00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello everyone, we are cuirassiers 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.130
 keep playing the hunger games on 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.550
 Orice map so the center and probably not 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 I will go the center I will not go and I will go to another 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.490
 the place right there is nothing about things so let's 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.320
 climbed up yet no weapon nothing 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 got 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:32.540
 except food like armor okay forward here 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.210
 chests not visible okay now 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.710
 anyone in any of them will be ears 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 good for me here is a hatchet already 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 Unfortunately, there is no sword 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.100
 let's probably asset tower can 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 climb remember in the tower something was 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 good man runs 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.090
 the clown from mcdonalds fled all 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.760
 there are no major weapons in my opinion so we 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.860
 probably attacked me yes this tower 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.840
 Of course, 14 people are awesome figs already 13 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.550
 tin can 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:17.780
 so little chest where is the sword 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:22.550
 I need a good sword with an ax 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.570
 I can not run long when no one is following me 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:31.100
 didn't run it cool well now the tower 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.810
 we explore all volumes chatting and can 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.920
 it will be safe to kill everyone because 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 tower a bunch of chests and go into it just 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.820
 was obliged 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:51.230
 almost every floor here has 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:54.200
 little chest even now happens and not one there 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.400
 so far everyone is dying I walk quietly 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:02.120
 here no one bothers me hitting the chests 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.620
 here's another damn where good things can 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.080
 be of course here and chests a lot but 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.080
 some things are not very good get 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.550
 I hope the next floor will make me happy 9 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.470
 man go nuts 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.330
 at least of course when it all began 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 there was in my opinion it was excellent in my opinion 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.930
 how many people there and I do not remember 21 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.890
 my 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.409
 but still it is necessary to reset probably 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.930
 all this stuff here 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.590
 let everyone else go fighting for nothing i'm pants 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.859
 threw me out no pants 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.260
 spare hahah spare machine okay i 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:52.120
 I think better find pants down 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:58.930
 then here is more than abandoned okay 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:01.939
 Attempt number 2 pants and at least already took 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.650
 eight people left two ingots 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.060
 thank you guys who carried the sharpener took 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.859
 unless of course they gave an ingot 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.189
 or maybe I am in a day and other place 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:12.829
 but thanks anyway where are u 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:17.709
 us workbench so somewhere below below 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.709
 there is in my even almost at the bottom 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.640
 here all these chests looked already 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.340
 here from me too , it looked like 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.680
 once again the floor to which I came running 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:35.129
 the very first one 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.000
 workbenches won't just about everything I'm garbage 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.879
 I will not take more 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.470
 and so missing here like a workbench 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:47.549
 should be giving you two pieces four 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:53.310
 things even have my arrows one with 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:58.709
 wand so it would certainly be better to find 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.870
 one more diamond but for now 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.380
 even twenty five arrows is cool shorter 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.950
 all seven people left 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:12.420
 I hope cheater will not be here that 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.500
 cheat kill though possible but very 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:21.720
 very difficult especially when they are not 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.169
 then the whole sense of the lighter burns 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.169
 is lost 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.860
 so here we were still up here 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:36.250
 the chest is exactly here it is flour pancake what 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.050
 bad things surprised at the top also not 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.360
 visible chests most likely all seven 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.370
 man well six people most likely 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.780
 there is 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.370
 you can jump down but probably even 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.230
 I won't do this either here 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.240
 boom principle 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.220
 how many 30 arrows I have is not bad 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.140
 six people 5 people excellent excellent 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.650
 okay I'll climb up now and go 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.820
 closer to like maybe what I think 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:10.870
 here though I already dressed up pretty well but 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.870
 people here I can hardly find the same thing 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.410
 the main thing is to find people as without people 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.419
 be it 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.449
 who kill where we pass that on 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.259
 my higher here 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.259
 yes he is 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.020
 well, so dressed up interesting 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.640
 why nobody rarely comes here 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.260
 already when here who is not my tibet 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.750
 I can’t craft an ingot anymore 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.770
 yourself a lighter 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:46.070
 I'd have killed someone else 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.490
 Ofiget fast game turns out with us 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.530
 very quickly so where to go 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.440
 lightning sound was in my hand and with the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.440
 downstairs dude someone says cheater 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.980
 interest who cheater hope by 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.510
 clown hopefully no clown cheater is unlikely 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.640
 clown cheater clown they happen 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:11.340
 cheaters clowns are good people 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.250
 golden apple and lighter here 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.360
 golden apple 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.940
 I think nothing more interesting on it 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.730
 there was no two left below 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:25.170
 man one of them shouted to cheaters he 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.950
 one can try to go down 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.820
 kill him 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.200
 than there like these 2 how are you dressed well 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.210
 diamond sword pancake dude what the hell are you 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.500
 it throws off okay probably he wants 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:44.690
 honestly this match so i basically not 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.320
 against the start of the match can be honest 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.820
 fight 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:54.470
 oh some other stuff i have already 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.840
 pants not bib is not enough ok 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.710
 let's wait for that match and honestly fight with 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:05.870
 thanks to him of course for things but it 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:07.540
 it wasn’t necessarily so golden 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.210
 there are apples 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.960
 so this guy is worse dressed well in general i 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.340
 I do not know who he shoots me or me 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.640
 I have a golden apple until I am 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:23.720
 just run 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:27.100
 Yes, they both shot at me here. 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.300
 Who will win in this battle 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.380
 OK, I will not interfere later on this 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.740
 match and we will fight 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:39.170
 but this match is already this ball goes all hum 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:42.689
 one on one and they have a fig 

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.999
 what is it 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:51.119
 maybe he is a cheater, I don’t know 

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:53.669
 report he did so apparently damn 

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:56.669
 not that he wanted so much that he won 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:59.369
