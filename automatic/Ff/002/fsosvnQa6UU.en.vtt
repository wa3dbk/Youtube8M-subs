here<00:00:41.670> there's<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> level<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
here there's gonna be the level of this

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.880 
here there's gonna be the level of this
all<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> way<00:00:48.030> around<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:49.110> there's<00:00:49.739> some

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
all the way around and then there's some

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:05.870 
all the way around and then there's some
plastic<00:01:02.989> we're<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
plastic we're going to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
plastic we're going to
plug<00:01:06.860> there's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.920> little<00:01:08.610> hole<00:01:08.789> right<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
plug there's a little hole right here

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
plug there's a little hole right here
that<00:01:09.329> the<00:01:09.450> cord<00:01:09.689> comes<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.280> goes

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that the cord comes out of this it goes

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.340 
that the cord comes out of this it goes
through<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> plug<00:01:11.939> back<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:13.970> another<00:01:14.970> pipe

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
through the plug back there another pipe

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:47.660 
through the plug back there another pipe
go<00:01:16.350> around<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.130> protected<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:47.490> it's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
go around so it's protected but it's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.740 
go around so it's protected but it's
pretty<00:01:47.819> strong<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:53.240> that's<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.539> was

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
pretty strong and that's what this was

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.990 
pretty strong and that's what this was
for<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.080> compact<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.679> bottom<00:01:56.069> of<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.610> in

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
for we compact to the bottom of this in

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.279 
for we compact to the bottom of this in
order<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.799> get<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> nice<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.020> compacted<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
order to get it nice and compacted and

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.529 
order to get it nice and compacted and
we're<00:02:02.099> gonna<00:02:02.189> put<00:02:02.399> soil<00:02:02.640> around<00:02:02.909> here<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.329> help

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
we're gonna put soil around here to help

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.609 
we're gonna put soil around here to help
you<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.349> doesn't<00:02:04.619> move<00:02:04.739> around<00:02:04.890> now

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
you know so it doesn't move around now

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.400 
you know so it doesn't move around now
be<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:08.250> top<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.910> we're<00:02:09.149> gonna<00:02:09.209> put<00:02:09.410> rocks

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
be on top of this we're gonna put rocks

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
be on top of this we're gonna put rocks
and<00:02:11.390> gravel<00:02:12.590> decorative<00:02:13.590> rock<00:02:13.799> small<00:02:14.579> stuff

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and gravel decorative rock small stuff

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.120 
and gravel decorative rock small stuff
and<00:02:15.150> bigger<00:02:15.359> stuff<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.230> make<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.590> feel<00:02:16.829> a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
and bigger stuff to make it feel a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.620 
and bigger stuff to make it feel a
little<00:02:17.340> bit<00:02:17.489> more<00:02:17.549> organic<00:02:18.000> now<00:02:18.959> Renee<00:02:20.630> is

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
little bit more organic now Renee is

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.650 
little bit more organic now Renee is
really<00:02:22.200> strong<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> basic

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
really strong and this is the basic

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.210 
really strong and this is the basic
field<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.109> now<00:02:31.350> still<00:02:32.069> have

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
field here just like that now still have

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280 
field here just like that now still have
to<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.329> pipe<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:33.989> then<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.260> put

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to do the the pipe in here then we put

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.830 
to do the the pipe in here then we put
putty<00:02:34.680> around<00:02:34.889> the<00:02:35.220> base<00:02:35.850> inside<00:02:36.329> we<00:02:36.540> put<00:02:36.720> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
putty around the base inside we put the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.990 
putty around the base inside we put the
putty<00:02:37.049> around<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.829> there<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.819> water

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
putty around it so that there the water

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.789 
putty around it so that there the water
doesn't<00:02:39.239> go<00:02:39.420> back<00:02:39.630> down<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.380> then<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.590> water

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
doesn't go back down and then the water

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.650 
doesn't go back down and then the water
comes<00:02:41.069> up<00:02:41.250> here<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:41.850> goes<00:02:42.060> straight<00:02:42.209> down

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
comes up here and goes straight down

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.900 
comes up here and goes straight down
no<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.769> just<00:02:44.549> hope<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> basin<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.180> wide<00:02:46.019> enough

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
no I just hope the basin is wide enough

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.059 
no I just hope the basin is wide enough
we<00:02:47.910> might<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.600> bigger<00:02:48.840> one

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
we might have to get a bigger one

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.289 
we might have to get a bigger one
depends<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.160> how<00:02:50.340> how<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.090> flow<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:52.019> this<00:02:52.170> goes

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
depends on how how the flow on this goes

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.870 
depends on how how the flow on this goes
because<00:02:54.299> if<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> starts<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.019> spill<00:02:55.350> over<00:02:55.880> then

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
because if it starts to spill over then

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.460 
because if it starts to spill over then
we're<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.120> trouble<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.810> hopefully<00:02:58.109> it<00:02:58.230> wraps

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
we're in trouble but hopefully it wraps

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.759 
we're in trouble but hopefully it wraps
around<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.100> goes<00:02:59.250> straight<00:02:59.400> down<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
around and goes straight down this is a

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.319 
around and goes straight down this is a
little<00:03:02.040> bit<00:03:02.130> bigger<00:03:02.310> than<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.609> was<00:03:02.639> expecting

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
little bit bigger than I was expecting

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.699 
little bit bigger than I was expecting
anyway<00:03:04.139> well<00:03:04.500> let<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.190> know<00:03:05.250> how<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.489> goes<00:03:06.709> all

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
anyway well let you know how it goes all

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.829 
anyway well let you know how it goes all
right
