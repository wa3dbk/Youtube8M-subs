00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
or be able to we but in this case like I

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.900 
or be able to we but in this case like I
said<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:39.959> do<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.260> edge<00:02:40.520> normally<00:02:41.520> you

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
said we do the edge normally you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.490 
said we do the edge normally you
wouldn't<00:02:42.120> want<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.720> edge<00:02:42.900> maybe<00:02:43.260> just

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
wouldn't want to do the edge maybe just

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.290 
wouldn't want to do the edge maybe just
a<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:43.830> bit<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.730> you're<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.209> be

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
a little bit if you're going to be

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.150 
a little bit if you're going to be
grouting<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.959> because<00:02:46.260> when<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.620> grout<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
grouting it because when you grout it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.130 
grouting it because when you grout it
you<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.880> grout<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.600> able<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.900> adhere

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
you want the grout to be able to adhere

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.460 
you want the grout to be able to adhere
to<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.709> material<00:02:50.700> better<00:02:51.080> okay<00:02:52.080> I'll<00:02:52.290> be

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to the material better okay I'll be

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.260 
to the material better okay I'll be
putting<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.950> outside<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.790> Sun<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> dry

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
putting this outside and the Sun to dry

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.449 
putting this outside and the Sun to dry
so<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.750> does<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.080> little<00:02:55.230> faster<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.340> then

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
so it does it a little faster and then

extra-special<00:05:33.680> sure<00:05:34.280> what<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:34.670> could<00:05:34.850> do<00:05:35.000> is

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
extra-special sure what you could do is

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.810 
extra-special sure what you could do is
maybe<00:05:36.080> lightly<00:05:36.650> sand<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.250> little<00:05:37.490> bit<00:05:37.640> just

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
maybe lightly sand it a little bit just

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.850 
maybe lightly sand it a little bit just
image<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.240> new<00:05:38.960> paint<00:05:39.260> has<00:05:39.440> something<00:05:39.830> to

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
image the new paint has something to

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.630 
image the new paint has something to
adhere<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.450> but<00:05:41.450> basically<00:05:41.870> you're<00:05:42.200> putting<00:05:42.350> a

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
adhere to but basically you're putting a

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.480 
adhere to but basically you're putting a
another<00:05:43.640> coat<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:43.910> paint<00:05:44.060> over<00:05:44.750> a<00:05:45.370> coat<00:05:46.370> of

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.220 
another coat of paint over a coat of
paint<00:05:46.640> so<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.240> shouldn't<00:05:47.450> should<00:05:47.720> adhere<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:48.050> a

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
paint so it shouldn't should adhere to a

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.310 
paint so it shouldn't should adhere to a
font<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:50.000> that's<00:05:50.420> that<00:05:50.660> still<00:05:50.990> waiting<00:05:51.290> for

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
font and that's that still waiting for

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.770 
font and that's that still waiting for
the<00:05:51.650> other<00:05:51.800> large<00:05:52.670> tile<00:05:53.030> to<00:05:53.210> dry<00:05:53.450> at<00:05:53.630> which

point bookless sealer on it and then

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.390 
point bookless sealer on it and then
that'll<00:05:56.300> be<00:05:56.390> done<00:05:56.560> be<00:05:57.560> back<00:05:57.740> shortly

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
up just put it on make sure you cover

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.470 
up just put it on make sure you cover
the<00:06:18.470> whole<00:06:18.740> area<00:06:21.820> with<00:06:22.820> a<00:06:22.880> sponge

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
the whole area with a sponge

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.470 
the whole area with a sponge
nothing<00:06:24.170> fancy<00:06:24.380> doesn't<00:06:25.040> matter<00:06:25.220> that<00:06:25.550> much

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
nothing fancy doesn't matter that much

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.140 
nothing fancy doesn't matter that much
especially<00:06:26.960> with<00:06:27.470> a<00:06:29.560> design<00:06:30.560> like<00:06:30.860> this<00:06:31.000> if<00:06:32.000> it

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
especially with a design like this if it

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.850 
especially with a design like this if it
was<00:06:32.270> flat<00:06:32.450> then<00:06:32.840> obviously<00:06:33.290> you<00:06:33.410> would<00:06:33.530> want

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
was flat then obviously you would want

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.920 
was flat then obviously you would want
to<00:06:34.610> be<00:06:34.670> a<00:06:34.700> little<00:06:34.880> more<00:06:35.030> careful<00:06:35.270> not<00:06:35.600> to<00:06:35.750> show

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
to be a little more careful not to show

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.530 
to be a little more careful not to show
any<00:06:36.140> streaking<00:06:36.470> in<00:06:36.710> that<00:06:36.920> but<00:06:37.420> with<00:06:38.420> this

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
any streaking in that but with this

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.600 
any streaking in that but with this
particular<00:06:38.870> style<00:06:39.380> of<00:06:39.680> tile<00:06:39.980> you<00:06:40.430> don't

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
particular style of tile you don't

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.580 
particular style of tile you don't
really<00:06:40.790> have<00:06:40.910> to<00:06:41.000> worry<00:06:41.180> about<00:06:41.300> that<00:06:41.600> and<00:06:42.350> then

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
really have to worry about that and then

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.179 
really have to worry about that and then
you<00:06:42.680> finish<00:06:42.830> it<00:06:42.980> off<00:06:44.980> lightly<00:06:45.980> dab<00:06:46.370> it

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:48.189 
you finish it off lightly dab it

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:50.549 
you finish it off lightly dab it
again<00:06:48.909> Chris<00:06:49.149> of<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.479> deep<00:06:49.869> crevices<00:06:50.529> you

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:50.559 
again Chris of the deep crevices you

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:54.329 
again Chris of the deep crevices you
don't<00:06:50.830> want<00:06:51.069> it<00:06:51.159> to<00:06:51.309> pool<00:06:52.949> and<00:06:53.949> take<00:06:54.099> forever

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:54.339 
don't want it to pool and take forever

00:06:54.339 --> 00:07:02.059 
don't want it to pool and take forever
to<00:06:54.610> joy<00:06:59.189> and<00:07:00.189> that's<00:07:00.519> pretty<00:07:01.089> much<00:07:01.479> it

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069 
to joy and that's pretty much it

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:06.439 
to joy and that's pretty much it
mmm<00:07:03.069> put<00:07:03.219> it<00:07:03.339> back<00:07:03.459> out<00:07:03.610> in<00:07:03.759> the<00:07:03.789> Sun<00:07:04.059> to<00:07:04.889> dry<00:07:05.889> up

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
mmm put it back out in the Sun to dry up

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.629 
mmm put it back out in the Sun to dry up
if<00:07:07.449> you<00:07:07.599> do<00:07:07.809> in<00:07:08.409> case<00:07:08.619> of<00:07:08.649> you're<00:07:09.039> doing<00:07:09.550> a

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 
if you do in case of you're doing a

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.419 
if you do in case of you're doing a
smooth<00:07:09.999> tile<00:07:10.589> what<00:07:11.589> you<00:07:11.679> could<00:07:11.860> do<00:07:12.009> is<00:07:12.159> lightly

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:12.429 
smooth tile what you could do is lightly

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:14.399 
smooth tile what you could do is lightly
breathe<00:07:13.269> on<00:07:13.629> the<00:07:13.779> tile<00:07:13.989> and<00:07:14.139> they<00:07:14.229> would

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.409 
breathe on the tile and they would

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:17.689 
breathe on the tile and they would
carbon<00:07:15.249> dioxide<00:07:15.729> from<00:07:15.849> your<00:07:16.059> breath<00:07:16.269> will

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 
carbon dioxide from your breath will

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.949 
carbon dioxide from your breath will
burst<00:07:18.699> any<00:07:18.999> bubbles<00:07:19.539> that<00:07:19.779> might<00:07:20.289> occur

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:21.959 
burst any bubbles that might occur

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.529 
burst any bubbles that might occur
that's<00:07:22.959> pretty<00:07:23.769> much<00:07:23.949> it<00:07:24.189> when<00:07:25.089> it<00:07:25.179> gets<00:07:25.360> done

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:25.539 
that's pretty much it when it gets done

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.480 
that's pretty much it when it gets done
I'll<00:07:25.779> take<00:07:25.809> one<00:07:26.139> more<00:07:26.319> shot<00:07:26.649> of<00:07:26.800> it<00:07:26.919> so<00:07:27.159> you<00:07:27.429> can

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
I'll take one more shot of it so you can

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.709 
I'll take one more shot of it so you can
see<00:07:27.819> what<00:07:27.969> it<00:07:28.059> looks<00:07:28.209> like<00:07:28.360> when<00:07:28.569> it's

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:28.719 
see what it looks like when it's

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.499 
see what it looks like when it's
complete<00:07:29.110> and<00:07:29.499> the<00:07:30.279> next<00:07:30.550> time<00:07:30.759> you<00:07:30.969> see<00:07:31.179> it<00:07:31.209> it

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:31.509 
complete and the next time you see it it

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:33.509 
complete and the next time you see it it
probably<00:07:31.959> be<00:07:32.169> on<00:07:32.349> the<00:07:32.379> wall<00:07:32.619> of<00:07:32.769> our<00:07:32.860> castle<00:07:33.399> up

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:33.519 
probably be on the wall of our castle up

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:36.809 
probably be on the wall of our castle up
in<00:07:33.699> the<00:07:33.959> Murphy<00:07:34.959> North<00:07:35.139> Carolina<00:07:35.669> because<00:07:36.669> I'm
