the program from which we control all

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.470 
the program from which we control all
this<00:00:31.800> stuff<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.480> straight

this stuff here and have to be straight

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
this stuff here and have to be straight
down<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.320> about<00:00:37.950> 16<00:00:38.520> blocks<00:00:38.730> because<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
down this about 16 blocks because of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
down this about 16 blocks because of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
blocks away from from each other so we

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.709 
blocks away from from each other so we
go<00:00:51.329> down<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.230> first<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> small

so we can can put stuff in it on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
so we can can put stuff in it on the
right<00:01:14.100> side<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.450> chests<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.290> can

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.839 

this<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.920> set<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.760> um<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.129> I<00:02:17.129> think<00:02:17.459> I'll<00:02:17.580> show

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
this is set up um and I think I'll show

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:26.449 
this is set up um and I think I'll show
you<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.500> program's<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:24.709> I've<00:02:25.709> been<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
you the program's now I've been just the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.180 
you the program's now I've been just the
computer<00:02:26.910> here<00:02:27.150> thought<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:29.099> have

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
computer here thought that I don't have

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.440 
computer here thought that I don't have
to<00:02:29.310> restart<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.970> server<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.599> there<00:02:31.370> um<00:02:32.370> yes<00:02:35.450> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
to restart the server up there um yes so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.030 
to restart the server up there um yes so
we<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.230> some<00:02:38.040> programs<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.590> put<00:02:40.590> for

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
we have some programs here I put for

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.650 
we have some programs here I put for
every<00:02:41.930> put<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> program<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.470> every<00:02:43.799> output<00:02:43.980> so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
every put a program for every output so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.370 
every put a program for every output so
I<00:02:45.660> named<00:02:46.230> them<00:02:46.500> back<00:02:46.860> one<00:02:47.250> till<00:02:47.880> two<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:49.019> ten

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
I named them back one till two back ten

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.620 
I named them back one till two back ten
and<00:02:49.650> top<00:02:50.160> 12<00:02:50.700> back<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.630> top<00:02:51.870> 10<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:54.360> can

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and top 12 back to top 10 so you can

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.259 
and top 12 back to top 10 so you can
it's<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:57.030> depends<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.870> output<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.590> you

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
it's it depends on the output if you

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.069 
it's it depends on the output if you
want<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.360> put<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.750> signal<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> top

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
want to put a signal to to the top

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.920 
want to put a signal to to the top
output<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.610> will<00:03:05.730> top<00:03:06.030> bundled<00:03:06.480> cable<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
output as it will top bundled cable and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.160 
output as it will top bundled cable and
