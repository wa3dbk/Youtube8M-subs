spacer thread that on just make sure

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
spacer thread that on just make sure
that<00:02:25.650> you've<00:02:25.769> pulled<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:26.310> nice<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.760> tight

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that you've pulled it nice and tight

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.619 
that you've pulled it nice and tight
down<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.299> water<00:02:28.280> now<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.580> these<00:02:29.790> source<00:02:30.450> key

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629

down the water now with these source key
crystal<00:02:31.019> sliders<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.670> two<00:02:33.150> holes<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
crystal sliders they have two holes so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
crystal sliders they have two holes so
there's<00:02:34.680> one<00:02:35.159> set<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.519> holes<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:36.120> through

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
there's one set of holes going through

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.270 
there's one set of holes going through
one<00:02:36.599> side<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.230> once<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> holes<00:02:38.010> going

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
one side and once at a holes going

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.400 
one side and once at a holes going
through<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.580> other<00:02:38.700> side<00:02:38.840> for<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.080> design

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
through the other side for this design

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.960 
through the other side for this design
what<00:02:40.739> we're<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.280> doing<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.730> we're

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
what we're going to be doing is we're

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.910 
what we're going to be doing is we're
going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.510> going<00:02:42.840> through<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.319> first<00:02:43.590> hole

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
going to be going through the first hole

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.039 
going to be going through the first hole
in<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.459> first<00:02:44.730> side<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.360> then<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.540> second

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
in the first side and then the second

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.920 
in the first side and then the second
second<00:02:46.590> hole<00:02:46.829> in<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.400> second<00:02:47.760> side<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.750> it's

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
second hole in the second side so it's

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.259 
second hole in the second side so it's
sort<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.230> diagonally<00:02:50.040> crossing<00:02:50.579> through<00:02:50.909> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
sort of diagonally crossing through the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.390 
sort of diagonally crossing through the
back<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.290> I'll<00:02:52.379> just<00:02:52.440> put<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.769> through<00:02:53.160> so

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
back so I'll just put that through so

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.479 
back so I'll just put that through so
see<00:02:53.640> how<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.860> shat<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.310> back

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
see how it's just going shat the back

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.099 
see how it's just going shat the back
there<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.540> i'll<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.930> put

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
there so on to that i'll just put

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.390 
there so on to that i'll just put
another<00:03:01.319> daisy<00:03:01.950> spacer<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.879> silver<00:03:04.400> one

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
another daisy spacer in the silver one

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.729 
another daisy spacer in the silver one
of<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.670> eight<00:03:05.849> millimeter<00:03:06.450> paranoid<00:03:07.019> donuts

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
of the eight millimeter paranoid donuts

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.170 
of the eight millimeter paranoid donuts
a<00:03:08.750> daisy<00:03:09.750> spacer<00:03:10.379> again<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.940> we're

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
a daisy spacer again and then we're

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.780 
a daisy spacer again and then we're
basically<00:03:12.599> going<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.109> be<00:03:13.290> entering<00:03:14.010> back<00:03:14.370> into

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
basically going to be entering back into

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.050 
basically going to be entering back into
the<00:03:14.910> next<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.260> icy<00:03:16.560> crystal<00:03:16.739> slider<00:03:17.129> using<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the next so icy crystal slider using the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.880 
the next so icy crystal slider using the
same<00:03:18.329> technique<00:03:18.900> going<00:03:19.319> through<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.680> first

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
same technique going through the first

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.940 
same technique going through the first
bottom<00:03:20.370> hole<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.690> second<00:03:22.140> second

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
bottom hole and in the second second

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.420 
bottom hole and in the second second
hole<00:03:23.329> see<00:03:24.329> how<00:03:24.510> they're<00:03:24.720> coming<00:03:25.049> up<00:03:25.169> like<00:03:26.160> that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
hole see how they're coming up like that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.750 
hole see how they're coming up like that
and<00:03:27.000> then<00:03:27.750> another<00:03:28.319> Daisy<00:03:28.709> space<00:03:29.190> are<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.519> top

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
and then another Daisy space are on top

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.250 
and then another Daisy space are on top
of<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:32.359> another<00:03:33.359> eight<00:03:33.660> millimeter

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
of that another eight millimeter

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.659 
of that another eight millimeter
paranoid<00:03:35.130> donut<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:36.030> top<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.569> that<00:03:36.720> and

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
paranoid donut on top of that and

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.670 
paranoid donut on top of that and
another<00:03:38.669> Daisy<00:03:39.060> spacer<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.200> that's<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
another Daisy spacer so that's going to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.800 
another Daisy spacer so that's going to
be<00:03:40.739> our<00:03:40.859> sequence<00:03:41.549> that's<00:03:41.760> going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.120> hang<00:03:42.510> off

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
be our sequence that's going to hang off

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.009 
be our sequence that's going to hang off
the<00:03:43.109> earring<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.180> onto<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.329> we're<00:03:45.690> going<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the earring and onto this we're going to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.509 
the earring and onto this we're going to
be<00:03:46.880> threading<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.480> crimp<00:03:49.319> so<00:03:50.099> we'll<00:03:50.310> thread

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
be threading on a crimp so we'll thread

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.360 
be threading on a crimp so we'll thread
that<00:03:50.700> on<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.060> both<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.569> strands<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.370> we'll

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
that on to both of the strands and we'll

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.039 
that on to both of the strands and we'll
just<00:03:53.519> make<00:03:53.700> sure<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.180> they're<00:03:54.389> going<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
just make sure that they're going to

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.960 
just make sure that they're going to

pliers go to the back there crimp that

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.990 
pliers go to the back there crimp that
now<00:04:13.169> you<00:04:13.230> might<00:04:13.470> find<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:14.099> is<00:04:14.730> curled

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
now you might find this is curled

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.979 
now you might find this is curled
slightly<00:04:15.289> once<00:04:16.289> you've<00:04:16.500> got<00:04:16.680> your<00:04:16.709> team<00:04:17.099> your

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
slightly once you've got your team your

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.659 
slightly once you've got your team your
some<00:04:18.989> rusty<00:04:19.260> crystal<00:04:19.620> style<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:20.039> facing<00:04:20.549> the

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
some rusty crystal style is facing the

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.370 
some rusty crystal style is facing the
right<00:04:20.970> way<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.720> will<00:04:21.810> actually<00:04:21.989> look<00:04:22.229> quite

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
right way it will actually look quite

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.480 
right way it will actually look quite
nice<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.900> finish<00:04:25.080> off<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.220> that<00:04:26.400> we

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
nice and to finish off this so that we

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.129 
nice and to finish off this so that we
can<00:04:26.669> attach<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.120> onto<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.449> ear<00:04:27.660> while<00:04:27.870> we're

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
can attach it onto the ear while we're

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.839 
can attach it onto the ear while we're
basically<00:04:28.500> going<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.830> be<00:04:28.890> using<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.400> Charlotte

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
basically going to be using a Charlotte

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:30.540 
basically going to be using a Charlotte
end

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
end

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.240

so<00:04:30.850> we're<00:04:31.420> going<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.660> throw<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.960> out<00:04:32.250> target

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
so we're going to throw it out target

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.420 
so we're going to throw it out target
hell<00:04:33.430> through<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.970> bottom<00:04:34.330> loop<00:04:34.810> of<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.430> the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
hell through the bottom loop of that the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.580 
hell through the bottom loop of that the
title<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:36.970> going<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.180> be<00:04:37.300> crimped<00:04:37.570> inside<00:04:38.020> cut

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
title is going to be crimped inside cut

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.100 
title is going to be crimped inside cut
off<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.040> then<00:04:39.250> these<00:04:39.430> two<00:04:39.490> clowns<00:04:40.120> shape<00:04:40.720> ends

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
off and then these two clowns shape ends

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.200 
off and then these two clowns shape ends
are<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.800> actually<00:04:41.950> close<00:04:42.370> up<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:42.910> then

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
are going to actually close up and then

00:04:43.210 --> 00:05:12.190 
are going to actually close up and then
hide<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.840> end<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.230> tie<00:04:44.410> tail

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.020 

and<00:05:21.470> then<00:05:21.890> I'm<00:05:22.100> going<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.400> repeat<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.850> same

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
and then I'm going to repeat the same

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.360 
and then I'm going to repeat the same

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
same for the other side and then what

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.900 
same for the other side and then what
we're<00:05:27.710> going<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:27.920> be<00:05:28.040> just<00:05:28.190> be<00:05:28.370> doing<00:05:28.520> is<00:05:28.880> just

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
sharleyan so just onto the hook and then

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.880 
sharleyan so just onto the hook and then
turning<00:05:34.490> it<00:05:34.670> over<00:05:35.170> I'll<00:05:36.170> just<00:05:36.350> pull<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:36.860> up
