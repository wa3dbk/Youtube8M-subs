 Amaranth food of the gods deserves special 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.730
 attention on the healing power comparable unless 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.130
 what's with ginseng and golden whiskers by 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.520
 nutritional value exceeds all 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.930

 the strongest antioxidant which only

 exists in nature keeps youth 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.840
 he clearly shows it in reality 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.149
 because it looks the same 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.719
 superb throughout the whole period 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.030
 your life amaranth protein in its 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.420
 superior to all quality and value 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 vegetable and animal proteins protein 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 rich in both seeds and greens contains 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.030
 many vitamins and minerals 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.979
 especially calcium and phosphorus increases

 immunity 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.110
 actively removes toxins therefore especially 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 useful to city dwellers as well as busy 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.759
 in hazardous industries 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.710
 amaranth panicle tea 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.710
 therapeutic and prophylactic agent 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.120
 great but this one is even better 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.220
 handsome like 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.070
 scientists call this culture 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.680
 and our answer is drought plants of the 21st century 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.450
 Amaranth translated from Greek 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.020
 unfading flower this plant is capable 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.229
 firstly oh i'm tired resistant against 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.900
 drought 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.710
 its power root steam + use 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.690
 their times and use 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.030
 very often and due to fall these 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.250
 temperatures and it turns out normal 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.350
 good harvest doctor of agricultural science peter 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.420
 Konan Cove is engaged in amaranth a lot 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 years in the field of breeding and seed production 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.540
 Moscow region 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.550
 but speaks only now because of drought a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.130
 not fading flowers remembered someone else 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.020
 besides him his colleagues in Penza not 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.360
 with whom he spends joint 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.670
 research after all precisely this arid 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.440
 Summer has set a serious land for farmers 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.100
 problem of lack of feed for 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.000
 animal husbandry and this is a culture in general 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.680
 universal purpose 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.650
 This and food not forage and technical 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.180
 and medicinal not even decorative 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.459
 amaranth plant 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.320
 it's a source of vegetable protein it 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.170
 content in leaves reaches 20 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.090
 percent in seeds 23a usefulness 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.360
 protein is estimated at 97 percent 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.080
 for example, we have basically our own 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.420
 culture force your corn but she 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.120
 contains more carbohydrates milka there obviously 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.910
 not enough but this culture is the opposite 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.980
 it is more protein than you are carbon 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.140
 dirty there scientists believe the future 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.450
 agriculture because he possesses more 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.180
 and high productivity example 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.430
 optimum plant density is 75,000 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.200
 amaranth of per hectare so here's one 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.090
 the plant according to my measurements weighs 4 4 s 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.769
 half a kilo that's four 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.410
 kilograms multiplied by 75 thousand to receive 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.710
 how many 300 tons 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.840
 this is an incredible yield and this is me 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.640
 I say and this is not the limit however 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.250
 According to cultural scientists, this is clearly 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.390
 underestimated forgotten from the wrong 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.060
 reputation turned out in due time 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.660
 beautiful red synthetic dye 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.420
 coloring 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.540
 he was called amaranth but he turned out to be 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.950
 carcinogenic and the year we start 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.070
 no natural dye can be obtained 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.960
 take with and how can and he is a carcinogen 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.300
 no relationship amaranth kite officer 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.700
 1 opinion Peter Konankov himself over the years 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.710
 brought out several varieties of amaranth in this 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.590
 field grow ornamental flowers named 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.530
 mace and faith is a plot with valentine 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.570
 me to the way name and wife conan whom she 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.530
 working with him at one institute in 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.690
 lunch break 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.850
 from leaves Valentine and Valentine Karlovna 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.740
 invariably makes her husband herbal tea 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.740
 speaks for new discoveries
