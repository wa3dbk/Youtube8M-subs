00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.569 
but there's many reasons of why black
ops<00:04:17.230> one<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.560> my<00:04:17.680> favorite<00:04:18.040> call<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.280> duty<00:04:18.459> and

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
ops one is my favorite call of duty and

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.860 
ops one is my favorite call of duty and
first<00:04:18.850> off<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.150> really<00:04:19.390> don't<00:04:19.510> have<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.690> worry

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
first off I really don't have to worry

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.900 
first off I really don't have to worry
about<00:04:19.959> second<00:04:20.440> chance<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.890> much<00:04:21.130> because<00:04:21.310> if

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
about second chance that much because if

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.640 
about second chance that much because if
you<00:04:22.090> go<00:04:22.120> back<00:04:22.390> on<00:04:22.570> my<00:04:22.660> combat<00:04:23.050> record<00:04:23.230> to<00:04:23.470> win<00:04:23.620> I

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
you go back on my combat record to win I

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.650 
you go back on my combat record to win I
was<00:04:23.860> actually<00:04:24.040> decent<00:04:24.580> at<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.000> game<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.419> have

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
was actually decent at the game I have

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.530 
was actually decent at the game I have
like<00:04:25.870> over<00:04:26.020> 10,000<00:04:26.830> field<00:04:27.040> espace<00:04:27.490> 12<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.480> a

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
like over 10,000 field espace 12 and a

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.790 
like over 10,000 field espace 12 and a
lot<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.720> kills<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.110> shock<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.350> if<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.680> guys

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
lot of kills the shock and if you guys

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.159 
lot of kills the shock and if you guys
don't<00:04:30.100> know<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.760> second<00:04:31.090> chance<00:04:31.330> perk<00:04:31.900> it

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
don't know the second chance perk it

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.480 
don't know the second chance perk it
like<00:04:32.470> when<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:32.620> had<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.770> shotgun<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.280> didn't

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
like when you had a shotgun it didn't

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.460 
like when you had a shotgun it didn't
