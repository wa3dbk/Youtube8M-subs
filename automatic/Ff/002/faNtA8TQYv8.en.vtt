00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
subjects and the thing with a level is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.300 
subjects and the thing with a level is
that<00:01:54.960> students<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.409> choose<00:01:55.560> exactly<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that students can choose exactly the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.890 
that students can choose exactly the
combination<00:01:56.790> subjects<00:01:57.150> they<00:01:57.360> wish<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> study

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
combination subjects they wish to study

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.420 
combination subjects they wish to study
and<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.710> example<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.100> somebody's<00:01:59.369> really

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and so for example if somebody's really

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
and so for example if somebody's really
strong<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.869> English<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.470> Modern<00:02:01.680> Languages

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
strong in English and Modern Languages

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
strong in English and Modern Languages
they<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.729> those<00:02:02.880> subjects<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.110> they

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
they can do those subjects and if they

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.389 
they can do those subjects and if they
don't<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.619> doing<00:02:04.740> maths<00:02:05.009> they<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.280> have

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
don't like doing maths they don't have

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.679 
don't like doing maths they don't have
to<00:02:05.490> continue<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:05.939> maths<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to continue with maths and that's the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.690 
to continue with maths and that's the
benefit<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.170> doing<00:02:07.380> a-levels<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.519> course

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
benefit of doing a-levels but of course

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.160 
benefit of doing a-levels but of course
there's<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.909> great<00:02:09.090> benefit<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> IB<00:02:09.989> as

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
there's a great benefit of the IB as

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.809 
there's a great benefit of the IB as
well<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.619> there's<00:02:10.769> a<00:02:10.829> whole<00:02:10.979> package<00:02:11.370> it

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
well because there's a whole package it

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.759 
well because there's a whole package it
gives<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> range<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.720> subjects<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:13.709> a

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
gives you a range of subjects and it's a

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.440 
gives you a range of subjects and it's a
terrifically<00:02:14.159> good<00:02:14.249> preparation<00:02:14.669> not<00:02:15.120> only

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
terrifically good preparation not only

the<00:02:22.010> study<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.370> for<00:02:22.550> them<00:02:22.760> not<00:02:23.000> something<00:02:23.510> that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
the study is for them not something that

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.480 
the study is for them not something that
they're<00:02:23.690> being<00:02:23.840> made<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.070> put<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.400> lot

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
they're being made to do so we put a lot

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.980 
they're being made to do so we put a lot
of<00:02:25.580> work<00:02:25.700> into<00:02:25.970> what<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.150> call<00:02:26.330> independent
