freakin pineapple lane um yeah so okay
so<00:01:04.970> here's<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.110> like<00:01:07.110> weird<00:01:07.680> type<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:09.830> hair<00:01:10.970> tie

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
so here's my like weird type of hair tie

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.719 
so here's my like weird type of hair tie
and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.840> reason<00:01:13.200> why<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.369> many

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and the reason why it has like so many

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.249 
and the reason why it has like so many
different<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.240> loops<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.780> stuff<00:01:15.869> it's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
different like loops and stuff it's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
different like loops and stuff it's
because<00:01:16.590> maybe<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.100> loop<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
because maybe one loop is for like a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
because maybe one loop is for like a
pony<00:01:18.960> tail<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> side<00:01:19.470> another<00:01:20.189> loop<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
pony tail to the side another loop is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.210 
pony tail to the side another loop is
for<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.110> tightening<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> slip

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
for like the tightening it's like a slip

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
for like the tightening it's like a slip
knot<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.430> tighten<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.200> another<00:01:25.380> loop

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
knot to tighten it up and another loop

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
knot to tighten it up and another loop
I'm<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.360> middle<00:01:27.689> loop<00:01:27.810> for

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I'm going to use this middle loop for

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
round but I guess this is the time of

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.150 
round but I guess this is the time of
year<00:03:30.630> where<00:03:30.960> people<00:03:31.260> really<00:03:31.620> want<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.040> do

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
year where people really want to do

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.760 
year where people really want to do
special<00:03:32.580> things<00:03:32.610> for<00:03:32.910> people<00:03:33.710> but<00:03:34.710> I<00:03:34.740> just

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
special things for people but I just

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.420 
special things for people but I just
kind<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.160> believe<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.860> what<00:03:38.310> you

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
kind of believe that it's not what you

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.870 
kind of believe that it's not what you
give<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> person<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.540> basically<00:03:40.850> how<00:03:41.850> you

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
give a person it's basically how you

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.449 
give a person it's basically how you
treat<00:03:42.270> people<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.870> know<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:44.040> believe

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
treat people you know I just believe

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.540 
treat people you know I just believe
that<00:03:45.500> why<00:03:46.500> don't<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> was<00:03:46.860> some<00:03:47.040> give<00:03:47.190> up<00:03:47.310> really

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.010 
that why don't I was some give up really
serious<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.360> just<00:03:48.630> believe<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:50.720> everyone<00:03:51.720> in

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020
