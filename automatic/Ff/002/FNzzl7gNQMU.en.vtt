00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of the ocean of the Seas and so we have

of the ocean of the Seas and so we have

of this train from from the moon and the

other planet is mercury who just turned
retrograde<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> couple<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.820> days<00:01:26.939> ago<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
retrograde a couple of days ago and it's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.179 
retrograde a couple of days ago and it's
really<00:01:28.049> interesting<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.500> both<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> these

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
really interesting because both of these

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.670 
really interesting because both of these
planets<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.759> either<00:01:29.970> stopped<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.409> ready

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
planets are either stopped or just ready

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
planets are either stopped or just ready
to<00:01:31.829> go<00:01:31.979> backwards<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.729> planets<00:01:33.659> are

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
to go backwards and planets are

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
to go backwards and planets are
considered<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.860> powerful<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.670> these

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
considered to be more powerful at these

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.170 
considered to be more powerful at these
points<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.329> may<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.470> overt<00:01:38.310> effects

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
points or I may not see overt effects

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630 
points or I may not see overt effects
but<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> planet<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.530> standing<00:01:41.340> still<00:01:41.610> or

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
but when a planet is standing still or

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.139 
but when a planet is standing still or
close<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.619> weighs<00:01:44.159> more<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
close to it it it weighs more and what I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.690 
close to it it it weighs more and what I
find<00:01:45.390> particularly<00:01:45.869> useful<00:01:46.320> today<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.399> that

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
find particularly useful today is that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.660 
find particularly useful today is that
the<00:01:47.820> Scorpio<00:01:48.390> moon<00:01:48.720> often<00:01:49.590> brings<00:01:50.100> up

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the Scorpio moon often brings up

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
the Scorpio moon often brings up
difficult<00:01:51.360> issues<00:01:52.049> whether<00:01:52.350> from<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> past

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
difficult issues whether from the past

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.270 
difficult issues whether from the past
or<00:01:53.520> desires<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.509> fears<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.290> future<00:01:55.590> but

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
or desires or fears about the future but

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
or desires or fears about the future but
I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.430> Rick<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.299> dissolving<00:01:58.020> power

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
I think Rick that the dissolving power

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.219 
I think Rick that the dissolving power
of<00:01:58.500> Neptune<00:01:58.799> today<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.850> also<00:02:00.600> potentially

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
of Neptune today is also potentially

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.010 
of Neptune today is also potentially
about<00:02:01.439> dissolving<00:02:01.860> our<00:02:02.250> fears<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.090> forgiving

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
about dissolving our fears or forgiving

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.760 
about dissolving our fears or forgiving
others<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:05.189> their<00:02:05.490> trespasses<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.439> think

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
others for their trespasses so I think

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.180 
others for their trespasses so I think
oh<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.789> watery<00:02:09.300> energy<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
oh and all this watery energy is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.430 
oh and all this watery energy is
emotional<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.430> deep<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.319> dispersed

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
emotional it's deep it's dispersed

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.620 
emotional it's deep it's dispersed
and<00:02:13.740> yet<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.220> pulls<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> Scorpio

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and yet it pulls in because the Scorpio

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.140 
and yet it pulls in because the Scorpio
energy<00:02:16.080> goes<00:02:16.350> deep<00:02:16.800> its<00:02:17.040> there's<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:17.880> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
energy goes deep its there's like and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.830 
energy goes deep its there's like and
