power storage on the left you see it's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.850 
power storage on the left you see it's
going<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.290> connected<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> the

it without a main power source you have

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.549 
it without a main power source you have

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
using nothing because that's not doing
anything<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> maximum<00:00:55.140> power

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
anything you have the maximum power

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709 
anything you have the maximum power
which<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> 40<00:00:56.010> RF<00:00:56.370> per<00:00:56.520> tick<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.570> energy

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
which is 40 RF per tick and the energy

which is 40 RF per tick and the energy
storage<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.410> obviously<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> same

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160

it to interact with levers and buttons

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.510 
it to interact with levers and buttons
and<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> input<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.400> output

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and you have the input and output

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
and you have the input and output

here is glue is the input red is the
output<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.310> yellow<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> secondary<00:01:15.450> output

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

whenever<00:01:16.560> you're<00:01:16.710> processing<00:01:17.220> oars<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
whenever you're processing oars there is

secondary dust from iron ore i believe

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.890 
secondary dust from iron ore i believe
it's<00:01:22.200> Faris<00:01:22.710> dust<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> adjust<00:01:24.509> these

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's Faris dust and you can adjust these

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719 
it's Faris dust and you can adjust these
simply<00:01:25.320> by<00:01:25.439> left-clicking<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.189> decide<00:01:26.520> which

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
simply by left-clicking to decide which

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
simply by left-clicking to decide which
side<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:27.689> things<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> come<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.619> out

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
side you want things to come in and out

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.030

of<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.180> case<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.140> also<00:01:31.290> set<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
of in this case you can also set it to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.270 
of in this case you can also set it to
Orange<00:01:32.610> let's<00:01:33.600> turn<00:01:33.780> off<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.130> set

Orange let's turn off then if it's set
to<00:01:35.310> Orange<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> means<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.180> both<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:37.229> main

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
to Orange it means that both the main

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.960 
to Orange it means that both the main
and<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.740> secondary<00:01:38.189> outputs<00:01:38.610> would<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and the secondary outputs would go to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.649 
and the secondary outputs would go to
the<00:01:39.150> same<00:01:39.390> side<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.640> our<00:01:41.850> secondary<00:01:42.360> yet

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the same side we have our secondary yet

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
the same side we have our secondary yet
but<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.049> probably<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.770> before<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> end

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
but we probably will do before the end

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160 
but we probably will do before the end
of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> video<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> has

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of the video as you can see here it has

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.350 
of the video as you can see here it has
dropped<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.680> secondary<00:01:47.159> dust<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
dropped a secondary dust here which is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600 
dropped a secondary dust here which is
indeed<00:01:48.689> ferrous<00:01:49.049> metal<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:50.189> press<00:01:50.369> are

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
indeed ferrous metal I can press are

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.249 
indeed ferrous metal I can press are
over<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> iron<00:01:51.240> you'll<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> ten

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
over the iron you'll see that is a ten

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
over the iron you'll see that is a ten
percent<00:01:52.380> chance<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.130> iron<00:01:53.460> ore<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:54.240> drop

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
percent chance that iron ore will drop

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.880 
percent chance that iron ore will drop
pulverized<00:01:54.930> ferrous<00:01:55.200> metals<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> also

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
pulverized ferrous metals it also

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.120 
pulverized ferrous metals it also
doubles<00:01:56.130> yours<00:01:56.579> hence<00:01:57.149> why<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:57.930> 3000<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
doubles yours hence why there's 3000 and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.440 
doubles yours hence why there's 3000 and
we're<00:01:59.280> still<00:01:59.460> pulverizing<00:02:00.149> even<00:02:00.329> though<00:02:00.390> we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
we're still pulverizing even though we

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.719 
we're still pulverizing even though we
only<00:02:00.570> puts<00:02:00.810> 32<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.640> about

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
only puts 32 in and that just about

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.160 
only puts 32 in and that just about
