movies<00:00:10.980> out<00:00:11.160> there<00:00:11.190> that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
movies out there that

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.680 
movies out there that
particular<00:00:12.930> visual<00:00:13.740> effects<00:00:13.980> films<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.690> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
particular visual effects films and and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.440 
particular visual effects films and and
even<00:00:15.900> hand-drawn<00:00:16.530> animated<00:00:16.860> films<00:00:17.280> but<00:00:18.270> there

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
even hand-drawn animated films but there

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.780 
even hand-drawn animated films but there
was<00:00:18.540> never<00:00:18.720> really<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.430> computer<00:00:20.430> animated

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
was never really a computer animated

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.790 
was never really a computer animated
film<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.810> big<00:00:21.930> advantage<00:00:22.380> there<00:00:22.619> was

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
film and the big advantage there was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
film and the big advantage there was
that<00:00:22.950> we<00:00:23.099> could<00:00:23.310> create<00:00:23.490> an<00:00:23.790> entire<00:00:24.300> world<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that we could create an entire world of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.700 
that we could create an entire world of
different<00:00:25.500> species<00:00:25.770> and<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:28.200> know<00:00:28.320> be

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
different species and and you know be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.089 
different species and and you know be
really<00:00:29.009> creative<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.700> it<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:29.880> go<00:00:30.529> go<00:00:31.529> wild

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
really creative with it and go go wild

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.350 
really creative with it and go go wild
with<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.369> because<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.669> didn't<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:32.970> to<00:00:33.180> match

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
with it because we didn't have to match

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
with it because we didn't have to match
a<00:00:33.540> life<00:00:33.750> action<00:00:33.960> plate<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.470> didn't<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a life action plate we didn't have to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
a life action plate we didn't have to
look<00:00:35.160> overly<00:00:35.700> realistic<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.570> could<00:00:36.720> have

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
look overly realistic so we could have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750 
look overly realistic so we could have
fun<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.230> these<00:00:37.320> dragons<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:38.340> wanted<00:00:38.610> at

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
fun with these dragons so we wanted at

fun with these dragons so we wanted at
the<00:00:38.820> same<00:00:39.030> time<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> dragons<00:00:39.810> to<00:00:39.960> feel<00:00:40.110> real

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the same time the dragons to feel real

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
the same time the dragons to feel real
and<00:00:41.100> believable<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.760> tangible<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.840> also

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and believable and tangible but we also

and believable and tangible but we also
wanted<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.380> have<00:00:43.470> for<00:00:44.250> them<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> sense

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
wanted to have for them to have a sense

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
wanted to have for them to have a sense
of<00:00:45.120> humor<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.990> we<00:00:46.170> needed<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> make<00:00:46.980> them

of humor like we needed to make them
entertaining<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:49.170> know

audience recognizes that that is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
audience recognizes that that is
entertaining<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.900> know<00:00:55.050> stand-up

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.780 

yeah<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.480> all<00:01:07.230> of<00:01:07.440> our<00:01:07.530> dragons<00:01:07.980> including<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
yeah so all of our dragons including the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.100 
yeah so all of our dragons including the
ones<00:01:08.970> from<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> first<00:01:09.450> movie<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.930> had<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
ones from the first movie we had a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.900 
ones from the first movie we had a
certain<00:01:10.680> approach<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.340> creating<00:01:11.670> these

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
certain approach to creating these

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.190 
certain approach to creating these
dragons<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.720> wanted<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.170> sure

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
dragons because we wanted to make sure

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100 
dragons because we wanted to make sure
that<00:01:14.160> they<00:01:14.730> felt<00:01:15.030> lifelike<00:01:15.480> they<00:01:15.720> felt<00:01:15.930> like

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that they felt lifelike they felt like

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.690 
that they felt lifelike they felt like
something<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> audience<00:01:17.550> could

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
something that the audience could

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
something that the audience could
recognize<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.020> did<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.410> essentially

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
recognize so what we did is essentially

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.790 
recognize so what we did is essentially
we<00:01:20.160> took<00:01:20.370> for<00:01:21.180> every<00:01:21.420> dragon<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.050> can<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> mixed

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
we took for every dragon we can a mixed

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.890 
we took for every dragon we can a mixed
and<00:01:23.010> matched<00:01:23.190> certain<00:01:24.090> types<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.510> animal

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and matched certain types of animal

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
and matched certain types of animal
behaviors<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:26.040> example<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> gronckle<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
behaviors for example the gronckle is a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
behaviors for example the gronckle is a
mixture<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.480> a<00:01:27.780> bull<00:01:27.990> dog<00:01:28.290> Harley<00:01:28.920> Davidson<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
mixture of a bull dog Harley Davidson a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.310 
mixture of a bull dog Harley Davidson a
helicopter<00:01:30.480> and<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.660> bumblebee

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
helicopter and a bumblebee

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
helicopter and a bumblebee
so<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.280> sounds<00:01:32.580> abstract<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.360> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so it sounds abstract but when you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.140 
so it sounds abstract but when you
actually<00:01:33.600> put<00:01:34.410> those<00:01:34.800> elements<00:01:35.370> together<00:01:35.940> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
actually put those elements together you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.930 
actually put those elements together you
get<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.330> flavor<00:01:36.690> of<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:37.080> character<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:38.760> that

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
get a flavor of a character and and that

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.180 
get a flavor of a character and and that
along<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> design<00:01:39.870> that<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.620> know<00:01:40.740> fits

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
along with the design that you know fits

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.219 
along with the design that you know fits
that<00:01:41.430> description<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:42.660> get<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:42.900> very

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that description you get a very

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.539 
that description you get a very
recognizable<00:01:44.120> piece<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.300> animation

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 

with<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> beer<00:01:48.450> Willoughby's<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.930> wanted<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
with the beer Willoughby's we wanted to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.719 
with the beer Willoughby's we wanted to
make<00:01:49.470> something<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:49.890> specific<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.520> wanted

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
make something very specific we wanted

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
make something very specific we wanted
to<00:01:50.790> make<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> big<00:01:51.240> statement<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.259> really

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to make a big statement that really

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
to make a big statement that really
differentiate<00:01:53.310> differentiates<00:01:54.270> him<00:01:54.479> from

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
differentiate differentiates him from

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
differentiate differentiates him from
what<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.500> had<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> first<00:01:56.100> movie<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
what we had in the first movie that the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.179 
what we had in the first movie that the
Red<00:01:57.030> Death<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:58.950> started<00:01:59.310> looking<00:01:59.340> at

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
Red Death and so we started looking at

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
Red Death and so we started looking at
particularly<00:02:02.189> big<00:02:02.729> animals<00:02:03.390> fighting<00:02:03.840> each

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
particularly big animals fighting each

and we actually went went through our

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.949 
and we actually went went through our
design<00:03:24.580> which<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.180> had<00:03:25.330> pretty<00:03:25.840> much

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959
