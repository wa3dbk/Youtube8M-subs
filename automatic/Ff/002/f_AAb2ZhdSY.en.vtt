00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:03.679
 I would like to talk about today 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.630
 proper packaging of seedlings 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.729
 as our company is engaged 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.139
 mailing seedlings by mail is very important 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.639
 know that 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.320
 we used to work with AMK and all this seedlings 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.580
 rub sent packed minutes could 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.610
 but no matter how few reviews about 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.939
 tom that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.289
 as customers arrived and torn packaging 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.409
 dried could for sapling 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.279
 of inadequate quality so we 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.090
 let's go 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.750
 further to correct even these 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.570
 minor mistakes 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.020
 working now with the latest material 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350
 which is called hydrogel here it is 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.510
 here is represented yang powders obtained 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.940
 it is a powder 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.230
 erected by water 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.510
 yes the consistency of such a gel is this idea 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.250
 allows not to cross by root when 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.250
 forwarding 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.990
 root system 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.990
 immersed 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.270
 extract back 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.430
 and it turns out that we have a root system 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.130
 here are all such crosses as 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.470
 inexpensive years and these crystals allows 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.360
 keep constant humidity on 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.430
 throughout the shootout or 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.350
 transportation up until receipt 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200
 it will be complicated for clients 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.690
 if not seedling stored in 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.610
 hydrogel fridge 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.560
 up to one and a half months 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.820
 principle 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 at zero temperature 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.530
 can fit himself 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.870
 feel 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.830
 many gardeners and makes a mistake than what 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.330
 acquires seedlings in open markets 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.790
 root system and when they say yes 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.150
 everything will grow today great you 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.700
 take us there cheap and fine and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130
 we 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.010
 sometimes look focused on cheap 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.590
 and grids 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.840
 go to the concessions purchased by the same with 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 the ceiling we come decided 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.880
 disappointments so you want to immediately 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.800
 warn nobody believe open 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.310
 root system 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 afraid should not at least should 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.680
 be some kind of packaging and was 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.599
 wet could and was not wet saw either a year 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.280
 hydrogel all feed must be wrapped 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.450
 for transportation for further and 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.090
 I can say nothing else for example 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.680
 what is the root system of the line when finding 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.529
 in the shadow of 20 minutes at the station 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:28.329
 is lost 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.150
 viability of interest on 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.590
 fifty
