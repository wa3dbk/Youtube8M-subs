00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.530
 good mates here once more 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.809
 bringing you a sony video tutorial 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.050
 xperia type which has problems of 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.560
 touch 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.590
 as you can notice in touch is a bit 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.920
 slow and now when it has 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.020
 also when moving and navigating 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.110
 applications are selected 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.940
 applications without any 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.370
 without any exact selection 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.670
 so then we decided that it is the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.219
 ankle 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.780
 this problem occurs when they are restored 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.640
 the factory telephones since I do not know 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.170
 calibrate properly 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.629
 so then 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.730
 well let's make the bases of a 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.130
 application 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.320
 while I can do a touch test 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.320
 screen how this is done 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.359
 dialing the following numbers 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.359
 asterisk 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.950
 ungrateful 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.950
 asterisk cat 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.229
 73 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 78 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.369
 4 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 2. 3 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.760
 this disco cat this disc 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.720
 and this we enter 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.370
 Oh 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.860
 accept the touch there is and we can notice 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.870
 that the touch actually ends when 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.870
 he wants is not forgotten as you can see 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.060
 and then if it's a little bit 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.250
 nervous, that's when he's going 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.100
 and that does not mean he's sitting 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.430
 Negotiation is not being right 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.430
 adequate 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.039
 after we're going to do the fandi 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.310
 mentioned we are going to download a 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.940
 application and good guys what are we going to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:22.260
 do next is download this file 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.880
 touch w hotels is a file ap carl 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.350
 as you can see it is an application to 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.110
 application that we're going to run inside the 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.780
 phone but to me by not running 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.840
 phone properly he made me more 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.550
 easy to download it turn off the computer 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.560
 then but what we are going to do is 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.560
 You can connect the equipment 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.010
 when computations true 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.310
 so that it works correctly 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.790
 and we have 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.849
 the application 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.190
 ready to just drag it to 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.250
 rise file 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.370
 that is happening 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.610
 supposes a new step space we are going to 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.560
 happen to enjoy the application on 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.560
 phone to connect the application 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.760
 once the application is closed 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.950
 let's do the next steps let's 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.870
 to go to the file explorer 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.790
 to find the application that we download 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.480
 to the phone is a bit of god home 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.480
 but good 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.340
 there we have the application you can not 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.910
 I got to see 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.910
 there we have it 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:53.409
 and we will not see if it is reached and not 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.760
 unfortunately the camera that I have the 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.090
 work quality good knowledge 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.350
 let's give it there 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.569
 let's give it the value of applications 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.400
 and install 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.400
 we wait for it to finish installing 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.480
 to keep doing 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.900
 the next steps 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.359
 open and we have the application open 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.180
 Now what we need is a space 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.480
 very flat very straight I in this case 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.110
 I will buy a box 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.630
 how can you see the problem is a box 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.300
 totally flat and you just have to press 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.969
 caliber 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.629
 begins to calibrate 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.960
 and it finishes calibrating we approach and it says 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:41.030
 concrete calibration 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.090
 and at that moment the phone is 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.720
 working properly are a little 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.259
 in answer but navigate without any 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.259
 problem 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.750
 and we are going to do a little bit of people that 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.260
 we had 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.430
 what are we going to do the test 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.920
 by entering the same code as 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.090
 I had previously told you 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:13.170
 much easier asterisk cat asterisk 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.170
 cat 7 378 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.020
 4 2 3 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.790
 to this disc 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:30.580
 sorry to be disco cat asterisk 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.580
 and ready and we enter the system 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.760
 and as you can see it 's very very very fluid 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.540
 the arms works correctly 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.540
 touch screen 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.900
 and ready 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.080
 that asks us things that is obviously a 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.870
 100% improvement 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.439
 well let's hope you liked this and 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.740
 do not forget is to give like to learn to 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:03.240
 Rootear a motorola that is 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.000
 I'll show it right now 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.490
 if you want me to teach you how to unlock 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.500
 an android this applies to all 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:15.980
 androids 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.980
 and then I say goodbye, chau chau
