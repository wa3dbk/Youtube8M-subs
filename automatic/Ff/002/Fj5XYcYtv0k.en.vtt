 I have to work for you shortly 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.940
 So, what does this lightning say? 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.790
 Glitsch works in the online 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.909
 meeting and in missions what now 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.309
 becomes so important people do it yourself 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.659
 this slippery with your friends 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 together and it is clear that yours 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.820
 friends do not sign up so join 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140
 mission like bank robberies or all 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.239
 other missions 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.449
 then, of course, get in touch with your friends 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.150
 not and then you will not be banished 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.690
 Do it all in one online 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.090
 session or mission online and kill 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.940
 other players and de facto as well as a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.729
 Dude of mine two days ago it has so 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.610
 Nicely tested with his second count 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.189
 and now it is already banned and not 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 only seven days but permanently from 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.490
 gc online so you can glitsch this 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.649
 do with your friends with you the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.969
 do not report and then you will not 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.079
 but banned only in missions as well 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.140
 bank robberies and then could the ten 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.479
 million dollars because of not dying 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.880
 So vote for the bank robberies 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.770
 mini money can be said that way 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.679
 So in that sense I will be you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.509
 now show the same as this god 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.450
 my luck in quotes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.899
 infinitely life klitsch works like that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.850
 now we come to the tutorial so people 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.939

 any mission no matter which one 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.430

 just as I am right now I am 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.370

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.280
 just so now comes one 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.490
 second message if you your pals to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.850

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.110
 once you press circle for no now 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.300
 Do you want to be in his online lobby in the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.460
 mission now presses the option and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.980
 frozen and then he pushes as long 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.920
 option or state until there is play 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.170
 for this story mode option so now 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.020
 do you like to repeat play no matter 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.090
 which missions just not the first and 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.590
 then your screen turns black 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.080
 that may take a little bit longer 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.690
 sometimes or not it is always 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.740
 different and then you are in 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.840
 an online logi so people are pushing now 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.210
 He always steers down to the environment 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.170
 story character but always with circle 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.740
 leave again 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.680
 you do that 56 times and then 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.500
 press the option or start and then 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.920
 she leaves on online game altogether 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.870
 below and just confirm with ex 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.080
 leave the game and your screen 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.940
 fries you see the minimap you can 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.130
 still moving so to speak you can see how 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.470
 the minimap turns I moved 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.930
 so to speak, and now he just pushes 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.709
 touchpad or select and do it yourself 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.310
 board so if you have suicide 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.740
 then you also suffered the god mode 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.410
 already finished we are now in one 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.709
 online lobby and i will give you a quick look 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.780
 show that I have god fashion and here 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.800
 I'm currently scrolling online 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.750
 list of players through which you also weapons 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.860
 can use because here you see me 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.979
 can not blast weapons 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.460
 But you can easily do that 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.520
 and endures start option and 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.430
 scroll either the friend list or 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.520
 the player list simply from the top to 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.009
 down a two times so only once briefly 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.860
 that's enough and now they go 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.949
 so things have gone wrong so i have been here before 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.680
 said that this is online 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.650
 and if you play him with the other player 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.129
 As a matter of fact and you will report 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.080
 to 210 percent banned and not 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.520
 only for seven days but forever 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.159
 from here online 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.759
 but it is here that they have this 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:12.879
 Glitsch with friends in a mission 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.389
 like bank robberies or other missions 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:18.069
 so that people stop then 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.930
 somehow before branches and all opponents 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.939
 kill and you have the mission in two 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.889
 minutes completed because not die 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.210
 and if you can do that with yours 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.800
 makes friends we have you 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.620
 Of course not report I just hope 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.469
 then you can not do anything 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.750
 happen and you all get endless 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.460
 a lot of rp and of course manni and 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.949
 if that's your bank robbery 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.490
 So do the ten million mission 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:45.069
 challenge not die and such 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.319
 killed and here you could see how 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.990
 fraps tries to kill me and it 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.580
 I just did not manage it I wanted you 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.180
 just show it is a buddy 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.520
 from me 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.919
 I can kill that when I get in touch 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.830
 not like that and now i'll show you or 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.180
 Better get a team deathmatch 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.189
 bank robbery bank robbery is unfortunately 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.469
 not gone because we do not have four people 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:10.960
 was so and in the in the mission could 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.659
 but dying again but you see 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.509
 once died and now you do 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:19.089
 just so option and again style 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:22.599
 Just leave leave like 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:25.150
 earlier and then squeezed again 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.830
 touchpad and do it yourself 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.050
 Of course not even let that cool 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.289
 I just showed you that way and when 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.419
 You did that again 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.060
 godmode in the mission and 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.259
 this dortmund never goes away from her 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.000
 from time to time just have to 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.190
 game running 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.800
 Bridges and suicide never works 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.630
 Back away people started from the game 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.790
 of course completely new then again 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.890
 all gone but you can in the 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.500
 missions in bank robberies 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.610
 from slipping off and the coal off a lot 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.190
 skim 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.040
 instead of always before this one mission from where 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.660
 your money will be taken away, so to speak 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.410
 it does not go away people's money 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.320
 stay because god engine and you can do that 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.330
 Collect a lot of rp through the mission like 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.880
 Do you think this look writes that and 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.919
 in the video comments it would be mega ois 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.320

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.120
 our teamspeak server is over steering 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.460
 of course and the address and in the 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.650
