00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
another let's play along with this one a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.510 
another let's play along with this one a
bit<00:00:18.570> different<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> game<00:00:19.500> sort<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.100> not

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
bit different the game sort of not

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.130 
bit different the game sort of not
something<00:00:20.820> you'd<00:00:20.939> expect<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.539> lets<00:00:21.750> played

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
something you'd expect to be lets played

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.939 
something you'd expect to be lets played
but<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.949> think

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
but I think I can do it because I think

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.380 
but I think I can do it because I think
it<00:00:26.099> would<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.279> interesting<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.970> no<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.330> would

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
it would be interesting and no one would

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.429 
it would be interesting and no one would
have<00:00:27.510> tried<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> before<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.050> even<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.410> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
have tried it before and even if it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
have tried it before and even if it
