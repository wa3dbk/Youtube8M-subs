evoke<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.080> lot<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.410> emotion<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.830> mean<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.040> can

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
evoke a lot of emotion I mean you can

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.110 
evoke a lot of emotion I mean you can
hear<00:02:27.459> it

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
hear it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.750 
hear it
carlene<00:02:29.989> Corsa<00:02:30.440> mode<00:02:30.470> which<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:30.890> sticking<00:02:31.640> to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
carlene Corsa mode which is sticking to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.290 
carlene Corsa mode which is sticking to
the<00:02:31.879> road

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.640 

when<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.780> switch<00:02:40.020> between<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.440> modes

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
when you switch between the modes

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.440 
when you switch between the modes
there's<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.520> many<00:02:41.610> different<00:02:41.760> things<00:02:42.060> got

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there's so many different things got

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.750 
there's so many different things got
happening<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.530> suspension<00:02:44.100> tightens<00:02:44.430> up<00:02:44.520> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
happening the suspension tightens up the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
happening the suspension tightens up the
gear<00:02:44.970> changes<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.630> faster<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> steering

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
gear changes get faster the steering

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.010 
gear changes get faster the steering
changes<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.730> has<00:02:47.850> variable<00:02:48.450> steering<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.900> it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
changes it has variable steering so it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.330 
changes it has variable steering so it
changes<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.620> steering's<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.010> don't<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
changes the steering's you don't have to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
changes the steering's you don't have to
turn<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.640> wheel<00:02:50.790> quite<00:02:51.000> far<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.720> kind

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
turn the wheel quite far you just kind

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.450 
turn the wheel quite far you just kind
of<00:02:51.960> give<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.200> tweaking<00:02:53.070> your<00:02:53.130> flying

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
of give it a little tweaking your flying

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.120 
of give it a little tweaking your flying
through<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> corners<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:54.390> also<00:02:55.020> this<00:02:55.260> new

the car in every kind of condition to do
this<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.270> need<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.750> fast<00:03:13.640> reaction<00:03:14.640> time<00:03:14.670> of

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
this you need a fast reaction time of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.120 
this you need a fast reaction time of
the<00:03:15.120> car<00:03:15.330> there<00:03:15.690> are<00:03:15.810> normally<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> system<00:03:16.680> that

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
the car there are normally a system that

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.700 
the car there are normally a system that
control<00:03:17.700> what<00:03:17.940> happens<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.540> car<00:03:18.780> based<00:03:19.200> on

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
control what happens in a car based on

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.000 
control what happens in a car based on
free<00:03:20.430> accelerometer<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.330> 10<00:03:22.080> scope<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.740> we

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
free accelerometer and 10 scope and we

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.460 
free accelerometer and 10 scope and we
finally<00:03:23.280> got<00:03:23.430> some<00:03:23.580> heat<00:03:23.730> desires<00:03:24.270> she's<00:03:25.140> um

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
finally got some heat desires she's um

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.860 
finally got some heat desires she's um
definitely<00:03:26.190> squirming<00:03:27.060> around<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.720> this

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
definitely squirming around for so this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.770 
definitely squirming around for so this
is<00:03:27.960> a<00:03:27.990> good<00:03:28.170> chance<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.590> see<00:03:28.830> how<00:03:29.520> well<00:03:29.820> these

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
is a good chance to see how well these

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.810 
is a good chance to see how well these
systems<00:03:31.320> work<00:03:31.530> with<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.890> new<00:03:32.010> accelerometers

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
systems work with the new accelerometers

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.270 
systems work with the new accelerometers
it's<00:03:33.480> got<00:03:33.750> three<00:03:34.230> gyroscopes<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.010> three

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
it's got three gyroscopes and three

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.830 
it's got three gyroscopes and three
accelerometers<00:03:35.520> measuring<00:03:36.240> I<00:03:36.510> think<00:03:36.750> it's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
accelerometers measuring I think it's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.630 
accelerometers measuring I think it's
like<00:03:36.960> a<00:03:36.990> thousand<00:03:37.560> times<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.860> second<00:03:38.220> exactly

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
like a thousand times a second exactly

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.310 
like a thousand times a second exactly
what<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.880> car<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.090> doing<00:03:39.330> is<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.780> car<00:03:39.990> letting

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
what the car is doing is the car letting

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.350 
what the car is doing is the car letting
go<00:03:40.490> doesn't<00:03:41.490> need<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> little<00:03:42.090> bit<00:03:42.180> more

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
go doesn't need a little bit more

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
pressure on the outside damping because

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.860 
pressure on the outside damping because
the<00:03:44.220> suspensions<00:03:44.790> variable<00:03:45.270> as<00:03:45.390> well<00:03:45.570> as<00:03:45.720> so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
the suspensions variable as well as so

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.140 
the suspensions variable as well as so
it's<00:03:46.050> just<00:03:46.200> kind<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.610> adapt<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.850> what's<00:03:48.060> going

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
it's just kind of adapt to what's going

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.270 
it's just kind of adapt to what's going
on<00:03:48.480> in<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.690> car<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.260> works

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.990 

we<00:03:56.090> want<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.709> car<00:03:58.010> always<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.730> when

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
we want to have a car always that when

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.270 
we want to have a car always that when
it<00:03:59.270> appear<00:03:59.660> in<00:03:59.810> your<00:03:59.840> rear<00:04:00.530> mirrors<00:04:00.980> it's

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
it appear in your rear mirrors it's

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.370 
it appear in your rear mirrors it's
remained<00:04:02.030> unique<00:04:02.360> you<00:04:02.690> have<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.990> feel

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
remained unique you have to feel

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.840 
remained unique you have to feel
something<00:04:03.740> that<00:04:03.980> this<00:04:04.100> thing<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.550> fast

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
something that this thing that is fast

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.240 
something that this thing that is fast
so<00:04:05.120> we<00:04:05.240> decided<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.870> use<00:04:06.140> there<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.770> a<00:04:06.830> kind<00:04:07.069> of

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
so we decided to use there is a kind of

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.670 
so we decided to use there is a kind of
movement<00:04:07.670> call<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.480> food<00:04:08.690> tourism<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.380> they

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
movement call it food tourism and they

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.370 
movement call it food tourism and they
were<00:04:09.860> adding<00:04:10.330> geometrical<00:04:11.330> figures<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.350> a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
were adding geometrical figures to a

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.060 
were adding geometrical figures to a
shape<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:13.250> add<00:04:13.459> dynamism<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:15.709> thing<00:04:15.920> is

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
shape to add dynamism this thing is

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.789 
shape to add dynamism this thing is
literally<00:04:16.730> from<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.480> future<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.590> see

literally from the future you can see

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.740 
literally from the future you can see
the<00:04:18.950> influences<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.609> can<00:04:19.760> see<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.299> hexagonal

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
the influences you can see the hexagonal

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.350 
the influences you can see the hexagonal
design<00:04:21.230> cues<00:04:21.950> throughout<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.610> whole<00:04:22.820> car<00:04:23.090> and

design cues throughout the whole car and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.420 
design cues throughout the whole car and
it<00:04:23.419> really<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:24.760> incredible<00:04:25.760> hey<00:04:26.120> boys<00:04:27.430> as

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.740 
it really is just incredible hey boys as
a<00:04:28.490> camera<00:04:28.940> crew<00:04:29.060> they're<00:04:29.360> still<00:04:29.660> alive

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
a camera crew they're still alive

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.810 
a camera crew they're still alive
they're<00:04:30.620> not<00:04:30.710> having<00:04:30.890> nearly<00:04:31.130> as<00:04:31.340> much<00:04:31.490> fun<00:04:31.550> as

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
they're not having nearly as much fun as

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.040 
they're not having nearly as much fun as
I<00:04:31.940> am<00:04:32.950> we<00:04:33.950> try<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.220> do<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.790> big<00:04:35.270> amount<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.810> work

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
I am we try to do a big amount of work

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.940 
I am we try to do a big amount of work
in<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.740> aluminum<00:04:37.370> chassis<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.990> achieved<00:04:39.380> but

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
in the aluminum chassis we achieved but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.580 
in the aluminum chassis we achieved but
we<00:04:40.400> also<00:04:40.700> achieve<00:04:41.030> an<00:04:41.150> increase<00:04:41.419> of<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.690> way<00:04:41.870> in

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
we also achieve an increase of a way in

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.680 
we also achieve an increase of a way in
order<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.980> solve<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.340> problem<00:04:43.580> we<00:04:44.060> substitute

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
order to solve a problem we substitute

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.710 
order to solve a problem we substitute
aluminium<00:04:45.590> with<00:04:46.100> carbon<00:04:46.550> fiber<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.240> the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
aluminium with carbon fiber and the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.140 
aluminium with carbon fiber and the
final<00:04:48.110> result<00:04:48.470> was<00:04:48.710> not<00:04:48.890> only<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.310> achieve<00:04:49.640> the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
final result was not only to achieve the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.090 
final result was not only to achieve the
stiffness<00:04:50.690> but<00:04:51.169> also<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.620> have<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.830> weight

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
stiffness but also to have a weight

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.150 
stiffness but also to have a weight

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
reduction of Denver side I would lose my

front end wants to go but then it just

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.250 
front end wants to go but then it just
kind<00:06:19.000> of<00:06:19.090> pulls<00:06:19.330> it<00:06:19.450> back<00:06:19.570> in<00:06:19.780> all<00:06:19.960> together
