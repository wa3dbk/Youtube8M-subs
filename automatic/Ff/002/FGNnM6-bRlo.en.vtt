00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.030
 coordinate a bit what is the rehabilitation service of in the selection 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.539
 Spanish Rugby Seven Control Hydration Control 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.380
 of injury prevention controls a little the treatment of those that already 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.150
 There is time as it is to meet the daily needs of players who 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:25.069
 with the trainings 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:29.459
 so strong and with what comes to us now of competition because the PSOE are 

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:33.140
 Both frequent overloads and the physiotherapist are not only 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.030
 important voort for the physical tension but also for the psychological one because 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.880
 the players have their kids restlessness and it's on the stretchers and in the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.590
 rehabilitation room where 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.250
 where they relax most and 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.030
 when you create links from friendship and from 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.830
 understanding problems that arise 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.530
 of the things that have impacted me most when coming to work for the national team 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.870
 Spanish Rugby is the personality that is generated this is not so much in the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.270
 technical body as 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.730
 the players and the day-to-day sample my work consists of pearls 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.570
 necessary tests, especially the physical and biological condition of the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.330
 players 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.680
 What next 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.850
 so he coordinated with the physical trainers so that they have a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.720
 reference 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.960
 and what are the most important aspects that you have to work 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.010
 kristen much better player logically 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.250
 since we started always medical tests we do is consume it 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.800
 because later usurer doing full 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.380
 PD not only at the state level but at the performance level 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.119
 from there we make a nutrition plan we make a plan of your 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.620
 implementation 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.549
 A plan of 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.790
 rest of thousands of recovery iun 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.150
 physical plan 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.310
 that's when we have to continue controlling with coplas programs 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 after an intel record has fatigued player 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.860
 very important for europe the boxes is the workload because they do not hire 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.090
 so long 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.260
 Workload training 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 it is very important hospitable normally 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.750
 I wish it worked well 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.190
 the players have to finish tired 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.390
 in the peaks 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.960
 it is planned 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.770
 what we try is he 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.779
 give is kind of procedure or strong 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.859
 so they look for many adaptations 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.269
 I also regulate very well the acid rest so that afterwards they 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.560
 catch the tournaments with the best 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.049
 only possible conversation so that we are in better conditions 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.149
 we have one means 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.049
 of preparation 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.249
 similar to those that may have another clear type as secretary 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.510
 technical can be 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.609
 is to coordinate a little bit all 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.139
 all the information that is arriving and destroying them to the right person 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.159
 and as a video analyst because the function of last year to record 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.929
 training 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.059
 for asaja technical improvement 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:48.429
 and then the games to analyze our game and especially the game of 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.989
 rival for otherwise we will not face 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.409
 and have an idea 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.409
 Little by little, we are establishing contact with other teams and 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.759
 and sharing videos and that's how he showed us we are giving the 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.680
 training 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.869
 we are improving a lot as the days go by 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.269
 i are going for the moment 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.120
 the progressives not very good and 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.230
 We are positive and we hope we will continue with the experience of the year 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.139
 past we have enough 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.329
 better organized what is he 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.929
 the coexistence of 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:21.459
 in the blume of falces makes very heavy all day together so much time there 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.129
 well 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.639
 We try to distribute the norm the week two days that we went out there little to think 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:26.999
 in other things to 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.730
 train us basically not with recipes entramientos and follow changes enough 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.369
 because we did not start from scratch as we could match last year has gone up 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.739
 the level assumed the intensity later but with on the other hand the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.669
 time and I am a trip the both 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:41.929
 inside as outside 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.509
 sovereign way of life 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:49.789
 another way partial George of us to mateo lina different way of approaching 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.789
 towards the path to professionalism much less means 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.279
 but a lot more people here sometimes 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.589
 We believe that the means to solve the issue 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:59.789
 a novelty 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:01.299
 in training for example 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.659
 it was everything much more 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.099
 In this natural area we also pretend on the beach what will include 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.069
 but we embark half of the sea with about two kilometers from the coast we started 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.639
 md 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.099
 arrived we have sent them group of course p 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.509
 races on the beach for several kilometers and in the process of these two 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.099
 deaths per cent last tournament we play has an economic prize what 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.529
 which motivates a lot I use it or populated the final moment in a team 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:30.180
 barrier fight for that prize there were 96 teams registered 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.449
 looking forward to returning here 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.270
 work the way but how do I know that they do not really spend excellent 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.349
 e in the project that we have requested 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.209
 not only do we forget about family team illusion that end ended up sellingh 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:46.180
 of the players and 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.400
 and it's a minimum, but it's also 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.850
 is being prepared by the guru of the technical team from first to last 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.199
 a way 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.199
 now we have nothing to envy many many other elections 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.300
 as regards the preparation by the technicians off 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.789
 the last weeks the parliament been excellent 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:05.809
 I am happy 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.400
 the players have worked 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.039
 the rest of the year if we have detected that the powers have worked 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.569
 and they come 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.169
 very well the metal forms optimal and allows it there was at least 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.259
 hook the detachments of the famous 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.740
 in this sense 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.759
 and we're going to start integrating the begin to integrate the physical pretty deal with 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.800
 all that is the whole part this 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.020
 intervene the funds that is integrated 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.270
 to charter more of the type of workouts are shorter more 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.699
 intense pale 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.889
 the group we have in london is a group 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:44.319
 1 in New Zealand that all are one of these goods amounts to 317 calculate 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.259
 the second game is to give Kenyan explanations we concretized the 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.379
 nice revenge 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.759
 and as such we have a challenge 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.280
 Of course I still think that our defense is not so little less points 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.189
 with them 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.379
 and we will continue to fight for its objectives because in us 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.419
 While these products are sold we only receive a 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.039
 clear objective and score after this setback and in the European championship 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.559
 it is an objective that we have marked all the players in this central 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:17.119
 and is among the first four shoots to be healed 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:19.150
 as a continuity of last year 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.530
 but saving that this year in the gold cup for gifts delivery portugal 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.830
 Russia does not smoke nor three decades ago 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.530
 I think that is among the first four would be
