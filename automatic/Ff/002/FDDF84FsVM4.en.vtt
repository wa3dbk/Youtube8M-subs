00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.730
 good morning everyone I do this today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580
 small video 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.000
 let's say one day it seems like a big thing 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.719
 in short, an alert is an update 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.760
 notice maybe some of you will already have 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.130
 noticed on facebook a few weeks ago 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 an event has been created to organize 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.550
 a Milan meeting 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.289
 the meeting will be held in Milan on the 12th of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.599
 October which is a Sunday since I 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.489
 by now , Saturdays are always working 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.770
 Sunday and we will be there of course 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.559
 shanti chantilly p's elena the asb in e 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 serena macha latte will be a meeting 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.260
 so rather full bodied I guess also 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.010
 because we are girls with channels 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.079
 quite different so there will be 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.489
 I think a rather heterogeneous influx 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.030
 so boys and girls with passions 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.190
 different 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.719
 but we decided to make it all 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.970
 a little more circumscribed because i 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.580
 our last meetings were many 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.830
 targeted in short girls passionate about 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.720
 makeup that invaded the perfumeries 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.210
 so this time we decided 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.060
 to meet us at 2 on the steps of 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.130
 cathedral e 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.509
 and then we still don't have a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.939
 precise program but certainly for i 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.950
 guys maybe listening intent 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:33.439
 to come we will not give the assault to the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.640
 perfumeries so don't worry and 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.479
 nothing this is all about the meeting 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.619
 we say that the meeting point will be 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.149
 book 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.220
 I guess we'll get on the steps 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:49.100
 of the cathedral a lot to give time 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.840
 all to arrive and nothing I did anyway 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.000
 more or less the meeting will be held by the two 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.440
 until around 6 because then I imagine that 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.330
 everyone will have to go home 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.360
 I will personally take a train 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.130
 at around 6 o'clock in short something of the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.470
 kind enough and I don't remember what anymore 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.509
 we have a saying and fact is organized 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.729
 for the previous meetings then me 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.440
 stop here I hope you will want to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.049
 come and have a chat with us is 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.890
 something as usual very informal 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.010
 at least as far as I'm concerned 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.299
 informal and I hope I would see a lot 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.299
 hello neighbors
