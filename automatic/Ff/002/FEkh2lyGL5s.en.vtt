00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.649 
time and barrier I don't know because I
haven't<00:01:41.610> been<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.090> guessing<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.450> puts<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
haven't been here I'm guessing it puts a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.569 
haven't been here I'm guessing it puts a
barrier<00:01:42.840> around<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.470> all<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.220> now<00:01:44.369> these

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
barrier around you all right now these

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.389 
barrier around you all right now these
ones<00:01:45.200> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.610> attack<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.329> does<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
ones this is like the attack it does a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.859 
ones this is like the attack it does a
drive<00:01:50.399> I'll<00:01:50.790> show<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> drive<00:01:51.600> does

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
drive I'll show you what the drive does

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.649 
drive I'll show you what the drive does
now<00:01:52.110> quickly<00:01:52.909> ready<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.540> hold<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
now quickly ready you hold it and it

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.730 
now quickly ready you hold it and it
does<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> does<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
does that that's what it does it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.630 
does that that's what it does it
basically<00:01:58.860> blows<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> hole<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> floor

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
basically blows a hole in the floor

I<00:02:13.310> hope<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.819> sounds<00:02:14.030> not<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.270> land<00:02:14.510> by<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.660> way

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I hope the sounds not to land by the way

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.940 
I hope the sounds not to land by the way
launch<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.520> one<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.560> quickly<00:02:18.740> go

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
launch this one if I just quickly go

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.650 
launch this one if I just quickly go
over<00:02:18.980> here<00:02:19.280> run<00:02:19.580> quick<00:02:19.850> before<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> lose<00:02:20.330> my<00:02:20.390> X

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
over here run quick before I lose my X

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.370 
over here run quick before I lose my X
charge<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.680> hold<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.100> right<00:02:22.280> button<00:02:23.380> this

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
charge if you hold the right button this

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.830 
charge if you hold the right button this
happens

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
happens

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.790 
happens
it<00:02:26.840> basically<00:02:27.370> launches<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:29.800> wherever

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
it basically launches you to wherever

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.690 
it basically launches you to wherever
you<00:02:31.069> are<00:02:31.130> holding<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.070> launches<00:02:34.580> you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
you are holding it just launches you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.270 
you are holding it just launches you
across<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.959> that's<00:02:36.170> pretty<00:02:36.320> cool<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
across so that's pretty cool the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.310 
across so that's pretty cool the
surround<00:02:37.730> one<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.120> actually<00:02:38.570> don't<00:02:39.020> know<00:02:39.290> what

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
surround one I actually don't know what

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.780 
surround one I actually don't know what
this<00:02:39.650> does<00:02:40.870> but<00:02:41.870> if<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.350> go<00:02:42.560> into<00:02:42.800> third<00:02:43.100> person

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
this does but if I go into third person

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.020 
this does but if I go into third person
and<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.390> hold<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:48.230> does<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.790> guess

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
and I hold it it does that so I guess

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.580 
and I hold it it does that so I guess
and<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.269> surrounds<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.900> in<00:02:51.019> some<00:02:51.260> sort<00:02:51.500> of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
and it surrounds you in some sort of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.150 
and it surrounds you in some sort of
fire<00:02:51.950> or<00:02:52.280> something<00:02:52.660> let's<00:02:53.660> try<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.900> again

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.140 

which<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.280> pretty<00:02:58.430> cool<00:02:58.610> because<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:59.000> leaves

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
which is pretty cool because it leaves

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.240 
which is pretty cool because it leaves
you<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> some<00:02:59.780> stake<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:00.800> can<00:03:00.980> eat<00:03:01.220> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
you a some stake so you can eat that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.729 
you a some stake so you can eat that
some<00:03:01.730> steak<00:03:02.080> alright<00:03:03.080> now<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.290> last<00:03:03.380> version

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
some steak alright now the last version

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.800 
some steak alright now the last version
this<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.700> probably<00:03:04.910> my<00:03:05.000> favorite<00:03:05.420> one<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
this is probably my favorite one and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.050 
this is probably my favorite one and
just<00:03:06.680> go<00:03:06.860> back<00:03:06.890> into<00:03:07.220> normal<00:03:07.670> view<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:10.060> this

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
just go back into normal view and this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.250 
just go back into normal view and this
this<00:03:11.269> one<00:03:11.420> probably<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.690> best<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.019> because

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
this one probably the best on because

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.530 
this one probably the best on because
you<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.709> do<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.820> can<00:03:13.910> make<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.299> blow

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
you can do you can make you just blow

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.539 
you can do you can make you just blow
things<00:03:14.840> wide<00:03:15.680> open<00:03:16.250> when<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.549> hold<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:18.549> and

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
things wide open when you hold it and

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.590 
things wide open when you hold it and
you<00:03:20.239> just<00:03:20.440> release<00:03:21.940> whatever<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.239> hell<00:03:23.420> just

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
you just release whatever the hell just

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.880 
you just release whatever the hell just
happened<00:03:23.810> there<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.350> yeah<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.340> basically<00:03:25.610> just

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.550 

just<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.090> old<00:03:30.330> aisles<00:03:30.750> people<00:03:31.140> it's<00:03:31.380> like

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
just for old aisles people it's like

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.070 
just for old aisles people it's like
push<00:03:31.800> for<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.040> darkened<00:03:32.460> sky<00:03:32.810> that's<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.020> is

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
push for a darkened sky that's this is

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.949 
push for a darkened sky that's this is
probably<00:03:34.410> my<00:03:34.560> favorite<00:03:35.100> thing<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.630> can<00:03:36.780> get

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
probably my favorite thing you can get

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.120 
probably my favorite thing you can get
on<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:38.870> don't<00:03:39.870> know<00:03:39.930> why<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.950> just

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
on it I don't know why I just I just

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.850 
on it I don't know why I just I just
really<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.930> don't<00:03:43.620> know<00:03:43.680> how<00:03:43.740> much

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
really like it I don't know how much

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.449 
really like it I don't know how much
range<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.400> thing's<00:03:44.730> got<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.150> let's<00:03:45.270> try<00:03:46.850> yeah

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
range this thing's got so let's try yeah

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.150 
range this thing's got so let's try yeah
okay<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.520> didn't<00:03:50.760> work<00:03:51.620> didn't<00:03:52.620> work<00:03:52.650> again<00:03:53.010> I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
okay it didn't work didn't work again I

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.870 
okay it didn't work didn't work again I
think<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.490> must<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:55.310> hold<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.489> against

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
think you must have to hold it against

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.320 
think you must have to hold it against
objects<00:03:58.370> some<00:03:59.370> reason<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.730> isn't<00:03:59.850> attacking

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
objects some reason it isn't attacking

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.710 
objects some reason it isn't attacking
this<00:04:00.450> let's<00:04:00.660> go<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.989> feet<00:04:02.450> all<00:04:03.450> right<00:04:03.570> so

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
this let's go to the feet all right so
