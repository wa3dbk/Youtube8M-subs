00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
episodes but that doesn't mean it's

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.040 
episodes but that doesn't mean it's
necessarily<00:02:26.770> bad<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.180> its<00:02:28.390> own<00:02:28.570> merits

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
somewhat gets to have a little bit of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.330 
somewhat gets to have a little bit of
the<00:02:46.780> spotlight<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.680> episode<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.220> not

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
the spotlight in this episode it's not

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.190 
the spotlight in this episode it's not
really<00:02:48.550> just<00:02:48.580> focused<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.300> one<00:02:49.510> individual

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
really just focused on one individual

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020 
really just focused on one individual
character<00:02:50.560> let's<00:02:50.709> say<00:02:50.770> like<00:02:50.920> Yuki<00:02:51.370> or<00:02:51.550> Yuri

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
character let's say like Yuki or Yuri

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.390 
character let's say like Yuki or Yuri
it's<00:02:52.420> focused<00:02:52.959> on<00:02:53.050> almost<00:02:53.440> everybody<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.310> this

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
it's focused on almost everybody in this

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.580 
it's focused on almost everybody in this
episode<00:02:54.760> but<00:02:54.850> mainly<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.570> some<00:02:56.140> ways<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.530> guess

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
episode but mainly in some ways I guess

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.920 
episode but mainly in some ways I guess
you<00:02:56.890> could<00:02:57.130> argue<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.790> say<00:02:57.940> Yuri<00:02:58.209> was<00:02:58.510> kind<00:02:58.870> of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
you could argue and say Yuri was kind of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.440 
you could argue and say Yuri was kind of
the<00:02:59.020> main<00:02:59.230> focus<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.190> episode<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.209> she

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the main focus of this episode but she

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.630 
the main focus of this episode but she
wasn't<00:03:01.660> as<00:03:01.930> implied<00:03:02.530> as<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.890> main<00:03:03.040> focus<00:03:03.490> as

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
wasn't as implied as the main focus as

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.920 
wasn't as implied as the main focus as
some<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.180> other<00:03:04.360> characters<00:03:04.900> from

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
a biological weapon a biological weapon

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.530 
a biological weapon a biological weapon
so<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.070> just<00:03:39.130> random<00:03:39.730> virus<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.390> just

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
so is I just random virus that just

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.880 
so is I just random virus that just
pumps<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:41.019> out<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.290> fucking<00:03:41.560> are<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:41.830> a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
pumps up out of fucking are it's a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.000 
pumps up out of fucking are it's a
biological<00:03:42.250> weapon<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.300> was<00:03:43.390> used<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:44.200> Japan

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
biological weapon that was used on Japan

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.110 
biological weapon that was used on Japan
and<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:47.290> not<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.860> either<00:03:48.250> what<00:03:48.670> goes<00:03:48.880> along

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
and it's not that either what goes along

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.080 
and it's not that either what goes along
with<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.890> with<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.370> being<00:03:51.670> used

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
with this is that with this being used

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.930 
with this is that with this being used
and<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.810> see<00:03:53.050> what<00:03:53.470> was<00:03:53.739> written<00:03:53.980> down<00:03:54.370> in<00:03:54.760> this

book this evacuation manual and it lets

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.710 
book this evacuation manual and it lets
us<00:03:57.780> know<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.110> assume<00:03:59.590> that<00:04:00.459> whatever<00:04:00.820> or

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
us know and assume that whatever or

us know and assume that whatever or
whoever<00:04:02.220> did<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.840> was<00:04:05.080> darn<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.470> little

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
whoever did this it was darn a little

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.380 
whoever did this it was darn a little
bit<00:04:05.800> awhile<00:04:06.040> ago<00:04:06.310> for<00:04:06.580> instance<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.970> let's<00:04:07.209> say

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
bit awhile ago for instance it let's say

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.970 
bit awhile ago for instance it let's say
it<00:04:07.480> was<00:04:07.570> done<00:04:07.750> maybe<00:04:07.930> in<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.230> couple<00:04:08.260> weeks<00:04:08.590> span

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
it was done maybe in a couple weeks span

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.460 
it was done maybe in a couple weeks span
before<00:04:09.510> everything<00:04:10.510> went<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.810> shit<00:04:10.840> like

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
before everything went to shit like

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.800 
before everything went to shit like
let's<00:04:12.070> say<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.880> biological<00:04:13.450> weapon<00:04:13.690> was<00:04:13.780> used

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
let's say the biological weapon was used

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.110 
let's say the biological weapon was used
on<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.380> top<00:04:14.560> part<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:14.860> Japan<00:04:15.250> okay<00:04:15.610> just<00:04:16.060> the

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
on the top part of Japan okay just the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.039 
on the top part of Japan okay just the
United<00:04:16.359> States<00:04:16.390> wherever<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:16.930> just

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
United States wherever it's just

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.570 
United States wherever it's just
anywhere<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.440> your<00:04:17.530> country<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:17.950> live<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.130> use

anywhere in your country you live in use

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.180 
anywhere in your country you live in use
on<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.880> top<00:04:18.910> part<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.600> depending<00:04:20.380> on<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.830> I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
on the top part and depending on the I

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.670 
on the top part and depending on the I
guess<00:04:21.489> quarantine<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.240> evacuation<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.289> took

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
guess quarantine and evacuation it took

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.200 
guess quarantine and evacuation it took
maybe<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.950> couple<00:04:24.220> weeks<00:04:24.490> for<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.820> finally

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
maybe a couple weeks for it to finally

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.560 
maybe a couple weeks for it to finally
