 weather forecast we have two 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.560
 Luxurious conditions and some drizzles 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.269
 they have still been reporting in 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.349
 different sectors of the east and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.210
 also from the southeast of the republic 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 mexicana we had already commented with 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 before this is associated with a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 front that stays semi stationary 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.189
 in the gulf of mexico and makes it not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 show and I watching also spread 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.939
 to sectors of the northeast the republic 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 Mexican although it is worth noting that these 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.660
 areas of cloudiness are going to dissipate 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.609
 gradually in the course of the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 next days although we will continue 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.630
 with cool temperatures especially 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 in the course in the mornings in these 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.129
 sectors for the time being for the city of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.410
 mexico on Thursday morning we hope 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.750
 some areas of rain or drizzle very 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.910
 isolated sunny sky at mid-cloudy the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 minimum temperature is going to be 8 degrees 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 centigrade the maximum value will be 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 close to 25 for the course of 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.890
 the afternoon a lot of attention for this 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 Friday and Saturday still remains 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.309
 current the probability of some 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.800
 rain in isolated cloudiness 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.379
 minimum variable of 8 maximum among the 24 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 or 25 degrees Celsius while 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.439
 already for Sunday the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.970
 cloudiness completely waiting for the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.280
 minimum temperature of 8 degrees 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.530
 and close to 26 maximum bonus or 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 27 degrees Celsius over the course 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 in the afternoon in the city ​​of Monterrey 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.270
 meanwhile still expected some 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.190
 drizzle or fog during the morning 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.690
 Partly cloudy already in the afternoon it goes 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.400
 discarding little by little the probable a 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.740
 rain although it still remains in force 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.390
 Of course we can not rule it out 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.890
 Minimum temperature is 15 and the maximum 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.020
 have to increase a little more 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 Freud in the 24 the 25 degrees 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.290
 centigrade for Friday and Saturday 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.970
 the probability remains e 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.070
 some rains in an isolated way the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.200
 minimum temperatures between 17 and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 18 degrees and the maximum values will be 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 in the range of 25 to 26 while 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.479
 that already for Sunday the sky 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.520
 Partly sunny and a temperature 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.950
 a little warmer in the evening nearby 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 at 29 degrees and 13 with 30 the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.420
 temperatures for the pearl sky tapatía 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.710
 totally in the sunny and I comment 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.080
 that at least for the next days 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.670
 there is no change remains a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.710
 sky with no clouds with 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.720
 minimum temperatures in the range of 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.090
 3 and the 14 maximum values 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.820
 again between 29 and 30 degrees 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 centigrade let's take a look 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.899
 quickly to the conditions in the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.269
 South beaches of the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.590
 public huatulco acapulco also in the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.450
 zihuatanejo area I want to comment 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.010
 that the conditions are going to be heaven 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.650
 totally sunny temperatures 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.689
 between 32 and 33 degrees centigrade 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.879
 that was through the rain scale of 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.129
 way casual sky half cloudy with 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.200

 sunny sky cloudy 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.780
 we can not rule out some rains of 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.760
 way pretty isolated already but we had 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.889
 state we rule out precipitation the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.689
 temperatures remain at 32 with 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.730

 partially sunny while in 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.000
 people equal in the same trend for 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.549
 tomorrow some rains of 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.200
 Isolated form 7 with 25 temperatures 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.000
 cloudy mid-sky extends the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000
 precipitation for this Friday maximum 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.639
 of 26 and Saturday half cloudy minimum 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.980
 of 8 and the maximum again between the 25 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.990
 at 26 degrees Celsius that happens 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.000
 for toluca tomorrow 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.190
 cold during the first four hours 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.780

 Partly cloudy the drizzle or rain 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.410
 casual over the course of the afternoon or 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.390
 already during the night to Friday and Saturday 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.980
 the probability of precipitation is extended 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.750
 the minimum temperatures are maintained in 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.730

 we expect maximum between 27 and 28 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.440
 It should be noted that we can not rule out 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.760
 the probability of some rains of

 with cloudy sky conditions 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.210
 a lot of attention towards the southern part of

 texas is still valid the 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.240
 probability of some rains towards
