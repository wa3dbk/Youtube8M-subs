00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.879
 Favorites video favorites 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.130
 February and nothing you were interested 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.320
 know the things that I liked the most 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.450
 What else have I used the most 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.250
 helped this month stay to see the child 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.439
 the girls well they seemed two this 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.259
 brochita that I bought in byn coins makes 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.619
 a few months a video was not uploaded to you 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.779
 some time it 's kind olaya screamed but 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.730
 in white and has the hair then 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.679
 goat if I have not misunderstood 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.380
 forgive that you teach dirty but not 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.060
 they had to wash it and since I 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.740
 I always use it for the 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.730
 blushes is that I love it because 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.320
 It blends really well and I'm delighted 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.280
 I think it cost me less than two euros 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.590
 because they are worth two dollars and a peak or 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.390
 be less than two euros sure and it's a 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.770
 great acquisition I like a thousand times more 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.870
 that the sheet that I bought for example the 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.290
 I bought the black one too and it's black face 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.090
 is that he almost did not use them because he does not 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.640
 It's like this I love the following 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.800
 favorite of this month are these powders 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.290
 that I bought them on the ore page 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 looks and you leave the type of link 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.870
 down here for what 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.060
 if you want to pass and are of the brand 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.510
 of the minerals I do not know if they look like this 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.300
 Mark in another in other stores but you 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.580
 I have to say they are powders 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.260
 amazing me when those received by 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.810
 you do a lot of time already that's why 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.790
 because I bought them a lot ago I bought 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.880
 several the size or so the little one 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.280
 to try them and see what I thought were the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.960
 I tried and I liked them but as I was 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.729
 trying others I left and I 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.190
 forget a little of them now as you see 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.040
 I have taken them back and there are almost no 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.140
 it is a very finite powder 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.140
 to see if I can show you a little 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.330
 she is passion and it comes out is a very dust 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:59.770
 finite and is that it gives an appearance to the skin 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.470
 as silky for much longer than 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.080
 with any any product of the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.610
 that I have tried even with the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.360
 sea ​​minerals that I can already 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.060
 say and I'm delighted with them gives me 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.590
 a lot of pity that I'm finished and I suppose 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
 than trying to find them in some other 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.160
 store because how bad this is 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.810
 Lux mineral page is that expenses 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.180
 of shipments are quite high and I do not 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.180
 I remember badly I think four euros five 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.340
 euros do not take them away then it's a lot 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.490
 money for me it seems to me like to 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.410
 shipping costs and for that reason ni 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.320
 turn to ask on the page because in 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.990
 actually the website is not bad but 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.460
 I think the shipping costs are excessive 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.710
 so good if you find them in 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.450
 some other online store tell me by 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.390
 here if any has bought them 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.210
 in another place and surely repeat in 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.560
 some future if I find them 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.390
 because I do not want to place an order 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.960
 spend five euros of shipping costs 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.360
 because it is a 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.060
 clarity 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.880
 are these from here 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.819
 it is already I tell you the skin mate but without 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.400
 To be very opaque I also tell you that the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.830
 I have tried applying the brush and 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.840
 I have also applied tassel- 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.020
 tassel last even longer than the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.970
 skin and also the pores leaves as 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.480
 very finite that's why it's called imagino 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.690
 photoshop and that I love the 7 favorite 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.340
 of this month are these brand powders 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.010
 kiko that you already know that I bought it in the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.140
 pottinger market or because I do not know 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.640
 found in the stores are the 100 to 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.330
 miláns this the number here 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.430
 and they are this tone since I have them this 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.860
 I use them every day I used them to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.230
 of rouge I have md then a little touch 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.700
 of rosita or so I always use them as 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.180
 a blush because I like it a lot 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.370
 they smell of vice and it is a very 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.490
 advisable I imagine that now that 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.920
 it's close to veranito 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.650
 they will put some similar if they are not 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.570
 these with another name and surely 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.060
 they will be able to buy again but good 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.130
 I am a craving you already know and I bought it then 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.290
 in that girl who sold it second 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.700
 hand and I'm super happy with them 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.340
 it's also that a lot of 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.040
 amount comes 20 grams that is said 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.269
 soon it is already as 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.160
 look at my face is my face is very good 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.440
 highly recommended if you have them at home 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.750
 do not waste them using them 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.330
 next product that I have to you 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.740
 recommend this month is the enlistment of 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.740
 olive eyebrow and I am saved by the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.139
 life me every good I'm half-cold 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.259
 and as much as a carnet, this area 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.000
 here I resent a lot and this 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.860
 product at night is saving me 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.900
 I have to say that many nights and 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.020
 I notice man the outline of the eyes 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.610
 dry even the eyelid or part of 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.710
 low of the eyebrows that this time is of 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.590
 plucking us from scale I'm sorry 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.199
 applying and that is manuel is both in 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.849
 the lips even also so it's a 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.320
 highly recommended product comes in little 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.160
 amount but it is that it is a 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.080
 barbarity come 20 milliliters and I think 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.889
 that does not reach two euros or two 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.740
 euros and little has 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.310
 this pint 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.810
 you see and I recommend that you 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.960
 the price you have if you make an order 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.360
 to make up and online cosmetics we 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.650
 you think because it's a wild product yo 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.169
 I have not done it but I know many girls 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.479
 that they use in the heels on the elbows 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.029
 is that I do not know I think it's a multipurpose 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.879
 very cheap and that can get us out of 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.110
 any trouble and the following the 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:42.669
 next products that I love you 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.889
 recommend are these two in several 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.860

 I applied to all the nails the clean 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.909
 then this enamel then I put on the 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.249
 color over when it has dried that is 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.540

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.760

 Cracking it kept them anything so
