00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.310
 hello friends with you valery 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:24.430
 Rudenko and today I will tell you how to withdraw 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.420
 family and disruption condition one way 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 called 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.710
 the position of the swarm that is here the queen cells 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.770
 postponed the fact that this little family 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.830
 her virtues then she is a calm bee not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.510
 angry and but I got this framework 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.890
 it is not clear where the inheritance comes from 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.960
 i need to get rid of these temples yes 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.080
 she therefore swam that honeycomb very 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.000
 black scary i wanted them all 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:04.559
 still get rebuilt and but they don't even 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.820
 trying to pull a small frame 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.570
 translate therefore what I will do right now 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.070
 I'll run away from this house 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 I'll take his side here put naked 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.540
 a car can do a little medical care for them and all 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.900
 the bees shook off and it will turn out here a swarm without 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.360
 nothing fool brood somewhere that is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.320
 he he should bring this framework to get rid 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.219
 from this framework 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.350
 they are black scary and all and then this 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.929
 little family 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:45.210
 under sewing can even put these frames 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.740
 back so they look into what got out 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.310
 and 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:57.170
 get rid of them and bring them out of the swarm 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.170
 state here so now show 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.940
 Well, I partially them 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.250
 I shake off the womb slowly until I found 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.640
 nor how can I find 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.880
 I want to look her in the eye 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.510
 life has come but to find it up 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.020
 the rest of the bees like this through a sieve 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.270
 shook and look uterus still need 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.760
 calculate what is there for uterus 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.760
 look possible and 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 I will change 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.900
 hold the floor 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.880
 from the point 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.080
 no 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.120
 from the point 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.920
 whom 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.610
 oh well and here they are on the sly but 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.190
 liquor in a lot happened 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.299
 gathered but get rid of the framework of 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.299
 these scary faster and the bees will start 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.790
 develop now we have a period of some kind 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.420
 not very good 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:10.000
 a dozen no dry weather here they are 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.200
 visible so we decided to give 100 you 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.799
 scary 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.049
 i wanted everything torn down the uterus after all 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.970
 start down there 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:25.110
 brood drive it left there completely 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.930
 sealed solution several frames 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.880
 and it can be seen on the bottom and passed 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.000
 again upstairs I would not climb here I 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.320
 wanted to get rid of these 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.500
 gradual development not some 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.480
 weak this little family 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.420
 Well, well, that's such a way 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.180
 and they will now feel like a swarm of y 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.400
 there is nothing here to start developing 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.890
 then I can give them a few 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.650
 framework of these large to come out 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:02.850
 the rest is split and small frames will 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.410
 leave at all the wrong place they put 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.220
 will come out 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.220
 here and tighten 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.870
 yes such a way out of the swarm situation all
