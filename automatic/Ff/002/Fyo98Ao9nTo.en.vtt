I met pose owner of this car no I need
to<00:00:17.670> go<00:00:17.869> hit<00:00:18.869> an<00:00:19.020> RX<00:00:19.380> -<00:00:19.680> he<00:00:20.340> ran<00:00:20.640> he<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.509> nine

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
to go hit an RX - he ran he was a nine

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.159 
to go hit an RX - he ran he was a nine
second<00:00:22.529> pass<00:00:23.270> from<00:00:24.270> there<00:00:24.509> I<00:00:24.539> think<00:00:24.689> he<00:00:24.989> got

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
second pass from there I think he got

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.019 
second pass from there I think he got
the<00:00:25.230> burger<00:00:25.770> gong<00:00:25.949> quicker<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.310> quicker<00:00:26.489> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the burger gong quicker and quicker and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.409 
the burger gong quicker and quicker and
he<00:00:27.779> decided<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.289> build<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.650> Chotu<00:00:29.489> Supra<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
he decided to build a Chotu Supra in the

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.810 
he decided to build a Chotu Supra in the
new<00:00:30.570> class<00:00:30.809> which<00:00:31.110> is<00:00:31.259> called<00:00:31.290> strict<00:00:31.919> -<00:00:32.099> 89

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
new class which is called strict - 89

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.200 
new class which is called strict - 89
it<00:00:33.629> means<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.260> he<00:00:34.800> only<00:00:35.070> had<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> 28<00:00:35.700> inch<00:00:36.000> by

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it means that he only had a 28 inch by

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.260 
it means that he only had a 28 inch by
nine<00:00:36.450> inch<00:00:36.660> tile<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.520> think<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> record<00:00:38.850> for

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
nine inch tile I think the record for

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.250 
nine inch tile I think the record for
that<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.989> seven<00:00:40.770> nine<00:00:41.750> so<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.870> built<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.170> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that was seven nine so we built in this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.640 
that was seven nine so we built in this
charge<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> Supra<00:00:44.070> which<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> 2jz

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
charge of Supra which is a 2jz

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.180 
charge of Supra which is a 2jz
turbo<00:00:46.650> how<00:00:47.070> tech<00:00:47.340> ECU<00:00:47.880> so<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:49.530> thing<00:00:49.770> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
turbo how tech ECU so this thing is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.530 
turbo how tech ECU so this thing is
going<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:50.970> I<00:00:51.150> think<00:00:51.270> its<00:00:51.480> first

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
going out there and I think its first

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.720 
going out there and I think its first
debut<00:00:52.170> broke<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> record<00:00:52.829> around<00:00:53.130> seven<00:00:53.610> 80s

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
debut broke the record around seven 80s

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.770 
debut broke the record around seven 80s
innocence<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:56.940> we're<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.300> gonna<00:00:57.420> pick<00:00:57.630> on

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
innocence then we're just gonna pick on

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.780 
innocence then we're just gonna pick on
a<00:00:57.810> clicker<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.230> yeah<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:58.950> it's<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.399> 7-0

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
a clicker and yeah now it's going 7-0

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.729 
a clicker and yeah now it's going 7-0
with<00:01:00.329> 207<00:01:01.140> mullah<00:01:01.290> now<00:01:02.809> no<00:01:03.809> one's<00:01:04.019> even<00:01:04.229> close

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
with 207 mullah now no one's even close

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
with 207 mullah now no one's even close
to<00:01:04.920> catching<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to catching it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.440 
to catching it
it<00:01:08.100> makes<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> fastest<00:01:09.000> car<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> world

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it makes it the fastest car in the world

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.340 
it makes it the fastest car in the world
will<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.960> tire<00:01:11.450> with<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> engine<00:01:12.900> believe

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
will that tire with the engine believe

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.660 
will that tire with the engine believe
it<00:01:13.440> or<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:13.710> still<00:01:13.740> under<00:01:14.040> standard<00:01:14.340> 2j

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it or not we're still under standard 2j

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.860 
it or not we're still under standard 2j
coils<00:01:15.860> those<00:01:16.860> standard<00:01:17.340> curls<00:01:17.550> hold<00:01:18.150> ignition

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
coils those standard curls hold ignition

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.950 
coils those standard curls hold ignition
in<00:01:19.140> our<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.530> 60<00:01:19.800> pounds<00:01:20.160> so<00:01:20.370> in<00:01:20.940> 10,000<00:01:21.600> rpm

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
in our up to 60 pounds so in 10,000 rpm

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.030 
in our up to 60 pounds so in 10,000 rpm
so<00:01:22.170> there's<00:01:22.320> still<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.650> ignition

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
so there's still a good ignition

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.040 
so there's still a good ignition

are 1600 CC primaries people look at

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.680 
are 1600 CC primaries people look at
that<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.430> say<00:01:35.640> okay<00:01:36.030> how<00:01:36.210> come<00:01:36.420> you've<00:01:36.600> got

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
that and say okay how come you've got

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.730 
that and say okay how come you've got
the<00:01:36.780> secondaries<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.440> front<00:01:37.590> and

the secondaries up the front and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
the secondaries up the front and
primaries<00:01:38.190> at<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.509> doesn't

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
primaries at the back and it doesn't

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.150 
primaries at the back and it doesn't
make<00:01:39.900> sense<00:01:39.960> usually<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.710> another<00:01:40.950> way

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
make sense usually you have another way

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.430 
make sense usually you have another way
around<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.060> reason<00:01:42.479> why<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:42.900> that<00:01:43.050> is<00:01:43.110> we

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
around the reason why we do that is we

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.140 
around the reason why we do that is we
like<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.340> much<00:01:44.550> fuel<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:44.970> can

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
like to have as much fuel as we can

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.030 
like to have as much fuel as we can
closer<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> port<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> keeps<00:01:46.890> the

closer to the port so it keeps the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.960 
closer to the port so it keeps the
engine<00:01:47.220> cooler<00:01:48.200> that's<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.320> precision<00:01:49.619> 94<00:01:50.400> Pro

the waste date and the turbo you can't
just<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.630> three<00:02:19.290> pipes<00:02:20.280> merge<00:02:20.670> into

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
just have three pipes merge into

just have three pipes merge into
wastegate<00:02:21.420> people's<00:02:21.870> fuel<00:02:22.799> overboost<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.269> we

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
wastegate people's fuel overboost so we

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.270 
wastegate people's fuel overboost so we
couldn't<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.290> had<00:02:25.470> no<00:02:25.620> room<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> merge

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
couldn't do that we had no room to merge

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.410 
couldn't do that we had no room to merge
it<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.450> put<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.110> exhaust<00:02:28.320> housing

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
it so we put it in the exhaust housing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.030 
it so we put it in the exhaust housing
now<00:02:30.420> having<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.110> exhaust<00:02:31.440> housing<00:02:31.620> is

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
now having it in the exhaust housing is

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.530 
now having it in the exhaust housing is
not<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> good<00:02:32.489> thing<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:32.880> if<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.299> have<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
not a good thing because if you have it

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.600 
not a good thing because if you have it
too<00:02:33.720> high<00:02:33.930> up<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.380> interrupts<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
too high up it interrupts the the

too high up it interrupts the the

it<00:02:39.390> your<00:02:39.840> way<00:02:40.019> disturb<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
it your way disturb it

pressure<00:04:17.500> more<00:04:17.950> turbine<00:04:18.489> speed<00:04:18.790> which<00:04:19.090> gives

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
pressure more turbine speed which gives

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.699 
pressure more turbine speed which gives
you<00:04:19.480> more<00:04:19.510> air<00:04:19.780> speed<00:04:20.080> and<00:04:20.290> you're<00:04:20.530> going<00:04:20.650> to
