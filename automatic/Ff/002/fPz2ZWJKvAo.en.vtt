00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.849
 Today they show beautiful good day one 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 unboxing video from the law at hanna three 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:16.590
 the new waterproof outdoor phone 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.500
 of jurassic and we started right at that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.400
 her far comes in a chic white 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.400
 box with Chinese inscriptions end 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.940
 what is supposed to be there from it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.950
 China is coming so in the box 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:52.399
 the phone itself with the bag lid 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:52.399
 then a pity and various lawyer around the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.850
 but I really do not think so 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.260
 human beings more does he ever need 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.260
 had android mobile phone in hand 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.350
 here is a usb cable 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:13.010
 at the same time charging cable 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 charger again Chinese supplement 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:21.630
 screen protection is not there and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.590
 The battery was empty again before 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960
 I've already welded it 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:31.290
 unpacked 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 that's a 2200 30 milliampere battery 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.840
 Charger is here in a US plug 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.979
 version 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.020
 but I assume that in the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 Normally the euro import with a 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.509
 will be stronger Europe is probably 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.509
 In any case, 120 to 240 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.229
 and is connected with the usb cable 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:06.789
 logically good 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:08.259
 that was part of the pack I get 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.550
 I do not want to do a review that is coming 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.440
 later in another video 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.739
 I like it here on the short time 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.950
 Main differences can be seen already 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:25.060
 And indeed the device is waterproof and 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.519
 here has a rubber seal around it 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.220
 I achieve that with the normal ones 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.880
 appliances have never been seen before 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.730
 not waterproof then logically 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.890
 as another we see here above 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.850
 Infrared port so not port 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:51.640
 output with which he with this device where 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.920
 90 percent of all other usual devices 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.750
 can remote control and so speaks tv-device 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.090
 air conditioners and so on and so forth 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.090
 everything is served with infrared 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.579
 Well 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.769
 the sim card I show that too 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:11.910
 is a micro sim 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.910
 I'll put you in here right now 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:23.900
 which is inserted so here and the battery 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:40.650
 Well that was it for the first unboxing one 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.420
 detailed review would come later 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.490
 look at my other videos 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.120
 I'll go into detail on that 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.720
 gets ready for now and many 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.720
 thanks for watching
