actually making a map editor so i just
want<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> show<00:00:23.300> everyone<00:00:24.300> really<00:00:25.169> that<00:00:25.320> map

want to show everyone really that map
editor<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:26.039> work<00:00:26.279> what<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.769> that

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
it can load into the game which i will

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.960 
it can load into the game which i will
make<00:00:31.079> another<00:00:31.230> video<00:00:31.550> pretty<00:00:32.550> much<00:00:32.700> straight

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970

after showcasing really me running

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.620 
after showcasing really me running
around<00:00:36.720> in<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.110> map<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.060> i'll<00:00:39.060> start<00:00:39.330> with

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
around in the map so i'll start with

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.520 
around in the map so i'll start with
what<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.380> map<00:00:40.560> editor<00:00:40.740> can<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.610> quiet

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
what the map editor can do it's quiet

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
what the map editor can do it's quiet
generic<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.740> can<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.970> it<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.330> make<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
generic it can know it can make a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.580 
generic it can know it can make a
mountain<00:00:47.810> river<00:00:48.810> and<00:00:49.790> really<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:51.590> contextual

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
mountain river and really a contextual

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160 
mountain river and really a contextual
that's<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.730> map<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:54.840> there

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that's all the map in it is really there

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
that's all the map in it is really there
for<00:00:55.200> and<00:00:55.680> placing<00:00:56.640> objects<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.410> i'll<00:00:58.940> increase

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
for and placing objects so i'll increase

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
for and placing objects so i'll increase
say<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:01.560> ray<00:01:01.830> tracing<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.870> make<00:01:04.080> few

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
say the ray tracing and just make few

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.249 
say the ray tracing and just make few
mountains<00:01:06.320> just<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:09.259> really

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
mountains just so you can see really

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.840 
mountains just so you can see really
that<00:01:10.740> yeah<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.820> big<00:01:11.999> mums<00:01:13.640> also<00:01:14.640> make

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that yeah can big mums also make

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.010 
that yeah can big mums also make
compared<00:01:15.539> to<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:17.210> around<00:01:18.210> i'll<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
compared to water around i'll make the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.700 
compared to water around i'll make the
small<00:01:19.259> river<00:01:22.549> I<00:01:23.600> think<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.259> also<00:01:25.409> we're

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
small river I think we can also we're

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.440 
small river I think we can also we're
gonna<00:01:25.829> race<00:01:26.009> mountains<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.670> rivers<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.240> well

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
gonna race mountains and rivers as well

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149 
gonna race mountains and rivers as well
by<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> spawn

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
by think I'm think I'm going to spawn

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
by think I'm think I'm going to spawn
there<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.259> have<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.499> free<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.950> some<00:01:32.130> food<00:01:33.229> ok

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
there so I have to free up some food ok

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.450 
there so I have to free up some food ok
so<00:01:35.600> I'm<00:01:36.829> gonna<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:38.039> ahead<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:38.810> make<00:01:39.810> something

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
so I'm gonna go ahead and make something

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.050 
so I'm gonna go ahead and make something
this<00:01:41.460> isn't<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.969> look<00:01:42.149> really<00:01:42.359> good<00:01:42.840> but

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
this isn't going to look really good but

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.840 
this isn't going to look really good but
I'm<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.119> really<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> make<00:01:46.020> e<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:47.549> takes

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
I'm not really going to make e it takes

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.649 
I'm not really going to make e it takes
time<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.539> make<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.289> good<00:01:49.590> map<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.340> really

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
time to make a good map and I'm really

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.739 
time to make a good map and I'm really
not<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> mood<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.139> do<00:01:52.289> that<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.520> I'm<00:01:54.299> just

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
not the mood to do that so I'm just

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.429 
not the mood to do that so I'm just
going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.959> make<00:01:55.079> something<00:01:55.469> that<00:01:55.889> looks<00:01:56.130> like

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
going to make something that looks like

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:06.340 
going to make something that looks like
kind<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.590> lacking<00:01:58.740> that

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.680

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
I don't really wanna BES revit already

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.090 
I don't really wanna BES revit already
bought<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.260> but<00:02:11.450> i'll<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.660> make<00:02:13.290> each<00:02:13.740> map

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
bought this but i'll just make each map

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:24.020 
bought this but i'll just make each map
a<00:02:14.130> little<00:02:14.550> unique<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:15.030> least

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.300 

ok<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.819> thing<00:02:27.000> i'll<00:02:27.090> show<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.360> is

ok but so this thing i'll show you is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.030 
ok but so this thing i'll show you is
texture<00:02:30.020> which<00:02:31.020> where<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.709> have<00:02:31.830> up<00:02:32.010> to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
texture which where we can have up to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.820 
texture which where we can have up to
about<00:02:32.280> five<00:02:32.550> texts<00:02:32.970> /<00:02:33.180> hot<00:02:33.420> map<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
about five texts / hot map and it is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.710 
about five texts / hot map and it is
enough<00:02:38.220> some<00:02:38.790> people<00:02:39.030> think<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.360> need<00:02:39.510> more

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
enough some people think you need more

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.870 
enough some people think you need more
but<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.709> don't<00:02:42.830> i'll<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:44.640> show<00:02:44.850> you

but you really don't i'll just show you
what<00:02:45.090> each<00:02:45.209> different<00:02:45.420> heart<00:02:45.750> then<00:02:45.959> really

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
what each different heart then really

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.229 
what each different heart then really
different<00:02:48.120> paths<00:02:48.420> textures<00:02:52.910> still<00:02:53.910> freeze

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
different paths textures still freeze

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.610 
different paths textures still freeze
make<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.750> real<00:02:54.959> quick<00:02:57.080> why<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.320> see<00:02:58.500> as

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
make this real quick why you can see as

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620 
make this real quick why you can see as
each<00:02:58.860> height<00:02:59.430> map<00:02:59.670> really<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.180> has<00:03:00.330> its<00:03:00.480> own

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
each height map really it has its own

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.140 
each height map really it has its own
essential<00:03:01.200> texture<00:03:02.100> set<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.640> i<00:03:02.670> don't<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
essential texture set so i don't have to

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.140 
essential texture set so i don't have to
be<00:03:03.800> restricted<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.190> five<00:03:05.760> different

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
be restricted to just five different

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.910 
be restricted to just five different
textures<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.690> whole<00:03:06.870> game<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.320> mainly

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
textures for the whole game and mainly

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.949 
textures for the whole game and mainly
time<00:03:08.100> at<00:03:08.310> sort<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.700> 100<00:03:09.360> meters<00:03:09.569> wide<00:03:09.840> i'm

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
time at sort of the 100 meters wide i'm

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:19.520 
time at sort of the 100 meters wide i'm
pretty<00:03:10.200> sure<00:03:11.300> not<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.510> big<00:03:13.340> okay<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.700> as<00:03:18.630> you

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
pretty sure not that big okay so as you

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.160 
pretty sure not that big okay so as you
can<00:03:19.620> see<00:03:19.830> we<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.280> touch<00:03:20.610> really<00:03:21.510> textures

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
can see we can touch really textures

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.190 
can see we can touch really textures
down<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:24.000> i'm<00:03:24.180> going<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.480> remove<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.870> slider

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
down but i'm going to remove this slider

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.880 
down but i'm going to remove this slider
so<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.709> i<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.550> make<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.600> little<00:03:27.750> more

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
so that i can make it a little more

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.039 
so that i can make it a little more
transparent<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.220> little<00:03:29.489> latter<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.600> we

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
transparent and a little latter so we

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:40.830 
transparent and a little latter so we
have<00:03:31.170> brushed<00:03:31.470> elections<00:03:31.950> like<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.549> well

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.130 

yeah<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.930> can<00:03:42.230> pretty<00:03:42.409> much<00:03:42.500> add<00:03:42.769> layers<00:03:43.010> over<00:03:43.250> I

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.289 

can<00:03:48.140> also<00:03:48.290> erase<00:03:48.739> if<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.549> wanted<00:03:49.879> to<00:03:49.939> I<00:03:50.030> can

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
can also erase if I wanted to I can

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.500 
can also erase if I wanted to I can
erase<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.620> button<00:03:51.950> for<00:03:52.069> that<00:03:52.159> as<00:03:52.340> well

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
erase it it's a button for that as well

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.630 
erase it it's a button for that as well
as<00:03:53.510> for<00:03:54.200> here<00:03:54.470> our<00:03:54.620> mounts<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.099> stuff<00:03:55.310> i<00:03:55.459> can

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
as for here our mounts and stuff i can

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.869 
as for here our mounts and stuff i can
add<00:03:55.819> rocks<00:03:56.620> let's<00:03:57.620> make<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:58.010> look<00:03:58.280> more<00:03:58.549> like

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
add rocks let's make it look more like

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.839 
add rocks let's make it look more like
cliffside<00:04:00.010> throws<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.069> lot<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.340> textures<00:04:01.700> we

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
cliffside throws a lot of textures we

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.240 
cliffside throws a lot of textures we
have<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.150> can<00:04:02.269> add<00:04:02.420> many<00:04:03.049> as<00:04:03.200> we<00:04:03.319> want<00:04:03.349> as<00:04:04.010> I

have we can add many as we want as I
said<00:04:04.489> you<00:04:04.640> can<00:04:04.670> only<00:04:04.819> have<00:04:04.970> up<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.329> about<00:04:05.510> 50

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
said you can only have up to about 50

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.170 
said you can only have up to about 50
right<00:04:07.129> now<00:04:07.930> alright<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.230> I'll<00:04:09.819> do<00:04:10.819> what<00:04:11.060> we

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
right now alright so I'll do what we

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.160 
right now alright so I'll do what we
have<00:04:11.359> lost<00:04:11.569> which<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:11.989> added<00:04:12.290> in<00:04:12.379> your<00:04:12.730> objects

what's amounted to Midian it doesn't
actually<00:04:24.860> bag<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.550> game<00:04:25.729> that<00:04:25.970> much<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.630> add

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
actually bag the game that much to add

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.129 
actually bag the game that much to add
some<00:04:27.620> idiot<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.250> can<00:04:28.699> make<00:04:28.850> forest<00:04:29.330> spot<00:04:29.720> we

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
some idiot I can make forest spot we

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.600 
some idiot I can make forest spot we
don't<00:04:30.260> really<00:04:30.410> have<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.650> time<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:31.490> make

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
don't really have the time to make

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:43.720 
don't really have the time to make
forests<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:35.060> I'm<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:35.270> going<00:04:35.389> to<00:04:35.449> add<00:04:35.539> a<00:04:35.600> few

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.580 

you<00:04:44.730> know<00:04:44.880> else<00:04:45.150> not<00:04:45.690> many<00:04:45.840> objects<00:04:46.230> right

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
you know else not many objects right

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.470 
you know else not many objects right
here<00:04:47.070> select<00:04:47.520> from<00:04:47.790> though<00:04:48.000> we<00:04:48.150> have<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> lot<00:04:48.450> of

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
here select from though we have a lot of

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.160 
here select from though we have a lot of
objects<00:04:48.840> made<00:04:49.170> I<00:04:49.550> just<00:04:50.550> move<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.600> intestine

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
objects made I just move the intestine

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.710 
objects made I just move the intestine
so<00:04:52.470> I've<00:04:52.590> never<00:04:52.800> really<00:04:53.070> felt<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.460> need<00:04:53.730> to

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
so I've never really felt the need to

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.960 
so I've never really felt the need to
have<00:04:54.840> any<00:04:54.990> more<00:04:55.200> than<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:58.850> it's<00:04:59.850> not

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
have any more than that so it's not

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.390 
have any more than that so it's not
really<00:05:00.030> much<00:05:00.540> else<00:05:00.600> to<00:05:00.930> do<00:05:01.170> I'm<00:05:02.040> just<00:05:02.190> going<00:05:02.370> to

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
really much else to do I'm just going to

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.680 
really much else to do I'm just going to
go<00:05:02.520> ahead<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.760> save<00:05:03.150> this<00:05:04.850> please<00:05:05.850> watch<00:05:06.420> the
