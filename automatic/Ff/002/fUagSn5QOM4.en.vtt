the<00:00:11.820> way<00:00:11.909> the<00:00:11.940> water<00:00:12.269> flows<00:00:12.629> through<00:00:12.659> it<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.230> lot

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the way the water flows through it a lot

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.169 
the way the water flows through it a lot
of<00:00:13.889> people<00:00:14.190> understand<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.789> once<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
of people understand that once the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.089 
of people understand that once the
static<00:00:15.780> media<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.230> put<00:00:16.439> into<00:00:16.679> the<00:00:16.769> center<00:00:16.949> of

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
static media is put into the center of

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.990 
static media is put into the center of
it<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.550> course<00:00:17.699> you're<00:00:17.910> getting

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
it that of course you're getting

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.480 
it that of course you're getting
mechanical<00:00:18.689> and<00:00:18.840> biological<00:00:19.019> filtration<00:00:19.800> but

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
mechanical and biological filtration but

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
mechanical and biological filtration but
I<00:00:20.519> wanted<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.089> see<00:00:21.300> how<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.529> well

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
I wanted you to see how this is so well

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.200 
I wanted you to see how this is so well
designed<00:00:22.919> in<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> fact<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.179> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
designed in the fact that you have a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.079 
designed in the fact that you have a
vortex<00:00:24.810> settling<00:00:25.199> chamber<00:00:25.589> in<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:26.550> outer<00:00:26.699> so

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
vortex settling chamber in the outer so

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.909 
vortex settling chamber in the outer so
here's<00:00:27.330> how<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> water<00:00:28.050> circulates<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
here's how this water circulates the

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.679 
here's how this water circulates the
water<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> come<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.179> from<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.449> side

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
water is going to come in from this side

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.200 
water is going to come in from this side
over<00:00:30.839> here<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:32.160> circulating<00:00:33.150> around

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
over here and it's circulating around

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.860 
over here and it's circulating around
the<00:00:34.220> outer<00:00:35.220> chamber<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.660> goes<00:00:36.840> through

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the outer chamber and as it goes through

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.740 
the outer chamber and as it goes through
the<00:00:37.080> outer<00:00:37.320> chamber<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:38.100> goes<00:00:38.520> into<00:00:39.030> this

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the outer chamber it goes into this

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
the outer chamber it goes into this
center<00:00:40.080> chamber<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.650> now<00:00:40.830> normally<00:00:41.340> under

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
center chamber here now normally under

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
under regular operation this Center

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.440 
under regular operation this Center
chamber<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.060> be<00:00:45.150> filled<00:00:45.390> with

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
chamber here is going to be filled with

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.220 
chamber here is going to be filled with
static<00:00:45.960> k1<00:00:46.490> bio<00:00:47.490> media<00:00:47.880> and<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
static k1 bio media and that's going to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.450 
static k1 bio media and that's going to
give<00:00:49.380> you<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> mechanical<00:00:50.130> and<00:00:50.280> biological

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
give you a mechanical and biological

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
give you a mechanical and biological
filtration<00:00:51.270> before<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> water<00:00:52.110> goes<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.380> in

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
filtration before the water goes back in

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
filtration before the water goes back in
through<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.220> center<00:00:53.520> tube<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.060> but<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> do

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
through the center tube here but I do

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.030 
through the center tube here but I do
want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.990> point<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.380> something<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
want to point out something it is the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.530 
want to point out something it is the
water<00:00:56.310> goes<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.700> through<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.060> center<00:00:57.270> tube

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
water goes out through the center tube

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.890 
water goes out through the center tube
here<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.830> go<00:00:59.130> at<00:00:59.850> such<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.060> velocity<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
here it can go at such a velocity as you

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.860 
here it can go at such a velocity as you
see<00:01:01.080> here<00:01:01.350> where<00:01:01.950> it's<00:01:02.610> actually<00:01:02.880> oxygenating

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
see here where it's actually oxygenating

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.550 
see here where it's actually oxygenating
the<00:01:03.960> water<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:05.360> taking<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> closer<00:01:06.900> look<00:01:07.080> here

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the water so taking a closer look here

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.010 
the water so taking a closer look here
at<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:10.730> at<00:01:11.730> the<00:01:11.940> vortex<00:01:12.090> settling<00:01:12.720> chamber

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
at the at the vortex settling chamber

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
at the at the vortex settling chamber
may<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.380> pick<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.980> the<00:01:14.190> camera<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.670> very

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
may not pick up on the camera here very

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.670 
may not pick up on the camera here very
well<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:15.870> here<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.230> super

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
well but this water here is super

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
well but this water here is super
oxygenated<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.330> great

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
oxygenated here and that's great

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
oxygenated here and that's great
obviously<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.740> pond<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.640> great<00:01:21.000> for

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
obviously for your pond it's great for

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.990 
obviously for your pond it's great for
the<00:01:21.300> establishment<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.050> beneficial<00:01:22.920> bacteria

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
the establishment of beneficial bacteria

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.300 
the establishment of beneficial bacteria
once<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.210> finds<00:01:24.480> its<00:01:24.690> way<00:01:24.780> into<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.740> center

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
once it finds its way into the center

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.570 
once it finds its way into the center

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
understand you've got three filters in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.320 
understand you've got three filters in
one<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:38.130> vortex<00:01:38.580> settling<00:01:38.970> chamber

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
one you have a vortex settling chamber

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.640 
one you have a vortex settling chamber
you<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.600> mechanical<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.620> a
