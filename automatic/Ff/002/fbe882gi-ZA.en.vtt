00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.530
 good morning, I don't know if you all 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.170
 remember but when I received the 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.540
 package of the kawaii box was me 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.040
 this packet arrived as a snack 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.650
 of a few pandas 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.560
 obviously not only August pandas are al 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.320
 taste cookies and cream then biscuit 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 and cream had in fact said that me 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.840
 would have liked to taste them in a video 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.000
 seeing that I sell them will put them on sale 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 I don't have any on my online store 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 still tasted so maybe you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 I know precisely what you eyes 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:53.570
 I think 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:58.970
 now I go to open them I can do ok 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.970
 ok to the conclusion with all the pandas 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.000
 we want to open them in a way 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 decent maybe ok there or you lose you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.610
 disgust even if used a cutter but 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.659
 oh well then we see a little very hard 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.990
 very good then the stick is at 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.770
 chocolate then there are just there 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:33.750
 hibiscus cream and small pieces of biscuit 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:38.120
 so now I'm going to taste it a lot 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.770
 very good then they are sweeter than 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.330
 of the other few that I have tasted that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
 then they would be those with the biscuit 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.350
 this is normal instead of chocolate and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.110
 so they will have more sweet and cream 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.820
 even more so it makes it sweet 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.440
 but the pieces of have not been heard 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.090
 biscuit because being so many aside 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.140
 crisp interior was not noticed 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.680
 difference 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.680
 try again 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.850
 yes ok there were no cookies in the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.090
 partly moved, so who knows why? 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.689
 I didn't hear it let's try anyone with 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.439
 some great cookies here 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.439
 here are some cookies 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.870
 ok i confirm that these bits of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.480
 cookies and then cookies 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.920
 here too are the sticks 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.280
 however the cream is very good 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.290
 vanilla and I think I wo n't be able to 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.710
 stop me I have to kiss everyone I 'm with 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.720
 yes they are very greedy you feel right there 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.970
 crunchy part and then when there is 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.980
 cream feels a little more aside 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.490
 soft that melts between the teeth and 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.890
 so they are very very good 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.100
 so definitely a good grade I give myself a 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.820
 good grade even if not by the votes but ok 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:56.020
 they are very good girls consider me 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.300
 try them are really very good too 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.780
 because I was used to those mikado ones 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.210
 however, these are very good Italian 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.180
 more good from this taste should 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.420
 make them kind of other a mikado type deal 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.790
 ok enough to say crap i hope there is 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.650
 been a bit useful this video are 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.420
 really good with still for one 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.420
 time and I greet you bye
