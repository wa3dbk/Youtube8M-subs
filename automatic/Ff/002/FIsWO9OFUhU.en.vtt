00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello i go from tablet ii and that 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.269
 Here are the two highlights of the ifa 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.630
 for me once that sony x10 lens 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.950
 and once that sony 600 and this one 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.870
 I will navigate both for you 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 to compare 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.180
 so here at x10 this is here 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.230
 so to speak the smaller power zoom and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.230
 that's it 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.620
 it is clearly wide-angle here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.220
 a few details 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.280
 that starts here at 44 5 millimeters 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.600
 and goes to 44 film in total so 10 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.580
 optical zoom and here at the carl 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 zeiss objective So you see it already 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.360
 is about quality 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.510
 then we have once from 10 4 to 37 1 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 mm so it already starts I mean quite 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.570
 as far as really and then looking too 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.150
 so do not be so far I guess 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.309
 that will only 3 to 5 times magnification 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.839
 its here it is first stop really 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 Ten times the googles 10 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.800
 otherwise yes connection technical 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.530
 the two identical we have here 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.840
 fc the on and off switch 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.980
 stereomicrophone then of course here the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.750
 then press this button 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.850
 micro-usb connection behind it hides 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.550
 a micro usb connection and the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.180
 micro sd card this is hidden here 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.800
 at the course 10 under the battery and that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.820
 directly under the battery is at both 600 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.730
 billion hours 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.100
 that does not mean days here 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.380
 willingness to expect but so for 100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 I should think about 150 pictures 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.060
 already quite enough 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.160
 it will be both here 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 snapped I have that time here 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.330
 to samsung galaxy s here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.070
 and you can already see the difference 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.729
 that eat 600 much wider 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.500
 and just stops off with 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.290
 say we wait in a moment 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.330
 the software and I tell times 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.310
 something to make quite wrong 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.259
 when you see it just goes out and 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.600
 that's just in the extended 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.220
 condition clearly further the nfc 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.740
 you then connect with the premium 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.900
 Of course, reset also has the whole thing here 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.420
 still 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.370
 should not connect me however 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.440
 and you can see extended 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.319
 this is clearly a significant 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.720
 difference so if you are here 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:40.130
 connected 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:43.110
 then you can already see the picture and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.200
 another difference is once we have 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.820
 here a blind from 2.2 to 59 each 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.420
 on in which we Stuke us 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.660
 are located 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.200
 at project 100 is his plans of 18 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.360
 until 49 so the fires always clear 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.060
 Light stronger, especially at 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.510
 taken in the dark one 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.920
 This is an enormous benefit overall 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.230
 zeiss objective of course again 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.120
 high quality and we can 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.420
 so here too hangzhou must 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.330
 Do not push the engine here as you feel 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.220
 it also depends on it 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.370
 plastic like this 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.060
 so have an optical steadyshot one 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.670
 optical image stabilization and times 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.110
 look at that now slowly 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.120
 Connectedness as I said these are here 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.590
 a lot of wlan networks that we too 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.730
 some problems have tried that one 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.730
 to connect again 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.040
 So changed the app awarded opened 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.870
 you see he is looking for we have here 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.230
 a total of three lenses in the vicinity 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.489
 are already some here in action 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.340
 then you stop that here once 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.230
 and see what the picture here 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.269
 the image is transmitted becomes relative 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.750
 transferred quickly and it is also right 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.459
 liquid as you may see so me 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.500
 think back and forth a bit here and there 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.659
 you can see it is relatively fluid 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.229
 So I can go in here again and 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.760
 Consumption and you can see it works 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.979
 not so far as I'll show you right now 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.780
 it's about 10 36 10 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.000
 but the advantage therefore really this 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.400
 Huge light you can see is also 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.820
 it is not quite ready and I really 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.449
 Just show you the x10 im now 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.449
 comparison 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.889
 we'll snap that in for a moment 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.919
 deppendorf that one communicated that 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.719
 trade related so you can be relative 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.119
 just switch back and forth if now 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.439
 at this objective has and you see 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:55.689
 This time it was much faster 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.679
 with the pulse 10 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.229
 and we are just looking for it 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:01.459
 and then you'll probably see it soon 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.860
 this is a pensioner goes well 

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:06.830
 faster and it is also clear 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.139
 Continue to zoom in and zoom in 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.419
 and much less is it 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.849
 disadvantage the lens is not quite so 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:19.189
 as bright as the higgs 800 100 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:23.479
 we are priced at 200 euro here 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:25.909
 the war 100 will be about 400-450 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.189
 Just fit zeiss 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:32.110
 objectively this is really high quality 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.110
 around this extreme light intensity has 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.949
 otherwise this is more of the 

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:39.919
 allrounder this is him 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.529
 the luxury version also the sensor is a 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.409
 a bit bigger and just offers 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:49.059
 a best picture quality and i believe 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:51.050
 Also more megapixels are around 20 so 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:55.879
 So that's the difference between 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.379
 the x10 and the pieks 100 i hope so 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.579
 video you liked if yes then give 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.779
 subscribed me a thumbs weeks ago 

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:01.550
 channel and tell me down in the 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:03.979
 comments which one will you 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.499
 buy 10 or 100th war 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.829
 in a fantastic many witty to for thanks 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.829
 see
