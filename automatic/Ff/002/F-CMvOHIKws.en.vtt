showing you guys how I clean all of my

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.440 
showing you guys how I clean all of my
brushes<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.839> I<00:00:06.839> usually<00:00:07.470> try<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.919> do<00:00:08.220> this

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
brushes and I usually try to do this

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.070 
brushes and I usually try to do this
quite<00:00:09.450> often<00:00:09.740> but<00:00:10.740> sometimes<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.080> get

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
quite often but sometimes I just get

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.250 
quite often but sometimes I just get
lazy<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.920> don't<00:00:13.950> feel<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.370> doing<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.820> I

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
lazy and I don't feel like doing it so I

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.109 
lazy and I don't feel like doing it so I
thought<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.740> time<00:00:17.190> because<00:00:17.640> these<00:00:17.850> brushes

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
thought it is time because these brushes

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.890 
thought it is time because these brushes
are<00:00:18.570> needing<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.529> good<00:00:19.830> cleaning<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.720> is

makeup<00:00:31.289> brushes<00:00:31.590> they<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:33.239> bacteria

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
makeup brushes they do get bacteria

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.110 
makeup brushes they do get bacteria
buildup<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.700> don't<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
buildup in them and you don't want to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.240 
buildup in them and you don't want to
spread<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> bacteria<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.170> face<00:00:37.559> because

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
spread the bacteria on your face because

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
spread the bacteria on your face because
then<00:00:38.370> you'll<00:00:38.520> cause<00:00:38.700> more<00:00:38.910> breakouts<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
then you'll cause more breakouts and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
then you'll cause more breakouts and
that<00:00:40.590> kind<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> stuff<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.399> really

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that kind of stuff so it is really

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.860 
that kind of stuff so it is really
really<00:00:41.790> important<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> keep<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:42.450> brushes

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.189 
start out I just use this Johnson's baby
shampoo<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.809> light

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
shampoo and it's just a really light

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
shampoo and it's just a really light
shampoo<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.219> clean<00:00:56.460> my<00:00:56.550> brushes<00:00:56.730> with

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
shampoo that I clean my brushes with

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.180 
shampoo that I clean my brushes with
because<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.899> baby<00:00:58.109> shampoo<00:00:58.350> therefore<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
because it's baby shampoo therefore it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.590 
because it's baby shampoo therefore it
doesn't<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.520> any<00:00:59.670> harsh<00:00:59.879> chemicals<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.480> it

doesn't have any harsh chemicals in it

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
doesn't have any harsh chemicals in it
and<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.219> clean<00:01:02.550> them<00:01:02.730> and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
do it and watch all the makeup that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:58.110 
do it and watch all the makeup that
comes<00:03:05.840> out<00:03:06.050> of<00:03:06.140> my<00:03:06.230> brushes

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.210 

so<00:03:59.120> once<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.660> have<00:03:59.840> all<00:03:59.870> of<00:04:00.200> my<00:04:00.320> brushes<00:04:00.530> done

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
so once I have all of my brushes done

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.330 
so once I have all of my brushes done
this<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:02.330> all<00:04:03.020> these<00:04:03.560> two<00:04:03.770> are<00:04:03.980> my<00:04:04.100> glitter

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
this is all these two are my glitter

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.520 
this is all these two are my glitter
brushes<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.360> they're<00:04:05.780> kind<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:05.960> impossible<00:04:06.260> to

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
brushes so they're kind of impossible to

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.500 
brushes so they're kind of impossible to
clean<00:04:07.040> because<00:04:07.220> there's<00:04:07.640> clutter<00:04:07.910> stuck<00:04:08.300> in

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
clean because there's clutter stuck in

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.010 
clean because there's clutter stuck in
them<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.110> glue<00:04:09.500> but<00:04:10.340> anyway<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.330> these<00:04:11.720> are

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
them and glue but anyway so these are

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.900 
them and glue but anyway so these are
the<00:04:12.260> finished<00:04:12.440> brushes<00:04:12.920> what<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.310> do<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:13.880> just

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
the finished brushes what I do is I just

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.210 
the finished brushes what I do is I just
lay<00:04:14.300> them<00:04:14.480> out<00:04:14.630> so<00:04:15.140> they're<00:04:15.320> laying<00:04:15.590> upward

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
lay them out so they're laying upward

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.070 
lay them out so they're laying upward
like<00:04:16.610> the<00:04:16.790> bristles<00:04:17.150> are<00:04:17.239> facing<00:04:17.600> down<00:04:17.810> so

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
like the bristles are facing down so

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.370 
like the bristles are facing down so
that<00:04:18.709> way<00:04:18.920> the<00:04:19.250> water<00:04:19.459> doesn't<00:04:19.790> drip<00:04:20.239> em<00:04:20.480> into

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
that way the water doesn't drip em into

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.540 
that way the water doesn't drip em into
the<00:04:21.680> glue<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.820> in<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:24.220> two-part<00:04:25.220> whatever

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
the glue that in the two-part whatever

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.670 
the glue that in the two-part whatever
you<00:04:25.640> call<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:25.850> so<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.870> way<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.470> water

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
you call it so that way the water

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.080 
you call it so that way the water
doesn't<00:04:28.040> get<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.340> there<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.760> then<00:04:28.970> your

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
doesn't get in there and then your

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.210 
doesn't get in there and then your
bristles<00:04:29.450> will<00:04:29.600> start<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.900> fall<00:04:30.050> out<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.470> just

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
bristles will start to fall out and just

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.620 
bristles will start to fall out and just
not<00:04:31.580> good<00:04:31.760> things<00:04:31.940> are<00:04:32.060> going<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.270> happen<00:04:32.510> you
