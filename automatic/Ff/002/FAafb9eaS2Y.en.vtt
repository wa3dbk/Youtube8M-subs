 accordion of andrés landero landero 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.620
 he played walk and everything but he absorbed 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.620
 la caixa and gives it a different style 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.560
 the most authentic cumbia they respect 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.070
 email cut in you is the cumbia that 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.470
 emanating from andrés landeros marital 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.130
 American when it hit the two bombs 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.670

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.130
 the house she was from and that 's been killed 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.690
 understands the press and the radio because everything 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.640
 what they play in cumbia they try to imitate 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.530
 is the style of André Landero who created 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.280
 its own asset derived from the 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.280
 pipers of san hyacinth 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:08.480
