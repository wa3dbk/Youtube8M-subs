 enough of the car even though it does not 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.400

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.730
 I came back here 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.680
 the track has already been invoked if 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.780
 say that we will have performance here 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.290
 our habit year is a car is fast 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.760
 man I only knew I thought so much 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.840
 old man leaving the camera that 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.920
 distant will not give to you 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.799

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.299
 coolest and then I come back here day 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.430
 makes the way more straw to measure 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.790
 take the traffic and the cars all of them 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.170
 have a car you want that you always like 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.940
 a car that disturbed 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.670
 suddenly the front of the car has a motor 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:55.489
 here calmly so as not to fall good and 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.329
 here we see two ways of 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.130
 beat 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.530
 lie right-left path 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.720
 You must want to do it after the day, I go. 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.359
 here the right because it is cooler 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.829
 on top has a pretty fucking effect that the 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.290
 dude did 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.329
 then you want me to link you 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.769
 this track than in the description of another 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.750
 Any video why that's even 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.209
 I'll put it on and see what I'm talking about 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.519
 guys look at that effect very very much 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.680
 fuck to put the type more flames 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.570
 a fire coming out here we go 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.970
 For him the car does not catch fire this is the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.630
 More cool is just 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.210
 face 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.530
 our cargo or not here from the front 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.100
 bout nÃ© 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.910
 whoa saw said it sent the guy goin 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.930
 Working photo has long been kneaded but 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.070
 the way you want to do a test here 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.870
 You stopped even the city is empty. 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.910
 because I took the traffic you talk 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.160
 this is also another way I have 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.530
 here where it exploded, damn it, we'll ask the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.520
 car here to see how it is 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.100
 exploded kinear only the ashes of the carcass 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.700
 it is the way of them can have upon 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.640
 it is broken but burnt by the 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.710
 Anyway, I will not be back so soon. 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.260
 I'll take it by day and get back on track. 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.880

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.120
 first thought nor will we see how it is 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.500
 is driving this car here first 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.060
 person can see if it really 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.100
 It's difficult to see why 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.680
 part of teaching that both the 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.480
 people are going to try it, my love. 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.740
 the other taking care of it on the way to 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.090
 left or right side of the fire 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.110
 because I want to show you the other 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.150
 path should have tried the type is 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.010
 pass the first person fire call 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.740

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.730
 person to get anything here to watch 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.110

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.840
 gt so when released for pc and 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.370
 care and performance can see that 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.750
 it's a bet 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.580
