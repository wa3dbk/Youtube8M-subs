 pokatushkami and serious cars 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.460
 simulators blur every year 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.829
 more and more 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.810
 the developers are well aware of the fact 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.579
 that auto sims are much more boring to play 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.579
 rather than in arcades and no matter how much 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.860
 realistic are aspects plus need 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.809
 aim for a wider audience not 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.270
 everyone likes to set up an hour each

 guys are slightly mad studios found 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 middle ground when simulator 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.329
 becomes really interesting but in 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.160
 same time without going too far with 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 Do you arcade success of such 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:58.020
 compromise now tell the very first 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.450
 this is the most polished racing game 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.399
 for several years while the cat 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.930
 masters struggling to twist 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.939
 f1 engine to the modern level 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.649
 slightly mad just competently perry 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.110
 collected engine that works at times 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.000
 better under the hood of the project cars and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.890
 engine madness engine which was 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 nedforspid shift providing 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.850
 extreme detail of each machine 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.200
 and the tracks are really true 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 just play on 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 maximum settings in 4 key as well as 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.039
 any self-respecting racing simulator 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.529
 project cars will not forgive errors 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.270
 one even the smallest before 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:32.429
 get behind the wheel need at least the minimum 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.649
 experience in racing especially if you are going 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.810
 play on the gamepad can not just 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.459
 go with your feet choose a random hurts and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 win just a ride wild 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.630
 screams from point a to point b 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.229
 turning the steering wheel back and forth project cars 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.229
 not about that 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.630
 35 tracks in the game are as famous 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.580
 like you and Artem Karl azure 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.920

 everything from weather to race time 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.860
 so we made sure that there is present 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.270
 the most realistic rain of all which 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.520
 we have ever seen in games 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.290
 also in project cars you walk on 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.990
 car legends such as 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.820

 rivals number of laps and racing 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.709
 sessions select the date and time of the start of the race

 You can choose how it will be 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.230
 change the weather during the race 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.360
 slightly mad studios moved away from 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.730
 standard options like cloudy dry 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.620
 rain and give players a choice of dynamic 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.330
 weather changes that you can 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.459
 select multiple fields in the tab 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.900
 conditions the weather on the track will be 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.300
 change according to the parameters you set 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.860
 when choosing the type of tire is not worth 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.440
 forget that in different parts of the track 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.660
 there may be different weather sometimes a and 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.190
 racers are too violently attacking crashing 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.140
 you or cuts off the race 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.180
 if you overtake on the circle slow 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.160
 the car is sure that the road is not for you 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.170
 give way and should always look in 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.060
 rearview mirror is quite possible that 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.430
 the opponent will overtake you dangerous 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.200
 maneuvering on the track you can't 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.540
 let the car on the track at once two 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.489
 prototype classes and jets in the project 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.560

 quite extensive though it is no one 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.380
 not surprised 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.120
 project cars turned out really 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.829
 the most beautiful race for pis rank 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.579
 the best benchmark on the tracks to her 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.500
 provided 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.359
 but that didn't make her unique 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.760
 almost every racing game takes 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.540
 some niche and almost every has its own 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.459
 feature 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.739

 Give realism to all fields 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.320

 extreme asphalt 8 on mobile 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.990
 platforms 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.020
 all that does not concern the graphics in the game 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.880
 done at a fairly acceptable level 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.250
 project cars is not the fact that no 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.740
 game and not bad and not too good 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.820
 so the game gets us 8 points from 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.979
 10 possible 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.960
