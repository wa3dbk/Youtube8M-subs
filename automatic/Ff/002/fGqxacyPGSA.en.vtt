and we're making water photo waterfalls
and<00:02:17.350> grapples<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.770> did<00:02:19.460> not<00:02:19.550> mean<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:19.940> that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and grapples I did not mean to do that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.410 
and grapples I did not mean to do that
and<00:02:22.370> we<00:02:22.580> do<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.970> this

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.120 

more<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:30.849> now<00:02:31.849> we<00:02:31.910> get<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.239> other<00:02:32.540> direction

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
more this now we get the other direction

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.809 
more this now we get the other direction
which<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.459> way<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:35.230> was<00:02:36.230> not<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:38.330> way

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
which is this way I was not this way

continue our journey towards the Holy
Grail<00:02:57.850> because<00:02:58.850> that's<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.209> cool<00:02:59.390> place<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.660> go

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
Grail because that's a cool place to go

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.610 
Grail because that's a cool place to go
I<00:03:02.650> take<00:03:03.650> some<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.490> can't<00:03:05.210> see<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:08.620> some

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
I take some of this I can't see and some

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:19.210 
I take some of this I can't see and some
of<00:03:09.650> this

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:29.270 

this<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:23.050> go<00:03:24.050> one<00:03:24.350> more

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.920 

this<00:03:30.280> graphics<00:03:30.790> probably<00:03:31.090> isn't<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:31.390> good<00:03:31.600> I

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
this graphics probably isn't that good I

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:44.000 
this graphics probably isn't that good I
didn't<00:03:32.440> work<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:32.890> very<00:03:33.070> long<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.550> guess<00:03:42.330> so

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
didn't work on it very long I guess so

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.660 
didn't work on it very long I guess so
moving<00:03:45.010> along<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.350> Mary<00:03:50.620> bow<00:03:50.950> around

moving along and the Mary bow around

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:00.810 
moving along and the Mary bow around
here<00:03:52.480> we<00:03:52.660> go<00:03:52.840> round<00:03:56.400> mm-hmm<00:03:59.400> let's<00:04:00.400> hurry<00:04:00.730> it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
here we go round mm-hmm let's hurry it

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.770 
here we go round mm-hmm let's hurry it
up<00:04:01.200> moltov<00:04:02.200> I'm<00:04:03.100> talking<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.700> myself<00:04:03.880> all

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
up moltov I'm talking to myself all

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.520 
up moltov I'm talking to myself all
right<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:06.010> that's<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.430> now<00:04:07.300> we<00:04:07.360> save<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:10.570> we

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
right and that's it now we save and we

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.780 
right and that's it now we save and we
go<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.739> Z<00:04:12.430> Ness<00:04:13.230> pick<00:04:14.230> up<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.739> controller<00:04:15.190> and

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
go to Z Ness pick up the controller and

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.699 
go to Z Ness pick up the controller and
we<00:04:16.180> get<00:04:16.359> ready<00:04:16.540> it's<00:04:16.810> probably<00:04:17.049> going<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.440> lag

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
we get ready it's probably going to lag

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.200 
we get ready it's probably going to lag
