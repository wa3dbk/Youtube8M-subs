00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 good we moment in your snacks and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.160
 until the same daily video and today I'm 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.529
 here as you are seeing in the title yes 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.500
 sir is double swarm is without dying 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 besides and without killing anyone the truth is 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 I climbed a swarm without killing anyone 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.859
 how good you started criticizing me 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 saying no uncle you killed with 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.689
 the dogs that this does not count that good 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.519
 What I interpreted was that there would be no 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.039
 to kill with the weapon and in this case not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.380
 killed in no time with the squat 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 riots or not with the knife I that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 I know with a shocked now something by 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.719
 the style then I decided good come 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.100
 let's repeat what we do not like anything 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.980
 and that surely we can leave until 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.050
 better and it's like that did not come out it 's better in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 this case I got and good in general 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.809
 we get the subscriber team and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.640
 I get two swarms without dying 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.289
 and without killing anyone simply by catching 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.660
 good plates maybe the second 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.090
 swarm itself that killed some with 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 some casualties I do with the first 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.680
 swarm but well that we do not expect 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 that nobody gets angry or criticizes me for 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.180
 that and I hope you value the good that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.480
 it costs quite a bit to swarm without 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.340
 kill nobody and many will say uncle abyss 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.080
 a swarm without killing anyone good 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.270
 as you know in low confirmed if 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 you get a sheet they give you 100 points and if 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.140
 do not get it good, they give us none 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.380
 just the low you will have done that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.760
 it's 50 so this is one more way 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.290
 important to play the goal that is 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.750
 here to what is coming in this game 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.540
 basically it 's the most important thing to play 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.730
 the objective to catch the plates to catch the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.450
 flags that are going to give you many more 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.610
 points provided that simply killing 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530
 other than doing assists for 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.170
 example so good in this case I'm 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.510
 using the gusts of those pm and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.670
 swarm so he did not kill anyone and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.950
 right here it already falls in a 30 minute 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 seconds practically the first 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.150
 swarm and now it starts to kill what 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.190
 better I make a pair of casualties or I do not know 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.110
 how many exactly with this swarm 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.120
 to get the next streak 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.220
 so maybe criticize me a little 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.290
 that's why but I hope it does not happen 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.940
 nothing that you see that they are all taking 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.640
 badges that in no time killed 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.130
 nobody with the gun and well this is more 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 a way to incite them to you from 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.039
 that you play more to the goal that is something 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.500
 that comes to this game 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.200
 you have already seen that pinching badges 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.150
 you will say uncle bishnoi or no no I do not know what 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.219
 I do in this game I do not have something that 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.239
 I do not get any streak and good what 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.650
 happens in this game is that you have to 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.620
 play it different you have to play at 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.420
 target you have to play not so much for 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 they were like others who say it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.470
 I had to go kill aa massacring 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.900
 get it was called to powder like that 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.569
 no no no you have to play as a team you have to 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.819
 play to win the game and well like that or 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.609
 will leave games with more results 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.560
 bulging with easier gusts of 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.810
 take out and right here and I take out the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.310
 next uve sat and then the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.680
 next swarm but good 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.810
 also add the ones that I 'm left with nothing to 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.419
 nothing, it seems to me that one or two 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.099
 veneers as much of the next swarm 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.859
 from the third swarm I think there would be 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.040
 been too three swarms I do not have 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.169
 thought to make some kind swarm alone 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.000
 for four or something because maybe 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.489
 some of you also know me by 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.319
 typical rather than more do not forgive the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.310
 typical nuclear that the modern 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.970
 warfare two axentes makes the 4th 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.890
 fragmentation also take me out the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.830
 good fragmentation there finish 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.069
 second swarm and good just now 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.750
 the next streak begins to come 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.240
 swarm of the third that I stay like 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.670
 I already told you one or two badges like 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.290
 a lot of getting me out there are some moments 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.150
 tense like this where I get lost 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.640
 I was just playing with subscribers 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.050
 as you are seeing and the truth that I 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.060
 like a lot to play with you already 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.370
 that you propose me many challenges and how 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.530
 I said before I took nuclear with 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.020
 quite difficult things quite rare 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.270
 things that are not seen every day and 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.980
 then that is why we already propose 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.840
 tell me in the comments if 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.660
 you want some challenge that you would like to see 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.940
 by the channel it has occurred to me also 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.550
 swarms only four swarms ago and 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.709
 tomahawk guide something like that and the 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.450
 truth is always something that is not usually 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.010
 see every day instead of games 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.800
 that ends up being always try 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.110
 the same and good also if you remember 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.090
 of modern warfare 3 I did things too 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.100
 different as for example take me out 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.470
 the assistance is that if you have not 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.390
 seen around there you will have it 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.070
 quite pretty good because not many 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.780
 people have taken off can boast 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.220
 of it and the truth is that when 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.610
 accounts with a good team 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.870
 almost everything is usually easy to pull out like this 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.900
 I always recommend that you play 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.520
 with friends with people that you know 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.680
 because this is a game like many 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.330
 They say maybe to make friends but 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.580
 in the end what they end up doing all the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.490
 world is to insult yourself among them because 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.190
 just like we are united by this game in 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.840
 common because many people friends who 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.990
 you have surely play this game 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.500
 also up rivals because the truth 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.150
 this is based simply on killing the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.740
 others and can lead to many 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.710
 clashes so I hope not 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.930
 happen that in your case and good ya 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.310
 I'm going to leave and you see that right now 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.040
 I'm going to get out of nowhere 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.570
 The following vee satÃ© the third and without 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.880
 kill anyone there you are seeing that already 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.650
 I take it out and well I hope that I have 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.370
 liked the video that you value the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.440
 effort that is to get this this double 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.510
 almost triple swarm as you will see 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.820
 now that I have nothing left without killing 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.090
 nobody catching at the end of the game 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.919
 I think it ended up taking 51 sheets bone 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.180
 look right here in killed one with ha 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.640
 shocked now he was very sensitive 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.060
 uncle so I apologize for it already 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.919
 you have seen 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.480
 the first swarms are totally 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.370
 legal so I hope there is not 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.650
 no criticism for them and now it's the 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.760
 moment when they are going to kill me so 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.280
 what I said, I hope you liked the 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.840
 kilo vote that you go through the video 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.520
 tomorrow it's going to be pretty good and 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.600
 see you in the next cracks a greeting 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.600
 and even then bye
