underneath<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.230> Marianas<00:01:05.980> plate<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.490> seems

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
underneath the Marianas plate it seems

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.760 
underneath the Marianas plate it seems
to<00:01:06.910> be<00:01:07.060> around<00:01:07.330> 11,000<00:01:08.200> meters<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.710> is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
to be around 11,000 meters and is

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.010

trenches seven miles deep and it's 21
miles<00:01:15.040> straight<00:01:15.430> out<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:15.820> why<00:01:16.090> does<00:01:16.510> this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
miles straight out so why does this

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.450 
miles straight out so why does this
expedition<00:01:17.200> want<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:17.740> reach<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.070> lowest

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
less than fifteen thousand years that is

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.410 
less than fifteen thousand years that is
really<00:01:32.140> pushing<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.619> limits<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.640> we<00:01:34.150> needed<00:01:34.360> a

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
really pushing the limits so we needed a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.120 
really pushing the limits so we needed a
campaign<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.960> also<00:01:35.259> pushes<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.680> limits<00:01:35.950> if

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
campaign it also pushes the limits if

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.760 
campaign it also pushes the limits if
this<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.240> really<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.600> lowest<00:01:37.900> price<00:01:38.440> possible

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
this is really the lowest price possible

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.640 
this is really the lowest price possible
for<00:01:39.670> Nava<00:01:40.000> Romeo<00:01:40.330> then<00:01:40.990> maybe<00:01:41.259> we<00:01:41.470> should

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
for Nava Romeo then maybe we should

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.620 
for Nava Romeo then maybe we should
place<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> poster<00:01:42.460> on<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.700> lowest<00:01:43.450> place

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
place a poster on the lowest place

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.720 
place a poster on the lowest place
possible<00:01:44.110> so<00:01:44.650> they<00:01:44.860> came<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.220> me<00:01:45.370> with<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
possible so they came to me with the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.180 
possible so they came to me with the
crazy<00:01:46.180> idea<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.630> put<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.900> billboard<00:01:47.190> 11,000

the<00:02:26.430> ocean<00:02:26.790> there<00:02:27.720> are<00:02:27.870> some<00:02:28.020> problems<00:02:28.290> our

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
the ocean there are some problems our

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.160 
the ocean there are some problems our
crew<00:02:28.920> will<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.550> overcome<00:02:29.930> now<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.050> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
crew will have to overcome now if you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.590 
crew will have to overcome now if you
are<00:02:31.320> at<00:02:31.440> 11,000<00:02:32.310> meters<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.570> a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
are at 11,000 meters then you have a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.370 
are at 11,000 meters then you have a
pressure<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:34.800> one<00:02:35.280> 1,000<00:02:36.209> bars<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:37.230> will

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
pressure of about one 1,000 bars it will

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.130 
pressure of about one 1,000 bars it will
be<00:02:37.500> crushed<00:02:37.739> between<00:02:37.890> his<00:02:38.400> body<00:02:38.660> after<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.900> few

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
be crushed between his body after a few

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
be crushed between his body after a few
meetings<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.800> became<00:02:41.220> immediately<00:02:41.580> clear

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
meetings it became immediately clear

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.420 
meetings it became immediately clear
that<00:02:42.330> we<00:02:42.450> would<00:02:42.600> face<00:02:42.810> some<00:02:43.020> difficulties<00:02:43.430> how

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that we would face some difficulties how

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.370 
that we would face some difficulties how
to<00:02:44.489> design<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:45.180> panel<00:02:45.540> or<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> billboard<00:02:45.930> that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
to design a panel or a billboard that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.290 
to design a panel or a billboard that
could<00:02:46.680> resist<00:02:46.950> thousand<00:02:47.610> times<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> air

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
could resist thousand times the air

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.600 
could resist thousand times the air
pressure<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.290> we<00:02:49.380> decided<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:50.070> construct<00:02:50.340> it

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
pressure so we decided to construct it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.250 
pressure so we decided to construct it
in<00:02:50.700> stainless<00:02:50.970> steel<00:02:51.150> instead<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.019> aluminium

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
in stainless steel instead of aluminium

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.320 
in stainless steel instead of aluminium
for<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.070> thing<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.550> implode<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.090> itself

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
for this thing not to implode on itself

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.410 
for this thing not to implode on itself
we<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.260> drill<00:02:55.470> holes<00:02:55.680> along<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.519> side<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
we have to drill holes along the side to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.360 
we have to drill holes along the side to
make<00:02:57.450> sure<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.959> water<00:02:58.170> fills<00:02:58.530> up<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.220> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
make sure the water fills up so it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.670 
make sure the water fills up so it
doesn't<00:02:59.730> collapse<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.269> itself<00:03:00.600> down<00:03:01.110> seven

doesn't collapse on itself down seven
miles<00:03:01.890> there's<00:03:02.190> gonna<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> lot<00:03:02.550> of<00:03:02.610> pressure

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
miles there's gonna be a lot of pressure

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.380
