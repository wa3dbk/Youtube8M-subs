it<00:04:40.210> about<00:04:41.070> some<00:04:42.070> have<00:04:42.280> pointed<00:04:43.240> out<00:04:43.360> that<00:04:43.420> it

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
it about some have pointed out that it

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.860 
it about some have pointed out that it
costs<00:04:44.410> money<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.010> are<00:04:45.670> saying<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.570> perhaps

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
costs money and are saying that perhaps

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.960 
costs money and are saying that perhaps
we<00:04:47.110> should<00:04:47.320> be<00:04:47.470> fixing<00:04:47.860> other<00:04:48.040> roles<00:04:48.400> before

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
we should be fixing other roles before

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.070 
we should be fixing other roles before
this<00:04:49.390> one<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.340> argument<00:04:51.760> today<00:04:52.120> or

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
this one is that the argument today or

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.950 
this one is that the argument today or
is<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.890> argument<00:04:54.430> above<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:55.030> fundamental

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
is the argument above a fundamental

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.680 
is the argument above a fundamental
logic<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:57.100> you<00:04:57.250> don't<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:57.820> cyclists<00:04:58.540> on

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
logic that you don't like cyclists on

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.780 
logic that you don't like cyclists on
the<00:04:58.960> roads<00:04:59.200> why<00:04:59.770> don't<00:05:00.010> we<00:05:00.130> be<00:05:00.280> honest<00:05:00.640> about

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
the roads why don't we be honest about

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.950 
the roads why don't we be honest about
that<00:05:01.150> if<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.450> is<00:05:02.940> now<00:05:03.940> council<00:05:04.390> array<00:05:04.660> has

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
that if it is now council array has

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.220 
that if it is now council array has
worked<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:05.590> into<00:05:05.950> his<00:05:06.100> equation<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:07.230> he

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
worked this into his equation and he

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.140 
worked this into his equation and he
must<00:05:08.470> be<00:05:08.620> patted<00:05:09.010> on<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.130> back<00:05:09.250> for<00:05:09.820> doing

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
must be patted on the back for doing

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
must be patted on the back for doing
that<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:11.230> takes<00:05:11.410> work<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:12.100> be<00:05:12.850> able<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.210> put

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
that and it takes work to be able to put

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.610 
that and it takes work to be able to put
this<00:05:14.380> into<00:05:14.650> any<00:05:14.950> equation<00:05:15.870> to<00:05:16.870> try<00:05:17.170> and<00:05:17.410> get

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
this into any equation to try and get

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.390 
this into any equation to try and get
lanes<00:05:18.040> cycle<00:05:19.030> lanes<00:05:19.270> in<00:05:19.900> your<00:05:20.170> communities<00:05:20.770> is

lanes cycle lanes in your communities is

lanes cycle lanes in your communities is
a<00:05:21.430> hard<00:05:21.760> task<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.930> so<00:05:23.650> might<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.400> be<00:05:24.790> that<00:05:25.210> some

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
a hard task and so might it be that some

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.480 
a hard task and so might it be that some
other<00:05:25.630> councillors<00:05:26.230> don't<00:05:26.800> want<00:05:27.070> to<00:05:27.160> work<00:05:27.310> as

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.299 
in a Tobago he never sees any any
cyclists<00:06:45.520> oh<00:06:46.740> yeah<00:06:47.740> I<00:06:47.919> do

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:48.309 
cyclists oh yeah I do

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:52.140 
cyclists oh yeah I do
yeah<00:06:49.210> you<00:06:49.990> know<00:06:50.050> and<00:06:50.439> and<00:06:50.800> I<00:06:51.129> think<00:06:51.430> most<00:06:51.729> of<00:06:51.969> us

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
yeah you know and and I think most of us

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.689 
yeah you know and and I think most of us
do<00:06:52.389> that<00:06:52.629> are<00:06:52.779> in<00:06:52.900> the<00:06:53.020> West<00:06:53.259> districts<00:06:53.949> and<00:06:54.520> I

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699 
do that are in the West districts and I

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.429 
do that are in the West districts and I
don't<00:06:54.759> know<00:06:55.150> where<00:06:55.389> that's<00:06:55.509> coming<00:06:55.689> from

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:56.439 
don't know where that's coming from

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.790 
don't know where that's coming from
perhaps<00:06:56.889> the<00:06:57.819> cyclists<00:06:58.539> that<00:06:58.689> aren't<00:06:59.169> there

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
perhaps the cyclists that aren't there

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.459 
perhaps the cyclists that aren't there
get<00:07:00.249> the<00:07:00.430> feeling<00:07:00.819> that<00:07:01.599> the<00:07:01.749> politicians

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:02.469 
get the feeling that the politicians

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:04.260 
get the feeling that the politicians
don't<00:07:02.830> want<00:07:03.039> them<00:07:03.400> there<00:07:03.610> and<00:07:03.819> that's

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
don't want them there and that's

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.879 
don't want them there and that's
probably<00:07:04.659> why<00:07:05.050> they're<00:07:05.229> not<00:07:05.379> using<00:07:05.620> our

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:05.889 
probably why they're not using our

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.999 
probably why they're not using our
streets<00:07:06.279> I<00:07:06.610> say<00:07:07.270> something<00:07:07.749> different<00:07:08.229> I<00:07:08.439> say

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
streets I say something different I say

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.980 
streets I say something different I say
let's<00:07:09.279> make<00:07:09.400> sure<00:07:09.550> that<00:07:10.060> that<00:07:10.240> we<00:07:10.360> try<00:07:10.629> and<00:07:10.839> get

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
let's make sure that that we try and get

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.170 
let's make sure that that we try and get
them<00:07:11.050> out<00:07:11.319> there<00:07:11.529> as<00:07:11.650> well<00:07:11.969> it's<00:07:12.969> not<00:07:13.060> just

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
them out there as well it's not just

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.899 
them out there as well it's not just
about<00:07:13.689> the<00:07:14.319> Humber<00:07:14.680> River<00:07:14.710> someone<00:07:15.520> pointed

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:15.909 
about the Humber River someone pointed

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:18.600 
about the Humber River someone pointed
out<00:07:16.029> it's<00:07:16.629> also<00:07:16.930> about<00:07:17.400> encouraging<00:07:18.400> people

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
out it's also about encouraging people

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.029 
out it's also about encouraging people
to<00:07:18.789> use<00:07:19.060> the<00:07:19.300> roads<00:07:19.710> encouraging<00:07:20.710> them<00:07:20.860> and

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 
to use the roads encouraging them and

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.860 
to use the roads encouraging them and
wanting<00:07:21.610> them<00:07:21.729> to<00:07:21.789> do<00:07:22.060> it<00:07:22.210> and<00:07:22.389> not<00:07:22.509> saying

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
wanting them to do it and not saying

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.290 
wanting them to do it and not saying
you're<00:07:23.050> excluded<00:07:23.710> because<00:07:24.129> I<00:07:24.339> believe<00:07:24.789> some

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300 
you're excluded because I believe some

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.879 
you're excluded because I believe some
of<00:07:25.330> the<00:07:25.479> policy<00:07:25.930> needs<00:07:26.020> to<00:07:26.139> be<00:07:26.229> changed<00:07:26.319> or

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:26.889 
of the policy needs to be changed or

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.260 
of the policy needs to be changed or
maybe<00:07:27.099> we<00:07:27.249> should<00:07:27.430> be<00:07:27.520> fixing<00:07:27.849> another<00:07:28.060> Road

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
maybe we should be fixing another Road

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.999 
maybe we should be fixing another Road
somewhere<00:07:28.659> in<00:07:28.719> Scarborough<00:07:29.199> before<00:07:29.740> we<00:07:29.830> do

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:30.009 
somewhere in Scarborough before we do

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:31.459 
somewhere in Scarborough before we do
something<00:07:30.399> like<00:07:30.550> this

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:31.469 
something like this

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.610 
something like this
Thanks<00:07:32.499> let<00:07:32.830> the<00:07:32.979> voice<00:07:33.159> to<00:07:33.339> speak
