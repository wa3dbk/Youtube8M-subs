00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
label and volume form and you can see

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.680 
label and volume form and you can see
already<00:04:37.040> they<00:04:37.460> different<00:04:38.240> within<00:04:38.420> the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
already they different within the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.380 
already they different within the
texture<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.680> after<00:04:40.040> we've<00:04:40.220> been<00:04:40.400> dry<00:04:41.090> they're

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
texture so after we've been dry they're

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.510 
texture so after we've been dry they're
just<00:04:41.630> using<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.170> label<00:04:42.500> any<00:04:42.650> crucial<00:04:43.040> brush

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
just using the label any crucial brush

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.030 
just using the label any crucial brush
and<00:04:43.850> then<00:04:44.420> literally<00:04:45.020> brushing<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.680> hair<00:04:45.860> up

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
and then literally brushing the hair up

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.270 
and then literally brushing the hair up
all<00:04:46.430> away<00:04:46.940> from<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.240> face<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:48.040> creating<00:04:49.040> the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
all away from the face and creating the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
all away from the face and creating the
lifting<00:04:50.270> slowly<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.440> rocker<00:04:51.860> as<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.850> lot<00:04:53.000> more

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
lifting slowly a rocker as a lot more

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.180 
lifting slowly a rocker as a lot more
aggressive<00:04:53.570> structures<00:04:54.380> so<00:04:54.800> we<00:04:54.830> use<00:04:55.070> the

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
aggressive structures so we use the

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.910 
aggressive structures so we use the
