00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
not worth it but everything adds up and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
not worth it but everything adds up and
eventually<00:01:32.579> should<00:01:33.060> start<00:01:33.360> building<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> nice

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
eventually should start building a nice
