worthwhile<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.640> first<00:01:42.910> large<00:01:43.570> words

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
worthwhile this is the first large words

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.320 
worthwhile this is the first large words
I've<00:01:44.830> ever<00:01:45.070> done<00:01:45.280> I've<00:01:45.790> never<00:01:45.970> done<00:01:46.150> big

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
I've ever done I've never done big

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.210 
I've ever done I've never done big
letters<00:01:46.600> before<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.800> measured<00:01:48.130> it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
letters before and I measured it

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.010 
letters before and I measured it
carefully<00:01:48.729> hinders<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.390> wrote<00:01:49.600> down<00:01:49.750> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
carefully hinders and wrote down the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.950 
carefully hinders and wrote down the
dimensions<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.210> was<00:01:52.540> important<00:01:52.930> to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
dimensions so it was important to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.319 
dimensions so it was important to
practice<00:01:53.259> it<00:01:53.380> yes

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.749 

worthy<00:01:57.140> would<00:01:57.320> be<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:58.310> get<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.549> about

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
worthy would be to get it about

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.399 
worthy would be to get it about
two-thirds<00:01:59.000> finished<00:01:59.719> and<00:01:59.840> then<00:01:59.929> asunder<00:02:00.200> go

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
two-thirds finished and then asunder go

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.660 
two-thirds finished and then asunder go
in<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.590> clouds<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:01.159> does<00:02:01.280> not<00:02:01.429> come<00:02:01.609> out

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
in the clouds and does not come out

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.370 
in the clouds and does not come out
again<00:02:01.939> we<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.539> can't<00:02:02.780> think<00:02:02.960> as<00:02:03.049> Crawford

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
again we just can't think as Crawford

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.870 
again we just can't think as Crawford
will<00:02:03.740> get<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.009> good<00:02:04.219> picture<00:02:04.429> of<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:04.670> when<00:02:04.759> it's

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
will get a good picture of it when it's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.949 
will get a good picture of it when it's
finished<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:06.310> first<00:02:07.310> stage<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.060> plotting

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
finished the first stage is the plotting

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.080 
finished the first stage is the plotting
out<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.229> all<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.500> lines<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.640> tedious

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
out of all the lines is a tedious

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.839 
out of all the lines is a tedious
business<00:02:11.510> has<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.930> be<00:02:11.989> done<00:02:12.110> very<00:02:12.140> carefully

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
business has to be done very carefully

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.089 
business has to be done very carefully
when<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:13.940> finished<00:02:14.269> that<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.690> think<00:02:15.019> yes<00:02:15.410> that's

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
when I finished that I think yes that's

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.630 
when I finished that I think yes that's
