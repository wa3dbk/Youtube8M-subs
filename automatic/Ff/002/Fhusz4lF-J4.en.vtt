leg is a face and my face is a hair and

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.220 
leg is a face and my face is a hair and
I<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:32.230> don't<00:02:32.410> get<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.390> emerald<00:02:34.750> armor

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.130 

since<00:02:38.910> diamond<00:02:39.910> already<00:02:40.360> took<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.110> entire

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
since diamond already took up the entire

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.699 
since diamond already took up the entire
armor<00:02:42.099> thing<00:02:42.340> right<00:02:42.880> above<00:02:43.090> your<00:02:43.239> health<00:02:43.709> they

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
armor thing right above your health they

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.410 
armor thing right above your health they
actually<00:02:44.860> had<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.340> make<00:02:45.519> everything<00:02:45.910> else<00:02:46.269> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
actually had to make everything else a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.009 
actually had to make everything else a
little<00:02:46.450> less<00:02:47.110> strong<00:02:48.060> just<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.269> emeralds

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
little less strong just so emeralds

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.850 
little less strong just so emeralds
could<00:02:50.290> be<00:02:50.440> more<00:02:50.680> strong<00:02:50.980> than<00:02:51.040> diamonds<00:02:52.860> so

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
could be more strong than diamonds so

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.920 
could be more strong than diamonds so
now<00:02:54.040> i'm<00:02:54.190> pretty<00:02:54.370> sure<00:02:54.579> diamond<00:02:55.269> armor<00:02:55.599> only

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
now i'm pretty sure diamond armor only

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.470 
now i'm pretty sure diamond armor only
takes<00:02:56.200> up<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:57.730> eight<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.269> your<00:02:58.720> armor<00:02:59.650> slots

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
takes up like eight of your armor slots

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.400 
takes up like eight of your armor slots
Vlad<00:03:01.480> emerald<00:03:02.319> takes<00:03:02.590> up<00:03:02.829> ten<00:03:03.250> all<00:03:04.150> ten<00:03:04.410> like

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
Vlad emerald takes up ten all ten like

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.330 
Vlad emerald takes up ten all ten like
diamond<00:03:05.799> used<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:07.889> that's<00:03:08.889> just<00:03:09.100> about

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
diamond used to and that's just about

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.860 
diamond used to and that's just about
how<00:03:09.549> much<00:03:09.700> stronger<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.389> it's<00:03:10.690> just

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
how much stronger it is it's just

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.559 
how much stronger it is it's just
probably<00:03:11.079> two<00:03:11.410> more<00:03:11.650> stronger<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:13.180> from

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
probably two more stronger like from

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.599 
probably two more stronger like from
iron<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.920> Golda<00:03:15.430> stuff<00:03:15.639> like<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:17.609> know

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
iron to Golda stuff like that I know

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.449 
iron to Golda stuff like that I know
there<00:03:18.940> are<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.480> more<00:03:19.980> interesting<00:03:20.980> things

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
there are a lot more interesting things

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.220 
there are a lot more interesting things
that<00:03:21.670> they<00:03:21.819> added<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.239> snapshot<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:23.079> have

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
that they added in the snapshot I have

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.670 
that they added in the snapshot I have
not<00:03:23.560> had<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:23.980> chance<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.670> go<00:03:24.850> over<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:25.180> yet<00:03:25.500> but<00:03:26.500> I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
not had a chance to go over it yet but I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.879 
not had a chance to go over it yet but I
just<00:03:26.920> felt<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.400> saw<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.209> thought<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:29.139> need

just felt I saw this and thought I need

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:38.810 
just felt I saw this and thought I need
