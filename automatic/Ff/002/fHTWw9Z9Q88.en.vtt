there and we'll we'll check out this

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.079 
there and we'll we'll check out this
transmutator<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.460> i'll<00:00:51.730> show<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.940> what

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
transmutator and i'll show you what

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.220 
transmutator and i'll show you what
that's<00:00:52.239> all<00:00:52.449> about<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.600> pretty<00:00:55.870> easy<00:00:56.019> to

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
that's all about it's pretty easy to

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.259 
that's all about it's pretty easy to
make<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.570> just<00:00:59.260> about<00:00:59.890> like<00:01:00.429> the<00:01:00.730> energy

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
make and it's just about like the energy

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.149 
make and it's just about like the energy
condenser<00:01:01.839> in<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.079> sense<00:01:02.379> that<00:01:02.530> it's<00:01:02.829> going

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
condenser in the sense that it's going

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.440 
condenser in the sense that it's going
to<00:01:03.900> basically<00:01:04.900> duplicate<00:01:05.860> items<00:01:06.070> for<00:01:06.790> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.990 

will<00:01:10.450> build<00:01:10.659> this<00:01:10.900> this<00:01:11.740> is<00:01:11.890> our<00:01:12.040> main<00:01:12.280> floor

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
will build this this is our main floor

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.020 
will build this this is our main floor
right<00:01:13.330> here<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.530> we<00:01:14.680> open<00:01:15.040> it<00:01:15.130> up<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.400> it<00:01:15.790> looks

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
right here and we open it up it it looks

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.920 
right here and we open it up it it looks
quite<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.330> bit<00:01:16.480> nicer<00:01:17.400> anyway<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.680> make<00:01:20.710> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
quite a bit nicer anyway to make a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.490 
quite a bit nicer anyway to make a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.460 
you have to make a philosopher's stone
which<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.260> take<00:01:29.590> one<00:01:29.920> diamond<00:01:31.470> for

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
which is going to take one diamond for

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
and for glowstone dust just like that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.370 
and for glowstone dust just like that
philosopher's<00:01:44.010> stone<00:01:44.900> with<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
philosopher's stone with that in the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.430 
philosopher's stone with that in the

center for obsidian for stone and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.680 
center for obsidian for stone and
there's<00:01:55.440> your<00:01:56.360> transmutation<00:01:57.360> tablet<00:01:59.690> this

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
there's your transmutation tablet this

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.270 
there's your transmutation tablet this
little<00:02:00.990> bad<00:02:01.140> boy<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.619> sits<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:01.950> top<00:02:02.220> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
little bad boy just sits on top of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.050 
little bad boy just sits on top of
something<00:02:02.580> like<00:02:03.479> say<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.720> slab<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.110> wood<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
something like say a slab of wood and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.320 
something like say a slab of wood and
then<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> put<00:02:07.140> your<00:02:07.880> transmutation<00:02:08.880> tablet

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
then you put your transmutation tablet

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.660 
then you put your transmutation tablet
down<00:02:09.769> now<00:02:10.769> this<00:02:10.950> thing<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.190> pretty<00:02:11.340> cool

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.400 

anything<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.820> an<00:02:14.970> EMC<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.170> duplicate

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
anything with an EMC you can duplicate

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.050 
anything with an EMC you can duplicate
on<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.269> have<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.510> teach<00:02:19.440> it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
on it you just have to teach it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.750 
on it you just have to teach it
basically<00:02:21.920> about<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> item<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.489> you're

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
basically about the item that you're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.280 
basically about the item that you're
trying<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> place<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:24.840> place<00:02:25.110> an

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
trying to place so you just place an

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.380 
trying to place so you just place an
item<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.880> going<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> learn

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
item in there and it's going to learn

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.820 
item in there and it's going to learn
diamond<00:02:28.280> take<00:02:29.280> your<00:02:29.370> diamond<00:02:29.760> back<00:02:29.910> out<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
diamond take your diamond back out and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.360 
diamond take your diamond back out and
just<00:02:31.830> add<00:02:32.160> stuff<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.890> able<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just add stuff to it to be able to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.020 
just add stuff to it to be able to
create<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.390> these<00:02:36.569> items<00:02:36.900> over<00:02:37.350> here<00:02:38.030> so

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
create one of these items over here so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.840 
create one of these items over here so
say<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.330> put<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.660> uranium<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:44.430> didn't<00:02:44.700> like

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
say we put in uranium one didn't like

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.780 
say we put in uranium one didn't like
your<00:02:45.060> uranium<00:02:45.600> that's<00:02:46.440> okay<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.340> put<00:02:47.610> in

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
your uranium that's okay you can put in

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.789 
your uranium that's okay you can put in
coal<00:02:50.420> it's<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.870> any<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.380> stuff

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:02.800 

alright<00:02:56.180> that's<00:02:57.180> fine

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.270 

anyway<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:04.019> basically<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.129> put

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
anyway that's basically it you can put

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.580 
anyway that's basically it you can put
it<00:03:05.400> into<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> furnace<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:07.200> there<00:03:07.440> we<00:03:07.560> go

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
it into the furnace and go there we go

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.089 
it into the furnace and go there we go
it's<00:03:08.129> feeding<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.670> EMC<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.860> raise<00:03:11.069> your

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
it's feeding it EMC now you raise your

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.170 
it's feeding it EMC now you raise your
EMC<00:03:11.760> levels<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:13.530> take<00:03:13.920> items<00:03:14.250> out<00:03:15.120> of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
EMC levels and you can take items out of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.020 
EMC levels and you can take items out of
the<00:03:15.450> right-hand<00:03:15.840> side<00:03:15.959> there<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:17.670> can<00:03:17.790> take

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the right-hand side there so we can take

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.900 
the right-hand side there so we can take
anything<00:03:18.840> that's<00:03:19.110> going<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.530> equate<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.010> 190

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
anything that's going to equate to 190

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.800 
anything that's going to equate to 190
MC<00:03:21.390> like<00:03:21.989> say<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> copper<00:03:22.800> ingot<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:26.810> it's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
MC like say a copper ingot and it's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.750 
MC like say a copper ingot and it's
quite<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.080> bit<00:03:28.260> quicker<00:03:28.709> than<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.430> energy

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
quite a bit quicker than the energy

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.339 
quite a bit quicker than the energy
condenser<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.720> fact<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.319> just

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
condenser and the fact that you just

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.250 
condenser and the fact that you just
keep<00:03:31.709> pumping<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.220> full<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.489> EMC<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.450> fast<00:03:34.049> as

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
keep pumping it full of EMC as fast as

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.740 
keep pumping it full of EMC as fast as
you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.530> pump<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.890> in<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:37.220> anyway<00:03:38.660> that's<00:03:39.660> a

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
you can pump it in there anyway that's a

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.449 
you can pump it in there anyway that's a
boat<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.110> on<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.760> transmutation<00:03:41.760> tablet

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
boat in on the transmutation tablet

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:54.270 
boat in on the transmutation tablet
thanks<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:44.579> watching

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.340 

you
