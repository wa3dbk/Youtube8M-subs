00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.779
 in this video I want to show the mouth 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.510
 flammability of biodiesel its nobility and 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.130
 your driving safety here we have a 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.500
 biodiesel sample from one of the 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.390
 last lots I did and we're going to 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.440
 submit to a couple of tests for how 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.810
 I say demonstrate your safety 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.910
 biodiesel that is not flammable either 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.040
 the oil that comes from then 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.500
 olive oil could also be from 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.170
 sunflower and nobody has a bottle of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.090
 oil as a fire hazard of 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 fire the same thing happens with the video 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 diesel let's do a couple of tests 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.430
 which is to introduce one of the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.320
 tests you will enter an editor 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.460
 inside the biodiesel is to say what 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.340
 we will try to do from 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.800
 A myth is a device that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.050
 apply their voltage terminals 6 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.910
 volts more or less and around here he responded 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.559
 with a flare this is an editor that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.059
 I myself did when I was 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.070
 experimenting with the theme of 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.050
 rocket engines I still have a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
 heap and are useful to make a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.600
 experiment from time to time the second 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.790
 test will consist of trying 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 burn the biodiesel in the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 surface by applying flame and we will see 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.300
 that we will not get it either and that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.160
 that the surface in fuel is the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.380
 more delicate part since it is the 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.240
 is in contact with the air and if it is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.220
 susceptible to combustion by 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.850
 We'll see that we 're not going to get it either 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.160
 It seems incredible that a fuel as 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.190
 low flammable may be able to do 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.660
 walk our car but this is how it is 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.750
 have a reading or a consequence 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.149
 quite positive and is that in case of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.280
 sinister what may happen but 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.880
 the car will not come out burning like 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880
 we'll see 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.040
 do the first of the two tests 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.930
 I shall see how it works one 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.510
 these I invite from put the two tracks 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.320
 cutting and terminals and now friend 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.870
 of tension to both cables another afternoon a 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.010
 second 2 3 but in the end to the edition 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.010
 let's see 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.760
 ok let's proceed with the first of 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.640
 the tests 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.210
 unclog the bottle 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.300
 and we're going to introduce the editor in the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.459
 inside the biodiesel to produce 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.270
 the flare and see if the biodiesel 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.030
 reaction to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.990
 by the way before proceeding to do 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.350
 this test 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.920
 I say that just when he invited the 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.530
 flare without video cuts I'm going to 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.110
 introduce one of these papers I'm going to 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.150
 impregnate and I'm going to make it burn and this 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.060
 so you have to avoid the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.740
 inevitable comment that says this does not 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.350
 speak because it is not biodiesel it is water 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.190
 colored with that we will launch any 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.319
 doubt well let's put the engine in the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.450
 diesel interior well 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.970
 and now we apply tension 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.070
 I forget 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.070
 we apply voltage with the battery 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.070
 the camera perfectly this angle 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.070
 we apply tension 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.040
 as you see a flash inside the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.140
 biodiesel leaves smoke but despite 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.740
 It has been a flame inside the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.230
 biodiesel does not burn 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.260
 and now I promised 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.750
 no video cuts 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.340
 mojo this paper 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.340
 and see if this is water 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.690
 and water nothing 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.690
 on the 10th 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.790
 and now let's do the second of the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.740
 tests that is trying to make it burn 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.540
 applying flame on its surface is 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.940
 proof is perhaps more determinant though 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.130
 the previous because incombustible the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.350
 most delicate part let's say in the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.820
 surface that is the part that is in 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.220
 contact with the atmosphere and therefore 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.549
 with oxygen and in what varies 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.049
 albert let's look at fire the surface 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.070
 it does not matter 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.590
 higher lower almost submerging it the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.410
 lighter rod as you see or to 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.840
 shots we get to do to live if 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.840
 it was alcohol or gasoline is burning 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.450
 there is no way 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.790
 again without video cuts we're going to 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.790
 see if this is water or biodiesel
