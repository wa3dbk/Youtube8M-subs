00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.019
 goodbye everyone 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.980
 have a lot of women lately 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.349
 is that bad 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.369
 it comes from a bridge can see how that 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.029
 pawn've done 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.730
 well I have a bit of formal work here 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.779
 different lures 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.230
 first if you can buy a new club 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:36.160
 you see on the box how deep one 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.629
 flight from the state in this case between 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.199
 The 3.3 and 5.4 meters deep get over 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.550
 is about this team 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.839
 well as you can see is one 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.839
 pretty clear on it 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.170
 what you have to pay attention to is 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.969
 that the difference is between downstairs from 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.620
 the side fishes 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.989
 and when you pull it behind a tree 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.699
 if you pull it behind a tree 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.039
 I am going to be able to stand and deeper than you 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.920
 knew him from the side so that is a moment 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.630
 something you should pay attention to 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.789
 well what is the dispute between the thumb 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.530
 deep so I have a small plug here 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:16.090
 with a relatively large clear 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.610
 the bigger the diving club 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.190
 deeper and dive team here 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.250
 tuft of rap all 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.119
 but is a small clear on this one 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.640
 views taco few centimeters or 40 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.590
 while one this plug easily to the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.310
 two and half maybe three meters 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.310
 can dive 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.869
 this whatever you the difference between this 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.270
 two 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.020
 Whatever you see is that the team or that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.739
 clearly repeated on the rapala 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.200
 how right angle the clear on the prostate 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:54.429
 how shallow he thinks with this deep 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.690
 diving now you see the then cut into it 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.330
 extended runs of the plug 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.190
 that means that depth thinks well 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.810
 it is still possible with a very large one 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.789
 garden is still on 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.009
 no that it show better at this 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.790
 plug this is a plug of your fall or 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.879
 van abu these teams have a 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.459
 adjustable to be clear in 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.040
 set various positions 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.180
 well if you set a hook on your lure 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.510
 like this i think that very shallow 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.400
 the more you set it upwards 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.400
 the deeper the practice 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.340
 so in this case look at that service option 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.770
 can on a position high this is it 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.300
 deepest position is almost complete 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.470
 straight 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.470
 relative to the plug 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.140
 well i still have here what this is human 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.080
 plug also has a very small one 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.770
 dive club you think only one 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:04.510
 centimeter or 50 60 I think different 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.930
 example of a deep dive and the plug 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.460
 is this salmo perch has a very big one 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.550
 diving club 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.150
 is also very straight on the plug and on 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.330
 the box states that this plug is diving 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.730
 between 4 and 9 meters 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.130
 so that's quite a bit of where you are 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.680
 keep in mind is that a plug 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.230
 a very large garden also ran very well 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.300
 pulls your rod heavily 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.700
 this offers a lot of water resistance 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.770
 making it really straight black 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.080
 you really have a strong rod for that 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.990
 early for otherwise you can have this 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.270
 kind of plugs with a large dive with kun 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.920
 you don't fish for it 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.360
 this for example has a small dive 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.980
 of course you also have a whole 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.150
 a lot less hard so you can do this 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.830
 a light spinning or use up 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.450
 but you also have a number of plugs 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.360
 they have none at all 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.830
 der klip such as this de 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.230
 salmo fatso 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.650
 have known plug German without 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.340
 clearly it will be two and a half 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.340
 meters deep 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:17.530
 here is a gathering bbz 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.440
 no diving club this time either 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.930
 very deep this is my slow sinking 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.720
 Dives about 50 to 60 centimeters deep 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.900
 Well you also have some plugs that 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.960
 have a metal clip 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.180
 this is one of fallen metals 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.680
 to be clear often at sync 'to the 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.110
 put plugs 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.509
 this is also a plug you at sea 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.940
 is used 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:48.120
 Well this is a plug Solomon also 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.919
 a metal clear 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.419
 yes is not necessarily used at sea â€‹â€‹but 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.460
 just on inland water 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.229
 also a big clear was also called the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.229
 meter or four five 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.590
 totally i hope we all 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.970
 is clear 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.389
 if you have any questions late 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.440
 let me know and happy to see you next 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.410
 times 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.590
 hopefully again on the waterfront okay 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.590
 bye
