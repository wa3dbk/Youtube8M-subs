break through blacks defense in in this

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.789 
break through blacks defense in in this

try to feel care to it just to play
diagonal<00:03:48.549> you<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.599> remember<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.140> then

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
diagonal you have to remember that then

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.569

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
you see C file attacking this porn

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.800 
you see C file attacking this porn
because<00:04:04.930> if<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.260> goes<00:04:05.439> into<00:04:05.680> six<00:04:06.040> then<00:04:06.340> it's

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
because if it goes into six then it's

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.360 
because if it goes into six then it's

so<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:12.819> fact<00:04:13.120> after<00:04:13.599> b6<00:04:14.290> black<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.159> practice

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
so in fact after b6 black the practice

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.490 
so in fact after b6 black the practice
showed<00:04:16.060> as<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.299> black<00:04:16.660> would<00:04:16.900> simply<00:04:17.410> play

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
showed as a black would simply play

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.610 
showed as a black would simply play
Bishop<00:04:17.739> d7<00:04:18.190> which<00:04:19.030> should<00:04:19.209> be<00:04:19.329> 7<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:20.470> who

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
Bishop d7 which should be 7 and then who

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.659 
Bishop d7 which should be 7 and then who
c8<00:04:21.039> and<00:04:21.340> then<00:04:21.849> white<00:04:22.750> couldn't<00:04:23.289> stop<00:04:23.470> c5<00:04:24.070> so

c8 and then white couldn't stop c5 so
there<00:04:24.849> will<00:04:24.910> be<00:04:24.970> number<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.330> games<00:04:25.660> attached

that could demonstrate at this point

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.710 
that could demonstrate at this point
