00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.539
 It's been a few days but there's a 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.510
 wound that does not heal I feel 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.549
 jara disappointed disappointed me 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.529
 disappointed chile disappointed me the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 arbitration and I also felt that I 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.120
 disappointed football on game day 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 everyone suggested that I do not play that I 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.530
 Focus more on my family problems 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 since my family is going through a 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.480
 horrible moment however for a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 question of conviction for an issue 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 of respect for the team and respect for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.190
 football I decided to play so that it does not stop 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.010
 go out on the court and be insulted be 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.800
 attacked they even told me things like you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.960
 dad is going to eat 20 years prisoner me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.790
 they discarded that they are so few humans 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 and that in order to win they resort to 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.829
 unworthy and cruel strategies I can 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.809
 tolerate cruel aggressions but that you 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.969
 put two fingers in the tail is something 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.090
 quite annoying difficult to cope with 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.280
 and react basically by instinct to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.680
 which jara did a performance worthy of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 Broadway is sad that in football 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.560
 there are these things when I was a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.049
 boy 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.030
 and I played with my ball all day was 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.399
 because I loved the sport because I 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.950
 I loved to run goals and go 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.710
 surpassing me both technically and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.020
 learn to play as a team I remember 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.270
 my adolescence I admired gabriel 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.250
 Batistuta and other players who 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 there they did not play in my position as the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.170
 Chinese recoba or pavel nedved admired them 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.299
 I would never have crossed the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 head put two fingers in the tail to 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.310
 pavel nedved because soccer is not 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.890
 it's about that jara is a poor human being 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.289
 an unsuccessful footballer who resorts to 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.200
 acting and the indignity to fill 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.390
 his shortcomings as a footballer for me 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.759
 He was wrong in the field because as an actor 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.099
 I see better and if so eager to put 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.619
 fingers in the tail you should should be engaged 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.750
 to pornography in tsunamis and in 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.899
 the earthquakes killed many chileans 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.149
 hardworking and honest and I wonder 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.860
 why sometimes still alive jara 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.259
 it seems that in this world 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.539
 the good suffer and the bad enjoy 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.989
 it seems that evil triumphs over 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.989
 well nothing more to say thank you for reading 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.700

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.700
