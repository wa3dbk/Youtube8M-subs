really really clear it's very very
important<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.320> I've<00:00:43.440> noticed<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:44.010> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
important and what I've noticed is this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
important and what I've noticed is this
horse<00:00:44.579> didn't<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> totally<00:00:45.989> too<00:00:46.050> much

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
horse didn't have a totally too much

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
horse didn't have a totally too much
sideways<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.579> started<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
sideways when we when we started on a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.889 
sideways when we when we started on a
couple<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> weeks<00:00:48.750> ago<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.329> he

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
couple of weeks ago and I think that he

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.470 
couple of weeks ago and I think that he
had<00:00:52.050> been<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.559> used<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.100> hitting<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.210> side<00:00:54.449> of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
had been so used to hitting the side of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
had been so used to hitting the side of
the<00:00:54.690> saddle<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.829> he<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.250> oh<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.000> he

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the saddle that he was like oh and if he

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
the saddle that he was like oh and if he
did<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.480> sideways<00:00:58.050> there<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.379> absolutely<00:00:58.770> no

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
did get sideways there was absolutely no

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
did get sideways there was absolutely no
bend<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.760> only<00:01:00.149> dead<00:01:00.809> straight<00:01:01.170> leg

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
bend that was only dead straight leg

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920 
bend that was only dead straight leg

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
me left right and center and it was the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300 
me left right and center and it was the
combination<00:03:00.050> of<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> saddle<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.980> saddle

pad because I think the saddle is 75% of

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.960 
pad because I think the saddle is 75% of
it<00:03:05.000> but<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.240> pad<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.930> at<00:03:06.830> least<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.640> big

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
it but the pad is at least it's a big

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.960 
it but the pad is at least it's a big
part<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> deal<00:03:08.720> because<00:03:08.980> I've<00:03:09.980> seen<00:03:10.700> this
