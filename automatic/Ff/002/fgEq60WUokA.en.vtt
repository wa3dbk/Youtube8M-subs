00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
cortex a9 processor and also i think on

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.779 
cortex a9 processor and also i think on
the<00:00:58.440> ipad<00:00:58.859> 2<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.929> about<00:01:00.929> 900<00:01:01.679> megahertz<00:01:02.010> but

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the ipad 2 it's about 900 megahertz but

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.499 
the ipad 2 it's about 900 megahertz but
also<00:01:02.940> dual<00:01:03.239> core<00:01:03.500> 16<00:01:04.500> gigabyte<00:01:04.829> SSD<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:06.240> here

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
also dual core 16 gigabyte SSD in here

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.830 
also dual core 16 gigabyte SSD in here
right<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> also<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.570> course

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
right now and also you can get of course

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.990 
right now and also you can get of course
some<00:01:10.380> different<00:01:10.740> options<00:01:10.829> both<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.820> have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
some different options both can have

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.830 
some different options both can have
with<00:01:12.270> mooji<00:01:12.630> module<00:01:12.960> inside<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.729> yeah<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
with mooji module inside and yeah the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
with mooji module inside and yeah the
main<00:01:15.990> difference<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.710> i<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.369> operating

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
main difference is i think the operating

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
main difference is i think the operating
system<00:01:18.329> we<00:01:18.450> thought<00:01:18.630> n-word<00:01:18.990> sweep<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.409> one

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
system we thought n-word sweep on one

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.899 
system we thought n-word sweep on one
and<00:01:19.829> i<00:01:20.399> was<00:01:20.430> feel<00:01:20.850> 4.2<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.979> ipad<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:25.909> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and i was feel 4.2 on the ipad and this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.910 
and i was feel 4.2 on the ipad and this
one<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.270> widgets

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.820 

I<00:01:30.979> don't<00:01:31.970> want<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:32.240> resize<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:32.930> now<00:01:33.049> all<00:01:33.680> we

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
I don't want to resize and now all we

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.920 
I don't want to resize and now all we
seniors<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.490> econ<00:01:35.290> 2849<00:01:36.290> video<00:01:36.770> and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
seniors in the econ 2849 video and

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.660 
seniors in the econ 2849 video and
basically<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.649> have<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.830> decide<00:01:40.159> if<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.460> want

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
basically you have to decide if we want

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.990 
basically you have to decide if we want
to<00:01:40.700> buy<00:01:41.299> an<00:01:41.450> android<00:01:41.600> device<00:01:41.780> or<00:01:42.320> an<00:01:43.009> iOS

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
to buy an android device or an iOS

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.580 
to buy an android device or an iOS
device<00:01:45.009> so<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.880> can't<00:01:47.119> really<00:01:47.240> compare<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
device so you can't really compare the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.440 
device so you can't really compare the
operating<00:01:49.100> systems<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:49.640> think<00:01:49.880> but<00:01:50.119> what<00:01:50.330> you

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
operating systems I think but what you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.930 
operating systems I think but what you
can<00:01:50.630> compare<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.289> sickness<00:01:51.740> because<00:01:52.640> as

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
can compare is the sickness because as

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.690 
can compare is the sickness because as
you<00:01:53.060> know<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.509> ipad<00:01:54.049> 2<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.100> little<00:01:55.430> bit<00:01:55.549> sick

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
you know the ipad 2 is a little bit sick

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.020 
you know the ipad 2 is a little bit sick
about<00:01:56.030> two<00:01:56.360> millimeters<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:58.640> have<00:01:58.759> to

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
about two millimeters and you have to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.460 
about two millimeters and you have to
adjust<00:01:59.689> this<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.960> little<00:02:00.200> bit<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:02.210> then<00:02:02.289> we<00:02:03.289> can

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
adjust this a little bit and then we can

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.550 
adjust this a little bit and then we can
see<00:02:03.850> its<00:02:04.850> iPad<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.750> middle<00:02:06.200> into<00:02:06.440> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
see its iPad is the middle into the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.279 
see its iPad is the middle into the
ticker<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.850> we<00:02:08.360> all<00:02:08.450> will<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.720> see<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.929> size

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
ticker so we all will you see a size

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.150 
ticker so we all will you see a size
difference<00:02:09.769> here<00:02:10.569> that's<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.900> course<00:02:12.319> because

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
difference here that's of course because

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.990 
difference here that's of course because
this<00:02:13.340> one<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.580> 8.9<00:02:14.090> ipad<00:02:14.510> 2<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.810> 9.7<00:02:15.350> but<00:02:16.280> here

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
this one is 8.9 ipad 2 with 9.7 but here

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.979 
this one is 8.9 ipad 2 with 9.7 but here
we<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.890> assume<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> 8.9<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.819> can't<00:02:20.569> see<00:02:20.840> that

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
we see assume the 8.9 is can't see that

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.250 
we see assume the 8.9 is can't see that
much<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> different<00:02:21.799> really<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> mean<00:02:23.080> point<00:02:24.080> two

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
much a different really I mean point two

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.400 
much a different really I mean point two
millimeters<00:02:24.799> but<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.239> enough<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.230> big

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
millimeters but it is enough it's a big

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.670 
millimeters but it is enough it's a big
selling<00:02:28.220> point<00:02:28.519> percent<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.239> think<00:02:29.680> yeah

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
selling point percent on I think yeah

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.340 
selling point percent on I think yeah
