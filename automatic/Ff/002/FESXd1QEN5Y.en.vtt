00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
tester check for live wires I also have

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.560 
tester check for live wires I also have
a<00:00:57.230> little<00:00:57.530> light<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:59.090> used<00:01:01.059> put<00:01:02.059> on<00:01:02.149> my<00:01:02.270> hat

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
a little light that I used put on my hat

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.329 
a little light that I used put on my hat
when<00:01:02.930> I<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.260> crawl<00:01:03.559> spaces<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:04.129> lot<00:01:04.280> of

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
when I in the crawl spaces a lot of

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.279 
when I in the crawl spaces a lot of
times<00:01:04.550> they're<00:01:04.879> not<00:01:04.910> lit<00:01:05.479> up<00:01:05.509> or<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.930> bulbs

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
times they're not lit up or the bulbs

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.380 
times they're not lit up or the bulbs
are<00:01:06.410> burnt<00:01:06.619> out<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:06.830> this<00:01:07.700> light<00:01:07.970> comes<00:01:08.240> in

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
are burnt out so this light comes in

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.230 
are burnt out so this light comes in
very<00:01:08.600> handy<00:01:08.660> for<00:01:09.229> me<00:01:09.440> then<00:01:12.910> another<00:01:13.910> tool<00:01:14.209> I

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
very handy for me then another tool I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.080 
very handy for me then another tool I
use<00:01:14.539> it's<00:01:14.780> an<00:01:14.899> infrared<00:01:15.289> thermometer<00:01:16.090> it

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
use it's an infrared thermometer it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.150 
use it's an infrared thermometer it
works<00:01:17.270> really<00:01:17.479> good<00:01:17.720> basically<00:01:18.259> just<00:01:18.860> squeeze

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
works really good basically just squeeze

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.100 
works really good basically just squeeze
the<00:01:19.340> trigger<00:01:19.369> point<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:20.690> will<00:01:20.810> tell<00:01:21.080> me

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
the trigger point and it will tell me

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.830 
the trigger point and it will tell me
the<00:01:21.229> temperature<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.729> point<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.539> usually

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
the temperature of that point I usually

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.830 
the temperature of that point I usually
a<00:01:24.020> lot<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.259> my<00:01:24.470> HVAC<00:01:24.979> inspections<00:01:28.840> general

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
a lot of my HVAC inspections general

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.320 
a lot of my HVAC inspections general
tape<00:01:30.110> measure<00:01:30.349> I<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.530> humidity<00:01:34.490> and

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
tape measure I have a humidity and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.260 
tape measure I have a humidity and
temperature<00:01:35.899> gauge<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.470> use<00:01:36.849> this<00:01:37.849> comes<00:01:38.090> in

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
temperature gauge that use this comes in

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.790 
temperature gauge that use this comes in
very<00:01:38.300> handy<00:01:38.630> when<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.869> do<00:01:38.929> my<00:01:39.170> environmental

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
very handy when I do my environmental

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800 
very handy when I do my environmental
inspections<00:01:40.700> they'll<00:01:40.910> give<00:01:41.090> me<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.240> relative

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
inspections they'll give me the relative

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.169 
inspections they'll give me the relative
humidity<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.560> home<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.640> indoor<00:01:43.970> outdoor

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
humidity of the home the indoor outdoor

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.300 
humidity of the home the indoor outdoor
temperature<00:01:45.039> so<00:01:47.500> well<00:01:48.500> another<00:01:48.770> important

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
temperature so well another important

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.580 
temperature so well another important
piece<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.520> equipment<00:01:49.759> I<00:01:50.149> use<00:01:50.179> is<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.750> just<00:01:51.500> a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
piece of equipment I use is a just a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.309 
piece of equipment I use is a just a
regular<00:01:52.009> let's<00:01:52.910> go<00:01:53.149> tester<00:01:53.599> this<00:01:53.899> will<00:01:54.110> tell

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
regular let's go tester this will tell

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.820 
regular let's go tester this will tell

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
me if that let's go outlet is wired up

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.940 
me if that let's go outlet is wired up
correctly<00:01:58.310> they<00:01:58.789> also<00:01:58.970> tell<00:01:59.300> me<00:01:59.330> if<00:01:59.539> has<00:02:00.530> open

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
correctly they also tell me if has open

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.729 
correctly they also tell me if has open
ground<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.670> open<00:02:01.759> neutral<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.380> reverse

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
ground and open neutral if the reverse

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.820 
ground and open neutral if the reverse
and<00:02:04.179> if<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.390> wiring<00:02:05.599> is<00:02:05.899> reversed<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:06.560> there

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
and if the wiring is reversed in there

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.889 
and if the wiring is reversed in there
it<00:02:06.950> also<00:02:07.099> tests<00:02:07.640> any<00:02:07.910> of<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.239> ground<00:02:08.509> fault

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
it also tests any of the ground fault

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.550 
it also tests any of the ground fault
circuit<00:02:09.640> sin<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.729> home<00:02:11.290> because<00:02:12.290> it's

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
circuit sin the home because it's

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.699 
circuit sin the home because it's
probably<00:02:12.709> one<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:12.950> my<00:02:13.190> most<00:02:14.180> used<00:02:14.660> tools<00:02:15.050> this

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
probably one of my most used tools this

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.559 
probably one of my most used tools this
gets<00:02:15.980> used<00:02:16.189> at<00:02:16.370> every<00:02:16.579> room<00:02:16.939> especially<00:02:17.510> in

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
gets used at every room especially in

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.850 
gets used at every room especially in
older<00:02:17.810> homes<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.290> are<00:02:18.379> rewired

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
older homes that are rewired

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.400 
older homes that are rewired
a<00:02:19.040> lot<00:02:19.579> of<00:02:19.610> times<00:02:19.909> they

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
a lot of times they

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.600 
a lot of times they
forget<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:21.600> pull<00:02:22.600> new<00:02:23.590> wires<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.190> only<00:02:24.340> have

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
forget to pull new wires that only have

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.610 
forget to pull new wires that only have
two<00:02:25.000> wires<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.870> three<00:02:26.170> prong<00:02:26.440> outlet

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
two wires going to a three prong outlet

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.950 
two wires going to a three prong outlet
which<00:02:27.580> would<00:02:27.790> make<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.210> an<00:02:28.360> improperly

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960
