00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Welcome to a new face of map 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.330
 stage erosion and this one is free what 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 you're going to have along with another free map 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.980
 to the great if I remember badly and nothing 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.280
 let's see let's see how it goes 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.780
 this good map works to start is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 a little square as you see here is 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.449
 pretty square is a lot of corridor 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.550
 Underground I think there are going to see 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.779
 to start in this area here 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 how blue are houses or underground has not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.140
 fixed look at how there are passages by 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.340
 underneath that they travel the whole nice map 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.470
 to the tree 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 there are underground passages that run 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.410
 the whole map there's good here there 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.120
 stairs uff how I mess this here for 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.550
 to camp with a franc rifle from 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.050
 here good for this side no but for 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 the other yes you can pretty much 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.020
 ok let's see more little things we are not going to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.059
 go there for the one for one 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.070
 I think it's too big to see you can 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.540
 jump sideways the host that good is going to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.590
 be that when they kill you from below 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.150
 it's going to look pretty in the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.590
 cinematic the truth type sanctuary with 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.880
 stones well here a little worth worth 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.350
 they have a pint the only thing I say 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.030
 that is a map they could also leave 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.720
 for normal mode will not know whether 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.340
 at the end but this map so that according to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.290
 all against all would be very good a 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.060
 domain can be very good very 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.369
 interesting there are many nooks and crannies 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.229
 stories over here a lot of good this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.930
 soil that should have liked them 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 santuari not as I already say and as 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.300
 you see it's a pretty big map to me 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.640
 it seems quite big, not in theory 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.410
 to be tiny maps for face of by 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.750
 there you can not go up will be to camp 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.750
 do not 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.070
 Here is a small window to 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.320
 I understand very well how and good is good 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.290
 good good this area here to those who do not 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.790
 know what the map may be 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.229
 stratospheric put you here my mother 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.080
 now that it can roll not in the one against 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.330
 one to see you can not get up here and nothing 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.220
 I will bring west after staying 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.140
 In the next 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.050
 I'm going to bring it together after this 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.930
 video is going to have there is another the other 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.970
 map you are already seeing a bit the map is 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.040
 a little camper use I believe a bit of 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.060
 champion the only good thing they have done is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.100
 that you can upload to almost any 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.790
 side on the other maps you can not 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.170
 go up to practically nowhere 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.480
 but it is finally done 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.930
 I hope I hope a mole I hope you 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.209
 like it good that being free is not that 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.810
 neither should we ask for pears 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.590
 elm so I do not expect anything like it and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.590
 we are still here in agra 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 the other free map for for face soft 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.500
 How nice I keep saying that they should 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.569
 put them for all game modes 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.140
 I hope they do but we'll go 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.550
 see how this is in good theory they said 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.489
 that the circular here you see there 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.130
 passages everywhere as you see 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.190
 area and right there is a passageway next to 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 end of the map let's see how it is here 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.810
 there is a passageway as you see how blue they are 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.850
 catwalks leisure hidden things there is a 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.160
 kind of ship thrown may be raised 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.530
 the ship is clear that there is no man 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.560
 so they could have left no but no 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.660
 they have left it there I imagine that you will kill 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.000
 ok here this is the ship 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.519
 another one of the ships I think was a 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.700
 mine evaluation to refinery but they are not 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.880
 they are ships you can climb to see me not 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.580
 let 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.900
 she did not let me 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.970
 Well, they may have left it 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.520
 We would have had a great time but good 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.250
 what are we always going to do 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.590
 this happens not to see 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.540
 this map is that this map is tiny 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.800
 so it's going to be quite interesting 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.590
 to play in the one to one to see 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.960
 to see here you can get the boat 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.050
 good in the boat you can get 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.710
 you can stay in the boat not having here 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.100
 another ship over here I do not know what this is 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.960
 good to die easily if you go up there 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.000
 another ship cited badly is full of ships 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.940
 or of semi ships or whatever you want to call it 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.830
 to see good here they are going to be sure 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.860
 people are very clear that they are going to sing the 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.390
 people to sack in this on this ship 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.310
 also here 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.380
 have a vision of who happens and who does not 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.239
 my mother the one that people are going to mess with is 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.370
 the one that is going to mess people here already already 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.570
 I'm seeing areas of campeo secured 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.190
 not to see here look here here is going to 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.720
 also be camping the good people 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.930
 the map does not look bad it 's cool 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.240
 with the sound of the sea ​​out there everything 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.509
 many twigs I see here not to see 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.070
 here you can jump you can not 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.720
 jump bad 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.080
 They should have stopped jumping around here 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.440
 at least know do not let's go to 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.660
 remember that part of the one on the left 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.030
 It is a passage without more than good 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.710
 you can control quite a lot 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.200
 areas of the map to see 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.580
 over here is the other passageway this is not 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.380
 it's a passage as such I do not know why the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.340
 they call like that but good as you see is a 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.340
 tiny map to see 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.979
 three points in order 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.150
 they have a pint also this map the 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.830
 they have really worked on it in this pack 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.419
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.639
 I hope that you mole hope that the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.500
 information has served us and nothing that 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.500
 Enjoy it, hello
