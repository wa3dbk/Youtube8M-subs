00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 the correct posture about the bicycle 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.639
 is the first step to master the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.639
 descents respects the incorrect position 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.140
 in relation to the suspension that 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.140
 anyone 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.800
 for him 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.600
 it goes straight 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 says you're in the head 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.789
 in the mountain descents the body must 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 position according to the center 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.960
 gravity that is located on the connecting rod and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.890
 the pedals 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.890
 what is done 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.870
 I told you 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.829
 valdemoro 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.270
 and our love to any 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.820
 circumstances that arise 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.010
 when the cyclist moves his body 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.140
 very back the position is also 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.510
 incorrect because they expose their integrity 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.640
 to hit against the rear tire or 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.640
 leave catapulted forward 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.640
 very good 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.770
 in the position that assumes the entire race 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.930
 more speed people which one is 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.110
 in the big drops where those 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.110
 forums with their bellies the weight 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:40.960
 if the base charge of the body and the 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 problem is that all the weight that over 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 the back part 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.400
 in this process 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.080
 for him 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.750
 and that indignation appears a pothole 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:02.140
 and the bicycle is lowered the rear tire 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.360
 will tend to stand on the pedals 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.150
 helps absorb bumps in the ground 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.550
 and always look forward keeps 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.930
 the cyclist warning about the road 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.930
 now let's assume 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.540
 with an inclination 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 in this position the load that there is of the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.540
 knobs on the triceps and on the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.080
 delivery is controllable thus can 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.650
 assume any error condition 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.650
 Y
