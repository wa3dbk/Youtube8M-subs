00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 I'm still a bit good 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.620
 Just start, I'm up to speed 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.389
 on road 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.219
 We should be at a moderate pace 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 Here indeed be possible I hope that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.920
 that as well is a correct one 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.020
 I know icelandic really hard 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 so that's the note here now 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.350
 aaa stretch a width of the retiree 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.580
 can ride to level a horse 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.240
 although I'm actually coincidence 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240
 but okay 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.280
 so far not so spectacular the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:47.570
 ride the lips so water it's cool 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:50.660
 So the signposts here maybe now 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.220
 later oh god then you have to completely 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.790
 play up to the end that's like 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.790
 is that meant 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.960
 you know really bad here bad 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.960
 it is better at another time 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:22.090
 life took place here and right on the left 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:33.689
 jumps fast akcan and jump 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.270
 and right and left here goes far 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.450
 It's just fine that we have this water 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:47.409
 realistic and main echo or composer 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.869
 bones and wonderful 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.869
 what was that because that is very 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.560
 interesting interesting 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.899
 magath would always have to be really 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.280
 always jump that is yes times 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.220
 here go too tilty at the Baltic and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.220
 the finish line costa rica 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.840
 managed and the anita hangs 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.180
 yes wonder couple and now professor 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.400
 a start is for us so that could be 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.360
 make the race again how much 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.340
 Can we get 125 for it? 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.019
 little bit for that that relative 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.220
 is fast and therefore one too 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:49.440
 for a while I can get in first 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.810
 Just explain that I can level 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.810
 then do it later 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.660
 me and the aimless have us 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.480
 entertain and a solution found 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.549
 in mercedes , he is too close to him in the near future 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.660
 future a bigger psychological 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.690
 experiment begins 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.660
 she has a theory how to use it 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.099
 Gene manipulates the manipulation of the tann 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.170
 I already can read 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.640
 That's why I can do anything against manipulation 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.579
 not I was confused then that's okay 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.760
 here grow the greenhouse effect 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.140
 can order 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.819
 she believes that we are within three 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.950
 months here is a tropical climate 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.260
 can not achieve fantastic, right 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.319
 imagine that she has turned into a 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.019
 south lake lagoon transforms pallmann 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.670
 make of fir trees a meadow instead of the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:48.299
 ice cold north wind glorious that mine 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.799
 schnitzel so enough of reverie and 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.840
 we are at the next step in the core 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.400
 other country the hot air balloon i 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.420
 Do not think that it can be that hard 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.639
 to fix him 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.760
 but not only not anymore 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.290
 investigate earthly investigations you 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.329
 inspects the damage when we get the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.100
 repair hot air balloon again 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.530
 because then we come this terrible 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.420
 Day can fly wherever we want 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.170
 maybe some particles are accelerating 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.500
 from core to geneva or we travel 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.840
 the galapagos islands and walk up 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.810
 Darwin's Traces Darwin's before school lesson 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.669
 now enough people start that 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.360
 dreams I have said inspect 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.360
 now in the hot air balloon 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.430
 prof 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.630
 I know me so well with 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.880
 hot air balloons out 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.880
 Yes / Yes 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.850
 Brenner is already a part of it 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.850
 many, moreover, the glass is empty 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.920
 the basket is almost destroyed he was 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.690
 Torn up as he was on the floor 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.420
 was a large part of the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.230
 no idea I can yes 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.910
 no lines I have you I 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.530
 mind the burner is broken the 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.900
 Substance is basically no longer available 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.970
 use and the basket is destroyed na 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.980
 Well that's probably the first project at 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.650
 In spite of everything I am confident 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.680
 that we bring it to a successful conclusion 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:28.030
 and yet is a bitch on and 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.650
 should accelerate the browser and a 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.020
 observation probably agree with mine 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.640
 own conclusions agree so lucky 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.150
 I already have a plan for this 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.150
 prepared 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:46.039
 it was musically supported 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.019
 according to the old model that is up 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.129
 asked to calculate where 

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.769
 all parts of the crashed 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.779
 We have hot air balloons to find 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:55.849
 to repair good chances in balance 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:58.729
 Let's just enough total a total 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.099
 i would like to have that for teaching 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.259
 After the parts balance shows there 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.559
 yes, there is a lot of garbage there 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:11.089
 only with what you need what is useful 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:17.469
 but it seems to be the hammer 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:20.029
 dual as a nice quarrel 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:24.110
 they would have also previously fully so narrow 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:27.789
 us earlier the task each can as 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.789
 by that the command 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.339
 welcome to the recording 

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:39.999
 Professor Einstein has us in before 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:44.499
 to collect things and I think klum 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:44.499
 literally okay 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.850
 yes I still wanted to buy the zero here 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.009
 make of professor einstein 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.720
 I do not really know 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.720
 have to do something again now
