00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.630
 very good to all who are such 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.520
 my name is ramÃ³n super and here we are going to 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.859
 start with the new youtube channel 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.980
 in which we will talk about games 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.170
 xbox 360 of many games but good 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.720
 in these moments more specifically of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.920
 this piece of game as is minecraft 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.730
 that already has millions of followers in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.589
 one month from the day it was launched 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.019
 in this chapter I'm going to talk and I'm going to 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.609
 show you my two constructions worth it 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.710
 I will try then engineering what 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.230
 impossible because because I like it 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.449
 that everyone contributes a little bit of 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.850
 what your buildings know how to do 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.100
 tutorials everything someone can do 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.880
 Well, glass cabinets that know how to make 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.009
 whatever aircraft then we will go 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.810
 each one contributing our idea and in 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.940
 this case in particular to and beige my 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.390
 first construction that I will show you 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.789
 that is a pyramid a huge pyramid 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.959
 you'll see when we get closer how 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.190
 will see gigantic has 128 squares 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.950
 base 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.160
 both wide and long and one 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.710
 height of 63 blocks that is the maximum 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.740
 that you can as you already know is made 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.050
 of sandstone but the doors and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.810
 corners I made them with a crystal 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.910
 bright with shiny stone so that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.730
 highlight a little bit at night and how 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.890
 You see when you enter and you will see that it is 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.950
 it is that it is amazing 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.080
 spectacular that light from within as 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.600
 You see it is very high even in the cloud 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.120
 you see how it looks in there is entering a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.640
 cloud the construction really took me 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.160
 quite some time especially the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.710
 base is above the water ie the 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.030
 base this stone stone on top of the water 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.399
 and those that you have already built on 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.070
 guard is what you will know perfectly of 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.400
 that takes a lot of time to have 128 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.080
 x 128 in the base so imagine more of 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.060
 10 thousand stones good is that it is not that 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.430
 be a math ax but they are more 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.260
 of 10,000 stones placed at the base and 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.460
 having made them, I am alone because 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.380
 has cost a lot the next 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.760
 construction that I will teach have helped me 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.840
 and it takes me less time but there 's the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.060
 it's true that it took me a long time 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.290
 make them 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.730
 for the top part so you can see 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.459
 the height you have can not be 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.420
 build not a single stone over 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.110
 is the maximum height and the views as 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.000
 you see 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.520
 they are spectacular 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.710
 we are above the clouds and those who 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.920
 those who have already built the heights 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.870
 you will realize that doing 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.170
 such tall buildings are always left 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.700
 phenomenal they are seen from very far although 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.500
 good although it is usually pixelated 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.300
 little and now let's teach them I'm going to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.160
 show you the other construction there I go 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.810
 jumping from normal I 'm in mode 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.760
 peaceful if not then I would be left without 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.459
 heart is the good time there I go in 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.780
 what is in the ways that I have 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.760
 connected from north to south and east to 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.709
 west completely in a straight line 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.060
 going through what is mountains because I 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.670
 like a little more so there you see the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.870
 background my house that I have in the air that 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.790
 connects with the one under the water 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.310
 that at the time of another time 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.379
 As you can see, the map is spectacular. 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.109
 a lot of luck has been the first one 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.959
 I had to enter no seed the 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.019
 it really has many waterfalls even 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.909
 waterfalls of lava and well there you see a 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.519
 little up there what is the lookout 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.200
 and we are reaching the area of 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.730
 Greek parthenon in some of you already 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.349
 You have seen it on other channels 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.909
 other partners on youtube but I wanted to 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.739
 teach it and explain myself a little there 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.689
 you see it is the Greek parthenon that is 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.340
 made taking into account actual size 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.439
 that each block roughly measure 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.720
 a meter since the doll if you put it 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.750
 next to it is almost two blocks 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.060
 then taking into account that it is almost 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.599
 almost one meter let's say I did it to 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.030
 actual measurement that are 30 meters wide 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.689
 by 70 long and 10 meters high 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.020
 The floor is decorated with gold diamond 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.860
 what it is 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.140
 as you can see the red stone and what is the 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.250
 brilliant stone and this good one I take 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.560
 less wheat because it tells you with a few 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.050
 companions and good and I will teach a 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.520
 little bit more holidays includes 6 and you 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.520
 deis a like if you like a greeting
