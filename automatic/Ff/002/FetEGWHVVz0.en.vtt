00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.370
 so installation review 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.370
 bulls 10 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.920
 while children cadenza is not in my one ok 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.010
 so on there my computer is not new on 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.599
 scratch don't watch it just now 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.720
 set it turns out that's what it means 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.250
 block 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 from bkk boat which goes under the panel 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.349
 she is in any case if anyone and not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.340
 will find 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.920
 she can be either down here she is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.070
 next to the clock pad which goes on 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.070
 clock 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.090
 so we connect two pads 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.270
 then we take the wire ordinary wire 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:07.900
 we insert we throw bosom white white wire 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.490
 which comes from bortovik here are the cases 2 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.720
 Vika and falls on the block from the panel 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.610
 where did you get pierced not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.350
 diagnose your cars with him 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.670
 bortovik will work on all functions 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.060
 the expense will not show there me 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.220
 through gave the engine temperature 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.710
 then this black wire goes to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.410
 who does not know a diagnostic block that 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.080
 I explain this under the wheel of a car 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.340
 VAZ 2010 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:48.130
 1211 entire range 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:52.450
 look here right here she shove 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.200
 its in connector m terminal here this connector m 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.840
 connector m here it is 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.620
 m suggests that it is 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.810
 knees and then he has to come here all in 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.240
 principle bortovik connected preferably 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.240
 do this engine off 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.939
 ignition 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.889
 they did just that show already 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:20.870
 promoted so if somehow 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.680
 this way you won't find this one 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.680
 under the panel 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.639
 I explain that where goes red + black 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.639
 black wire mass 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.360
 pink wire to the fuel pump it is this 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.730
 pink wire is present here on 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.290
 instrument panel when you shoot some 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.760
 of the chips where you find so blue 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.760
 ignition wire 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:59.950
 lilac temperature sensor white to line 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.690
 generation diagnostics 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.470
 and backlight and stone hope 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.390
 everyone understands 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.460
 which is incomprehensible comments will write 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.880
 time to answer 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.520
 All in principle that thanks to the mouths of reason 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.340
 there would be awkward to pull out there 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.970
 others are much harder from 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.970
 absent
