thing<00:02:42.030> here<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.120> can<00:02:43.239> see<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> price<00:02:43.660> six

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
thing here you can see the price six

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.370 
thing here you can see the price six
nine<00:02:44.320> nine<00:02:44.350> zero<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> receipt<00:02:46.540> of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.290 

the<00:02:50.380> cohort<00:02:50.739> over

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.470 

these<00:02:55.300> are<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.480> modes<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.620> microwave<00:02:57.070> has

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
these are the modes so the microwave has

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.310 
these are the modes so the microwave has
five<00:02:58.480> modes<00:02:59.040> from<00:03:00.040> 100<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.400> ten<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.110> is

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
five modes from 100 to ten so that is

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.890 
five modes from 100 to ten so that is
the<00:03:02.410> power<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:03.610> grill<00:03:03.880> grill<00:03:04.270> has<00:03:04.390> two<00:03:04.690> modes

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
the power the grill grill has two modes

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.250 
the power the grill grill has two modes
here<00:03:06.330> convection<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.510> convection<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.080> can

grill and accordingly and the start and

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.700 
grill and accordingly and the start and
stop<00:03:32.980> button<00:03:33.450> I'll<00:03:34.450> quickly<00:03:34.750> keep<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.560> some

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
stop button I'll quickly keep in some

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:51.860 
stop button I'll quickly keep in some
water<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.220> heat<00:03:36.460> it<00:03:36.490> up<00:03:36.700> using<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.540> microwave

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.350 

so<00:03:52.440> here<00:03:52.590> we<00:03:52.739> have<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.010> water<00:03:53.330> be<00:03:54.330> careful

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
so here we have the water be careful

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.650 
so here we have the water be careful
because<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.349> glass<00:03:55.560> gets<00:03:55.800> really<00:03:56.099> warm<00:03:56.280> and

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
because the glass gets really warm and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:04.160 
because the glass gets really warm and
the<00:03:57.660> water<00:03:58.290> too<00:03:58.500> so<00:04:01.430> 40<00:04:02.569> seconds<00:04:03.569> with<00:04:03.989> the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
the water too so 40 seconds with the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.410 
the water too so 40 seconds with the
maximum<00:04:04.440> power<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.459> water<00:04:05.670> was<00:04:05.910> quite<00:04:06.060> warm

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
maximum power the water was quite warm

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.089 
maximum power the water was quite warm
so<00:04:06.599> here<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.140> can<00:04:07.260> see<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.470> grill<00:04:07.680> so

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
so here you can see the grill so

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.970 
so here you can see the grill so
whenever<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.670> heat<00:04:09.599> up<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> grill<00:04:09.989> this

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
whenever you heat up the grill this

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.770 
whenever you heat up the grill this
thing<00:04:11.220> gets<00:04:11.400> heated<00:04:11.610> up<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.450> red<00:04:12.599> color

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
thing gets heated up and the red color

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.729 
thing gets heated up and the red color
grill<00:04:13.080> that<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:13.440> see<00:04:13.560> inside<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.709> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
grill that you see inside this is the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.909 
grill that you see inside this is the
kit<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.310> get<00:04:20.549> along<00:04:21.209> with<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.510> oven

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
kit that you get along with this oven

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.590 
kit that you get along with this oven
you<00:04:22.919> have<00:04:22.950> some<00:04:23.250> vessels<00:04:23.730> inside<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.360> let's

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
you have some vessels inside it so let's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.360 
you have some vessels inside it so let's
see<00:04:24.750> what<00:04:24.870> we<00:04:24.990> have<00:04:25.139> here<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.340> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
see what we have here so this is the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.190 
see what we have here so this is the
normal<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.970> rice<00:04:27.750> bowl<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.410> which<00:04:29.130> you<00:04:29.310> have<00:04:29.460> the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
normal a rice bowl in which you have the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.810 
normal a rice bowl in which you have the
vessels<00:04:31.200> for<00:04:31.260> Italy<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.430> can<00:04:32.550> make<00:04:32.700> your

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
vessels for Italy so you can make your
