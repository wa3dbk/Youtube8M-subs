00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
blocks right down to fordham road i like

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.350 
blocks right down to fordham road i like
to<00:00:43.489> wait<00:00:43.760> till<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.030> get<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.239> jerome<00:00:44.690> avenue<00:00:45.460> but

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.920

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
see there's the train down there if you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320
