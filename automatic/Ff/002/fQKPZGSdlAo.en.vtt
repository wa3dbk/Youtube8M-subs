 Lake of the youtube good to leave to you a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.389
 video talking about region lock 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.700
 for movies that xbox has face I just 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.770
 discovering the bad way there that the xbox 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.990
 has region symbol for movies and not 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.430
 I knew I knew I had to play more 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 for movies I did not know that I did not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.550
 understood very region of things is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 because we end up buying for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.810
 example buy the games games are 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 ntsc works throughout the territory through Thursday 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.529
 of the Americas, right? 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.759
 but the movies is more complicated the hole 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.590
 it's more below, right? 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.070
 because then I bought two original films 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.809
 It's been a little longer a week there. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 a metrics I 'll tell you a bit 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.190
 delicate that I simply one of the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.500
 movies that I like the most 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 short and middle echelon I love philosophy 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.190
 of the film knows the whole concept that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 movie brings philosophically speaking 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.160
 Understand the I love this movie, I love it. 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.020
 understand I'm crazy about metz metrics and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.609
 I got lord of the rings I got 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 because I 've never watched lord of the rings 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.660
 This same lot of people will want me. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 even anxious with this lord of the rings 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.250
 had been the meters but my 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.590
 new themes and an advantage of xbox 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.970
 xbox makes it small and in the movies ie 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.130
 the picture quality is better 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 of his DVD and he kind of gives a 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.060
 increased by fugue is not a fire of 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 real understands ops kim 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.240
 you give an improvement in the image gives a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.920
 dinho treatment to give an improvement 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 picture scene 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.150
 but then what the mouth that drove a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.979
 Dude, I want you two now. 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.329
 Take care as I'm going to take 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.729
 be careful now when you buy 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.340
 a movie that is the next you look 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.020
 back the duty of all the duty to generate 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.860
 a guy all I've seen to this day guys 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.159
 come here oh 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.130
 so seeing that way and catching focus 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.320
 here on the camera that the camera has to have 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.200
 which take a bit of focus here but he 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.390
 There's a number four left here. 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.570
 they are seeing the number 4 then he 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.450
 that 4 symbol on the planet and the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.000
 planet earth on that map that 4a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.950
 dvd region 4 and the region is the region 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 sold to the dvds of Brazil for 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.440
 to run on Brazilian devices 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.780
 see you only if you have a xbox manufactured 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.760
 in brazil you run this movie what? 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.530
 it's not my case my xbox is north 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.210
 american united states 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.230
 then in the United States the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.030
 films region 1 and the region 4 does not rotate 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.620
 obviously as I said it is blocked in 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.990
 region and I'm not even that in the middle 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.490
 them and unfortunately also the lord of 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.910
 rings you can see here 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.580
 it is region 4 so well unfortunately pricey 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.500
 What a pity I could not watch then if two 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.970
 movies, I'm only now when I buy one. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.490
 new notebook then because it has 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.350
 dvd player at home what i had is 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.180
 it will take a while before you can 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.340
 these movies but I'll put on the console 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.530
 for you see let it open here 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.930
 open the Lord of the Rings here you can 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.200
 see that you see how original it is 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.180
 even all right but come on let's go 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.830
 get it here it's really cheap dvd in the face 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.430
 I bought putz 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.510
 I paid $ 15 in the movie, that's it. Come on. 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.420
 by xbox here and we'll see what it gives 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.250
 you must see the error that happens already 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.870
 I show you in practice how it is that 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.220
 It's the problem is that sometimes people 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.180
 ends up having this blocking business 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.280
 nÃ© region 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.200
 Sorry for the camera too. 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.459
 will reproduce dvd I will press here the 9th 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.690
 in xbox control 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:38.459
 Let's see, look, it was not possible. 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.450
 to reproduce the duty of the code from 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.370
 region is unsuitable for this console 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.340
 boring that annoying face that anger that 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.330
 gives stall region 1 that anger but the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.820
 People have to get used to it. 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.910
 do what the console is so then the 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.890
 People have to obey this, so it's just 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.470
 I want you to understand and console 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.989
 region one is the Brazilian 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.160
 do not run or sorry Brazilian console 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.070
 region 4 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.500
 You Buy Movies With Region 4 Console 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.650
 What is the United States you buy from? 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.780
 region 1 to the region of the 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.180
 united states but there is a salvation 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.979
 a very cool thing that is what I 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.100
 I know I already knew about the games but they work 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.470
 the movies also that is region free that is 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.600
 the free is usually written here 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.400
 behind is the planet with 14 lines 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.150
 that I had spoken to you instead 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.729
 of 4 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.169
 is or written to 'le sometimes he 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.300
 It also has some faces that they are 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.860
 region I have already encountered some 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.320
 movies that was in eighth the number one 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.970
 and number 4 are then movies that go 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.800
 rotate both in North American console 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.660
 how many Brazilian islands 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.490
 so always take a look back is the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.039
 see if it will be compatible with the console 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.919
 How did I talk to Brazilian soil? 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:52.620
 region 4 with bound solids region 1 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.990
 or you can buy a free region that 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.840
 sometimes it is written back as to type 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.630
 English which is the ll taxi and unifies all 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.070
 which is for all regions if you 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.100
 buy this is for all regions and 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.389
 will run on any console but it is not 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.150
 That's it , people, I just wanted to get this tip. 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.520
