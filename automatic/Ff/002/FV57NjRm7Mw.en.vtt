00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
I can change the route type or I can see

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.990 
I can change the route type or I can see
that<00:03:57.660> here<00:03:58.019> for<00:03:58.530> example<00:03:59.010> by<00:03:59.489> going<00:03:59.640> here<00:03:59.970> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
that here for example by going here I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.490 
that here for example by going here I
can<00:04:00.269> see<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:02.340> turn<00:04:02.819> off<00:04:03.000> road<00:04:03.989> toll<00:04:04.290> so

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
can see that I can turn off road toll so

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.770 
can see that I can turn off road toll so
I<00:04:04.590> can<00:04:04.769> turn<00:04:04.980> off<00:04:05.220> unpaved<00:04:06.090> roads<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.690> things

I can turn off unpaved roads and things

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.839 
I can turn off unpaved roads and things
of<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:07.260> have<00:04:08.220> everything<00:04:08.670> connected

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
of that I have everything connected

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.400 
of that I have everything connected
right<00:04:09.180> now<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:09.420> I've<00:04:09.480> been<00:04:09.599> gone<00:04:09.720> every<00:04:10.019> every

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
right now so I've been gone every every

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.390 
right now so I've been gone every every
possible<00:04:10.890> route<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:13.560> we<00:04:13.709> go<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:13.980> here<00:04:14.160> again

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
possible route if we go in here again

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.390 
possible route if we go in here again
and<00:04:14.849> we<00:04:14.940> say<00:04:15.090> alternative<00:04:15.630> route<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.400> can

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
and we say alternative route I can

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.840 
and we say alternative route I can
change<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.820> route<00:04:18.000> type<00:04:18.890> which<00:04:19.890> means<00:04:19.919> right

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
change the route type which means right

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.440 
change the route type which means right
now<00:04:20.880> it's<00:04:21.329> going<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> most<00:04:23.240> winding<00:04:24.240> roads

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
now it's going to the most winding roads

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.570 
now it's going to the most winding roads
I<00:04:24.720> can<00:04:25.470> find<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.800> most<00:04:25.890> environmentally

walking routes bicycle routes so if I
change<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.050> one<00:04:37.229> now<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.250> the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
change this one now to the to the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.420 
change this one now to the to the
quickest

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.610 

it<00:04:43.430> will<00:04:43.639> reroute<00:04:43.969> sit<00:04:44.210> self<00:04:44.449> and<00:04:45.379> then<00:04:45.499> will

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
it will reroute sit self and then will

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.110 
it will reroute sit self and then will
of<00:04:45.710> course<00:04:45.860> then<00:04:46.069> choose<00:04:46.279> highway<00:04:46.729> problem

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
of course then choose highway problem

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.410 
of course then choose highway problem
they<00:04:47.599> will<00:04:47.749> be<00:04:47.900> killed<00:04:48.080> much<00:04:48.289> faster

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.810 

so<00:04:53.420> instead<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.920> seven<00:04:54.920> hours<00:04:55.070> on<00:04:55.400> down<00:04:55.640> to

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.630 
so instead of seven hours on down to
three<00:04:56.000> hours<00:04:56.360> now<00:04:56.510> so<00:04:57.250> it's<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.340> big<00:04:58.490> use

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
three hours now so it's a big use

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.380 
three hours now so it's a big use
