00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.760
 blessing first as a human being and 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.380

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.220

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.850
 today his life 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 it's not something that is once said to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 look, I'm an example of following not at 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.090
 opposite is a responsibility that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.180

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.680
 share what I'm doing 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.180

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.160

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.760
 dream I think that I have that 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.350

 He gave so much love and what is important is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.440
 not believe but I think that the important 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.630
 is to be able to share it with people is not 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.280
 to that joy I have in day of power 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.540
 do what I like to do but to the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.060
 same time is to let them know that two 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.500
 possible is to share is to say no of 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.120
 some form or another everything in life 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.220

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.020
 life to achieve something is to be alive then
