00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.490
 good and then now we're going to 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.340
 place the electric current this 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.770
 electric current is located in the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.170
 points 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.470
 culture 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.259
 then the patient another patient said 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.029
 lose weight faster way 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.500
 mean we are going to locate them in 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.500
 abdomen and waist 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:41.010
 always these points these cables milestones 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.430
 that bring rivals in the end come by 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.270
 positive and negative pairs that are located 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.270
 in a positive and negative staggered way 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.769
 and see how I'm placing the most 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.440
 character and the products of the zones 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.580
 where the patient a patient want 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.230
 reduce localized fat 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.230
 in a more accelerated way 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.180
 here 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.700
 well now we are going to 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.230
 to learn the device that is the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.230
 separate electrode 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:31.039
 What is it 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.070
 the electrical frequency towards the needles 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:37.340
 and the information so that the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.140
 fat cells and can invest their 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.069
 content into the bloodstream 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.250
 and then go to the urine for distraction 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:49.520
 renal in practice sessions and 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.079
 we started gently to climb the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.649
 current the intensity of the current 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:57.860
 electrical until the patient or the 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.140
 patient of 25 who feels it 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.790
 then we asked 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.820
 accident in the patient 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.510
 you feel the current 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.510
 7 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.220
 we leave ground the loss 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.450
 and we leave the patient together with the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.970
 current and the needles half an hour 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.620
 now we are going to place auriculotherapy 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.450
 which is another reflexology that is a branch 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.650
 of culture and that will help us 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.520
 also decreases flours and sweets 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 let's go to that good and how can you observe 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.030
 after locating the needles in the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.420
 patient and the electric current is 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.540
 covering the patient with a blanket and 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.690
 leave a heating system so that 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.600
 feel more comfortable and allow one more 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.390
 fast relaxation 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.170
 well now let's place in the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:09.160
 thumbtack thumbtacks are some needles 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.410
 very small microscopic that are located 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.020
 in the auricular pavilion 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.180
 in some special points so that 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.780
 help the patient to reduce 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.390
 Tails flours and for the sweets 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:27.440
 then we are going to locate them 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.440
 Notice how it is clear microscopic 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.900
 breathe deeply 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.670
 that is the first needle the first 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.940
 point that is to accelerate the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.630
 natural metabolism 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.630
 now 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.200
 this point is to diminish the desire 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.040
 to eat sweets 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.390
 and the third point here 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.659
 breathe deeply that is to decrease 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.930
 the desire to eat there is then 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:14.439
 we had three mounds specifically 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.840
 each one serves for something different and 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.840
 now we are going to live with ribbons 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.870
 with the microphone 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.490
 This means we will allow 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.330
 needles do not fall 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.180
 to protect health so we put in 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.389
 the body 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.360
 we remove them after the hour of 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:46.610
 treatment of the patient and the lady 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.630
 that minorities are like that and those are 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.390
 permanent 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.820
 and they do not see how it does not matter that the patient 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.460
 use earring she can use 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.770
 any type of metal adhesion or 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:05.220
 of plastic does not matter because as they are 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:09.060
 needles does not interfere with the momentum and 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:12.330
 with the energy activation that they generate 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.900
 those shoelaces then is the vehicle 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.690
 therapy that will help us in partnership 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.360
 with traditional classical culture 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.030
 lessen anxiety about everything and to 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.030
 help in the launch process
