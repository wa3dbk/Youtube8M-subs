00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
neither one is toggled on so I can walk

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.280 
neither one is toggled on so I can walk
around<00:01:34.700> if<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.120> need<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.420> sprint<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:36.020> double

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
around if I need to sprint then I double

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.260 
around if I need to sprint then I double
tap<00:01:36.320> W<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.159> like<00:01:37.340> normal<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:37.970> I'm<00:01:38.180> gonna

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
tap W just like normal and I'm gonna

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.820 
tap W just like normal and I'm gonna
sprint<00:01:38.540> around<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.080> want<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.350> shift<00:01:39.620> I'm

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
sprint around if I want to shift I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.860 
sprint around if I want to shift I'm
gonna<00:01:40.010> hold<00:01:40.370> shift<00:01:40.820> if<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.090> let<00:01:41.270> go<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.479> shift

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
gonna hold shift if I let go of shift

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.280 
gonna hold shift if I let go of shift
then<00:01:42.200> I'll<00:01:42.409> start<00:01:42.710> then<00:01:43.370> I'll<00:01:43.490> unstick

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
then I'll start then I'll unstick

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.289 
then I'll start then I'll unstick
whereas<00:01:45.290> if<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.770> do<00:01:45.830> enable<00:01:46.430> these<00:01:46.790> two<00:01:47.060> things

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
whereas if I do enable these two things

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.420 
whereas if I do enable these two things
so<00:01:47.420> I'm<00:01:47.510> going<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.690> enable<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:48.320> toggle<00:01:48.890> sprint

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
so I'm going to enable a toggle sprint

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.789 
so I'm going to enable a toggle sprint
and<00:01:49.670> I'm<00:01:49.940> going<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.210> enable<00:01:50.360> toggle<00:01:50.960> sneak<00:01:51.380> so

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
and I'm going to enable toggle sneak so

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.770 
and I'm going to enable toggle sneak so
now<00:01:51.979> if<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.310> hit<00:01:52.460> W<00:01:52.880> I'm<00:01:53.090> just<00:01:53.240> automatically

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
now if I hit W I'm just automatically

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.240 
now if I hit W I'm just automatically
going<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.049> start<00:01:54.170> running<00:01:54.440> similar<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.130> the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
going to start running similar to the

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.940 
going to start running similar to the
better<00:01:55.400> sprint<00:01:55.790> mod<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.930> if<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.170> hit<00:01:57.320> shift<00:01:57.680> I'm

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
better sprint mod and if I hit shift I'm

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.490 
better sprint mod and if I hit shift I'm
just<00:01:58.310> going<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.060> just<00:01:59.479> simply<00:01:59.900> press<00:02:00.140> shift
