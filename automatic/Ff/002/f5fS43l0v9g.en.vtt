00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.340
 here he has to meet with the computer and 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.340
 we have a little thing because we are what 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.240
 you see here we do not have our own kitchen 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.369
 so then we have many 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.590
 collaborations of recognized friends 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.419
 I started to graduate from the clear ones I would read you 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.099
 for example now we have Italian cinema 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.130
 or more tasting that is a combination 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.599
 between cinema and kitchen and the dish is the one 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.759
 it comes out in the movie after taking there 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.160
 outside and also between the cinema is a 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.500
 Very family room very homely very 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.089
 comfortable only fit 11 people we can 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.670
 ask them of all kinds for each age 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.289
 for each personality type not to 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.510
 Sometimes you want to come and have some 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.609
 beers and laugh or well in the morning 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.039
 you want to see something that interests you so more 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.440
 quiet creates a quite atmosphere 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.030
 pimp's passion not interesting that to 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.999
 Sometimes people who did not know each other at all 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.440
 out of the movie and go commenting 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.420
 I liked it, I did not like it and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.420
 they chat for a while and they ride a kind 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.679
 of mini film forum improvised apart from 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.449
 get the movies that is already a 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.130
 I also work in an original version with 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.750
 subtitles in Spanish because always 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.000
 looking for new things, original things 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.510
 we do not have a workshop of this month 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.060
 script 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.710
 jorge naranjo last month we made the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.420
 first short ski festival there's no 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.790
 Many collaborations are part of the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.890
 selection of footwear merchants and 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.090
 we collaborate a lot of things you 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.640
 You send me people after talking 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.060
 every project like the posters or you come 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.100
 here to present your book in the living room and 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.810
 then I send your bookstore and although 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.460
 it seems that it has nothing to do forever 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.510
 there are many possibilities for collaboration 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.160
 magazines with NGOs with schools we 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 we inspired in places we had seen 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.560
 in which we had been that we 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.390
 they had liked it a lot 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.549
 particularly there was one in vietnam at 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.740
 that many backpackers and put 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.110
 old movies and they also came 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.000
 waiter and it served you anything from 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.740
 menu while you watch the movie and we 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.360
 loved it was very small it's always 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.000
 based all in reality on what to you 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.470
 you would love to do and thinking that if you 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 love your friends you love it 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.350
 they will sing more people we are two 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.110
 people that we had experience in 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.260
 this but a lot of illusion and we liked 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.300
 a lot and you learn it starts small and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.350
 people start to get interested and who 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.350
 he knows where he can finish it
