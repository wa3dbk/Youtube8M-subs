00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.230
 The internet there is a lot of people talking 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.329

 The staff that is coming now is 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.679
 learning confused 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.809

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:58.010

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.370
 what he is doing is compatible what 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.870
 He talks to the work he does. 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.720

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.150

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.400

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.940
 What does he say, what are you talking about? 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.100
 with work is on the same level 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.650
 the following when I work, I 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.080
 I leave with my machine attached to my 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.740
 Hand needle cap wants 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.150
 she gets hot when I call she arrives 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.640
 This will depend on the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.840
 machine configuration but on average 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.620
 gets to come out one and a half to 2 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.530
 mm, I just do not work, okay? 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.050
 I do not work with more than this sometimes. 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.840
 Can I help you a little bit? 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.580
 thing just a little bit depending on the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 region than the body I am going to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.180
 to tattoo 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.050
 you know that the thickness of the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:03.020
 human skin it varies from body site 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.230
 have areas that are thinner and will 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.140
 although areas she will be thicker 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.660
 now leaves the needle out of the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.080
 play when your machine is off 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.520
 This is who already is here already 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.150
 tattoos ap 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.760
 this can burst the trace this can 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.440
 cause skin damage and this can 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.620
 technology 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.330
 so I'll leave a link there from one of 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.800
 a video I recorded should have around 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.140
 10 minutes 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.030
 It's time that I 'm explaining better. 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.240
 about this subject 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.730
 another doubt that I see there in the hymn and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.160
 kind of when I the person I owe 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.770
 to touch my skin when I'm 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.150
 acting or not needing to 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.890
 to touch 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.020
 when I started to make tattoos 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.270
 I could put my toe on my skin because 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.350
 my line comes out a bit firmer and 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.870
 solid 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.420
 I'm not that strong now, so I'm going 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.580
 following the outline there the toe 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.880
 a little off the skin 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.490
 if your machine counts off the needle 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.930
 is hand wants cap has no problem 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.300
 that you are going to 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.850
 rewind if you watch the video you 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.630
 I told you, you will understand better and 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.480
 now if she's one out like I see 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.480
 personal field speaks on the internet there 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.100
 out and you touch the peak on the skin 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.430
 You will muck the skin of your 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.610
 customer, so stay tuned in that detail 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.310
