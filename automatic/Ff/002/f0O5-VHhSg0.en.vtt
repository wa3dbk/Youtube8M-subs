you<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> mini-map<00:00:23.430> now<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.449> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you see it on the mini-map now this is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.500 
you see it on the mini-map now this is
the<00:00:24.810> fourth<00:00:25.199> time<00:00:25.730> that<00:00:26.730> I've<00:00:26.820> had<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the fourth time that I've had one in

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.300 
the fourth time that I've had one in
this<00:00:27.810> location<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.710> starting<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.099> think

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
this location and I'm starting to think

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
this location and I'm starting to think
that's<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.449> than<00:00:30.630> coincidence<00:00:31.080> I've

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
that's that's more than coincidence I've

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
that's that's more than coincidence I've
only<00:00:31.679> seen<00:00:31.949> about<00:00:31.980> seven<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:32.850> something

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
only seen about seven or something

in-game until after you'll see something

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
in-game until after you'll see something
else<00:00:38.129> after<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.579> well<00:00:38.730> right<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.870> know

random<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.670> random<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.270> sometimes<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.079> know

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
random is random and sometimes you know

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.799 
random is random and sometimes you know
random<00:00:50.010> situations<00:00:50.640> throw<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.239> random

random situations throw up random
occurrences<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:54.420> person<00:00:54.899> could

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
occurrences you know so one person could

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.470 
occurrences you know so one person could
just<00:00:55.199> luckily<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> same<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.940> results

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
just luckily get the same good results

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.389 
just luckily get the same good results
in<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.989> place<00:00:58.289> loads<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.010> times

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
in one place loads of times

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.930 
in one place loads of times
I<00:01:00.170> understand<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.680> happen<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I understand that that can happen but to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.939 
I understand that that can happen but to
me<00:01:03.090> there's<00:01:03.539> two<00:01:03.570> things<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
me there's two things really that I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.060 
me there's two things really that I
think<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> main<00:01:05.760> potentials<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:07.070> one

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
think are the main potentials here one

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310 
think are the main potentials here one
is<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> root<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.049> by

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
is that there is some kind of root of by

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
is that there is some kind of root of by
Martin's<00:01:10.770> house<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.159> these<00:01:11.310> guard<00:01:11.580> fans<00:01:11.970> go

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
Martin's house that these guard fans go

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.550 
Martin's house that these guard fans go
by<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> other<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.600> regardless<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
by and the other is that regardless of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
by and the other is that regardless of
where<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> Vans<00:01:17.159> actually<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
where the Vans actually are going to be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
where the Vans actually are going to be
they<00:01:18.659> spawn<00:01:19.049> near<00:01:19.409> where<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> player<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.159> does

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
they spawn near where the player is does

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.660 
they spawn near where the player is does
that<00:01:20.700> make<00:01:20.850> sense<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.530> either<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.400> kind

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that make sense so either they just kind

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
that make sense so either they just kind
of<00:01:23.790> spawn<00:01:24.000> near<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> player<00:01:25.049> every<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.950> often

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
of spawn near the player every so often

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.850 
of spawn near the player every so often
and<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.509> timing<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.530> totally

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and the timing of it is just totally

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.890 
and the timing of it is just totally
random<00:01:29.420> or<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.470> an<00:01:31.619> actual<00:01:31.920> route<00:01:32.310> um

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
random or they have an actual route um

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.179 
random or they have an actual route um
now<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.820> think<00:01:36.200> sorry<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.590> trying<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.979> find

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
now I think sorry just trying to find

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:38.870 
now I think sorry just trying to find
this<00:01:38.369> fucker

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
this fucker

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.670 
this fucker
well<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> slow<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.200> trying<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> put<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
well you slow down I'm trying to put a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.160 
well you slow down I'm trying to put a
sticky<00:01:41.009> bomb<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.110> do

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
sticky bomb on you I think if they do

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
sticky bomb on you I think if they do
have<00:01:43.530> an<00:01:43.649> actual<00:01:43.799> route<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.700> obviously<00:01:45.119> well

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
have an actual route it's obviously well

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.719 
have an actual route it's obviously well
worth<00:01:45.540> knowing<00:01:45.829> but<00:01:46.829> even<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
worth knowing but even if it is that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.399 
worth knowing but even if it is that
it's<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.210> totally<00:01:48.570> random<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.140> spawn

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
it's just totally random and they spawn

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.469 
it's just totally random and they spawn
near<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> player<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:51.090> well<00:01:51.299> worth

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
near the player that's also well worth

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.700 
near the player that's also well worth
knowing<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.200> means<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.500> shouldn't

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
knowing because it means we shouldn't

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.319 
knowing because it means we shouldn't
waste<00:01:53.130> our<00:01:53.340> time<00:01:53.369> trying<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> find<00:01:54.119> these

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
waste our time trying to find these

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.530 
waste our time trying to find these
things<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.310> yeah<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:57.060> them<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.479> know

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
that so when I finish a mission I don't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.780 
that so when I finish a mission I don't
need<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> jump<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.770> see<00:03:48.920> what's<00:03:49.130> around<00:03:49.280> me<00:03:49.520> and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
need a jump to see what's around me and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.400 
need a jump to see what's around me and
this<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.210> what's<00:03:50.390> happened<00:03:50.720> each<00:03:50.810> time<00:03:51.140> I've

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
this is what's happened each time I've

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.620 
this is what's happened each time I've
found<00:03:51.650> these<00:03:52.660> they've<00:03:53.660> been<00:03:53.900> like<00:03:55.630> not

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
found these they've been like not

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.120 
found these they've been like not
immediately<00:03:57.170> after<00:03:57.410> I've<00:03:57.500> jumped<00:03:57.680> out<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.920> a

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
immediately after I've jumped out of a

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.430 
immediately after I've jumped out of a
mission<00:03:58.460> but<00:03:58.640> members<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.270> couple<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.080> minutes

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
mission but members a couple of minutes

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.199 
mission but members a couple of minutes
so<00:04:01.400> what<00:04:01.760> I'd<00:04:01.880> say<00:04:02.120> T<00:04:02.180> is<00:04:02.390> is<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:03.140> worthwhile

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
so what I'd say T is is it's worthwhile

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.130 
so what I'd say T is is it's worthwhile
you<00:04:05.209> know<00:04:05.330> if<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.570> complete<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:05.990> mission

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
you know if you complete the mission

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.020 
you know if you complete the mission
which<00:04:06.410> leaves<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.800> up<00:04:06.950> at<00:04:07.130> Martins<00:04:07.520> house

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
which leaves you up at Martins house

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.520 
which leaves you up at Martins house
I'd<00:04:08.720> say<00:04:08.930> it's<00:04:09.080> going<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.260> be<00:04:09.320> worthwhile

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
I'd say it's going to be worthwhile

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.440 
I'd say it's going to be worthwhile
hanging<00:04:10.160> around<00:04:10.400> or<00:04:10.610> driving<00:04:10.850> around<00:04:11.180> there

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
hanging around or driving around there

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.090 
hanging around or driving around there

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
lose a couple of minutes of your life in

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.620 
lose a couple of minutes of your life in
which<00:04:16.310> case<00:04:16.520> you'll<00:04:16.669> probably<00:04:17.030> see<00:04:17.359> me<00:04:17.390> and

getting<00:04:21.859> them<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:23.210> yet<00:04:23.419> in<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.440> particular

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
getting them so yet in this particular

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.620 
getting them so yet in this particular
instance<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:25.550> couldn't<00:04:25.910> find<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.480> van

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
instance I couldn't find the van

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.080 
instance I couldn't find the van
anywhere<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:28.010> did<00:04:28.280> have<00:04:28.460> quite<00:04:28.730> a<00:04:28.760> bit<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:29.030> a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
anywhere and I did have quite a bit of a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.520 
anywhere and I did have quite a bit of a
drive<00:04:29.300> around<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:29.990> it's<00:04:30.230> just<00:04:30.410> completely

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
drive around and it's just completely

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.530 
drive around and it's just completely
gone<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:31.280> there<00:04:31.760> obviously<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:32.060> some<00:04:32.240> kind<00:04:32.450> of

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
gone so there obviously is some kind of

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.900 
gone so there obviously is some kind of
timer<00:04:32.780> what<00:04:33.530> happened<00:04:33.919> was<00:04:34.070> after<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.520> finished

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
timer what happened was after I finished

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.840 
timer what happened was after I finished
that<00:04:35.030> mission<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:36.620> can't<00:04:37.460> remember<00:04:37.610> now<00:04:37.730> I

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
that mission I can't remember now I

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.580 
that mission I can't remember now I
probably<00:04:38.330> went<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.690> get<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.840> glass<00:04:38.990> of<00:04:39.140> juice<00:04:39.350> or

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
probably went to get a glass of juice or

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.790 
probably went to get a glass of juice or
say<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.250> made<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.640> smoke<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.270> know<00:04:41.840> I<00:04:42.020> was<00:04:42.440> doing

say I made a smoke you know I was doing

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.260 
say I made a smoke you know I was doing
something<00:04:43.070> for<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.400> few<00:04:43.490> minutes<00:04:43.790> just<00:04:43.850> sitting

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270
