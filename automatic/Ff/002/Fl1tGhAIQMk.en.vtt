00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:49.890
 following the breakdowns is this a way to 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.890
 we stick to the repair 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.060
 obviously 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:52.259
 this trio is all so people I have 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.259
 say no you are you cowards and 2022 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:47.910
 yes and no 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.620
 c 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.620
 only one on the ranks 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:29.319
 number of suicides will be entitled to 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:58.599
 hard game and august 2006 let's be we are 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.519
 really 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.150
 and I think that through a comedy we 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.370
 can address serious topics as well 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.660
 so finally it's a little bit that's it 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.829
 boxes in which we range but 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.209
 I hope they are all cases a 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.880
 book that takes people elsewhere and 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.400
 not far from the idea with the book it was 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.900
 to sift through all the codes 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.949
 every moment every question 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.389
 when we fall in love 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.410
 when we meet someone when we 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.690
 try to find out 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.360
 so there are all these questions that we get 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.500
 poses all girls and boys sometimes in 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.699
 taking risks sometimes 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.470
 spying a little sometimes 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.710
 except that there situations are pushed 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.389
 to the extreme and it's a bit for me 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.160
 the digest of everything I saw at 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.470
 my female friends and my friends love 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.330
 also from worst to best of funniest 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.560
 the most touching and then of what I have 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 imagined a lot because there is no 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.500
 damage no anecdotes really stolen 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.729
 and in a story that would be enough 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.729
 iconic a bit like a fable 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.160
 the title tomorrow I'm stopping is reference 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.470
 at these times we all have or actually 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.720
 we promise ourselves where we take resolutions 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.770
 where we know the solutions but we have 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.380
 wrong to put them in place 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.180
 we all know her and where these species of 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.430
 grand declarations of relief 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.099
 decide that tomorrow we usually stop 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.599
 we know how it ends 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.440
 nature gets back on it's okay 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.440
 a little further 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.630
 so one of the things that in this book 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.630
 that I ask is it you what is the 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.639
 the most stupid thing you did 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.440
 is actually me the most stupid thing 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.660
 that I did the first one that comes to me 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.940
 among the many is to do the 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.270
 corpse for a friend who needed 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.100
 of a very good excuse for not 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.060
 see a girl who was sticking to him here I 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.060
 make the corpse for you
