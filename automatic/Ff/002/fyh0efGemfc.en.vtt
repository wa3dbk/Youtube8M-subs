00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.799
 servus in the last video we said 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.300
 was in Neuastenberg last video today 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.010
 already in winterberg in the morning 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.349
 afternoon neuastenberg it is beautiful 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.439
 calmly look like the commission 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.439
 here goes off the best 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.720
 Here we are still in Neuastenberg 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.150
 almost at the starting point of the band 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.270
 and it was also relative for that now 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.289
 constant 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.329
 with the lock after still open 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.829
 Definitely a good decision 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.630
 the top post this was the only one 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.250
 But joke was enough as well 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.259
 the 70 to 80 meters of lynx 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.579
 was also relatively fast around the piste 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.310
 in that still a certain basis 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.090
 the last sheet a relatively good one 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.819
 State 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.500
 the world is watching the providers always 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.329
 still diligently cropped tower 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.990
 about the snowmaking equipment at night 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.399
 go on 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.319
 We're doing the whole next week 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.519
 to expect that you almost consistently 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.290
 At the most, maybe you can crop it 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.700
 not at lunch time, if you go now 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.190
 looks to the right then you can also see 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.770
 that already started the fan park and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.570
 stands two cannons 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.010
 yes case is already that again 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.170
 nice festival 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.180
 hopefully you will have a quick start 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.320
 together generally can definitely 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.160
 to recommend is not really synonymous 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.850
 an alternative to abroad and 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.980
 the true difference 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.060
 the weather took care we hope that 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.740
 Now snow is the next real snow 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.210
 can be produced and think 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.530
 next week sees the world already 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.970
 again very different from no more 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.100
 to four years running but exciting 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.910
 Almost everything was back 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.270
 quasi snow cannons was from there 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.270
 a beautiful day
