00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.170
 These are not about five-year-old girls 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.740
 but adult men

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.849

 pony actually based on merchandise 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.410
 Little girls should have more toys 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.570
 buy ponies 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.290
 that the little horses are also male 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.460
 Nobody expected fans

 Tobias is 23 years old and has studied physics 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.110
 to meet today's bruni fan 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.110
 organized 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.730
 The shopping tour is part of the meeting 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.460
 about 60 celebs from all over Germany and 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.160
 The foreigners are there since Tobias is one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 year fan of my little pony love on 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.240
 the first view , however, usually not 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.610
 that I saw the series for the first time 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.510
 I thought oh my god 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.790
 55,000 children's series creek pond and 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:31.160
 completely meaningless money so me 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.020
 then I have watched longer then I am 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.030
 then he became aware of it 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.470
 that this series is a bit more 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.600
 has substance than most others 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.940
 child series the series shows the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 adventures of six ponies in common 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.210
 the secrets of friendship 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.259
 fathom 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.090
 Friendship is magic too 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.060
 motto of the series and one of the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.590
 LeitsprÃ¼che the brawnies on the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.210
 I have a lot of community 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.460
 People met with me 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.650
 really fun but that as mine 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.710
 would designate friends 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.590
 and I think that there are many others 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.970
 synonymous people in the normal case not so 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.630
 many friends have about the community 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.299
 getting to know people is their favorite 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.040
 werritty he especially appreciates the values 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.530
 which mediates the series 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.170
 friendship intolerance that is so 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.409
 pretty much the most important for celebs 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.459
 simply the possibility is given 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.629
 to be different 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.709
 I really liked that one not 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:39.390
 They give you these prefabricated ones 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.609
 stereotypical bruised maybe 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.409
 next time you look much closer 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.799
 even in strange books is what 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.719
 special invites people to love so much 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.389
 and to accept as they are 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.370
 this is important to the brawnies themselves 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.650
 However, they are not always accepted 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.049
 many do not understand that young men 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.459
 A children's series and funny horses are great 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:07.560
 find us even pedophilia or 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.560
 something has been accused two 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.840
 sixth thing I hear you have to go with 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.310
 Life 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.599
 The bruins have decided on her 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.790
 hobby not by stupid sayings 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.829
 to be ruined by your time 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.970
 they have a lot at the brawnies 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.970
 learned 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.680
 I have become more open and I have it 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.870
 easier to let people over what i have 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.090
 I can say that I am less 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.610
 shy and actually a lot of times 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.940
 on the tolerance of tolerance 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.340
 Friendship and individuality that can 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.920
 one of my little pony and the brawnies 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.680
 learn and self-confidence to the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.810
 It's okay to stand what matters to you 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.410
 everything we hear on bonuses we do now 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.410
 a departure 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.330
 [Music] 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.650
