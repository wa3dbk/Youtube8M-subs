00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.640
 the people as they are 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.160
 and now let's go to the section of 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.930
 funniest questions from all of mexico 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.670
 and I do not mean the debate 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.640
 presidential last question the idea I 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.619
 8 let's see some questions from my little 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.570
 phone that was first the egg or the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.640
 chicken 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.040
 clearly chabelo jimena sanchez or paty 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 cantu or do you mean who would destroy 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.460
 of so much carnal passion or here I 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.480
 I would deliver in my heart 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.630
 unconditionally 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.610
 because there is no summary of that word 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.920
 annoying is for those people who do not 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.900
 wants to say poor to someone and not 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.730
 I am saying that poor and humble be 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.309
 the same but tell me if you have never 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.379
 heard something like that you already knew the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.930
 lopez are a pretty humble family 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.940
 when los lopez are poorer than in 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.440
 the imanol race today that is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.739
 feels that they make themselves the coolest pig 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.739
 Youtube 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.180
 and that feels like I do not know the number one 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.800
 of music on good youtube without soaking 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.890
 I would have been a very musical producer 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.540
 important here in mexico that invested 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.030
 very much very much money in my career 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.010
 artistic, probably the day of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 well I would feel so helpless how 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.530
 I feel at this moment for those children if 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.570
 you were the killer of a movie of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 terror how would you call yourself how you would kill 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 your victims strangely enough there 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.160
 thought about this a few days ago 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 I would probably call myself cramping and 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.890
 I would dedicate myself to beating my victims of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.140
 a very very creepy way and they 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 would give many cramps although if my 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.820
 victims end up with cramps maybe not 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 be very well interpreted but the name 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.790
 it's pretty sticky you bite pillows or 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.590
 blows nuncas I blow armed well that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.590
 pillow that is behind me blow it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.560
 a while ago I do not know what that means 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.610
 I think or panela smear cheese in the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.619
 panela as if you were a quesadilla of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.150
 cheese factories good since I currently live 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.350
 Mexico City 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.060
 maybe lady quesadilla of what is 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.010
 where does self obsession come from 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.480
 spelling of the frustration of not being able 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.670
 understand what the people were 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.320
 writing what is your song 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.320
 favorite opening of dragon ball 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.980
 I want to know looting his triumph in me what 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.530
 what are you dancing or if my heart 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.630
 enchanted shines 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.660
 how women resemble 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.790
 tornadoes destroy everything in their path they give 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.400
 turns to all things but nobody 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.069
 can say anything because its nature and 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.770
 aside when you turn around they are no longer there and leave 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.380
 everything is a chaos one direction justin 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.770
 bieber or jonas brothers the question is 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.770
 who have premenstrual fans more 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.220
 winter or summer I prefer summer in 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.020
 winter because h street is more 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.270
 black than a choco roll 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.950
 good question let's make a comparison 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.950
 here we have a choco roll 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.280
 nice cord and here we have a call of 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.390
 ax 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.390
 they are equal 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.890
 do you prefer a mac or a victim 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.410
 I have a mac and it is credited to the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.200
 videos and all that but it causes me a lot 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.030
 Intrigue know it's a big mac case 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.670
 It's a hamburger full of pens 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.550
 have you ever come to Veracruz, yes 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.010
 but it never is 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.620
 Shut your belly if it lets you see your 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.260
 penis does not let me see the feet coming 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.510
 because you do not take off your mustache but if not 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.510
 I take it out where you want me to put it 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.370
 as supports people I do not do it if 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.370
 you were invisible what would you do 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.880
 I will do the worst 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.080
 why the fuck did not you win the savior 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.270
 the savior for those who do not know 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.920
 a reality where we participate several 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.470
 bloggers and we had to do some 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.780
 dynamics on the internet to be able to win 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.340
 points and so win and well do not win 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.680
 because if it had come out that the winner 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.299
 was going to define in a stupid rally and not 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.910
 on twitter as I already knew preset 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.980
 well I would have read my book a hundred times 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.380
 of stupid activities for children 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.660
 delayed you have the eye that cuts you 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.900
 the hair the same people that go to your being 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.400

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.690
 best time and apart 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.509

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.229

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.770
 excitement of this a kiss 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.040
 huge on youtube what do you prefer xbox 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.530

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.570
 why is it so fucking cock people 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.190
 you say you are what you eat but that's what 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.310
 It's very weird since I do not remember having 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.800
 eaten a cock you already have kilo 4 of 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.300
 I already have it but I will be 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.310
 sincere I never doubted the games 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.870
 previous if I do not have any idea of 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.630
 the story but it's very strange to see 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.000
 a master chief in love with a hologram 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.750
 who talks to you all the time giving you 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.700
 indications 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.560
 it's like the link is in love 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.650
 no one is afraid to get to 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.720
 Stay without friends for being such a sucker 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.340
 I do not have friends if a vampire bites 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.170
 a zombie that passes the zombie is 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.780
 turns the papyrus into a zombie into a zombie 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.700
 which question is more stupid as not 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.500
 AIDS knows well start is 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.590
 truth that you know is lenderman by 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.150
 course it's a very well known guy in 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.500
 high society shut up if you knew that 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.550
 angelique boyer is pregnant 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.550
 It would be the first thing you would do 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:19.710
 yesterday you took the pills 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.710
 so 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.580

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.689
 I do not know when it's going to come maybe it's 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.729
 soon maybe within a year like the 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.490
 last time but finally 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.900

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.590

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.330
 Regarding the things that I do in my day 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.159
 a day yes but it is held by this 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.349
