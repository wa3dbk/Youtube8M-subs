00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.360
 the world 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.690
 hello friends how good this blog is going 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.149
 about garlic what we eat almost all 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.220
 the days at meals and that according to 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.370
 scientists from the state university of 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.480
 Washington has antibiotic effects 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.809
 about the digestive system 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.790
 and they say it works better than a 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.540
 antibiotic to kill said 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.730
 bacteria 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.700
 in particular to campylobacter 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.050
 Well, I read the old 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.490
 garlic contains sulfide dial and 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:14.330
 demonstrated its effectiveness against the bacterium 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.330
 Campylobacter campylobacter 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.820
 that cause colonies or colonies of 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.220
 bacteria 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.070
 the intestine 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.920
 according to say the good said substance the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.500
 sulphide from way to the wire is one hundred times more 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.840
 effective against these bacteria that 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.090
 antelopes that antibiotics forgive 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.290
 such as ciprofloxacin name the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.620
 ciprofloxacin which is a very antibiotic 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.080
 important do you take it not long ago 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.530
 it's like amoxicillin are antibiotics 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.530
 very common and erythromycin too 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.260
 apart from how good the garlic is 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.970
 healthy 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.720
 it's very healthy it does not hurt you that much 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.720
 as an antibiotic 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.070
 but good as the news says there is no 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.740
 guarantees that garlic can prevent 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.310
 poisoning alone why is 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.289
 recommend 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 the heat treatment of meat from 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.650
 bird as the most effective measure when 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.260
 type of poisoning but well I think 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.370
 that is a tremendous advance I knew that the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.099
 Garlic 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.690
 so much did that know how many people know 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.670
 that garlic works against 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.340
 determined 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.060
 good certain poisonings of the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.700
 intestine 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.489
 for example against these earthworms 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.040
 intestines worked very well us what 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.200
 they gave when we were little and nothing 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.410
 now apparently it is said to be one hundred 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.560
 times more powerful than said 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.040
 antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.040
 erythromycin 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.450
 well I leave the news the new garlic 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.650
 antibiotic yes sir come a greeting and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.220
 until another new blog we learn together 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.220
 people chau
