00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
an Oscar bait kind of film now if he

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.319 
an Oscar bait kind of film now if he
takes<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.920> doesn't<00:01:38.850> completely

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
takes that on it doesn't completely

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.030

exclude<00:01:39.840> him<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:39.990> doing<00:01:40.259> Star<00:01:40.560> Trek<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:40.950> i'm

exclude him from doing Star Trek but i'm
going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> guess<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> timing<00:01:42.060> becomes

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

us around this table are going to agree

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.220 
us around this table are going to agree
that<00:03:56.540> when<00:03:57.540> looking<00:03:57.780> at<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.900> plan<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
that when looking at the plan of the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.509 
that when looking at the plan of the
Apes<00:03:58.410> we<00:03:58.590> talked<00:03:58.769> about<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.070> strength<00:03:59.370> was

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
Apes we talked about the strength was

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.570 
Apes we talked about the strength was
obviously<00:03:59.850> Rupert's<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:01.220> masterful<00:04:02.220> handling

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
obviously Rupert's a masterful handling

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.250 
obviously Rupert's a masterful handling
of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> narrative<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.300> think<00:04:03.989> beyond<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.200> shadow

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
of the narrative I think beyond a shadow

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.630 
of the narrative I think beyond a shadow
of<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.680> doubt<00:04:04.709> we'll<00:04:05.040> all<00:04:05.280> agree<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.580> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
of a doubt we'll all agree it's the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.270 
of a doubt we'll all agree it's the
absolute<00:04:05.880> worst<00:04:06.239> part<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.900> film<00:04:07.280> was

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
