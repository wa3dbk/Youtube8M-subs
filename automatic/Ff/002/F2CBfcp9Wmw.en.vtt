00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
it Boeing Boeing because just to go of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.900 
it Boeing Boeing because just to go of
course<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.310> not<00:02:51.340> like<00:02:51.550> it's<00:02:51.700> really

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
course it's not like it's really

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.290

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.430 

connects<00:02:58.300> alone<00:02:59.640> some<00:03:00.640> ice<00:03:00.820> here<00:03:01.270> as<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
connects alone some ice here as this is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.050 
connects alone some ice here as this is
more<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.920> goal<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.250> course<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.730> mean<00:03:03.880> come

more of the goal of course I mean come
on<00:03:04.090> how<00:03:04.420> many<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.780> things<00:03:05.880> are<00:03:06.880> gonna<00:03:07.000> build<00:03:07.360> I

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
on how many go things are gonna build I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.620 
on how many go things are gonna build I
mean<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.890> not<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.040> anyone<00:03:09.730> even<00:03:10.000> please<00:03:10.270> go

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
mean it's not like anyone even please go

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.320 
mean it's not like anyone even please go
for<00:03:10.870> my<00:03:10.990> god<00:03:11.260> well<00:03:11.760> they<00:03:12.760> kind<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.030> play<00:03:13.150> like

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
for my god well they kind of play like

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.770 
for my god well they kind of play like
ice<00:03:13.570> go<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:15.910> got<00:03:16.030> some<00:03:16.150> more<00:03:16.269> obsidian

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
ice go so you got some more obsidian

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.729 
ice go so you got some more obsidian
here<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.400> it's<00:03:18.730> not<00:03:18.880> very<00:03:19.750> likely<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.380> don't

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
here so it's not very likely I don't

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.860 
here so it's not very likely I don't
think<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.310> Yogscast<00:03:21.850> would<00:03:22.000> use<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.600> much

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
think the Yogscast would use this much

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.259 
think the Yogscast would use this much
obsidian<00:03:23.440> personally<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.910> allowed

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
obsidian personally and this allowed

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.660 
obsidian personally and this allowed
more<00:03:25.420> snow<00:03:25.720> over<00:03:25.989> there<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.410> light<00:03:27.250> coming

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
more snow over there and light coming

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.380 
more snow over there and light coming

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
out from that sir suggest here it's got

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.770 
out from that sir suggest here it's got
a<00:03:31.420> load<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.750> science<00:03:32.730> yay<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:36.750> some<00:03:37.750> more

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780

going to need to make another jet ski
there's<00:03:48.459> probably<00:03:48.550> about<00:03:48.850> like<00:03:48.940> 50<00:03:49.720> flying

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
there's probably about like 50 flying

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.590 
there's probably about like 50 flying
jet<00:03:50.590> skis<00:03:50.950> around<00:03:51.459> there<00:03:51.700> where<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.030> had<00:03:52.360> them

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
is that I was nothing actually there I

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.990 
is that I was nothing actually there I
thought<00:06:54.169> it<00:06:54.320> might<00:06:54.470> be<00:06:54.650> oh<00:06:54.800> god<00:06:55.490> I'm<00:06:55.639> sure<00:06:55.850> you

supply<00:06:56.479> downward<00:06:56.870> just<00:06:57.050> fell<00:06:57.260> down<00:06:57.289> a<00:06:57.470> hole

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
supply downward just fell down a hole

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.090 
supply downward just fell down a hole
well<00:06:59.479> I<00:06:59.810> guess<00:07:00.650> that's<00:07:00.830> one<00:07:00.949> of<00:07:01.039> the

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
well I guess that's one of the

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.920 
well I guess that's one of the
disadvantages<00:07:01.310> of<00:07:01.910> the<00:07:02.210> aether<00:07:02.510> mod<00:07:02.539> like

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
disadvantages of the aether mod like

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.360 
disadvantages of the aether mod like
