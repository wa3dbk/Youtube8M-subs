these<00:02:00.600> forests<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> best<00:02:01.979> thing<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
these forests so the best thing now is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.459 
these forests so the best thing now is
to<00:02:03.180> find<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.479> solution<00:02:03.659> for<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.140> disease

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469

because<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.159> soon<00:02:05.250> as<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.490> solve<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.880> problem

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

because as soon as we solve that problem
I<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:06.750> we'll<00:02:07.049> start<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.469> an<00:02:07.710> increase

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
I think we'll start to see an increase
