sniper<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.070> slight<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> hand<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.580> don't

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909

sniper so with slight of hand you don't
get<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> run<00:01:06.270> around<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.630> much<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
get to run around as much because you

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
get to run around as much because you
have<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> walk<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> run<00:01:09.180> for

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have to walk and all you can run for

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
have to walk and all you can run for
like<00:01:09.479> five<00:01:09.689> seconds<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.560> basically<00:01:10.860> have

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
like five seconds but you basically have

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.010 
like five seconds but you basically have
to<00:01:11.189> hold<00:01:11.369> off<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.729> area<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> win

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to hold off one area if you want to win

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.719 
to hold off one area if you want to win
and<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.010> game<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.430> hold

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and that's what I do in this game I hold

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
and that's what I do in this game I hold
off<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.180> rooftop<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.950> if<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
off this little rooftop here and if it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.320 
off this little rooftop here and if it
was<00:01:17.220> marathon<00:01:17.610> sniping<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.210> been

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
was marathon sniping I would have been

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.670 
was marathon sniping I would have been
running<00:01:18.570> around<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.810> over<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> place<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
running around all over the place so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.149 
running around all over the place so
there's<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> difference<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.659> i<00:01:22.080> slide<00:01:23.070> up

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
there's a difference so I'm i slide up

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
there's a difference so I'm i slide up
and<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.430> tend<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> clear<00:01:24.030> scope<00:01:24.270> more

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and I do tend to clear scope more

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.350 
and I do tend to clear scope more
because<00:01:24.810> marathon<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.830> tend<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
because marathon I tend to not want to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
because marathon I tend to not want to
miss<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.869> even<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.710> miss<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.790> got<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
minute here or three minutes or so this

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.840 
minute here or three minutes or so this
is<00:02:30.800> one<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:30.980> my<00:02:31.070> longer<00:02:31.400> free-for-all<00:02:31.760> is

usually<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.180> tend<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.110> get<00:02:33.230> them<00:02:33.380> around<00:02:33.530> three

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
usually I tend to get them around three

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.050 
usually I tend to get them around three
or<00:02:33.890> four<00:02:34.220> minutes<00:02:34.340> long<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.760> one's<00:02:34.940> like

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060

to six months I think so um it's a
longer<00:02:40.250> one<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.840> what<00:02:42.020> yeah<00:02:42.500> yeah

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
longer one so I so it's what yeah yeah

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
much and there's so many videos on it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.440 
much and there's so many videos on it
already<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.670> game's<00:02:55.880> not<00:02:56.000> even<00:02:56.209> close<00:02:56.390> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
already in the game's not even close to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.540 
already in the game's not even close to
come<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.290> mean<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:57.739> kind<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.010> close<00:02:58.220> but

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
come and I I mean it's kind of close but

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.330 
come and I I mean it's kind of close but
you<00:02:59.239> know<00:02:59.390> it's<00:02:59.690> not<00:02:59.840> quite<00:03:00.410> there<00:03:00.620> yet<00:03:00.650> and

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
you know it's not quite there yet and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.280 
you know it's not quite there yet and
you<00:03:02.300> could<00:03:02.420> say<00:03:02.540> that's<00:03:02.630> what<00:03:02.810> she<00:03:02.840> said<00:03:03.170> I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
you could say that's what she said I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.040 
you could say that's what she said I

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
guess that's fail I didn't even line up

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.960 
guess that's fail I didn't even line up
my<00:03:06.290> shot<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:06.860> shot<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.250> wall<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.550> was<00:03:07.820> like

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
having fun didn't really plan on using

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.539 
having fun didn't really plan on using
this<00:03:11.750> game<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.650> at<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.010> end<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.310> kind<00:03:13.519> of

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
this game then at the end I kind of

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.220 
this game then at the end I kind of
realized<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.030> was<00:03:14.120> decent<00:03:14.329> score<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.079> was

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
realized it was decent score and I was

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.990 
realized it was decent score and I was
like<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.500> know<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.650> kind<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.340> had<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.730> couple

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
like you know I kind of had a couple

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.330 
like you know I kind of had a couple
nice<00:03:17.180> shots<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.750> guess<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:18.110> kind<00:03:19.070> of<00:03:19.100> use<00:03:19.310> it

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
nice shots so I guess I kind of use it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.060 
nice shots so I guess I kind of use it
despite<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.180> embarrassin<00:03:20.810> mints<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.650> stuff

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
despite the embarrassin mints and stuff

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.979 
despite the embarrassin mints and stuff
and<00:03:22.340> I'm<00:03:23.060> trying<00:03:23.299> to<00:03:23.329> kill<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.480> Boosters<00:03:23.840> here

and I'm trying to kill the Boosters here

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.600 
and I'm trying to kill the Boosters here
because<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.350> hear<00:03:24.530> them<00:03:24.620> but<00:03:24.769> some<00:03:25.010> dick<00:03:25.310> face

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
feels like letting them keep on boost we

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.220 
feels like letting them keep on boost we

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.590 
everything like that it just makes the
game<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.130> bad<00:04:20.549> i<00:04:20.579> mean<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.000> guns<00:04:21.209> are<00:04:21.359> pretty

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
game so bad i mean the guns are pretty

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600 
game so bad i mean the guns are pretty
cool<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:22.260> pretty<00:04:22.470> balanced<00:04:22.889> I<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:23.280> aside

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
cool the pretty balanced I think aside

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.550 
cool the pretty balanced I think aside
from<00:04:23.789> like<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.120> AK<00:04:24.360> sunny<00:04:24.600> for<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.930> but<00:04:25.139> they

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
from like the AK sunny for you but they

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.080 
from like the AK sunny for you but they
tend<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.800> be<00:04:25.919> on<00:04:26.039> top<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.430> patching<00:04:26.789> it<00:04:26.880> like

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
tend to be on top of patching it like

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.460 
tend to be on top of patching it like
when<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.360> famas<00:04:27.630> gets<00:04:27.870> too<00:04:28.020> overpowered

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
when the famas gets too overpowered

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.260 
when the famas gets too overpowered
there<00:04:29.100> on<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:29.400> shit<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.699> they<00:04:29.789> fix<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.150> which

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
there on that shit and they fix it which

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.350 
there on that shit and they fix it which
is<00:04:30.389> pretty<00:04:30.600> cool<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.729> maybe<00:04:32.729> something<00:04:33.210> like

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
is pretty cool so maybe something like

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.990 
is pretty cool so maybe something like
that<00:04:33.389> in<00:04:33.840> marker<00:04:34.229> 3<00:04:34.470> like<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:35.340> they<00:04:35.520> released<00:04:35.850> a

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
that in marker 3 like if they released a

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.020 
that in marker 3 like if they released a
gun<00:04:36.240> like<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.780> UMP<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.669> realizes<00:04:38.669> extremely

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
gun like the UMP and realizes extremely

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.340 
gun like the UMP and realizes extremely
overpowered<00:04:39.419> they<00:04:39.510> patch<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.960> next<00:04:40.050> week

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
overpowered they patch it the next week

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.680 
overpowered they patch it the next week
that'd<00:04:40.860> be<00:04:41.010> awesome<00:04:41.150> whereas<00:04:42.150> mine<00:04:42.300> warfare<00:04:42.419> 2
