Raiders of the North Sea which is a very

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.870 
Raiders of the North Sea which is a very
smartly<00:00:06.810> designed<00:00:07.259> game<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.639> really<00:00:08.639> really

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
smartly designed game I really really

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.509 
smartly designed game I really really
need<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.570> core<00:00:09.900> central<00:00:10.230> conceit<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
need the core central conceit of the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.169 
need the core central conceit of the
shared<00:00:12.980> worker<00:00:13.980> resource<00:00:14.639> pool<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
shared worker resource pool is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.760 
shared worker resource pool is
absolutely<00:00:16.049> brilliant<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.410> don't<00:00:16.590> think<00:00:16.710> I've

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
absolutely brilliant I don't think I've

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.109 
absolutely brilliant I don't think I've

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
ever really seen anything quite like it

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.310 
ever really seen anything quite like it
the<00:00:18.359> notion<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.109> worker

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320

taking nobody else can go there but the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.490 
taking nobody else can go there but the
fact<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.090> everybody<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.720> sharing<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> same

pool of workers is just really really

pool of workers is just really really
clever<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.320> saw<00:00:28.650> something<00:00:28.980> similar<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
clever I saw something similar to it in

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.279 
clever I saw something similar to it in
a<00:00:30.029> little<00:00:30.359> micro<00:00:30.660> game<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.990> came<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.199> last

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
a little micro game that came out last

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.290 
a little micro game that came out last
year<00:00:31.470> called<00:00:31.619> Provence<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.369> wow<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> mean<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
year called Provence but wow I mean this

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.510 
year called Provence but wow I mean this
game<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.690> really<00:00:34.530> nothing<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.190> game<00:00:35.370> at

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
game is really nothing like that game at

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.069 
game is really nothing like that game at
all<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.440> it<00:00:37.440> works<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:39.030> well<00:00:39.719> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
all and it works really really well in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
all and it works really really well in
here<00:00:40.230> particularly<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> additional

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
here particularly with the additional

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.420 
here particularly with the additional
wrinkle<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.320> fact<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.040> workers

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
wrinkle of the fact that your workers

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
wrinkle of the fact that your workers
get<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.390> upgrade<00:00:45.780> over<00:00:45.930> time<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
get you know they upgrade over time and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
get you know they upgrade over time and
there's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> three<00:00:46.950> different<00:00:47.070> types<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
there's a three different types that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.220 
there's a three different types that
have<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.570> three<00:00:48.809> different<00:00:49.110> functions

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
have the three different functions

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.660 
have the three different functions
letting<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.770> go<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> different<00:00:50.160> spaces

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
letting you go to different spaces

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
letting you go to different spaces
making<00:00:51.210> spaces<00:00:51.600> better<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.289> worse<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.800> terms

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
making spaces better or worse in terms

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
making spaces better or worse in terms
of<00:00:53.160> their<00:00:53.309> output<00:00:53.520> um<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.870> in

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
of their output um you know in

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
of their output um you know in
thematically<00:00:55.559> makes<00:00:55.770> sense<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thematically makes sense to that the you

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.880 
thematically makes sense to that the you
know<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.780> start<00:00:58.050> out<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.410> guys<00:00:58.649> who

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
know you start out with these guys who

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.020 
know you start out with these guys who
are<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.010> regular<00:00:59.219> civilians<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
are just regular civilians and so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.250 
are just regular civilians and so
they're<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.180> good<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.660> civilian<00:01:01.050> stuff

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
they're really good at civilian stuff

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.840 
they're really good at civilian stuff
and<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.500> very<00:01:01.649> good<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:01.920> fighting<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.460> then

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and not very good at fighting and then

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
and not very good at fighting and then
as<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.149> upgrade<00:01:03.930> into<00:01:04.290> warriors<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> super

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
as they upgrade into warriors and super

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
as they upgrade into warriors and super
warriors<00:01:05.700> they'd<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.210> give<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.990> access<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
warriors they'd be give you access to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.280 
warriors they'd be give you access to
more<00:01:07.619> stuff<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.520> also<00:01:08.700> become<00:01:09.150> worse<00:01:09.960> at

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
more stuff but they also become worse at

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
more stuff but they also become worse at
the<00:01:10.740> regular<00:01:11.130> day-to-day<00:01:11.340> stuff<00:01:12.060> like
