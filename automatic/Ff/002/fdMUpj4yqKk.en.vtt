00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.639
 me 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:25.830
 I am running a general road in the city with the new Camry . 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.110
 First of all for the powertrain this Toyota hybrid system is quite long 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 Have rich experience 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:36.510
 It is totally necessary to run in order to realize the thing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.700
 There is no hybrid song or something like that, but the driver wants 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:48.130
 If you step on the accelerator and accelerate and deliver it with the engine and motor, it will deliver 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:52.220
 It is possible to run without having a kindness, so I feel that one more head feels 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:57.050
 Kedomo is I'm such for the ribbon out of it do you say leave the size of the scale 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:01.460
 A spacious ride with a sedan body that can afford the size 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.879
 Of course I think that's an impression I get from the room size too 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.659
 The suspension has some great capacity 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:15.140
 A version that is calm enough to flow the streets of such a city 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:17.539
 If you move, it is designed to run on a long distance continent such as America 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.770
 Great scale size done 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:24.870
 Force how to ride at Tteyuu margin of such part Ganan or run 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.310
 Even running in the city say this because it is you can feel 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.300
 I will have such feelings when I do not want to go far 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.300
 It will be in the car 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:44.689
 I 'm in a state of accelerating through the toll gate that entered the Metropolitan Expressway right now 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:48.530
 With the coordination of the engine and motor, there is no problem at all with regard to acceleration. 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.650
 We were able to accelerate at a stretch to around 80 kg 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.570
 Yappa 湘光 sound labor noise also be included in the cut-off to the great 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:04.200
 It feels like you can spend an easy distance today. 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:08.670
 The ride is the same as the impression I received throughout the city, and the scale was very large. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.640
 It is riding taste and this is also going to be riding gradually if I put it too much 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.920
 It leads to tiredness in my house but 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:24.459
 Barking City of the Camry has a relaxed feeling like me unravel a flame or tired rather 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:29.090
 It makes me feel that it is okay if I keep running for a while. 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.510
 Right now I didn't mean that much so I turned the curve. 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:38.330
 I wonder if I say low's that the center of gravity of the sedan unique 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.629
 Part that very stability tire also in short there because is why there is room in the body fraud 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:47.840
 The in packages that collapsed basically that Rutteyuu 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:49.080
 Of course, you can also realize the running of the law Straight stability is of course the best slur in the US 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.030
 Why sedan 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.750
 So just touch the handle lightly at all perfectly 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.930
 assuming the a we are straight ahead long run 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:07.930
 You can feel is that there is Do's some of the capacity build margin 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:14.230
 Some safety equipment has been added to the new Camry, but now one of them 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:20.290
 Activate the radar cruise control and there is 80 km in setting 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.430
 But because there is also a drag in front of it, the speed is now 60 km according to the speed 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.920
 A little bit 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.630
 Naturally 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.770
 You can adjust this person and you can speed up and down 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.390
 This kind of a cruise control overthrow A worried person who might get sleepy 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:39.650
 It seems that there is 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:41.910
 In fact, it is the opposite It is not necessary to use the fire for the accelerator control, so be careful about other parts 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.920
 You can distribute 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:52.350
 So it is relatively good to enter in terms of safety 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:58.500
 I think that I think I might not be equipped with the new Camry and good again the sedan 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:01.930
 After all the comfort and livability of the sedan and so high precision all balance something 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.469
 The shop is a car that is often fused at a high level 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.300
 Something is amazing words Tteyuu's basic shape of the car 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:14.340
 I think it's a car I can understand 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.840
 Is also such that margin was felt to drive the new Camry 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.260
 It says that the body of the size sedan can be run with ease 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.240
 That was the comfort and comfort of such a car 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.289
 One of the recent trends in cars and sporty as one 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.559
 Also grinded something in Well big car 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:38.110
 Kedomo also Rutteyuu car to run crisp in ot 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:40.080
 It 's probably a comfortable car for those with a room of this size 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.539
 I want to move 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:50.400
 This Kamuri is a feeling of being relaxed in the middle from the large car at that point 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:53.729
 Feeling relaxed as such a great care as a thorough as a global car 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.180
 Familiar with the United States and other parts of the world 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.180
 I felt that the reason was understood in this drive
