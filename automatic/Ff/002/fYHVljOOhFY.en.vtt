the<00:00:54.570> instrumentation<00:00:55.110> used<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.589> and<00:00:55.710> it's

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
the instrumentation used to be and it's

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.710 
the instrumentation used to be and it's
now<00:00:56.010> completely<00:00:56.430> digital<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:57.089> no<00:00:57.239> analog

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
now completely digital there's no analog

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.600 
now completely digital there's no analog
instrumentation<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.470> there<00:00:58.589> at<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.949> you're

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
instrumentation in there at all you're

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.219 
instrumentation in there at all you're
able<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.940> switch<00:01:00.119> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.360> customize<00:01:01.049> the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
able to switch you can customize the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.420 
able to switch you can customize the
display<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.650> can<00:01:01.799> see<00:01:02.040> there<00:01:02.220> you've<00:01:02.400> got

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
display you can see there you've got

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
display you can see there you've got
your<00:01:02.820> breath<00:01:03.299> counters<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:03.750> bigger<00:01:04.049> your

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
your breath counters now bigger your

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.170 
your breath counters now bigger your
speedos<00:01:04.619> bigger<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.640> when<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
speedos bigger so this is for when you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609 
speedos bigger so this is for when you
know<00:01:06.330> where<00:01:06.479> you're<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.080> then

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
know where you're going and then

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.780 
know where you're going and then
obviously<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> take<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> back<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> see

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
obviously that can take it back to see

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.219 
obviously that can take it back to see
if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> navigate<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> don't

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
actually an incredibly impressive idea

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
actually an incredibly impressive idea
it's<00:01:13.740> been<00:01:13.799> clearly<00:01:14.549> well<00:01:14.700> thought<00:01:15.060> through

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's been clearly well thought through

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
it's been clearly well thought through
and<00:01:15.869> someone<00:01:16.469> says<00:01:16.649> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.829> bit<00:01:16.950> overdue

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
but actually seeing here it has it's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.099 
but actually seeing here it has it's
proven<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.579> it's<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.479> worth<00:01:21.750> getting

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
proven that it's it's worth getting

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:23.480 
proven that it's it's worth getting
these<00:01:22.170> things<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.679> now<00:01:23.039> one<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> other

and<00:01:37.649> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.039> just<00:01:38.249> simply<00:01:38.460> draw<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.789> letters

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
on it and that means that rather than

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.499 
on it and that means that rather than
looking<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> display<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.060> sort<00:01:42.479> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
looking at the display you can sort of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
looking at the display you can sort of
write<00:01:42.749> down<00:01:43.189> McDonald's<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.310> whatever<00:01:44.520> you

want<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> try<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.210> find<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:45.929> be<00:01:46.049> easy

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
want to try and find and it will be easy

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.569 
want to try and find and it will be easy
to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.679> that<00:01:46.710> while<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.159> driving<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
to do that while you're driving you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.590 
to do that while you're driving you
won't<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.969> take<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.210> eyes<00:01:48.359> off<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600

won't have to take your eyes off the
road<00:01:48.719> and<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.679> will<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.799> no<00:01:49.979> distraction

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
road and there will be no distraction

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
road and there will be no distraction
really<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.749> here<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.929> can<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.259> working

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
really and here you can see it working

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.349 
really and here you can see it working
and<00:01:53.100> that's<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.670> very<00:01:53.729> logical<00:01:54.329> way

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
and that's actually a very logical way

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.870 
and that's actually a very logical way
of<00:01:54.539> doing<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.100> can't<00:01:56.490> wait<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
of doing it and we kind of can't wait to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.599 
of doing it and we kind of can't wait to
see<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.240> applied<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.469> cars<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:59.189> course<00:01:59.460> it's

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.669 
see this applied in cars of course it's
going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.819> take<00:01:59.969> a<00:01:59.999> while<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:01.109> for<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> time

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
going to take a while but for the time

now he's also demonstrating this laser
light<00:02:27.890> concept<00:02:28.890> now<00:02:29.099> which<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.879> supposed<00:02:30.180> to
