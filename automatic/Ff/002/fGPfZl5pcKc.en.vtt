00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
to use his boxing very well and he he

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.860 
to use his boxing very well and he he
knows<00:03:14.640> how<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.820> use<00:03:14.910> his<00:03:15.030> reach<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.420> bit<00:03:15.570> well<00:03:15.720> as

knows how to use his reach a bit well as
well<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.200> think<00:03:16.590> he's<00:03:16.710> not<00:03:17.460> that<00:03:17.820> much<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
well I think he's not that much of a

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.150 
well I think he's not that much of a
reach<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.570> varnish<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.110> probably<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.010> little

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
reach and varnish but probably a little

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.880 
reach and varnish but probably a little
bit<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:21.450> think<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:25.140> gonna<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.800> gonna

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
bit and I think it's gonna be it's gonna

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.640 
bit and I think it's gonna be it's gonna
be<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.100> tough<00:03:26.280> one<00:03:27.140> but<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.200> both<00:03:28.350> they're<00:03:28.620> both

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
be a tough one but I both they're both

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.470 
be a tough one but I both they're both
going<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.010> go<00:03:29.130> at<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.700> can<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.060> can

think he's going to control the pace you
know<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:55.110> think<00:03:55.950> he<00:03:56.100> might<00:03:56.280> be<00:03:56.340> able<00:03:56.610> to

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
know and I think he might be able to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.880 
know and I think he might be able to
defend<00:03:58.940> against<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.200> gray<00:04:01.200> Maynard's<00:04:01.620> ground

ground<00:04:02.340> game<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:04.400> could<00:04:05.400> be<00:04:05.490> wrong<00:04:05.610> it's

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
ground game so I could be wrong it's

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.150 
ground game so I could be wrong it's
really<00:04:06.030> tough<00:04:06.210> one<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:07.320> know<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.830> one<00:04:07.950> factor
