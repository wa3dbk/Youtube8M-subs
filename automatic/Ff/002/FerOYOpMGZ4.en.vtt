we've<00:04:22.130> also<00:04:22.280> worked<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.730> lot<00:04:22.880> on<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.510> different

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
we've also worked a lot on the different

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.150 
we've also worked a lot on the different
archetypes<00:04:24.230> in<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.500> game<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.800> make<00:04:24.920> sure<00:04:25.100> that

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
archetypes in the game to make sure that

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.080 
archetypes in the game to make sure that
you<00:04:25.250> have<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.460> change<00:04:25.730> your<00:04:25.910> strategy

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
you have to change your strategy

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.300 
you have to change your strategy
depending<00:04:26.840> on<00:04:26.930> who<00:04:27.410> you're<00:04:27.650> attacking<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.220> in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
depending on who you're attacking so in

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.070 
depending on who you're attacking so in
this<00:04:28.400> instance<00:04:28.640> your<00:04:29.330> base<00:04:29.570> attack<00:04:29.900> won't

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
this instance your base attack won't

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.050 
this instance your base attack won't
work<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.830> need<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.070> use<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> more<00:04:31.790> advanced

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
work and you need to use a more advanced

tactics you may not have noticed but all

tactics you may not have noticed but all
that<00:04:35.720> combat<00:04:36.110> took<00:04:36.350> place<00:04:36.590> on<00:04:36.860> uneven<00:04:37.100> terrain

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
that combat took place on uneven terrain

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.760 
that combat took place on uneven terrain
just<00:04:38.390> like<00:04:38.600> our<00:04:38.750> navigation<00:04:39.410> we've<00:04:39.560> tried

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
just like our navigation we've tried

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.500 
just like our navigation we've tried
very<00:04:40.040> hard<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.370> make<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.730> believable<00:04:40.910> and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
very hard to make it believable and

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.010 
very hard to make it believable and
contextual<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.470> environment<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.930> new

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
contextual to the environment the new

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.480 
contextual to the environment the new
assassin<00:04:48.410> can<00:04:48.500> also<00:04:48.620> assassinate<00:04:49.370> his

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
assassin can also assassinate his

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.100 
assassin can also assassinate his
enemies<00:04:49.790> with<00:04:49.910> all<00:04:50.060> tools<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.690> all<00:04:50.810> weapons

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
enemies with all tools and all weapons

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.870 
enemies with all tools and all weapons
in<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:51.500> case<00:04:51.710> we'll<00:04:51.890> use<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.250> tomahawk<00:04:52.730> to

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
in this case we'll use the tomahawk to

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.660 
in this case we'll use the tomahawk to
finish<00:04:53.150> off<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.300> poor<00:04:53.600> fleeing<00:04:53.960> guard<00:04:57.430> we<00:04:58.430> truly

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
finish off a poor fleeing guard we truly

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.160 
finish off a poor fleeing guard we truly
believe<00:04:58.880> we<00:04:59.030> have<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.210> most<00:04:59.330> robust<00:04:59.870> third

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
believe we have the most robust third

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.920 
believe we have the most robust third

moves such as the slide we can show you

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.500

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
the integration of tree navigation and

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.420 
the integration of tree navigation and
cliff<00:05:08.810> navigation<00:05:09.470> we're<00:05:09.980> really<00:05:10.160> trying

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
cliff navigation we're really trying

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.540 
cliff navigation we're really trying
very<00:05:10.730> hard<00:05:10.790> to<00:05:11.120> keep<00:05:11.210> natural<00:05:12.080> shapes<00:05:12.550> organic

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
very hard to keep natural shapes organic

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.050 
very hard to keep natural shapes organic
surfaces<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.840> make<00:05:14.990> believable<00:05:15.620> terrain<00:05:16.060> here

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
surfaces to make believable terrain here

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.580 
surfaces to make believable terrain here
you'll<00:05:17.180> see<00:05:17.390> that<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.690> environment<00:05:18.290> self<00:05:18.470> is

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
you'll see that the environment self is

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.920 
you'll see that the environment self is
not<00:05:18.620> greeted<00:05:19.160> that<00:05:19.670> a<00:05:19.730> Conor<00:05:20.180> is<00:05:20.330> able<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.660> grab

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
not greeted that a Conor is able to grab

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.450 
not greeted that a Conor is able to grab
on<00:05:21.140> to<00:05:21.380> all<00:05:21.590> kinds<00:05:21.890> of<00:05:21.950> different<00:05:22.280> shapes

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
on to all kinds of different shapes

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.190 
on to all kinds of different shapes
which<00:05:23.240> we<00:05:23.390> think<00:05:23.510> is<00:05:23.630> particularly<00:05:23.990> special

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
which we think is particularly special

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:33.600 
which we think is particularly special
in<00:05:24.890> an<00:05:25.040> open-world<00:05:25.400> context

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.399 

this<00:05:34.150> is<00:05:34.270> one<00:05:34.389> of<00:05:34.419> three<00:05:34.659> ways<00:05:34.990> into<00:05:35.289> this

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
this is one of three ways into this

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.080 
this is one of three ways into this
particular<00:05:35.710> fort<00:05:36.159> it's<00:05:36.370> sort<00:05:36.580> of<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.759> stealth

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:58.930 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth
path<00:05:37.870> at<00:05:38.199> the<00:05:38.349> rear

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.640 

so<00:05:59.510> black<00:05:59.690> powder<00:05:59.960> is<00:06:00.110> not<00:06:00.230> just<00:06:00.410> a<00:06:00.470> key

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
so black powder is not just a key

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.320 
so black powder is not just a key
historical<00:06:00.830> resource<00:06:01.700> you<00:06:01.880> can<00:06:01.910> see<00:06:02.090> it<00:06:02.180> being

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
historical resource you can see it being

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.640 
historical resource you can see it being
loaded<00:06:02.570> there<00:06:03.220> into<00:06:04.220> that<00:06:04.370> cabin<00:06:05.470> but<00:06:06.470> it<00:06:06.530> also

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
loaded there into that cabin but it also

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.800 
loaded there into that cabin but it also
gave<00:06:06.890> us<00:06:06.980> an<00:06:07.070> opportunity<00:06:07.190> to<00:06:07.970> include<00:06:08.510> some

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
gave us an opportunity to include some

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:18.640 
gave us an opportunity to include some
historical<00:06:09.320> exploding<00:06:10.280> barrels<00:06:17.410> so<00:06:18.410> nothing

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
historical exploding barrels so nothing

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.930 
historical exploding barrels so nothing
we<00:06:18.740> invested<00:06:19.070> heavily<00:06:19.190> in<00:06:19.400> is<00:06:19.580> this<00:06:19.670> notion

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
we invested heavily in is this notion

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.660 
we invested heavily in is this notion
that<00:06:20.210> Connor<00:06:20.450> is<00:06:20.690> always<00:06:21.620> on<00:06:21.770> the<00:06:21.860> move<00:06:22.040> and<00:06:22.610> we

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
that Connor is always on the move and we

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.000 
that Connor is always on the move and we
gave<00:06:22.820> him<00:06:22.880> a<00:06:22.970> bunch<00:06:23.150> of<00:06:23.270> new<00:06:23.510> abilities<00:06:24.440> such

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.800 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such
as<00:06:25.040> running<00:06:25.400> assassinate<00:06:26.000> so<00:06:26.420> here<00:06:26.630> is<00:06:26.720> he

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
as running assassinate so here is he

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.450 
as running assassinate so here is he
chases<00:06:27.200> Silas<00:06:27.530> you<00:06:27.650> can<00:06:27.800> assassinate<00:06:28.070> this

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
chases Silas you can assassinate this

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.220 
chases Silas you can assassinate this
guy<00:06:28.580> in<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:28.850> run<00:06:29.000> you<00:06:29.480> can<00:06:29.630> snatch<00:06:29.870> up<00:06:30.080> this

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
guy in the run you can snatch up this

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.290 
guy in the run you can snatch up this
musket<00:06:30.620> on<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:30.860> run<00:06:31.010> kill<00:06:31.490> another<00:06:31.760> guy<00:06:32.000> and

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
musket on the run kill another guy and

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.980 
musket on the run kill another guy and
