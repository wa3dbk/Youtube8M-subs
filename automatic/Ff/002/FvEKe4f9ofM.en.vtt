bishops<00:00:49.440> let's<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.670> black<00:00:51.000> will<00:00:51.270> strike

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
bishops let's see how black will strike

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
bishops let's see how black will strike
at<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> White<00:00:52.050> Pond<00:00:52.350> center<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.129> some

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
at the White Pond center these are some

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
at the White Pond center these are some
things<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.180> how<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:54.750> black<00:00:54.989> go

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
things I think about how will black go

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
things I think about how will black go
ahead<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.710> challenge<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:56.460> guys<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
ahead and challenge these guys in the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
ahead and challenge these guys in the
center<00:00:57.390> okay<00:00:57.690> first<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.260> Bishop<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.649> being

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
center okay first this Bishop is being

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.459 
center okay first this Bishop is being
kicked<00:00:59.160> around<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.780> black<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.230> for

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
kicked around and black is going for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.319 
kicked around and black is going for
this<00:01:01.620> particular<00:01:02.160> imbalance<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> night<00:01:03.059> for

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this particular imbalance the night for

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.070 
this particular imbalance the night for
Bishop<00:01:03.600> exchange<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:05.479> some<00:01:06.479> things<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.930> know

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
Bishop exchange so some things to know

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
Bishop exchange so some things to know
when<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> Knight<00:01:08.100> takes<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> bishop<00:01:08.909> there

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
when this Knight takes the bishop there

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.940 
when this Knight takes the bishop there
might<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.750> some<00:01:10.049> tactics<00:01:10.530> against<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
might be some tactics against this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.730 
might be some tactics against this
square<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.520> Rick<00:01:12.060> isn't<00:01:12.210> defended<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
square if this Rick isn't defended this

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
square if this Rick isn't defended this
is<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> direction<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.820> capture<00:01:15.320> that's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
is not the direction to capture that's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
is not the direction to capture that's
my<00:01:16.530> first<00:01:16.770> thought<00:01:17.040> captured<00:01:17.520> towards<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
my first thought captured towards the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
my first thought captured towards the
center<00:01:18.150> lets<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> good<00:01:18.630> reason<00:01:18.780> not

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
center lets you have a good reason not

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980 
center lets you have a good reason not
to<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.650> guess<00:01:20.580> white<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> giving<00:01:21.509> some<00:01:21.780> way

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to now I guess white is giving some way

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
to now I guess white is giving some way
to<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.530> exactly<00:01:22.650> giving<00:01:23.280> some<00:01:23.520> weight<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to what exactly giving some weight to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.240 
to what exactly giving some weight to
this<00:01:24.330> idea<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.930> castling<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.680> having<00:01:25.950> play

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
this idea of castling and having play

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.980 
this idea of castling and having play
along<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> f<00:01:26.759> file<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.869> let's<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:29.990> white

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
along the f file so let's see if white

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
along the f file so let's see if white
can<00:01:31.320> follow<00:01:31.979> through<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.490> idea<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
can follow through with that idea in the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.999 
can follow through with that idea in the
meantime<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.689> night<00:01:33.960> although<00:01:34.409> he's<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
meantime this night although he's on the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.640 
meantime this night although he's on the
edge<00:01:35.159> he<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.090> keeping<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.540> close<00:01:36.750> eye<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:36.960> f5<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
edge he is keeping a close eye on f5 and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
edge he is keeping a close eye on f5 and
I<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.250> thinking<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> c5<00:01:39.540> advanced<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
I was thinking about the c5 advanced to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.370 
I was thinking about the c5 advanced to
strike<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> center<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:42.200> increase<00:01:43.200> this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
strike in the center and increase this

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.609 
strike in the center and increase this
bishops<00:01:43.770> diagonal<00:01:44.310> strength<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.229> open<00:01:46.350> up

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
bishops diagonal strength and to open up

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.020 
bishops diagonal strength and to open up
this<00:01:46.770> diagonal<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> Queen<00:01:47.640> where<00:01:47.820> she

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
this diagonal for the Queen where she

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
this diagonal for the Queen where she
would<00:01:48.149> pin<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> night<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> rake<00:01:49.829> this

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
would pin the night and rake this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.030 
would pin the night and rake this
fifth-ranked<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.500> think<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.619> important<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
fifth-ranked I think it's important to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.039 
fifth-ranked I think it's important to
keep<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.460> night<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> f5<00:01:54.659> square

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
keep this night out of the f5 square

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.620 
keep this night out of the f5 square
Bishop<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> defend<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.390> pond

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
Bishop so this is to defend this pond

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899 
Bishop so this is to defend this pond
and<00:01:57.960> notice<00:01:58.649> how<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> may<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.549> available

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and notice how this is may be available

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
and notice how this is may be available
as<00:02:00.180> well<00:02:00.360> capturing<00:02:01.350> away<00:02:01.500> from<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> center

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
as well capturing away from the center

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.069 
as well capturing away from the center
this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.850> square<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.360> becomes<00:02:03.750> very

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this is the one square that becomes very

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
this is the one square that becomes very
soft<00:02:04.409> III<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:05.520> unprotected<00:02:06.920> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
soft III is now unprotected so

think<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.130> if<00:04:17.280> we're<00:04:17.459> castle<00:04:17.850> in<00:04:17.970> opposite

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
think of it if we're castle in opposite

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.870 
think of it if we're castle in opposite
sides<00:04:18.630> he<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.620> actually<00:04:19.829> serving<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.459> very<00:04:20.700> good

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
sides he is actually serving a very good

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.690 
sides he is actually serving a very good
role<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.209> preventing<00:04:21.600> black<00:04:22.109> from<00:04:22.530> doing<00:04:23.520> what

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
role in preventing black from doing what

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.150 
role in preventing black from doing what
from<00:04:24.570> opening<00:04:24.930> up<00:04:25.080> any<00:04:25.290> files<00:04:25.620> against<00:04:26.040> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
from opening up any files against the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.480 
from opening up any files against the
White<00:04:26.310> King<00:04:26.580> c4<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.690> on<00:04:28.220> c4<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.310> being

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
White King c4 is on c4 is being

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.040 
White King c4 is on c4 is being
threatened<00:04:29.669> as<00:04:29.940> well<00:04:30.120> as<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.330> five<00:04:30.570> but<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.810> think

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
threatened as well as a five but I think

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.420 
threatened as well as a five but I think
it's<00:04:31.140> more<00:04:31.320> important<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.710> watch<00:04:31.890> over<00:04:32.160> sea

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
it's more important to watch over sea

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.970 
it's more important to watch over sea
for<00:04:33.050> because<00:04:34.050> if<00:04:34.169> this<00:04:34.290> night<00:04:34.560> is<00:04:34.710> able<00:04:34.890> to

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.890 
for because if this night is able to
capture<00:04:35.160> your<00:04:35.669> now<00:04:36.000> having<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.419> contend<00:04:36.750> with

capture your now having to contend with
another<00:04:37.860> piece<00:04:38.130> getting<00:04:38.669> involved<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:40.080> okay

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
another piece getting involved so okay

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.320 
another piece getting involved so okay
be4<00:04:41.010> is<00:04:41.130> being<00:04:41.370> played<00:04:41.640> that's<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:42.030> very

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
interesting move I was going to say if

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.440 
interesting move I was going to say if
the<00:04:43.860> Queen<00:04:44.070> never<00:04:44.220> takes<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.640> then<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> file

the Queen never takes a then the a file
opens<00:04:45.810> up<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.110> now<00:04:46.169> we<00:04:46.230> have<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.530> B<00:04:46.680> file<00:04:46.980> and

mate threat on b7 because you could have
this<00:05:06.960> but<00:05:07.229> we're<00:05:07.350> probably<00:05:07.530> not<00:05:07.740> going<00:05:07.860> to

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
this but we're probably not going to

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.550 
this but we're probably not going to
have<00:05:08.070> that<00:05:08.100> b6<00:05:08.760> seems<00:05:09.060> like<00:05:09.390> most<00:05:09.660> natural<00:05:10.260> but

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
have that b6 seems like most natural but

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.950 
have that b6 seems like most natural but
okay<00:05:11.430> definitely<00:05:12.150> avoid<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.419> Queen<00:05:12.600> exchange

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960

thought we could still be having Queen
c5<00:05:21.000> offering<00:05:21.479> another<00:05:21.720> Queen<00:05:22.050> exchange<00:05:22.470> and
