okay<00:00:12.820> let's<00:00:13.780> start<00:00:14.019> by<00:00:14.230> looking<00:00:14.410> at<00:00:14.680> the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
okay let's start by looking at the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.890 
okay let's start by looking at the
pieces<00:00:15.100> we're<00:00:15.639> going<00:00:15.940> to<00:00:16.090> be<00:00:16.180> examining<00:00:16.299> in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
pieces we're going to be examining in

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.589 
pieces we're going to be examining in
this<00:00:17.080> example<00:00:17.640> first<00:00:18.640> up<00:00:18.939> is<00:00:19.180> the<00:00:19.480> Earth's

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
this example first up is the Earth's

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.839 
this example first up is the Earth's
crust<00:00:19.900> which<00:00:20.770> is<00:00:20.800> made<00:00:21.160> up<00:00:21.340> of<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:21.670> Earth's

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
crust which is made up of the Earth's

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.570 
crust which is made up of the Earth's
tectonic<00:00:22.390> plates<00:00:22.919> we<00:00:23.919> will<00:00:24.040> be<00:00:24.160> looking<00:00:24.460> at

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
tectonic plates we will be looking at

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.870 
tectonic plates we will be looking at
three<00:00:24.849> plates<00:00:25.180> in<00:00:25.419> this<00:00:25.540> example<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:27.669> North

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
three plates in this example the North

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.029 
three plates in this example the North
American<00:00:28.419> plate

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
American plate

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:41.479 
American plate
I<00:00:32.370> walk<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.399> few<00:00:33.760> coke<00:00:33.969> late

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.760 

and<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.300> Pacific<00:00:42.780> plate

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
and the Pacific plate

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.730 
and the Pacific plate
and<00:00:45.060> then<00:00:46.060> there's<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.420> Earth's<00:00:46.600> mantle<00:00:46.840> an

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
and then there's the Earth's mantle an

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.950 
and then there's the Earth's mantle an
area<00:00:48.070> lies<00:00:48.430> just<00:00:48.880> beneath<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.540> earth's<00:00:49.660> crust

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
area lies just beneath the earth's crust

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.790 
area lies just beneath the earth's crust
on<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:52.000> Earth's<00:00:52.150> surface<00:00:52.240> this<00:00:53.080> material<00:00:53.680> is

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
on the Earth's surface this material is

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.160 
on the Earth's surface this material is
called<00:00:53.830> lava<00:00:54.340> and<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:55.060> liquid<00:00:55.510> because<00:00:55.900> it<00:00:56.050> is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
called lava and is liquid because it is

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.090 
called lava and is liquid because it is
so<00:00:56.380> hot<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.760> below<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.060> earth's<00:00:58.450> crust

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so hot but below the earth's crust

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.470 
so hot but below the earth's crust
incredibly<00:01:00.100> high<00:01:00.310> pressure<00:01:00.700> keeps<00:01:01.270> this

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
incredibly high pressure keeps this

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.810 
incredibly high pressure keeps this
material<00:01:02.020> in<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.260> kind<00:01:02.530> of<00:01:02.710> semi<00:01:02.950> solid<00:01:03.460> state

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
material in a kind of semi solid state

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.330 
material in a kind of semi solid state
so<00:01:04.660> it<00:01:04.809> moves<00:01:05.050> like<00:01:05.350> very<00:01:05.680> thick<00:01:06.070> peanut

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
so it moves like very thick peanut

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.070 
so it moves like very thick peanut
butter<00:01:06.640> wood<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:10.030> we<00:01:10.180> have<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.840> North

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
butter wood so we have the North

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.550 
butter wood so we have the North
American<00:01:11.650> plate<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.730> Juan<00:01:12.940> de<00:01:13.090> Fuca<00:01:13.120> plate

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
American plate the Juan de Fuca plate

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.289 
American plate the Juan de Fuca plate
the<00:01:14.560> Pacific<00:01:15.130> plate<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.690> Earth's<00:01:16.810> mantle

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.029 

this<00:01:24.299> process<00:01:24.780> begins<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.439> mantle<00:01:25.950> material

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
this process begins with mantle material

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.399 
this process begins with mantle material
welling<00:01:26.789> up<00:01:26.939> due<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> convection<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
welling up due to convection the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
welling up due to convection the
upwelling<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> mantle<00:01:29.579> material<00:01:29.670> pushes<00:01:30.420> up

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
upwelling of mantle material pushes up

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.080 
upwelling of mantle material pushes up
in<00:01:30.780> between<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.380> plates<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.490> pushes<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
in between the plates this pushes the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.539 
in between the plates this pushes the
plates<00:01:33.360> apart<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.289> mantle<00:01:34.860> material<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
plates apart this mantle material that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730 
plates apart this mantle material that
reaches<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:36.000> seafloor<00:01:36.539> becomes<00:01:37.109> new<00:01:37.380> plate

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
reaches the seafloor becomes new plate

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.429 
reaches the seafloor becomes new plate
material<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.789> our<00:01:38.969> case<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:40.079> Juan<00:01:40.289> de

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
material in our case here the Juan de

material in our case here the Juan de
Fuca<00:01:40.469> plate<00:01:40.860> moved<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> east<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
Fuca plate moved to the east and the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.889 
Fuca plate moved to the east and the
Pacific<00:01:43.110> plate<00:01:43.289> moves<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> west

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.840 

megathrust<00:01:48.899> earthquakes<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:50.039> only<00:01:50.280> occur<00:01:50.700> in

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
megathrust earthquakes can only occur in

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
megathrust earthquakes can only occur in
places<00:01:51.390> where<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> plate<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.259> pushed<00:01:52.619> under

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
places where a plate is pushed under

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
places where a plate is pushed under
another<00:01:53.310> plate<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:54.060> process<00:01:54.599> is<00:01:54.810> called

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
another plate this process is called

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.229 
another plate this process is called
subduction<00:01:55.759> earthquakes<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.939> occur

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
subduction earthquakes that occur

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.389 
subduction earthquakes that occur
because<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.959> process<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.189> only

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
because of this process are the only

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.999 
because of this process are the only
known<00:01:59.819> earthquake<00:02:00.450> type<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
known earthquake type we know of that

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.149 
known earthquake type we know of that
can<00:02:02.189> cause<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:02.459> 9.0<00:02:03.450> or<00:02:03.720> greater<00:02:04.140> earthquake<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
can cause a 9.0 or greater earthquake it

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.669 
can cause a 9.0 or greater earthquake it
is<00:02:05.429> because<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:05.970> this<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.450> most<00:02:06.679> megathrust

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
is because of this that most megathrust

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:14.120 
is because of this that most megathrust
earthquakes<00:02:08.399> caused<00:02:08.759> large<00:02:09.179> tsunamis<00:02:13.130> here

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
earthquakes caused large tsunamis here

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.160 
earthquakes caused large tsunamis here
we<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.670> Juan<00:02:14.880> de<00:02:15.120> Fuca<00:02:15.150> plate<00:02:15.540> being

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
we have the Juan de Fuca plate being

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.410 
we have the Juan de Fuca plate being
subducted<00:02:16.680> under<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.459> North<00:02:17.670> American<00:02:18.269> plate

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
subducted under the North American plate

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.589 
subducted under the North American plate
as<00:02:19.260> its<00:02:19.650> abducts<00:02:20.099> under<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> North<00:02:20.970> American

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
as its abducts under the North American

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.930 
as its abducts under the North American
plate<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.379> causes<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.099> lip<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.730> North

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
plate it causes the lip of the North

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.569 
plate it causes the lip of the North
American<00:02:24.540> plate<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.959> get<00:02:25.079> pulled<00:02:25.350> back<00:02:25.579> the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
American plate to get pulled back the

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.670 
American plate to get pulled back the
motion<00:02:27.030> continues<00:02:27.420> until<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.139> two<00:02:28.319> plates

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
motion continues until the two plates

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.729 
motion continues until the two plates
get<00:02:29.010> stuck<00:02:29.569> pressures<00:02:30.569> build<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.170> until<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
get stuck pressures build up until the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.910 
get stuck pressures build up until the
plates<00:02:32.069> slip<00:02:32.549> this<00:02:33.389> is<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.810> earthquake<00:02:33.989> in

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
plates slip this is the earthquake in

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
plates slip this is the earthquake in
this<00:02:35.220> case<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.850> lip<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.359> North<00:02:36.600> American

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
this case the lip of the North American

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.410 
this case the lip of the North American
plate<00:02:37.230> will<00:02:37.739> flip<00:02:38.010> back<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:38.609> as<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.120> pressure

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
plate will flip back up as the pressure

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.080 
plate will flip back up as the pressure
is<00:02:39.720> released<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.889> this<00:02:41.130> flipping<00:02:41.609> back<00:02:41.850> up
