where<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> drivers<00:01:34.799> aren't<00:01:34.979> accredited<00:01:35.610> in

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
where the drivers aren't accredited in

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
where the drivers aren't accredited in
their<00:01:35.880> cars<00:01:36.119> aren't<00:01:36.420> checked<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.259> you're

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
their cars aren't checked so you're

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.170 
their cars aren't checked so you're
taking<00:01:37.650> you're<00:01:38.009> taking<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.460> risk<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:38.939> get

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
taking you're taking a risk when you get

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.270 
taking you're taking a risk when you get
in<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.170> fine<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> use<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.979> yuba

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
in one I think it's fine to use the yuba

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
in one I think it's fine to use the yuba
system<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.939> limos<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.600> hire<00:01:42.750> cars<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
system for limos and hire cars in the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
system for limos and hire cars in the
rest<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.310> system<00:01:44.700> works<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
rest I think that system works well but

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
rest I think that system works well but
the<00:01:45.360> drivers<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.780> accredited<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> cars

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the drivers are accredited and the cars

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.060 
the drivers are accredited and the cars
are<00:01:47.280> registered<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.180> carrying<00:01:48.780> passengers

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
are registered as carrying passengers

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.289 
are registered as carrying passengers
and<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.340> could<00:01:50.399> finish<00:01:50.700> nail<00:01:51.030> that's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and if I could finish nail that's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
and if I could finish nail that's
exactly<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> point<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.470> making<00:01:52.500> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
exactly the point that I'm making is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
exactly the point that I'm making is
that<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.369> all<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> these<00:01:53.729> categories<00:01:54.000> but

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that we have all of these categories but

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.080 
that we have all of these categories but
the<00:01:54.960> public<00:01:55.170> don't<00:01:55.560> understand<00:01:56.159> who<00:01:56.880> these

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the public don't understand who these

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.120 
the public don't understand who these
food<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.869> kept<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.259> these<00:01:58.439> categories<00:01:58.860> are

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
food is kept what these categories are

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.889 
food is kept what these categories are
what<00:01:59.399> they<00:01:59.610> involve<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.600> fact<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
what they involve and the fact that

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.300 
what they involve and the fact that
they've<00:02:01.079> actually<00:02:01.290> got<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> license

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
they've actually got to have a license

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.670 
they've actually got to have a license
on<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.670> license<00:02:03.270> plate<00:02:03.600> attached<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.530> their
