ordinarily<00:00:15.559> I<00:00:15.709> would<00:00:15.920> have<00:00:15.949> you<00:00:16.129> do<00:00:16.219> something

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
ordinarily I would have you do something

100 pound dumbbells from one of the
treat<00:00:28.490> ribs<00:00:28.669> that's<00:00:29.210> what<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.480> ad<00:00:29.599> said<00:00:29.869> is

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
treat ribs that's what the ad said is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.689 
treat ribs that's what the ad said is
all<00:00:30.169> about<00:00:30.380> increasing<00:00:31.339> the<00:00:31.429> weight<00:00:31.550> each

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
all about increasing the weight each

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.240 
all about increasing the weight each
time<00:00:31.999> this<00:00:32.990> version<00:00:33.290> is<00:00:33.560> a<00:00:33.590> range<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:33.950> motion

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
time this version is a range of motion

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.610 
time this version is a range of motion
version<00:00:34.460> where<00:00:35.030> instead<00:00:35.300> of<00:00:35.360> increasing<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
version where instead of increasing the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.959 
version where instead of increasing the
weight<00:00:36.800> you're<00:00:37.129> gonna<00:00:37.250> be<00:00:37.430> increasing<00:00:37.910> the

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
weight you're gonna be increasing the

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:38.770 
weight you're gonna be increasing the
range<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.239> motion

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
range of motion

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.229 
range of motion
so<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.590> first<00:00:40.280> part<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.640> set<00:00:40.820> is<00:00:40.969> gonna<00:00:41.090> be

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
so the first part of the set is gonna be

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.790 
so the first part of the set is gonna be
high<00:00:41.359> reps<00:00:41.600> though<00:00:41.840> you're<00:00:42.410> gonna<00:00:42.500> do<00:00:42.649> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
high reps though you're gonna do the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.220 
high reps though you're gonna do the
very<00:00:42.829> strongest<00:00:43.219> range<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.760> motion<00:00:44.059> that

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
very strongest range of motion that

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.029 
very strongest range of motion that
you're<00:00:45.230> gonna<00:00:45.320> be<00:00:45.500> able<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.680> have<00:00:45.829> a<00:00:45.859> lot<00:00:46.010> more

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
you're gonna be able to have a lot more

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.310 
you're gonna be able to have a lot more
reps<00:00:46.399> with<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.690> first<00:00:47.899> week<00:00:48.140> you're

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
reps with that the first week you're

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.240 
reps with that the first week you're
going<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:48.469> pick<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.739> something<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.039> could<00:00:49.160> do

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
going to pick is something you could do

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.720 
going to pick is something you could do
probably<00:00:49.609> about<00:00:49.760> 12<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.570> 15<00:00:50.690> reps<00:00:51.109> with<00:00:51.730> and

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
probably about 12 to 15 reps with and

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.040 
probably about 12 to 15 reps with and
the<00:00:52.879> second<00:00:53.300> part<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.600> set<00:00:53.780> you're<00:00:53.929> gonna

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the second part of the set you're gonna

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.410 
the second part of the set you're gonna
do<00:00:54.260> half<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:54.980> range<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.429> motion<00:00:55.519> to<00:00:56.149> just

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
do half the range of motion to just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.330 
do half the range of motion to just
above<00:00:56.690> whatever<00:00:57.379> sticking<00:00:57.829> point<00:00:58.039> is<00:00:58.160> on<00:00:58.250> the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
above whatever sticking point is on the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.220 
above whatever sticking point is on the
exercise<00:00:58.760> you're<00:00:58.940> at<00:00:59.059> I'm<00:00:59.809> gonna<00:00:59.960> be<00:01:00.050> doing

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
exercise you're at I'm gonna be doing

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.930 
exercise you're at I'm gonna be doing
barbell<00:01:00.589> curls<00:01:00.890> here<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:01.429> the<00:01:01.519> top<00:01:01.699> part<00:01:01.730> of

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
barbell curls here so the top part of

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.819 
barbell curls here so the top part of
the<00:01:02.030> range<00:01:02.179> of<00:01:02.300> motion<00:01:02.570> is<00:01:03.199> gonna<00:01:03.410> be<00:01:03.500> just<00:01:03.710> up

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
the range of motion is gonna be just up

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.640 
the range of motion is gonna be just up
here<00:01:04.180> very<00:01:05.180> short<00:01:05.510> just<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.200> top<00:01:06.350> couple

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
here very short just the top couple

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.410 
here very short just the top couple
inches<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.520> then<00:01:07.640> I'm<00:01:07.730> going<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.000> go<00:01:08.060> over<00:01:08.090> to

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
inches and then I'm going to go over to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.570 
inches and then I'm going to go over to
just<00:01:08.630> above<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:09.530> sticking<00:01:09.920> point<00:01:10.160> which<00:01:10.430> is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
just above that sticking point which is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.800 
just above that sticking point which is
the<00:01:10.850> sticking<00:01:11.150> point<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:11.420> generally<00:01:11.720> the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
the sticking point is generally the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.690 
the sticking point is generally the
halfway<00:01:11.960> mark<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.070> exercise<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.490> we're

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
halfway mark of the exercise so we're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.460 
halfway mark of the exercise so we're
gonna<00:01:13.790> stay<00:01:13.970> just<00:01:14.150> above<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.290> then<00:01:15.410> the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
gonna stay just above that and then the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.650 
gonna stay just above that and then the
last<00:01:15.620> part<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.010> set<00:01:16.220> we're<00:01:17.120> going<00:01:17.240> and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
last part of the set we're going and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.149 
last part of the set we're going and
knees<00:01:18.020> are<00:01:18.170> keeping<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.440> weight<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.680> same

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
knees are keeping the weight the same

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.760 
knees are keeping the weight the same
we're<00:01:20.060> going<00:01:20.390> all<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.630> way<00:01:20.659> down<00:01:20.750> all<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.619> way

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
we're going all the way down all the way

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.770 
we're going all the way down all the way
up<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.189> that's<00:01:22.880> for<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:23.210> one<00:01:23.329> to<00:01:23.420> three<00:01:23.570> reps

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
up and that's for just one to three reps

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.539 
up and that's for just one to three reps
and<00:01:24.170> by<00:01:24.289> that<00:01:24.469> point<00:01:24.649> that's<00:01:25.219> all<00:01:25.430> you're

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
and by that point that's all you're

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.069 
and by that point that's all you're
going<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.729> be<00:01:26.180> able<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> do<00:01:26.539> with<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.840> dead

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
going to be able to do with that dead

00:01:27.079 --> 00:02:08.510 
going to be able to do with that dead
weight<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:27.710> let's<00:01:28.520> get<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.820> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.170 

that<00:02:09.520> was<00:02:09.640> 36<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.680> you<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.880> kind<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:12.940> cheat<00:02:13.120> a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
that was 36 and you can kind of cheat a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.030 
that was 36 and you can kind of cheat a
little<00:02:13.300> bit<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.870> way<00:02:13.990> up<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.920> you're<00:02:15.010> not

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
little bit on the way up so you're not

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.380 
little bit on the way up so you're not
wasting<00:02:15.280> energy<00:02:15.550> getting<00:02:15.910> up<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> first

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
wasting energy getting up to the first

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.290 
wasting energy getting up to the first
part<00:02:16.710> do<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.800> same<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.160> second<00:02:18.460> one<00:02:18.580> I'm

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
part do the same on the second one I'm

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.280 
part do the same on the second one I'm
going<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.510> kind<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.690> give<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.960> little<00:02:19.990> cheat

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
going to kind of give it a little cheat

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.540 
going to kind of give it a little cheat
to<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> top<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:20.890> I'm<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.160> digging<00:02:21.280> at<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
to the top so I'm just digging at the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.480 
to the top so I'm just digging at the
top<00:02:21.670> range<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:22.000> motion<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:24.340> is

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
top range of motion and then this is

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.070 
top range of motion and then this is
gonna<00:02:24.610> be<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.000> top<00:02:25.209> half<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.750> above

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
gonna be just the top half to just above

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:55.309 
gonna be just the top half to just above
the<00:02:26.170> sticking<00:02:26.470> point

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:36.030 

that's<00:02:55.950> part<00:02:56.159> two<00:02:56.629> last<00:02:57.629> one<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.260> each

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.610 

if<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.580> can't<00:03:36.790> get<00:03:36.909> a<00:03:36.939> pump<00:03:37.200> with<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.319> little

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
if you can't get a pump with this little

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.649 
if you can't get a pump with this little
training<00:03:39.000> check<00:03:40.000> your<00:03:40.120> pulse

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
training check your pulse

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.069 
training check your pulse
did<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.379> probably<00:03:41.500> know<00:03:41.680> me<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.829> way<00:03:43.079> this

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
did you probably know me that way this

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.110 
did you probably know me that way this
is<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.260> great<00:03:44.530> training<00:03:44.739> technique<00:03:45.129> I'm<00:03:45.970> gonna

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
is a great training technique I'm gonna

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.330 
is a great training technique I'm gonna
feel<00:03:46.269> like<00:03:46.390> most<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> blood<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.340> really

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
feel like most of the blood I really

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.530 
feel like most of the blood I really
forced<00:03:48.610> some<00:03:48.730> growth<00:03:48.939> into<00:03:49.180> those<00:03:49.299> stubborn

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
forced some growth into those stubborn

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.069 
forced some growth into those stubborn
fibers<00:03:49.930> we're<00:03:50.799> very<00:03:50.950> good<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.189> this<00:03:51.280> right

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
fibers we're very good with this right

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.360 
fibers we're very good with this right
another<00:03:53.079> triple<00:03:53.500> had<00:03:53.620> set<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.069> variation

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
another triple had set to a variation

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.670 
another triple had set to a variation
for<00:03:54.819> you<00:03:54.879> here<00:03:55.060> this<00:03:55.810> one<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.110> done<00:03:56.260> using<00:03:56.470> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
for you here this one is done using a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.670 
for you here this one is done using a
push<00:03:56.980> down<00:03:57.159> and<00:03:57.959> instead<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.019> increasing<00:03:59.409> the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
push down and instead of increasing the

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.809 
push down and instead of increasing the
weight<00:03:59.829> on<00:03:59.980> each<00:04:00.099> set<00:04:00.310> like<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.579> don't<00:04:00.700> really

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
weight on each set like I don't really

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.699 
weight on each set like I don't really
have<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.120> doing<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.290> way<00:04:02.440> you're<00:04:02.560> going

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
have you doing and this way you're going

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.770 
have you doing and this way you're going
to<00:04:02.769> be<00:04:02.829> decreasing<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.340> range<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.640> motion

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
to be decreasing the range of motion

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.699 
to be decreasing the range of motion
we're<00:04:04.780> gonna<00:04:04.900> be<00:04:04.989> starting<00:04:05.349> with<00:04:05.409> a<00:04:05.470> very

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
we're gonna be starting with a very

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.729 
we're gonna be starting with a very
partial<00:04:06.689> outraged<00:04:07.689> emotion<00:04:08.079> range<00:04:08.560> motion

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
partial outraged emotion range motion

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.710 
partial outraged emotion range motion
the<00:04:08.950> strongest<00:04:09.310> part<00:04:09.549> of<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.670> range<00:04:09.819> doing

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
the strongest part of the range doing

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.080 
the strongest part of the range doing
very<00:04:10.870> high<00:04:11.019> reps<00:04:11.290> like<00:04:11.890> 30<00:04:12.159> to<00:04:12.280> 50<00:04:12.579> reps<00:04:12.760> just

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
very high reps like 30 to 50 reps just

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.210 
very high reps like 30 to 50 reps just
in<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.780> very<00:04:13.959> certain<00:04:14.290> range<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.500> motion<00:04:14.829> in

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
in that very certain range of motion in

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.099 
in that very certain range of motion in
your<00:04:15.280> breast<00:04:15.549> ten<00:04:15.700> seconds<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.630> then<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:16.959> go

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
your breast ten seconds and then you go

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.449 
your breast ten seconds and then you go
again<00:04:17.229> with<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.590> partial<00:04:17.919> range<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.190> motion

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
again with the partial range of motion

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.569 
again with the partial range of motion
just<00:04:19.389> up<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.750> sticking<00:04:20.139> point<00:04:20.350> about<00:04:21.340> six

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
just up to the sticking point about six

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.879 
just up to the sticking point about six
to<00:04:21.699> eight<00:04:21.729> reps<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.449> then<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:23.650> all

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
to eight reps and then and this is all

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.710 
to eight reps and then and this is all
keeping<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.310> same<00:04:24.490> weight<00:04:24.669> then<00:04:25.570> you're

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
keeping the same weight then you're

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.840 
keeping the same weight then you're
gonna<00:04:25.810> do<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:25.990> full<00:04:26.260> range<00:04:26.500> with<00:04:26.889> that<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.699> the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
gonna do a full range with that in the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.670 
gonna do a full range with that in the
one<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.090> three<00:04:28.270> rep<00:04:28.419> range<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:29.050> by<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.530> point

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
one to three rep range and by that point

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.290 
one to three rep range and by that point
I<00:04:29.949> saw<00:04:30.400> you're<00:04:30.520> gonna<00:04:30.610> really<00:04:30.850> be<00:04:30.970> able<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.120> get

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
I saw you're gonna really be able to get

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.930 
I saw you're gonna really be able to get
with<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.539> very<00:04:31.720> same<00:04:31.780> way<00:04:32.080> too<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:32.789> this<00:04:33.789> one

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
with that very same way too so this one

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.850 
with that very same way too so this one
isn't<00:04:34.090> push<00:04:34.330> down<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.169> works<00:04:35.350> with<00:04:35.530> just

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
isn't push down and it works with just

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.159 
isn't push down and it works with just
about<00:04:36.639> any<00:04:36.880> exercise<00:04:37.419> here<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.020> can

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
about any exercise here that you can

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.990 
about any exercise here that you can
think<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:39.010> makes<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.669> nice<00:04:39.820> one

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
think of and that makes it a nice one

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.909 
think of and that makes it a nice one
for<00:04:40.150> eternity<00:04:40.210> crowded<00:04:40.690> gym<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.710> have<00:04:41.800> to

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
for eternity crowded gym and you have to

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.110 
for eternity crowded gym and you have to
use<00:04:42.010> freeway<00:04:42.340> didn't<00:04:42.639> want<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:42.820> hog<00:04:42.910> all<00:04:43.060> the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
use freeway didn't want to hog all the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.340 
use freeway didn't want to hog all the
weights<00:04:43.330> but<00:04:43.830> obviously<00:04:44.830> not<00:04:45.010> really<00:04:45.250> big

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
weights but obviously not really big

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.850 
weights but obviously not really big
wait<00:04:46.950> staff<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.570> one<00:04:48.750> very<00:04:49.260> nice

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
wait staff but this one very nice

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.090 
wait staff but this one very nice
you're<00:04:50.400> gonna<00:04:50.490> like

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.670 

to<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.460> pushdown<00:04:55.230> first<00:04:56.230> part<00:04:56.440> is<00:04:56.500> going<00:04:56.530> to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
to the pushdown first part is going to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.100 
to the pushdown first part is going to
be<00:04:56.770> just<00:04:56.920> in<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.100> bottom<00:04:57.430> range<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.730> motion

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
be just in that bottom range of motion

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.110 
be just in that bottom range of motion
second<00:04:59.110> work<00:04:59.230> going<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.830> be<00:04:59.890> right<00:05:00.070> here<00:05:00.120> just

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
second work going to be right here just

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.110 
second work going to be right here just
before<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.480> half<00:05:01.570> way<00:05:01.780> point<00:05:02.460> third<00:05:03.460> part<00:05:03.700> all

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
before the half way point third part all

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:55.220 
before the half way point third part all
the<00:05:04.270> way<00:05:04.360> up<00:05:04.510> all<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.230> way<00:05:05.290> down

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.660 

so<00:05:55.740> if<00:05:55.860> this<00:05:55.950> one<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.280> weight<00:05:56.400> you're<00:05:56.550> going

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
so if this one the weight you're going

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.250 
so if this one the weight you're going
to<00:05:56.730> pick<00:05:56.850> on<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.060> first<00:05:57.270> is<00:05:57.660> something<00:05:58.140> you

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
to pick on the first is something you

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260 
to pick on the first is something you
can<00:05:58.380> do<00:05:58.470> for<00:05:58.500> about<00:05:58.770> 15<00:05:59.130> reps<00:05:59.340> gives<00:06:00.060> you<00:06:00.150> kind

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
can do for about 15 reps gives you kind

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.290 
can do for about 15 reps gives you kind
of<00:06:00.360> a<00:06:00.450> nice<00:06:00.630> mix<00:06:01.230> on<00:06:01.740> that<00:06:01.890> I<00:06:02.070> found<00:06:03.060> that<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.270> be

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
of a nice mix on that I found that to be

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.300 
of a nice mix on that I found that to be
about<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.630> best<00:06:03.750> oh<00:06:04.020> wait<00:06:04.560> too<00:06:04.920> big<00:06:05.100> to<00:06:05.190> work

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
about the best oh wait too big to work

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.560 
about the best oh wait too big to work
with<00:06:06.710> is<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.830> next<00:06:08.010> one<00:06:08.160> just<00:06:08.480> before<00:06:09.480> the

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
with is the next one just before the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:35.140 
with is the next one just before the
halfway<00:06:09.720> point

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.030 

so<00:06:35.570> never<00:06:35.720> rest<00:06:35.960> in<00:06:36.080> seconds<00:06:36.470> we<00:06:36.740> go<00:06:36.860> again

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
so never rest in seconds we go again

00:06:37.040 --> 00:07:05.020 
so never rest in seconds we go again
full<00:06:37.250> range

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.550 

that's<00:07:05.450> it<00:07:05.660> this<00:07:06.110> one<00:07:06.260> gives<00:07:06.380> you<00:07:06.500> a

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
that's it this one gives you a

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.830 
that's it this one gives you a
tremendous<00:07:06.800> pump<00:07:07.400> the<00:07:08.180> first<00:07:08.390> set<00:07:08.540> brings<00:07:08.780> a

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
tremendous pump the first set brings a

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.720 
tremendous pump the first set brings a
lot<00:07:08.960> of<00:07:09.020> light<00:07:09.260> into<00:07:09.380> the<00:07:09.500> muscle<00:07:09.830> the<00:07:10.400> seconds

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
lot of light into the muscle the seconds

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.830 
lot of light into the muscle the seconds
that<00:07:10.850> keeps<00:07:11.060> it<00:07:11.210> there<00:07:11.240> and<00:07:11.450> really<00:07:11.600> starts

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
that keeps it there and really starts

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.060 
that keeps it there and really starts
working<00:07:12.140> those<00:07:12.260> two<00:07:12.350> have<00:07:12.530> that<00:07:12.830> switch

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
working those two have that switch

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.400 
working those two have that switch
wipers<00:07:13.460> and<00:07:14.060> the<00:07:14.120> last<00:07:14.330> part<00:07:14.570> you<00:07:15.020> got<00:07:15.140> a<00:07:15.170> lot

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
wipers and the last part you got a lot

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.650 
wipers and the last part you got a lot
of<00:07:15.440> blood<00:07:15.650> you're<00:07:16.310> working<00:07:16.520> heavier<00:07:16.850> and

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
of blood you're working heavier and

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.610 
of blood you're working heavier and
you're<00:07:17.810> covered<00:07:18.050> the<00:07:18.110> whole<00:07:18.230> range<00:07:18.440> of<00:07:18.500> motion

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
you're covered the whole range of motion

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.890 
you're covered the whole range of motion
so<00:07:18.830> you're<00:07:19.070> really<00:07:19.510> ramming<00:07:20.510> a<00:07:20.570> lot<00:07:20.660> of<00:07:20.750> blood

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
so you're really ramming a lot of blood

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.320 
so you're really ramming a lot of blood
in<00:07:20.930> at<00:07:21.110> most<00:07:21.260> a<00:07:21.710> very<00:07:22.490> good<00:07:22.910> kind<00:07:23.240> of

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
in at most a very good kind of

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.640 
in at most a very good kind of
combination<00:07:23.780> to<00:07:23.840> hit<00:07:23.960> all<00:07:24.110> different<00:07:24.440> muscle

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
combination to hit all different muscle

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.100 
combination to hit all different muscle
fiber<00:07:24.830> types
