movies I don't I can't remember a movie
I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.750> maybe<00:01:13.140> cop-out<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.920> probably<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I think maybe cop-out was probably the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
I think maybe cop-out was probably the
least<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:14.850> even<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.590> even<00:01:16.590> though

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
least one but even that one even though

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
least one but even that one even though
he<00:01:16.799> had<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> struggle<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> read<00:01:17.729> his<00:01:17.850> book

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
he had a struggle if you read his book

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.670 
he had a struggle if you read his book
he<00:01:18.240> had<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> struggle<00:01:18.900> making<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.290> fucking

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
he had a struggle making that fucking

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.590 
he had a struggle making that fucking
movie<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.100> wasn't<00:01:20.520> entirely<00:01:21.150> his<00:01:21.540> fault

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
movie and it wasn't entirely his fault

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.859 
movie and it wasn't entirely his fault
trust<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.280> anyways<00:01:23.640> back<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> script

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
trust me but anyways back to the script

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.130 
trust me but anyways back to the script
okay<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.490> supposedly<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.810> leaked

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
okay so this is supposedly the leaked

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.890 
okay so this is supposedly the leaked
fake<00:01:28.680> Kevin<00:01:29.340> Smith<00:01:29.549> script<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.329> obviously

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
fake Kevin Smith script but obviously

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.590 
fake Kevin Smith script but obviously
it's<00:01:31.350> probably<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.979> who<00:01:32.700> knows<00:01:32.759> who<00:01:33.509> knows

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it's probably just who knows who knows

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's probably just who knows who knows
what<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
the thing is though I've skimmed through
it<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> haven't<00:01:37.049> read<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> entire<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.250> I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it I haven't read the entire thing but I
