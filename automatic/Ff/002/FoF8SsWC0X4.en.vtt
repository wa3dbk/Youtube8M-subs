00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it's it feels like it should be

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.459 
it's it feels like it should be
removable<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.510> although<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.199> it's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
removable but although I know that it's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
removable but although I know that it's
not<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> SIM<00:00:56.940> card<00:00:56.969> stuff<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> over

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
not because the SIM card stuff is over

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.369 
not because the SIM card stuff is over
here<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.430> 5<00:00:59.670> inch<00:00:59.850> display<00:01:00.030> q<00:01:00.809> HD<00:01:01.230> and

we<00:01:05.880> go

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.520 

design<00:01:09.939> here<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:10.420> he's<00:01:10.600> running<00:01:10.719> a<00:01:10.929> Snapdragon

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
design here so he's running a Snapdragon

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.520 
design here so he's running a Snapdragon
400<00:01:12.070> processor<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.450> MSM<00:01:13.899> eighty<00:01:14.289> nine

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
400 processor that's the MSM eighty nine

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.090 
400 processor that's the MSM eighty nine
twenty<00:01:15.189> six<00:01:15.520> it's<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.729> quad-core<00:01:16.179> at<00:01:16.329> 1.2

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
twenty six it's a quad-core at 1.2

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.539 
twenty six it's a quad-core at 1.2
gigahertz<00:01:18.100> now<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.000> also<00:01:19.450> have<00:01:19.990> an<00:01:20.679> internal

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
gigahertz now we also have an internal

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.080 
gigahertz now we also have an internal
memory<00:01:21.819> of<00:01:22.329> 8-bit<00:01:23.259> bytes<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:24.610> ends<00:01:24.819> up<00:01:24.880> being

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
memory of 8-bit bytes that ends up being

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.760 
memory of 8-bit bytes that ends up being
six<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:25.659> it's<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.869> good<00:01:25.990> thing<00:01:26.049> that<00:01:26.229> we<00:01:26.500> have

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
six so it's a good thing that we have

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.959 
six so it's a good thing that we have
the<00:01:27.399> SD<00:01:27.759> card<00:01:28.560> some<00:01:29.560> other<00:01:29.770> features<00:01:30.700> we<00:01:30.939> have

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
the SD card some other features we have

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.059 
the SD card some other features we have
an<00:01:31.390> 8<00:01:31.569> megapixel<00:01:31.840> camera<00:01:32.170> there<00:01:32.649> on<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.920> reel

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
an 8 megapixel camera there on the reel

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.219 
an 8 megapixel camera there on the reel
where<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.429> career<00:01:33.729> with<00:01:33.969> an<00:01:34.090> LED<00:01:34.240> flash<00:01:34.509> and

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
where the career with an LED flash and

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.740 
where the career with an LED flash and
overall<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.310> device<00:01:36.520> does<00:01:36.850> feel<00:01:37.030> really<00:01:37.329> nice

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
overall the device does feel really nice

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.800 
overall the device does feel really nice
so<00:01:37.959> it<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.140> 126<00:01:39.009> grams<00:01:39.130> which<00:01:39.579> is<00:01:39.759> lighter<00:01:40.299> than

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
so it is 126 grams which is lighter than

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.699 
so it is 126 grams which is lighter than
the<00:01:41.159> Galaxy<00:01:42.159> s4<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:43.299> really<00:01:43.899> great<00:01:44.049> display<00:01:44.500> so

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
the Galaxy s4 so really great display so

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.589 
the Galaxy s4 so really great display so
let's<00:01:44.860> just<00:01:45.009> take<00:01:45.069> a<00:01:45.189> look<00:01:45.399> at<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.209> display

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
let's just take a look at the display

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.859 
let's just take a look at the display
just<00:01:47.159> put<00:01:48.159> that<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.459> there<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:48.819> it<00:01:49.239> is<00:01:49.329> an<00:01:49.450> HD

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
just put that in there so it is an HD

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.809 
just put that in there so it is an HD
IPS<00:01:50.020> display<00:01:50.349> so<00:01:51.250> take<00:01:51.489> a<00:01:51.520> look<00:01:51.610> at<00:01:51.729> the

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
IPS display so take a look at the

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.890 
IPS display so take a look at the
viewing<00:01:52.179> angles<00:01:52.739> looks<00:01:53.739> it<00:01:54.670> doesn't

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
viewing angles looks it doesn't

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.920 
viewing angles looks it doesn't
