00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.709
 Hi Chris Fix you. today I'm 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.270
 I will show you how to diagnose the bright light signal 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.899
 So you have a coin when you are 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639
 Your car is powered by an airbag 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.620
 You will appear on the drum and stay 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.410
 About 3 to 5 seconds and then turn off 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.539
 This means that the airbag system or bags 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.730
 Works and works normally but when 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 Operates and operates the motor vehicle 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.730
 The signal of the antenna remains permanently illuminated or remains flashing repeatedly 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 This means there is a problem in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.849
 Your Vehicle's Vehicle System. The number of times the signal flashes is 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 It will give you the error code 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.739
 This method is used on such a car Mazda in the 3000 and 2001 model as well 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.290
 Used on the Ford Ranger Mazda B Series 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.540
 And Ford Explorer as well as many different types of cars and model 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.360
 The way it works is when the signal emits a flickering time 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 Two, three, four means flashing four times and then stopped flashing 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 Six times it means a defect code number four six 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.270
 Or forty-six after reading the code 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 The signal will remain flashing about 5 times 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.109
 It gives you 5 chances to read the code 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.180
 Then he stays illuminated 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 You will know there is a problem 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.570
 In some cars there is no flash but 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.130
 The signal of the irish remains illuminated and then 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.960
 You can take your car to an engineer or free zone 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.580
 Or spare parts stores and will check it for you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.619
 The 46th code referred to previously is forty-four 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.360
 It means that the electrical circuit is stabilized and the driver's side belt is secured 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 Be disabled or disconnected 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.140
 The reason for this imbalance is when 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.610
 Move the chair or put your needs 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570
 Under the chair the seat saw this wire here 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 I am adjusting my position where you can watch 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.320
 These connectors and plugs are here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.600
 What happens is that the moisture decomposes these joints 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.360
 Or it has relaxed 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.470
 Most of the time when you have anything under you 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.640
 Your seat or when you move the seat 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.710
 Forwards and backward, these links are delayed 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.200
 These are in the Ford Maintenance Bulletin 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.329
 But they did not say how to fix it 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.950
 So all you have to do is remove the connectors 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.009
 Brush or put a little of the WG-40 spray on it 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.920
 To remove these plugs you have to pay this 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.840
 Clip down until the end and pull them out 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.079
 Just outside so you spray on it and evaporate 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.030
 Put a little WD 40 here 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.520
 Or some grease and this will help 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.799
 To get rid of 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.159
 Rust 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.260
 Now I will take this 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.670
 Reconnect it and make sure to hear the sound of the shutter 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.920
 Absolutely 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.900
 Move your seat back 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.709
 Now we'll take the car again and watch 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.580
 If the signal is back, the signal will flash again. good 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.620
 The signal is extinguished. This is how to fix the holidays 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.500
 Coda was forty-six or forty-six 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.880
 This was the electric circuit for the side seat stabilizer 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.770
 For the driver. Forty - seven or 47 is the code 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.569
 Side passenger seat so when you repair it do the same 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.459
 To repair the occupant of the passenger. Also there 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.569
 Other codes I will not touch them all 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.090
 But I'll give you a thought about it 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.120
 The first code is 919 and this is normal yet 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.650
 A collision or an accident 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.330
 And the foresight is 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.489
 Memory control module for system restriction and safety 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.810
 They are full. What you have to do is replace them 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.330
 This is the only way to repair 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.549
 that. Also there is code number 42 forty 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.830
 It is a sensitive frontal shock 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.880
 Be careful when working in a system 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.620
 You always have to turn off the car engine 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.060
 And disconnect the battery 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.610
 For at least 10 minutes, be very careful 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.079
 Because if you caught a sensitive frontal 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.150
 He will explode and see this certainly 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.010
 It is not in your favor 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.180
 The other thing that 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.100
 His code is code number 27 and this code 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.470
 Common and what is happening is 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.630
 Power switch and lighting for the lamp 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.660
 The Airbag has become bad and this is called the BD key 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.049
 And the lamp you can 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.549
 Purchased from Radio Shack 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.320
 A few dollars and the number of the piece 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.030
 I'm going to describe the video but its number 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.130
 272-334 and you can also 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.140
 Charged with another lamp light instead of pushing 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.640
 $ 200 for a whole new system 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.739
 This was a quick clip on how 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.840
 Examine the signal of the antenna so if this 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.430
 The CD has helped you and it was useful to work for him 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.930
