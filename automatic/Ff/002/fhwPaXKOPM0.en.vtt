00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.769
 now people are from norman craft and 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.750
 good this time to open a tutorial 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.119
 buenavista in the name of holograms 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.570
 I do not know if anyone will have seen for example 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.540
 us etc or some other server that says 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.210
 I do not know how we like our page 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.490
 facebook for example such a thing 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.239
 the statistics good whatever the 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.680
 issue is that you can see and can be 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.840
 see well on the servers and you can 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.260
 do in minecraft handle as vanilla 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.399
 it's the same and the truth that I love 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 I did not find out I found it on a page 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.629
 of internet to later travel the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.629
 page and in the description of the video 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.910
 but it's great I love it 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.869
 well that I do not know I think you can not 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.750
 intervene to do it with color to this 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.780
 but well, it does not matter, it does not follow us 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.300
 we will always see it well 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:20.770
 it's phenomenal and 42 why 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.970
 it's all the same command is not easier 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.420
 see what a juice is and it is to add a 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.650
 horse 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 57 5 blocks up 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.040
 on a head of we there 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.049
 with the name that is the horse of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.360
 name this for example that are the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.360
 these bars that are seen up here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.280
 is that invulnerable 1 so he does not die 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.869
 and good and that 's the law 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.869
 you just saw something up 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.240
 What herself 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.690
 then there is another that says hologram 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.760
 another that says super epic and another that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.760
 say the same as above but below 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.010
 well I here in the distances I had 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 to put for example here 59.7 or things 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.650
 well because good to erase it you have to 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.880
 make a kindle antich horse and look if 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.080
 I for example put it 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.950
 I got the point 7 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.250
 and he ends up here he has nothing and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.850
 I took out every one, I do not think it has 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.290
 nothing ours if you have it removed and you 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.769
 just 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.950
 this is only with coordinates 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:57.069
 punctual would be 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.200
 well and good is bad and bad enough 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.750
 that I was in a different way and travel the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.819
 command in the description as always and 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.819
 you can write whatever you want 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.060
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.360
