hi it's Caroline a meteorologist at

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.920 
hi it's Caroline a meteorologist at
absolute<00:00:06.370> health<00:00:06.819> aney<00:00:07.089> I'm<00:00:07.540> going<00:00:07.690> to<00:00:07.750> talk

absolute health aney I'm going to talk
to<00:00:08.139> you<00:00:08.320> about<00:00:08.590> minoxidil<00:00:09.400> again<00:00:10.000> today<00:00:10.299> it's

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
to you about minoxidil again today it's

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.019 
to you about minoxidil again today it's
such<00:00:10.869> a<00:00:10.900> misunderstood<00:00:11.860> product<00:00:12.490> it's<00:00:12.969> not

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:13.029 
such a misunderstood product it's not

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.840 
such a misunderstood product it's not
understood<00:00:13.480> why<00:00:13.750> you<00:00:14.110> use<00:00:14.440> minoxidil<00:00:14.949> and<00:00:15.219> the

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
understood why you use minoxidil and the

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.310 
understood why you use minoxidil and the
rules<00:00:16.090> associated<00:00:16.480> with<00:00:16.900> it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
rules associated with it

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.429 
rules associated with it
minoxidil<00:00:17.980> it<00:00:18.669> reduces<00:00:19.269> the<00:00:19.689> constriction

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
minoxidil it reduces the constriction

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.120 
minoxidil it reduces the constriction
caused<00:00:20.830> by<00:00:21.099> DHT<00:00:21.970> dihydrotestosterone<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
caused by DHT dihydrotestosterone and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.069 
caused by DHT dihydrotestosterone and
it's<00:00:24.279> related<00:00:24.609> to<00:00:24.759> male<00:00:25.119> and<00:00:25.390> female<00:00:25.779> hand

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
it's related to male and female hand

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.620 
it's related to male and female hand
thinning<00:00:26.470> which<00:00:26.679> is<00:00:26.859> for<00:00:27.130> thinning<00:00:27.630> gradual

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
thinning which is for thinning gradual

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.960 
thinning which is for thinning gradual
thingy<00:00:28.900> I<00:00:29.019> should<00:00:29.259> say<00:00:29.439> at<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.949> top<00:00:30.249> areas<00:00:30.669> of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
thingy I should say at the top areas of

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.330 
thingy I should say at the top areas of
the<00:00:31.240> scalp<00:00:31.480> does<00:00:31.869> infect<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.560> entire<00:00:32.770> scalp

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
the scalp does infect the entire scalp

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.240 
the scalp does infect the entire scalp
so<00:00:33.520> what<00:00:33.640> happens<00:00:34.060> is<00:00:34.480> this<00:00:34.690> DHT<00:00:35.380> it<00:00:35.740> starts<00:00:36.160> to

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
so what happens is this DHT it starts to

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.300 
so what happens is this DHT it starts to
bind<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:37.120> antigen<00:00:37.620> receptors<00:00:38.620> now<00:00:39.220> we

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
bind to the antigen receptors now we

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.420 
bind to the antigen receptors now we
have<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.790> block<00:00:40.090> or<00:00:40.390> inhibit<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.350> DHT<00:00:41.860> first

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
have to block or inhibit the DHT first

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.580 
have to block or inhibit the DHT first
before<00:00:42.940> you<00:00:43.090> can<00:00:43.270> start<00:00:43.510> moving<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:44.050> away<00:00:44.230> with

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
before you can start moving it away with

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.980 
before you can start moving it away with
one<00:00:44.770> also<00:00:45.130> now<00:00:45.610> but<00:00:45.790> also<00:00:45.940> all<00:00:46.300> traditionally

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
one also now but also all traditionally

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.330 
one also now but also all traditionally
the<00:00:47.140> herb<00:00:47.230> accountant<00:00:47.710> ones<00:00:47.890> ones<00:00:48.220> have<00:00:48.310> been

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
the herb accountant ones ones have been

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.820 
the herb accountant ones ones have been
available<00:00:48.700> for<00:00:48.970> many<00:00:49.210> years<00:00:49.600> they<00:00:50.230> do<00:00:50.650> not

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
available for many years they do not

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.610 
available for many years they do not
have<00:00:51.130> DHT<00:00:52.030> eating<00:00:52.330> if<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:52.540> is<00:00:52.660> in<00:00:52.810> them<00:00:52.990> so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
have DHT eating if it is in them so

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.500 
have DHT eating if it is in them so
you're<00:00:53.770> trying<00:00:54.130> to<00:00:54.490> inhibit<00:00:55.000> them<00:00:55.120> an<00:00:55.210> ox<00:00:55.330> or

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
you're trying to inhibit them an ox or

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.270 
you're trying to inhibit them an ox or
move<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:55.870> away<00:00:55.960> at<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.440> same<00:00:56.620> times<00:00:56.920> as<00:00:57.160> long

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
move it away at the same times as long

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.190 
move it away at the same times as long
as<00:00:57.400> you<00:00:57.460> try<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:57.700> move<00:00:57.940> away<00:00:58.120> it's<00:00:58.780> building

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
as you try and move away it's building

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.350 
as you try and move away it's building
up<00:00:59.320> so<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.590> me<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.830> go<00:01:00.130> nowhere<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:01.060> first

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
up so to me you go nowhere so first

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.450 
up so to me you go nowhere so first
thing<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:01.750> do<00:01:01.960> here<00:01:02.260> at<00:01:02.350> Absolute<00:01:02.770> Cal<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.370> it

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
thing we do here at Absolute Cal and it

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.630 
thing we do here at Absolute Cal and it
is<00:01:03.580> we<00:01:03.730> teach<00:01:04.000> how<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.299> inhibit<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.409> DHT<00:01:05.860> now<00:01:06.609> I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
is we teach how to inhibit the DHT now I

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.239 
is we teach how to inhibit the DHT now I
do<00:01:06.759> like<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.149> do<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.539> naturally<00:01:07.689> if<00:01:08.679> you<00:01:08.859> do<00:01:09.070> it

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249 
do like to do it naturally if you do it

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.419 
do like to do it naturally if you do it
with<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.670> medication<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:11.439> can<00:01:11.679> cause<00:01:11.920> diffuse

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
with a medication it can cause diffuse

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.160 
with a medication it can cause diffuse
hair<00:01:12.609> loss<00:01:12.789> as<00:01:13.030> well<00:01:13.149> as<00:01:13.299> other<00:01:13.479> side<00:01:13.810> effects

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
hair loss as well as other side effects

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.889 
hair loss as well as other side effects
so<00:01:14.350> be<00:01:14.499> careful<00:01:14.950> about<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.759> kind<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:16.090> DHT<00:01:16.719> in

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
so be careful about the kind of DHT in

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.450 
so be careful about the kind of DHT in
here<00:01:17.079> two<00:01:17.320> years<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:17.679> stopped<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:17.979> natural

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
here two years you stopped a natural

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.830 
here two years you stopped a natural
function<00:01:18.880> in<00:01:18.999> your<00:01:19.090> body<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.539> will<00:01:19.600> actually

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
function in your body you will actually

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.739 
function in your body you will actually
get<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.200> side<00:01:20.499> effect<00:01:20.890> which<00:01:21.369> can<00:01:21.609> increase<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
get a side effect which can increase the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.080 
get a side effect which can increase the
problem<00:01:22.990> with<00:01:23.319> the<00:01:23.439> hair<00:01:23.679> so<00:01:24.130> be<00:01:24.369> minoxidil

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
problem with the hair so be minoxidil

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.149 
problem with the hair so be minoxidil

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
most over-the-counter an obstacle

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
most over-the-counter an obstacle
products<00:01:27.609> are<00:01:27.789> 5%<00:01:28.329> and<00:01:28.810> they<00:01:29.229> have<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:29.469> huge

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
products are 5% and they have a huge

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
poll now propylene glycol is a protein

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.709 
poll now propylene glycol is a protein
denature<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.090> not<00:01:37.179> to<00:01:37.329> mention<00:01:37.509> an

anti-freezing<00:01:38.350> agent<00:01:38.530> they<00:01:38.829> use<00:01:38.979> on

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
anti-freezing agent they use on

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.069 
anti-freezing agent they use on
aeroplanes<00:01:39.639> now<00:01:40.149> that<00:01:40.299> sort<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.600> stuff<00:01:40.810> is

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
aeroplanes now that sort of stuff is

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.469 
aeroplanes now that sort of stuff is
actually<00:01:41.469> bad<00:01:41.889> for<00:01:41.920> your<00:01:42.429> skin<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:43.030> it's

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
actually bad for your skin so it's

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.989 
actually bad for your skin so it's
designed<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:44.109> eat<00:01:44.439> through<00:01:44.979> your<00:01:45.280> scalp<00:01:45.579> skin

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
designed to eat through your scalp skin

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.749 
designed to eat through your scalp skin
so<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.689> minoxidil<00:01:47.109> can<00:01:47.409> get<00:01:47.590> down<00:01:47.829> to<00:01:48.549> here

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
so the minoxidil can get down to here

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.340 
so the minoxidil can get down to here
now<00:01:49.090> most<00:01:49.270> people<00:01:49.389> are<00:01:49.539> allergic<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:50.109> this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
now most people are allergic to this

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.230 
now most people are allergic to this

do minoxidil used to be a blood-pressure

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.209 
do minoxidil used to be a blood-pressure
tablet<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.389> is<00:01:55.479> not<00:01:55.719> natural<00:01:56.170> either<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:57.039> be

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
on top of that the alcohol will

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.700 
on top of that the alcohol will
dehydrate

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
dehydrate

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.770 
dehydrate
those<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:03.190> scale<00:02:03.670> but<00:02:04.240> all<00:02:04.390> this<00:02:04.540> bad<00:02:04.750> stuff

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
those of scale but all this bad stuff

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.690

going<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.619> minoxidil<00:02:05.979> not<00:02:06.280> really<00:02:06.490> doing

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
what it needs to do so I've been

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.610 
what it needs to do so I've been
searching<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.690> part<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.080> knob<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.380> I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
searching for a part of a knob so that I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.949 
searching for a part of a knob so that I
can<00:02:11.950> use<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.700> won't<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.180> effect<00:02:13.750> on

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
can use that won't have that effect on

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.720 
can use that won't have that effect on
the<00:02:14.470> scalp<00:02:14.770> skin<00:02:15.100> because<00:02:15.430> when<00:02:15.610> you're

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the scalp skin because when you're

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.730 
the scalp skin because when you're
correcting<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.420> hair<00:02:16.569> cycle<00:02:16.780> which<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.590> need

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
correcting the hair cycle which you need

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.010 
correcting the hair cycle which you need
to<00:02:17.800> nurture<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.490> nourish<00:02:18.550> what<00:02:19.480> happens<00:02:19.810> down

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
to nurture and nourish what happens down

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.229 
to nurture and nourish what happens down
here<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.440> dermis<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:21.160> dehydrate<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
here in the dermis not dehydrate and

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.890 
here in the dermis not dehydrate and
denature<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:24.160> we<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.850> formula<00:02:25.540> of

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
denature so we have a formula of

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.210 
denature so we have a formula of
minoxidil<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:26.920> highly<00:02:27.190> recommend

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
minoxidil that I can highly recommend

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.740 
minoxidil that I can highly recommend
now<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.360> 5%<00:02:29.050> minoxidil<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.239> with<00:02:31.720> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
now it is 5% minoxidil but it is with a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.500 
now it is 5% minoxidil but it is with a
base<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.380> aloe<00:02:32.830> vera<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.940> soothing

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
base of aloe vera so it's a soothing

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.130 
base of aloe vera so it's a soothing
aloe<00:02:34.780> vera<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.410> on<00:02:35.680> top<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.340> has<00:02:36.550> 11

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
aloe vera and on top of that it has 11

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.740 
aloe vera and on top of that it has 11
natural<00:02:38.370> DHT<00:02:39.370> inhibitors<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.600> they're

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
natural DHT inhibitors so they're

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.979 
natural DHT inhibitors so they're
actually<00:02:41.110> going<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.800> they're<00:02:42.160> protecting

actually going and they're protecting

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.780 
actually going and they're protecting
they<00:02:43.989> have<00:02:44.200> old<00:02:44.350> from<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.709> DHT<00:02:45.070> as<00:02:45.430> well<00:02:45.610> as

they have old from the DHT as well as

they have old from the DHT as well as

the minoxidil moving it away all at the

same time however there's some rules

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.040 
same time however there's some rules
about<00:02:51.130> using<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.640> because<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.360> don't<00:02:52.600> have<00:02:52.840> the

about using it because we don't have the

damaging the surface of the skin so we

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.430 
damaging the surface of the skin so we

clean it with a natural scalp cleanser
read<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.489> ingredients<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.540> then<00:03:19.780> must<00:03:20.079> be

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
read the ingredients and then must be

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.319 
read the ingredients and then must be
effective<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.130> must<00:03:21.340> feel<00:03:21.640> clean<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.150> must

effective it must feel clean it must

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.630 
effective it must feel clean it must
look<00:03:22.510> clean<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:23.320> without<00:03:23.590> denaturing<00:03:24.430> it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
look clean but without denaturing it

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.990 
look clean but without denaturing it
then<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:25.630> channel<00:03:26.019> through<00:03:26.680> open<00:03:27.459> follicles

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
then we channel through open follicles

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.479 
then we channel through open follicles
so<00:03:28.120> we<00:03:28.209> open<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.630> follicle<00:03:29.140> with<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.590> tonic

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
so we open the follicle with a tonic

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.940 
so we open the follicle with a tonic
okay<00:03:30.910> it's<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.299> scalp<00:03:31.750> tops<00:03:32.079> kind<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.440> like<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
okay it's a scalp tops kind of like the

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.850 
okay it's a scalp tops kind of like the
face<00:03:33.190> toner<00:03:33.549> without<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.630> alcohol<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:35.560> it's<00:03:35.739> a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
face toner without the alcohol so it's a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.699 
face toner without the alcohol so it's a
tie<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.430> open<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.329> hole<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.900> then<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.320> channel

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
tie to open the hole and then we channel

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.500 
tie to open the hole and then we channel
through<00:03:38.950> with<00:03:39.130> our<00:03:39.280> micro<00:03:39.760> needle<00:03:40.030> therapy

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
through with our micro needle therapy

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.380 
through with our micro needle therapy
then<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.200> only<00:03:41.320> then<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:41.980> dry<00:03:42.310> scalp<00:03:42.670> do<00:03:43.239> you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
then and only then on a dry scalp do you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.349 
then and only then on a dry scalp do you
apply<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:44.230> same<00:03:44.500> formula<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.250> minoxidil<00:03:45.730> now

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
apply this same formula of minoxidil now

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.030 
apply this same formula of minoxidil now
when<00:03:46.570> we<00:03:46.690> do<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.170> only<00:03:47.530> have<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:47.859> do<00:03:48.010> it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
when we do this you only have to do it

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.979 
when we do this you only have to do it
on<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.310> day<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.850> wash<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.540> no<00:03:49.780> more

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
on the day that you wash so no more

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.810 
on the day that you wash so no more
twice<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.380> day<00:03:50.799> or<00:03:51.130> anything<00:03:51.310> like<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.519> no

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
twice a day or anything like that no

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.729 
twice a day or anything like that no
sticky<00:03:52.209> residue<00:03:52.239> left<00:03:52.810> on<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.109> scalp<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
sticky residue left on the scalp and

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.580 
sticky residue left on the scalp and
never<00:03:54.010> any<00:03:54.250> more<00:03:54.519> than<00:03:54.730> one<00:03:54.970> mill<00:03:55.570> at<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.930> time

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
never any more than one mill at a time

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.460 
never any more than one mill at a time
so<00:03:57.549> that's<00:03:57.730> our<00:03:58.030> you've<00:03:58.600> been<00:03:58.720> oxydol<00:03:59.049> formula

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
so that's our you've been oxydol formula

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.310 
so that's our you've been oxydol formula
from<00:03:59.709> hair<00:04:00.100> scripts<00:04:00.459> complete<00:04:01.140> they<00:04:02.140> also

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
from hair scripts complete they also

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.069 
from hair scripts complete they also
have<00:04:02.769> an<00:04:03.160> alternative<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.150> minoxidil<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:04.870> for

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
have an alternative to minoxidil so for

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.229 
have an alternative to minoxidil so for
women<00:04:05.380> who<00:04:05.799> are<00:04:05.950> pregnant<00:04:06.160> or<00:04:06.489> people<00:04:06.790> who<00:04:06.940> are

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
women who are pregnant or people who are

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.630 
women who are pregnant or people who are
allergic<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.750> minoxidil<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.560> have<00:04:08.799> a<00:04:09.010> formula

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
allergic to minoxidil we have a formula

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.610 
allergic to minoxidil we have a formula
which<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.090> maximum<00:04:10.630> where<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.870> therapy<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.440> is

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
which is maximum where a therapy that is

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.060 
which is maximum where a therapy that is
the<00:04:11.829> 11<00:04:12.280> DHT<00:04:13.060> inhibitors<00:04:14.019> so<00:04:14.560> when<00:04:14.829> I<00:04:14.859> actually

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
the 11 DHT inhibitors so when I actually

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.060 
the 11 DHT inhibitors so when I actually
start<00:04:15.459> moving<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.449> DHT<00:04:16.840> away<00:04:17.260> which<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.799> what

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
start moving the DHT away which is what

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.009 
start moving the DHT away which is what
the<00:04:18.190> minoxidil<00:04:18.579> does<00:04:18.880> however<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.780> will

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
the minoxidil does however it will

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.760 
the minoxidil does however it will
protect<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.739> hair<00:04:21.639> bulb<00:04:21.820> from<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.480> DHT<00:04:22.930> we<00:04:23.560> do

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
protect the hair bulb from the DHT we do

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.320 
protect the hair bulb from the DHT we do
that<00:04:23.980> internally<00:04:24.669> through<00:04:25.180> our
