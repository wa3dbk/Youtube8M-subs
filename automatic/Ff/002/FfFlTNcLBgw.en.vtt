three people approached them about
renting<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:41.660> there<00:00:41.810> seems<00:00:42.020> to<00:00:42.290> be<00:00:42.410> an<00:00:42.530> uptick

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
renting so there seems to be an uptick

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.040 
renting so there seems to be an uptick
and<00:00:43.220> demand<00:00:43.610> for<00:00:43.790> rentals<00:00:44.150> in<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.600> back<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.900> my

and demand for rentals in the back of my

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.750 
and demand for rentals in the back of my
mind<00:00:45.200> I've<00:00:45.440> thought<00:00:45.650> well<00:00:45.980> if<00:00:46.280> we<00:00:46.400> don't<00:00:46.550> know

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
mind I've thought well if we don't know

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.070 
mind I've thought well if we don't know
of<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:46.910> by<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.060> time<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.420> house<00:00:47.540> we<00:00:47.720> build<00:00:47.930> is

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
of it by the time the house we build is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.780 
of it by the time the house we build is
ready<00:00:48.320> maybe<00:00:48.950> we'll<00:00:49.130> just<00:00:49.190> rent<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:49.520> for<00:00:49.670> two

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
ready maybe we'll just rent it for two

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.460 
ready maybe we'll just rent it for two
years<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.090> wait<00:00:50.300> for<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.720> market<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:51.050> improve

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
years and wait for the market to improve

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.890 
years and wait for the market to improve
and<00:00:51.740> then<00:00:52.040> sell<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:52.460> later<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:52.970> think<00:00:53.690> another

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
and then sell it later I think another

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.380 
and then sell it later I think another
option<00:00:54.380> would<00:00:54.410> be<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.370> think<00:00:55.400> before<00:00:55.820> I

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
option would be and I think before I

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.810 
option would be and I think before I
would<00:00:56.900> list<00:00:57.140> with<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.380> realtor<00:00:57.680> because<00:00:58.670> I'm

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
would list with a realtor because I'm

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.920 
would list with a realtor because I'm
not<00:00:58.940> convinced<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.420> they<00:00:59.570> would<00:00:59.720> bring

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
not convinced that they would bring

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.290 
not convinced that they would bring
anything<00:01:00.140> more<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.680> sales<00:01:01.430> party<00:01:02.090> if<00:01:02.180> you

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
anything more to the sales party if you

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.999 
anything more to the sales party if you
know<00:01:02.450> I<00:01:02.690> think<00:01:03.020> that<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.650> thing<00:01:03.770> would<00:01:03.890> be

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
know I think that the thing would be

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.399 
know I think that the thing would be
priced<00:01:04.280> at<00:01:05.059> some<00:01:05.360> point<00:01:05.630> there's<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.110> price

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
priced at some point there's a price

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.190 
priced at some point there's a price
point<00:01:07.060> there's<00:01:08.060> an<00:01:08.210> inflection<00:01:08.720> point<00:01:08.750> that

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
point there's an inflection point that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.010 
point there's an inflection point that
says<00:01:09.470> that's<00:01:10.460> too<00:01:10.790> cheap<00:01:11.000> someone's<00:01:11.780> got<00:01:11.930> to

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
says that's too cheap someone's got to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.890 
says that's too cheap someone's got to
buy<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:12.500> it<00:01:13.250> creates<00:01:13.640> together<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:14.690> is

closer<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.890> completion<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:02.450> might<00:02:02.630> be<00:02:02.750> more

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
closer to completion we might be more
