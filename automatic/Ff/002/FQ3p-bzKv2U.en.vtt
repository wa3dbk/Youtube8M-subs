 oye good choice of hello to all here 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.039
 regling on a budget for you 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.180
 present some small information 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.410
 I could not but this last minute 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.850
 places information that could 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.890
 to be helpful to you and who could very 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.390
 interesting for you because that's it 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.460
 you are not unaware that we are at 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.380
 less by amroune and yes basically to a 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.370
 week of the release anyway 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.160
 official halo 4 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.110
 so it's approaching very fast and he 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.999
 are still a few small 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.920
 little dishes on the grill that a few 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.050
 little things in train that are in 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 trying to concoct for you 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.280
 precisely to prepare and finish 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.609
 this week 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.980
 this last week out of 100 to leucate 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.449
 just to know that so the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.550
 contest officially ended 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.350
 yesterday to know Sunday at 00:01 as 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.979
 planned do not compete I speak well of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.659
 olympic games 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.729
 so we received some participations 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.640
 but not a lot 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.409
 oddly and in fact we're learning 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.900
 a little we realized that actually 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.540
 the mailbox looked a little bit 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.520
 buggy maybe visibly there was 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.930
 mails that we did not receive and where 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.780
 what we will do is that by then 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.729
 this night we will send an xbox message 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.590
 to all the people we have received 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.180
 participation is so by then 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.430
 tomorrow morning so Tuesday 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.049
 you have not received a message on 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.369
 your xbox from a staff member you 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.240
 signaling that we have received your 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.159
 participation 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.049
 but that you had sent an email for 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.729
 to participate what you need 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.859
 do as soon as possible to know if 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.990
 possible tomorrow so Tuesday is really 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.789
 as soon as possible if not we can 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.950
 not to take into account your 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.840
 candidacy it would be to come on the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.789
 forum squarely on the topic 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.170
 about the Olympics and you 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.460
 put your candidacy squarely 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 on top of that we are sure of the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.939
 receive and see at least we will be sure what 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.049
 will be taken into account 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.119
 so we are sorry for this inconvenience 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.679
 but we realized at the last 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.060
 moment looking at the last 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.409
 candidatures that we and that we 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.579
 seemed weird that some 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.890
 people who were supposed to participate 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.820
 do not participate and where so we get 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.979
 is really realizing argument 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.300
 we are not like 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.229
 wicked we will not say ah ah so much 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.910
 worse it's not our fault that the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.920
 messenger bug people are getting off on 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.690
 warns you but really does not 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.519
 so that was it forever 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.620
 contest and to continue with the 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.030
 contest and finish 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.769
 so know that the results will be 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.540
 available before the release of halo 4 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.620
 so most definitely at the end of the week 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.610
 that's why you have to hurry 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.879
 if you have not yet given the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.040
 then left a good second and 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.500
 last thing about this time 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.769
 halo reach as joly says halo 4 spell 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.420
 very very very very soon and 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.159
 so here we had already made games 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.019
 halo pic to really make one last 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.030
 is really a last event to 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.069
 main before the release of halo 4 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.860
 and then we said we really have to 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.959
 to push the delirium after what remains 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.069
 a week on halo reach so what we 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.989

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.609

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.739

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.970
