00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
 It is something until a few clicks against a 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:17.750
 possible did not take anything else on screen 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:17.750
 the studies goes back to the year 93 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.430
 good afternoon 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.099
 respect to everything 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:47.010
 the query you want to do not 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.890
 specifically and second thing does not have 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.379
 of what time stops I know how long 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.000
 more like the neck is sometimes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.270
 controlling with subject all the good as 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270
 co 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:17.250
 and already has more than a good year many 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 thanks for calling the wheat look 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.479
 Rodrigo and now they went down I say 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.700
 units and the truth that for us 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.420
 it is a constant enemy 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.610
 because especially on the scalp 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.500
 produces this very annoying layer and even 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.530
 people write like that suddenly it's 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.470
 so deep and so thick and so thick 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.479
 common like squeezing a bit this 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 feeling of tiredness that one has 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.630
 above all I do not expect hair in everything 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.030
 case how to convince you this gel what you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.979
 you name is pretty good shampoo like that 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.800
 well yes it is not bad that it is 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.710
 using but people suddenly confuse 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.990
 a lot because there are other things that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.610
 she can use the same you do not have to go 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.620
 to the dermatologist but at the bottom of the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.090
 home like some small cracks that 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.880
 I said scare 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.439
 first there are droplets substances 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.709
 specials that you want to take 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.709
 Rodrigo means doing 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.080
 and the brown coin but the little ones 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.150
 my grandfather started with blond theme 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:35.769
 quality to taste and also I pointers 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:35.769
 tooth rabbits measures 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.940
 Water 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.480
 I do not have it as you do 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.480
 we have to warn
