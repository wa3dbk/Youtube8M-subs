00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.600
 What 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:13.070
 Well then 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.630
 I had a question that I did not know how to step on the bass drum 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.900
 I will take a little bit 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.870
 so 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:25.730
 Well each one is each person 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:31.759
 The first way is to say that heal down 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:35.239
 Well, I'll keep it on the ankle with the ankle in the future 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:41.870
 Well heel group synthesis 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:44.530
 More volume but I get the sound Well I Well, even this looks like but what is I gal 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.530
 When you want to put out 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.670
 Well that 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.850
 See or lift 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.850
 Grinded as it is sound 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.810
 Raise your heels 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.140
 It feels like I'm dropping it from my thighs 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.760
 It feels like this way Khan 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.460
 Pau Ntte 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:22.890
 I feel ankles dropped 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.890
 It feels like it floats up when you lift it, and only the toes remain, and that number already 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.400
 Hmm 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:33.760
 I'm feeling well because the amount of tones I do 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.980
 It is how to meet 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.980
 And when it comes to double stroke 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:50.470
 Well in the fielder usually hit and ankle ankle 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:50.470
 Double-after and luck way in like a feeling of Te is the Well heel emergence 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 Medium even wrist want to Well I'd Eidabero Wu Who I'm cormorant U in the path 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.930
 It can be used to move the ankle 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.580
 I hope you do it all 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.420
 For the time being, first let's drop it through a futon and become a pong 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.850
 In Naa was pressed close 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.360
 I'd Tteyuu closed after hitting Ru this to suppress One k 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.750
 Bouncing back then 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.650
 Hmm 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.920
 There is no opening of the gals, but it is not okay if you press down 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.920
 eh 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.319
 eh 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.060
 What 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.060
 I'm used to it and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.969
 After that my way changed a little 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.969
 Put on this way 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:05.780
 From the heel 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.590
 Or I'd hear a little seen this is probably 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.780
 Under'm alone until now 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.780
 I have never seen anything 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:25.740
 I feel like that 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.700
 If this was a little 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.150
 I'm thinking that I'm a video house fast 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.880
 It looks like it's like this. 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.240
 Please try it 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.240
 after 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.210
 Oh yes , please try variously 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.960
 I think it's good from my own original statement 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.960
 that's all
