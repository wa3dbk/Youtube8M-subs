00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it was but um in my review earlier today

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.840 
it was but um in my review earlier today
I<00:00:59.730> said<00:01:00.090> he<00:01:00.329> didn't<00:01:00.570> movie<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.699> there<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I said he didn't movie because there are

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
I said he didn't movie because there are
other<00:01:03.149> aspects<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> movie<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.080> there

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
other aspects of the movie and there

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
other aspects of the movie and there
were<00:01:04.530> too<00:01:04.739> many<00:01:04.920> other<00:01:05.159> aspects<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.850> took

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
were too many other aspects that took

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.109 
were too many other aspects that took
over<00:01:06.869> his<00:01:07.470> role<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> overshadow<00:01:08.490> him<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
over his role and overshadow him to a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.820 
over his role and overshadow him to a
degree<00:01:09.470> well<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:12.479> still<00:01:13.200> stand<00:01:13.409> behind<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
degree well I I still stand behind that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.850 
degree well I I still stand behind that
but<00:01:14.250> um<00:01:14.780> just<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.869> people<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.170> yelling<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.710> me

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
but um just so people like yelling at me

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.820 
but um just so people like yelling at me
I<00:01:17.040> agree<00:01:17.729> he<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.420> Joker<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:19.380> was

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I agree he was a good Joker he was

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
I agree he was a good Joker he was
probably<00:01:20.130> better<00:01:20.549> than<00:01:20.670> Jack<00:01:20.909> Nicholson<00:01:21.450> but

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
probably better than Jack Nicholson but

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.560 
probably better than Jack Nicholson but
it's<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:23.189> hard<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> say<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:23.970> they

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it's really hard to say because they

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.499 
it's really hard to say because they
both<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.320> movies<00:01:25.619> had<00:01:25.770> different<00:01:26.270> spins<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
both those movies had different spins to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.410 
both those movies had different spins to
them<00:01:28.040> Christopher<00:01:29.040> Nolan's<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:30.030> means<00:01:30.240> are

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
them Christopher Nolan's that means are

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.749 
them Christopher Nolan's that means are
a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.630> darker<00:01:30.960> they're<00:01:31.320> more<00:01:31.860> real<00:01:32.100> world<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
a lot darker they're more real world and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.960 
a lot darker they're more real world and
the<00:01:33.540> other<00:01:33.720> Batman<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:35.159> lighter<00:01:35.579> less

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the other Batman was little lighter less

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.580 
the other Batman was little lighter less
was<00:01:36.810> gritty<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.369> uh<00:01:38.689> yeah<00:01:39.689> Heath<00:01:39.900> Ledger<00:01:40.140> he

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
was gritty but uh yeah Heath Ledger he

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.760 
was gritty but uh yeah Heath Ledger he
if<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:41.790> Heath<00:01:42.450> Ledger<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.960> missile<00:01:43.380> movie

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
if if Heath Ledger was a missile movie

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
if if Heath Ledger was a missile movie
there<00:01:44.340> weren't<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:44.909> didn't<00:01:45.149> go<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> Japan

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
there weren't they didn't go to Japan

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.819 
there weren't they didn't go to Japan
they<00:01:45.840> didn't<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.140> any<00:01:46.290> other<00:01:46.439> other<00:01:46.590> side

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
they didn't have any other other side

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.280 
they didn't have any other other side
plots<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.970> easily<00:01:48.479> would<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.720> been<00:01:48.840> where

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
plots this easily would have been where

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.950 
plots this easily would have been where
my<00:01:49.439> top<00:01:50.009> three<00:01:50.579> movies<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> year<00:01:51.210> but

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
my top three movies of the year but

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.069 
my top three movies of the year but
because<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:52.890> did<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.329> go<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> Japan<00:01:54.869> they

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
because they did go go to Japan they

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.980 
because they did go go to Japan they
spread<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> plot<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.820> made<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.360> movie

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
spread out the plot they made this movie

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.530 
spread out the plot they made this movie
two<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.229> half<00:01:58.320> hours<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.149> focused

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
two and half hours but if they focused

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.200 
two and half hours but if they focused
on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> Joker<00:02:00.990> plot<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:02.070> had<00:02:02.280> Batman

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
on the Joker plot and just had Batman

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.660 
on the Joker plot and just had Batman
vs.<00:02:03.810> Joker<00:02:04.020> throughout<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> whole<00:02:04.799> movie<00:02:04.829> had

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
vs. Joker throughout the whole movie had

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.930 
vs. Joker throughout the whole movie had
led<00:02:05.880> your<00:02:06.060> act<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.420> Christian<00:02:06.840> Bale<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.290> his

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
led your act in Christian Bale with his

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.780 
led your act in Christian Bale with his
friends<00:02:09.110> Morgan<00:02:10.110> Freeman<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.649> Michael<00:02:11.580> Caine

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
friends Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
friends Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine
that<00:02:12.480> stuff<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:13.050> on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that stuff going on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
that stuff going on
I<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.070> would<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.280> been<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> lot<00:02:14.670> better

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
I think it would have been a lot better

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.450 
I think it would have been a lot better
of<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.050> film<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.910> he<00:02:18.480> really<00:02:18.780> was<00:02:18.960> a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
of a film it because he really was a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.550 
of a film it because he really was a
