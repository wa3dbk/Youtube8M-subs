00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:11.660
 Hello UTB 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.759
 Andrei Kushniruk again today, March 26 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.330
 year 2013 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:23.590
 This is a small video I wanted to show about 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:28.270
 fair pass prizes for formative 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:33.210
 I mean in the past, the video showed how 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 we clean them up 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 big frezoy yes but now passes 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:46.710
 plates that mitsubishi cutter 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.670
 And already on the balances and makes the first 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.350
 finishing pass prize of three quarters 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.149
 inch means cat about 20 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 millimeters in diameter and it's flat with 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:09.630
 I will install the plates now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:12.479
 and I will show how it looks but when we 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.070
 we work on such large areas 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 yes on large molds 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.620
 endurance problem occurs 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.590
 tool as if we tried 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.510
 process this whole area 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.580
 the ball produces no ball then 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:40.930
 faces would not stand half square 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:45.600
 meters means square she would have a ball below 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:51.520
 sure baht crumbled demolished and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.820
 literally ten maybe 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.780
 centimeters running 20 he would already 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.130
 showed 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 I began to show signs of wear but 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.990
 such a square mill 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.940
 Now Iâ€™ll stop them. 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.190
 like that 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.190
 I 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 boy 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.950
 here and so it looks like this cutter 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.000
 I honestly and and this cutter 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:45.120
 found someone selling by chance on ebay 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.770
 two pieces at once and I bought both pieces and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.270
 both of these cutters 1 of course already hit 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.580
 accident and it is no longer with us but 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:03.420
 second we take care of her 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.490
 so take care I was surprised when we 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.220
 first time started using this cutter 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.050
 and here these plates were surprised and tearing 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.160
 endurance 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:21.560
 here they are by the way I have boxes here with 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.560
 these plates this mitsubishi 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.380
 mitsubishi 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.680
 and these are the letters up here 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:37.650
 first especially they are empty 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:44.370
 this type means plate well and here it is 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:48.750
 big they are about 15 millimeters 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.290
 probably from the angle to the angle of attack smaller 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:59.760
 who here now i use it here 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:02.730
 this acceptance number is 12-6 16 our 16 digits 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.920
 dangerous not to denote radius this 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.530
 another box here 8 yes here such here 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 little eyes 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.700
 they are already here I have almost many worn out 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.840
 but this 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.590
 with a large radius on the left and on the right more 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.170
 minor decides a three-quarters of a millimeter 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.840
 this is millimeter and a half melina 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.830
 radius and here on these big ones too 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:37.580
 one and a half millimeter of rabiz in general is 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:41.850
 a short video about how we do 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.420
 the first finishing pass on large 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.580
 squares mean we pass and do not know 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.580
 Now let's see it better not from the world 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:01.520
 passing this frezoy over all 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:05.130
 immediately the surface here it goes further 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:12.960
 it goes all over the surface and 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:16.650
 slope connector on the part itself and on 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:21.030
 all over the world that is to all the slopes 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.100
 not pop flat planes flat 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.810
 planes here now she goes to 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.540
 flat to flat connector thats we do 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.790
 individual pockets individual pockets 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:38.670
 to drawing 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:40.940
 prizes and went on a plane but those are the slopes 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.120
 all slopes 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.340
 doing this way square 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.710
 steep 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:54.890
 means start and and across the slope 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:58.070
 or how to say yes to 90 degrees backgrounds 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:01.330
 or on the contrary the slope BEAC say 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:06.500
 so that she and her about such 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:11.830
 bottom to the terms that accumulated and 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:16.790
 hard to explain but now i go by 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:19.370
 half a millimeter step but the surface she 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.640
 makes very nice very smooth 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.000
 the surface of course all the corners of these still 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:30.260
 seen by the corner will be more 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.300
 small tool and the area itself 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:38.050
 but we will not touch the area remains 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.050
 not bad even here 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:47.300
 here 's the part itself yes she is pretty 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.610
 smooth already of course we burn 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.300
 scratch pebbles 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.900
 made as it should 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.099
 the milling cutter is very tenacious as I said on 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.729
 surprise here I will probably 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:07.460
 another six hours to work now I go 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:09.380
 home she is half of it 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:14.190
 Press forms 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.380
 it means fully whose must finish now 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.070
 all hours 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.070
 all 30 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:24.360
 I wanted to show this brand like this 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:29.270
 this tool 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:32.759
 very tenacious tool and by the way 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:36.599
 cheaper to buy in serbia why so 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:39.260
 Serbia sell such plates on 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:40.540
 7 dollars new mitsubishi 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.390
 but 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:48.160
 don't know why the whole building is in the states or 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:51.870
 somewhere in Europe 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.870
 great bye
