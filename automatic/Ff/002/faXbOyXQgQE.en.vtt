 Russian camellia producer 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.510
 unwanted such threads on 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.120
 why not someone like the shape 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.030
 Here is the same to keep her shape 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:05.450
 not all slips 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:07.760
 how to say it was n't so soft and here 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.040
 for such purposes approaches 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.110
 strings of kamilia they are cotton 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.220
 one hundred percent he and cost 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.700
 inexpensive here is 305 meters in 100 grams 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.329
 100% cotton 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.500
 he is for the texture here it is good for 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.480
 textures to keep exactly the form 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.840
 but if you want something more agile 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.209
 and then choose either without skin or 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.450
 cotton so that viscose and color of course you 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.630
