to<00:00:18.420> do<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> first<00:00:18.990> episode<00:00:19.410> several<00:00:19.980> ideas

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
to do for a first episode several ideas

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
to do for a first episode several ideas
came<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> mind<00:00:20.760> one<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.119> which<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.390> comparing

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
came to mind one of which was comparing

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.689 
came to mind one of which was comparing
the<00:00:21.960> video<00:00:22.170> game<00:00:22.350> crash<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.769> 83<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> stock

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the video game crash of 83 to the stock

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.230 
the video game crash of 83 to the stock
market<00:00:24.150> crash<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.480> 29<00:00:24.990> yeah<00:00:25.740> ridiculous

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
market crash of 29 yeah ridiculous

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.130 
market crash of 29 yeah ridiculous
instead<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> decided<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.840> talk<00:00:27.990> about

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
instead I decided to talk about

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.109 
instead I decided to talk about
something<00:00:28.410> smaller<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.340> Kirby<00:00:29.519> came<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> mind

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
something smaller so Kirby came to mind

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.260 
something smaller so Kirby came to mind

ah Kirby such a fun happy series of
games<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.320> ruined<00:00:34.710> by<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> giant

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
games all that ruined by a giant

bleeding eyeball yes you're seeing that
right<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> blood<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.809> game<00:00:40.020> made<00:00:40.200> for

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
right that is blood in a game made for

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
right that is blood in a game made for
kids<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.280> little<00:00:41.520> bit<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.700> blood

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
kids and not just a little bit of blood

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.880 
kids and not just a little bit of blood
splashing<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.690> wall<00:00:42.899> either<00:00:43.110> no<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
splashing a wall either no this is a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
splashing a wall either no this is a
massive<00:00:44.280> quantity<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.149> blood<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
massive quantity of blood so for this

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.200 
massive quantity of blood so for this
pilot<00:00:46.350> episode<00:00:46.890> want<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> figure<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.879> how

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
pilot episode want to figure out how

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.720 
pilot episode want to figure out how
much<00:00:48.450> blood<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.809> actually<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.860> who<00:00:50.460> cares

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
much blood that actually is who cares

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.490 
much blood that actually is who cares
well<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.480> probably<00:00:51.719> don't<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.379> just

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
well you probably don't but that's just

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.160 
well you probably don't but that's just
a<00:00:52.620> theory<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.219> game<00:00:53.940> fee<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.750> start<00:00:54.899> us<00:00:55.079> off

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
a theory a game fee so to start us off

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.479 
a theory a game fee so to start us off
we<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> good<00:00:55.949> idea<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:56.460> big

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
we need to get a good idea of how big

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
we need to get a good idea of how big
zero<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.750> considering<00:00:58.680> zero<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
zero actually is considering zero is the

image to the final battle we can find

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
image to the final battle we can find
that<00:01:04.439> zero<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.309> less<00:01:05.430> than<00:01:05.489> six

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that zero is a little less than six

Kirby's<00:01:06.299> tall<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.930> question<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> how<00:01:07.619> tall<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
Kirby's tall the question is how tall is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
Kirby's tall the question is how tall is
Kirby<00:01:08.340> according<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> Kirby<00:01:09.360> wiki<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
Kirby according to the Kirby wiki and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
Kirby according to the Kirby wiki and
Nintendo<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.229> Japan<00:01:10.500> Kirby<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.159> about<00:01:11.369> eight

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
Nintendo of Japan Kirby is about eight

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
Nintendo of Japan Kirby is about eight
inches<00:01:11.820> tall<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.630> take<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.930> number<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
inches tall so we take that number and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
inches tall so we take that number and
cut<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> extra<00:01:13.890> height<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> six

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
cut off the extra height from that six

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
cut off the extra height from that six
Kirby<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.360> determine<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.900> zero<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
Kirby and we can determine that zero is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
Kirby and we can determine that zero is
about<00:01:16.619> forty<00:01:17.070> six<00:01:17.280> point<00:01:17.460> nine<00:01:17.580> inches<00:01:17.970> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
about forty six point nine inches in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.109 
about forty six point nine inches in
diameter<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.750> 23<00:01:19.619> point<00:01:19.860> 45<00:01:20.310> inches<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.759> radius

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
diameter or 23 point 45 inches in radius

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.700 
diameter or 23 point 45 inches in radius
to<00:01:21.420> find<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> volume<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.229> perfect<00:01:22.619> sphere

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
to find the volume of a perfect sphere

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.039 
to find the volume of a perfect sphere
you<00:01:23.159> multiply<00:01:23.549> four<00:01:23.850> thirds<00:01:24.090> pi<00:01:24.240> PI<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.840> then

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you multiply four thirds pi PI and then

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
you multiply four thirds pi PI and then
multiply<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.619> number<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> radius<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
multiply that number by the radius to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
multiply that number by the radius to
the<00:01:26.790> third<00:01:26.970> power<00:01:27.180> by<00:01:27.600> plugging<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> numbers

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the third power by plugging the numbers

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.219 
the third power by plugging the numbers
in<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.979> find<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> zeros<00:01:29.670> volume<00:01:30.060> is
