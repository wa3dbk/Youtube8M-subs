some<00:02:07.310> initial<00:02:07.999> testing<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> much<00:02:09.709> better

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
some initial testing it is a much better

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.650 
some initial testing it is a much better
camera<00:02:10.490> takes<00:02:10.700> much<00:02:10.880> better<00:02:11.060> pitchers<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
camera takes much better pitchers in the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.170 
camera takes much better pitchers in the
5<00:02:11.810> megapixel<00:02:12.020> on<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.070> 15<00:02:13.400> mega<00:02:13.670> pixel<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
5 megapixel on the 15 mega pixel on the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.080 
5 megapixel on the 15 mega pixel on the
venue<00:02:14.780> pro<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.290> actually<00:02:15.950> quite<00:02:16.220> lame

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
venue pro is actually quite lame

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.330 
venue pro is actually quite lame
I<00:02:17.360> know<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.140> minimum<00:02:18.410> spec<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:18.890> windows

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
I know it's the minimum spec for windows

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.339 
I know it's the minimum spec for windows
phone<00:02:19.370> 7<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.180> really<00:02:20.629> doesn't<00:02:20.930> take<00:02:21.170> very

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
phone 7 but it really doesn't take very

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.020 
phone 7 but it really doesn't take very
good<00:02:21.470> pictures<00:02:21.830> at<00:02:21.950> all<00:02:22.099> whereas<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.940> eight

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
good pictures at all whereas the eight

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.850 
good pictures at all whereas the eight
megapixel<00:02:23.599> on<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.840> venue<00:02:24.140> actually<00:02:24.530> seems<00:02:24.709> to

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
megapixel on the venue actually seems to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.800 
megapixel on the venue actually seems to
be<00:02:25.010> doing<00:02:25.160> pretty<00:02:25.519> well<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.599> with

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
be doing pretty well with that with

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.520 
be doing pretty well with that with
pictures<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.209> can<00:02:29.360> see<00:02:29.410> there's<00:02:30.410> a

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
pictures and as you can see there's a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.070 
pictures and as you can see there's a
bit<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.129> a<00:02:31.220> difference<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.730> thickness

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
bit of a difference in thickness

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.089 
bit of a difference in thickness
primarily<00:02:33.080> because<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.530> venue<00:02:33.769> pro<00:02:33.950> of

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
primarily because the venue pro of

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.910 
primarily because the venue pro of
course<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.540> see<00:02:35.629> here<00:02:35.840> has<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.230> slide<00:02:36.709> up

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
course you can see here has the slide up

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.640 
course you can see here has the slide up
keyboard<00:02:37.120> okay<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.140> very<00:02:39.319> similar

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
keyboard okay so the very similar

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.130 
keyboard okay so the very similar
hardware<00:02:39.799> so<00:02:40.670> let's<00:02:40.940> put<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.209> venue<00:02:41.930> pro

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
hardware so let's put that venue pro

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.949 
hardware so let's put that venue pro
aside<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.769> just<00:02:42.799> kind<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.760> take<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.569> little<00:02:44.780> bit

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
aside and just kind of take a little bit

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.500 
aside and just kind of take a little bit
the<00:02:45.319> look<00:02:45.530> at<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.250> dell<00:02:46.790> venue<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.390> is

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
the look at the dell venue this is

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.050 
the look at the dell venue this is
actually<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.959> retail<00:02:48.379> box<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:48.920> very<00:02:49.610> similar

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
actually the retail box for very similar

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.789 
actually the retail box for very similar
to<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.209> venue<00:02:50.450> pro<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.349> kind<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.620> shows

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
to the venue pro you know kind of shows

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.809

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
it off there so on so forth so let's

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.089 
it off there so on so forth so let's
just<00:02:56.030> take<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.209> look<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.640> venue<00:02:59.650> now<00:03:00.650> i<00:03:00.829> must

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
just take a look at the venue now i must

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.809 
just take a look at the venue now i must
have<00:03:01.250> erased<00:03:03.250> must<00:03:04.250> have<00:03:04.340> done<00:03:04.489> something

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
have erased must have done something

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.940 
have erased must have done something
when<00:03:05.150> i<00:03:05.180> was<00:03:05.390> holding<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.140> two<00:03:06.260> devices<00:03:06.530> there

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
when i was holding the two devices there

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.050 
when i was holding the two devices there
so<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.060> an<00:03:08.209> android<00:03:09.220> 2.2<00:03:10.220> device<00:03:10.549> for<00:03:10.970> you

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
so this is an android 2.2 device for you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.920 
so this is an android 2.2 device for you
it<00:03:11.870> does<00:03:12.290> have<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:14.030> what's<00:03:14.360> called<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.660> dell

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
it does have the what's called the dell

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.259 
it does have the what's called the dell
stage<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:16.400> as<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.610> can<00:03:16.700> see<00:03:16.879> there's<00:03:17.060> little

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
stage so as you can see there's little

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.360 
stage so as you can see there's little
icons<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> little<00:03:18.440> dots<00:03:18.680> on<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> bottom

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
and we have seven home screens to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.860 
and we have seven home screens to
balance<00:03:21.500> between<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:23.510> don't<00:03:23.630> wrap

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
balance between and they don't wrap

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.300 
balance between and they don't wrap
around<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.400> get<00:03:25.760> over<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:26.150> them<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.480> then

okay so this is the home now I must have

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.050 
okay so this is the home now I must have
realigned<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.889> so<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.430> here<00:03:31.579> is<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.760> dell

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
realigned it so this here is the dell

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.000 
realigned it so this here is the dell
stage<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.900> recent<00:03:33.200> apps<00:03:33.560> as<00:03:33.859> your

necessarily someone locked I haven't oh

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.890 
necessarily someone locked I haven't oh
I<00:06:51.440> did<00:06:51.710> pop<00:06:51.949> yes<00:06:52.340> I<00:06:52.610> did<00:06:52.790> pop<00:06:53.000> my<00:06:53.180> t-mobile<00:06:53.570> sim
