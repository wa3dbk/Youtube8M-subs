00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.279
 we will focus on models under 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 name predator that translated from 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.810
 English mark predator all knives 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.410
 family predator have a uniform form 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.219
 uniform sizes 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 i.e. the length of all the knives predator 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.219
 are 200 15 millimeters length 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.750
 blade 95 millimeters 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.350
 they differ only in blade material 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 and the material of the handle is the main difference 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.809
 The worldâ€™s easiest option is to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.170
 plastic handle then gun 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:03.600
 plastic and usually 420 stainless steel blade 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:20.640
 This model with a clip but without a cover 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:25.350
 There is also an option without a clip but with 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:31.970
 leather case that looks like this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.970
 just about everything can be folded and 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.610
 put 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.380
 case so it will look 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.170
 In principle, all Mike models are driven by 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.470
 leather covers except sole 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.910

 The 420 steel itself is still a row 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.900
 of tools 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.110

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.250
 wood but no tool but right now i'm not

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.670

 what exactly is this knife 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.070
 This model took part in the shooting 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.030

 released in 2006 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.980
 the go-ahead was one and the villains 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.430
 a movie that wanted to kill james bond 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.180
 but James Bond has selected the knife 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.860
 villain and left about himself 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:01.540
 here the blade is made of Damascus steel 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:04.960
 produced steel company houses steel 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:09.870

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.210
 standard 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:30.130
 predator and go to the top models 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:32.950
 mikov gigu or model except from 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.880

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.250
 damask made both blaster and 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.610
 lever too from damask handles and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.780
 snake tree is the only model 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:56.380
 which comes in a gift box 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:05:03.630
 which looks like this with a case 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.630
 premium and with a passport 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:13.230
 also the predator of there is such 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.300
 little model fish something like 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.020
 keychain can be hung on the keys 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:24.000
 but pretty functional thing hard 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.970
 spring lock in general, too, has 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.460
 the right to exist but the main 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:35.040
 Now we pay attention to the model 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:39.510
 predator how does this work basic 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:43.200
 whether the principle of work is verlag itself 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:46.050
 predator ii released from '89 but 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.670
 the history of this castle is much richer 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.990
 such locks were used yet 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.450
 Italian and German classic 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.450
 automatic knives over 100 years ago 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.400
 there really is he worked the other way 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.010
 here he leans towards the blade 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.240
 Ataman reclined towards the handle but 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:09.660
 the essence does not change how does he 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.169
 running reclines liver 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:16.110
 push pops up the blade you can 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.850
 work kick is fixed then to 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:24.860
 close again back cinema clover 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:27.979
 press close lock very reliable 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.979
 time tested 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.740
 the blade is fixed rigidly practically 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.220
 no lift may be a slight backlash 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.260
 minor but normal 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.479
 the spring in case of breakage changes very 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.600
 easy literally there in 30 seconds you can 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.820
 change the spring we have on the site 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.080
 separate video about this if 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.240
 there is interest you can look at the same by 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.419
 workmanship and reliability 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.440
 may well compete with modern 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:06.930
 the same american knives 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.810
 given of course the fact that it 's still 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.389
 classic 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.070
 but all knives are not certificate not 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:16.580
 cold weapons 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:21.020
 Ukraine upon purchase is provided 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:24.830
 a copy of such a certificate so no 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:28.419
 problems with wearing storage 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:32.020
 the acquisition does not arise 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:35.290
 Thank you all, I hope it was interesting 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.290
 all the best
