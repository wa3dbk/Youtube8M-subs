00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello, are you with me ? 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.870
 The info section you can almost 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 They came to take off the saddle of the pass 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.170
 Fedoseeva but speech now not about mountain 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.949
 routes and not passes now i want 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 tell you in one pretty steep 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 own invention invented it am we 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 I wondered if it was invented except me 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.180
 also other people and now the essence 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 inventions is to use arcs from 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.700
 tents in principle any tent with 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.329
 arcs of u preferably with aluminum 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.920
 as trekking sticks see 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.559
 how it made a number of small such cords 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 one is elastic and the other is just a piece 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:01:00.210
 Repshnura a pair of crooked branches found in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.219
 700 meters lower forest and a couple more 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 rubber mats for tying floor mats 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.540
 who serve as those faces and so if you 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.330
 know a little knots know physics then 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.430
 can already bind yourself 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.930
 Some bitch cotton and beams which serve 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.140
 the tips of these 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.810
 trekking poles will be able to fold in 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.450
 proper proportions of the arc of the tent so that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.170
 they came to you for a height that's how 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.659
 well and tie me up 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.729
 similar to lanyard 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.009
 why do I do such a perversion and what 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.810
 it gives the traveler these shelves give 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.090
 unreal savings on weights 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 see for yourself the usual trekking poles 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 weigh 550 550 grams depending on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 models and strengths but the lightest 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.090
 maybe 500 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.260
 at the same time the strength of ultra light sticks 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.220
 but already prohibitively low 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.240
 my upgrade kit consisting of ropes 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.570
 and rezinochek weighs less than 50 grams so 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.950
 way, weight saving is more 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.490
 half a kilo 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.130
 at the same time I have very reliable 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.240
 durable shelves that i'm not afraid even 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.880
 use as 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.950
 alpenstocks have draw on them here 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.580
 so here in the lateral direction and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.100
 insure them on a steep slope in 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.730
 overall i think that a lot of people 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.580
 Be sure to check out this my invention 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.340
 Like those who don't like it just 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.530
 must write in the comments why 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.580
 most likely it will be manufacturers 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.190
 trekking poles 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.450
 Well, those who are not in the subject does not know why 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.850
 trekking poles 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.160
 just note down go to 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.010
 trekking with regular trekking poles 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.410
 but then do something like that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.620
 I'm right in the campaign of their spirits will 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.170
 cool it will be convenient to be easy in general 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.120
 not only travel yet invent 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.340
 cool too i hope what 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.020
 the invention will go to the masses will allow 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.900
 save not only babos on 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.959
 purchase of trekking poles but still 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.040
 the total weight of the camping kit is 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.300
 Script saving pound weight in 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.660
 personal package 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.470
 it's just unreal savings for example 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.980
 if we want 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.640
 tent on half a kilo lighter it is worth 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.330
 it is usually two to three times the usual 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.670
 tents 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.040
 if we want a sleeping bag for half a kilo 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.739
 easier at the same comfort temperature 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.530
 sleeping bag it will also cost two three 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.090
 times more expensive but in absolute numbers this 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:54.620
 maybe five thousand or even more 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.530
 so that on the shelves of the economy race shelves 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.519
 it is at least two or three thousand rubles and 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.519
 plus savings on total weight which 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.040
 worth by my estimates so finger in 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.680
 sky with a sleeping bag and a tent too 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.280
 5 thousand and more so easy easy 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.049
 invention i saved it 7000 if 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.019
 want to keep saving 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.759
 subscribe to the channel see the school 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.160
 sports tourism themselves 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.759
 think with your head to invent different 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.310
 hiking trivia is still necessary to watch 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.470
 whether we should climb the pass or 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.840
 stop before taking off saddle am 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.630
 for the night with you was dinistor drink 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.440
 mountain sections of the photo go out the whole group 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.710
 which climbs on fedoseev pass so far 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.710
 until
