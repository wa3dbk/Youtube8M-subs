00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello everyone with you freaks and today 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 show here is such a t3l 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.940
 I hope in the near future more you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.500
 I will not show triggers because 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.300
 they are already quite tired of me 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.320
 what is the essence of this trigger is that he 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.000
 very small and as you see here 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.829
 put the usual block they block out 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.380
 red stone ice 1 ton sorry and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.210
 the last series of mechanisms I said that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.960
 this the trigger won't work 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.050
 new version but it works I founded 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.950
 it is now on show here will energize 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.020
 simply 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.300
 this unit will be fed rs volume 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.710
 let's do a crooked so that the signal does not go 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.490
 directly to our piston it will not 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.020
 fed husband signal is not directly 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.400
 if a 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.380
 this one remove a piece of 1 ton 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.060
 there will be one such piece of 1 ton 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.479
 that is, he never sent it 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.660
 directed in all directions according to the idea of ​​something 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.650
 the trigger state will be powered on 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.960
 Based on this, I made this one the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.070
 trigger 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.660
 that is, here we will have a way out 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.810
 our scheme 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.190
 but here I put the red torch and how 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.220
 see here is powered not directly to 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.410
 our piston if I remove the torch 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.100
 the signal will remain here for a moment but 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.890
 arrest he himself will have already been done wrong 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.470
 it will already be like this one piece 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.730
 they are here and in general 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.200
 d-trigger will work and the block will remain 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.350
 Well here, in general, look 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 here so again that is inconvenient in him then 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 this is activation through 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.640
 improvised items I do not know how to do 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.519
 and in general, I think it is no different 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.920
 make but this ones trigger 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:27.030
 due to its size it is worth it 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.970
 These are inconveniences, but I don’t know 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.380

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.510
