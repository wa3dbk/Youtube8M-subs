 new slom samsung galaxy note 3 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.660
 let's look at software that 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.560
 accompany this speaker 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.279
 the system may include samsung in 93 and 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.189
 that come from the factory is the android version 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.490
 4.3 that comes with this layer of the judge who 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.230
 samsung has already inhabited us is all this 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.060
 works very smoothly as 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.420
 can also see thanks to the teacher 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.980
 josÃ© braga grito 800 which is a small 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.739
 wonderful 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.079
 in this case a pig or three that we have is 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.110
 that the model 4 unique way explains in 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.090
 Portugal and here we have our 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.149
 the main current analyzes with the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.870
 complications rate folders widgets 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.510
 we have here is really a lot of matter 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.760
 to customize the other fan and a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.739
 novelty here is also the fact that the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.079
 slide a low kick up we have 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.020
 access to a summary of key 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:10.750
 news that is running and here 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 we soon is 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 access to the current 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 we have access to some 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.040
 shortcuts that allow us to go directly 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.610
 for some applications wanting not so 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.860
 central back to main screen 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.930
 application police functions just as 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.270
 samsung is used in the form of 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 Side wherein said operating signal and 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.250
 that we see here and hopefully then 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:49.270
 what we want to add to our 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:52.240
 the notification area and how you can 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.910
 see is the tom cruise is really much 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.210
 very similar to what we already saw on the galaxy 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.970
 s 4 ie the software is very very 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.300
 identical we can customize everything here 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.240
 this is the functions are now with fashions 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.759
 pure spectators because in fact with the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.270
 increments the song only time will tell the 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.549
 company has and 60 for more and more 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.130
 options that increasingly functionality 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.019
 and I was starting to become very 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.510
 complicated to have here all the missions 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.269
 in one the cinema for what it is samsung 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.400
 opted and bath prepare with topic 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:32.320
 these missions 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.030
 For example, we will see the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.640
 then customize the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.680
 notifications and here are the options that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.350
 are available to us as a believer 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.630
 and we also have here to put more options 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.200
 still these people also everything very much 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.560
 who did not aim and e as visitors 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.049
 galaxy s 4 acquisitions like the ocimar 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.500
 scrolling pages focused only with the 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.519

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.310
 over content from the album i melo e ver 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.200
 the content 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.900
 one provides for a preview of the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.110
 sangster content at last we have a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.340
 series of features that I knew 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.380
 which does not turn out much better for 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.209
 to get coverage is that we do not 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.270
 It's quite the case we also have our text 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.850
 it was written that 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.680
 the drive elucidate more about the nominees 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.990
 of this forum in terms of software 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.970
 How can you see everything very fast? 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.840
 we are really ready a top of the range 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.880

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.490
 to the new android 413 that has been 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.500
 progress has since there are few options for 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.920
 behind in that google the time is very 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.170
 in optimization and this is noted aquino in 3 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.200
 and it's a good thing 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.110
 the fact that the fluidity of the system is so there 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.510
 will then wait that this video can 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.580
 be surgical and that can continue to 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.620

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.110
