00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
something sharp to break into the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.730 
something sharp to break into the
surface<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:13.110> once<00:01:13.320> you've<00:01:13.530> gotten

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
surface of it but once you've gotten

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
surface of it but once you've gotten
into<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.630> now<00:01:15.630> peel<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:18.080> wrapping

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.230 

so<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.260> have<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.710> clear<00:01:23.189> basketball<00:01:24.150> hoop<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
so you have a clear basketball hoop like

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
so you have a clear basketball hoop like
cylinder<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.430> got

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
cylinder now you can see that it's got

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280 
cylinder now you can see that it's got
some<00:01:29.670> rough<00:01:29.850> edges<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.960> we're<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
some rough edges on it so we're going to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.719 
some rough edges on it so we're going to
use<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.619> black<00:01:31.799> tape<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.400> saw<00:01:32.580> before

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
use that black tape that we saw before

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.420 
use that black tape that we saw before
and<00:01:34.610> sellotape<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.940> top<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and sellotape at the top of it so that

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.660 
and sellotape at the top of it so that
we<00:01:38.580> get<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> nice<00:01:39.180> smooth<00:01:39.960> round<00:01:40.649> an<00:01:40.830> edge<00:01:41.130> on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
we get a nice smooth round an edge on

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170 
we get a nice smooth round an edge on
the<00:01:42.060> top<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.600> bottom

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.280 

once<00:01:47.180> you've<00:01:47.360> done<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:49.690> should<00:01:50.690> look<00:01:50.990> a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
once you've done that should look a

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.130 
once you've done that should look a
little<00:01:51.320> something<00:01:51.980> like<00:01:52.250> this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.170 

step<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.380> backboard<00:02:01.250> now<00:02:01.430> you're<00:02:02.030> going

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
step to the backboard now you're going

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.290 
step to the backboard now you're going
to<00:02:02.240> have<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.510> roll<00:02:02.930> yourself<00:02:03.200> up<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:04.300> backboard

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300
