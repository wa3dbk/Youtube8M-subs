00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
now more than halfway through my fast I

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.350 
now more than halfway through my fast I
had<00:00:28.220> originally<00:00:28.369> planned<00:00:28.759> to<00:00:28.939> go<00:00:29.090> for<00:00:29.300> about

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
had originally planned to go for about

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.569 
had originally planned to go for about
30<00:00:29.720> days<00:00:29.990> but<00:00:30.020> due<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.500> time<00:00:30.860> constraints<00:00:30.890> on

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
30 days but due to time constraints on

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.880 
30 days but due to time constraints on
my<00:00:31.790> part<00:00:32.090> I<00:00:32.329> will<00:00:32.630> only<00:00:32.809> be<00:00:33.079> fasting<00:00:33.590> into<00:00:33.800> the

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
my part I will only be fasting into the

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.220 
my part I will only be fasting into the
high<00:00:34.040> 20s<00:00:34.610> haven't<00:00:35.270> gotten<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.660> exact<00:00:36.020> date

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
high 20s haven't gotten the exact date

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.470 
high 20s haven't gotten the exact date
yet<00:00:36.260> but<00:00:36.500> needless<00:00:37.430> say<00:00:37.700> more<00:00:38.030> than<00:00:38.210> halfway

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
yet but needless say more than halfway

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.410 
yet but needless say more than halfway
so<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:39.380> thought<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.219> would<00:00:40.250> be<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.489> good<00:00:40.850> point<00:00:41.270> in

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
so I thought it would be a good point in

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.930 
so I thought it would be a good point in
time<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:42.230> offer<00:00:42.590> some<00:00:42.950> reflection<00:00:43.550> of<00:00:43.670> how<00:00:43.879> the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
time to offer some reflection of how the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.099 
time to offer some reflection of how the
fast<00:00:44.450> has<00:00:44.750> gone<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.260> far<00:00:46.390> what<00:00:47.390> my<00:00:47.539> experience

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
fast has gone so far what my experience

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.720 
fast has gone so far what my experience
has<00:00:48.199> been<00:00:48.260> because<00:00:49.010> I<00:00:49.190> know<00:00:49.249> a<00:00:49.309> lot<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.579> people

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
has been because I know a lot of people

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.459 
has been because I know a lot of people
are<00:00:50.269> interested<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:51.230> fasting<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.539> lot<00:00:54.440> of

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
are interested in fasting so a lot of

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.439 
are interested in fasting so a lot of
when<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.010> think<00:00:55.039> about<00:00:55.280> fasting<00:00:55.909> most<00:00:56.149> people

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
when you think about fasting most people

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.989 
when you think about fasting most people
think<00:00:56.539> about<00:00:56.659> weight<00:00:57.079> loss<00:00:57.640> that's<00:00:58.640> actually

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
think about weight loss that's actually

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.840 
think about weight loss that's actually
not<00:00:59.210> why<00:00:59.449> I'm<00:00:59.629> here<00:00:59.659> in<00:01:00.199> fact<00:01:00.499> I<00:01:00.679> had<00:01:00.920> purposely

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
not why I'm here in fact I had purposely

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.279 
not why I'm here in fact I had purposely
put<00:01:02.089> on<00:01:02.179> weight<00:01:02.420> over<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.690> last<00:01:02.899> year<00:01:03.170> because

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
put on weight over the last year because

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.770 
put on weight over the last year because
I<00:01:03.440> was<00:01:03.589> getting<00:01:03.949> kind<00:01:04.159> of<00:01:04.220> thin<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.390> needless

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
I was getting kind of thin but needless

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.140 
I was getting kind of thin but needless
to<00:01:06.110> say<00:01:06.350> yeah<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:07.220> definitely<00:01:07.490> lose<00:01:07.850> weight

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
to say yeah you definitely lose weight

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.580 
to say yeah you definitely lose weight
over<00:01:08.770> 15<00:01:09.770> days<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.490> as<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.720> when<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.290> weighed

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
over 15 days I as of when I weighed

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.070 
over 15 days I as of when I weighed
myself<00:01:12.800> yesterday<00:01:13.040> afternoon<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:13.970> was<00:01:14.080> 164

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
myself yesterday afternoon I was 164

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.109 
myself yesterday afternoon I was 164
pounds<00:01:15.320> i<00:01:15.590> started<00:01:15.890> off<00:01:15.950> at<00:01:16.159> 180<00:01:16.729> pounds<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:18.020> a

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
pounds i started off at 180 pounds now a

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.990 
pounds i started off at 180 pounds now a
lot<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.149> people<00:01:20.240> will<00:01:20.540> say<00:01:20.750> well<00:01:20.990> you've<00:01:21.140> lost

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
lot of people will say well you've lost

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.380 
lot of people will say well you've lost
15<00:01:23.000> pounds<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.450> fat<00:01:23.630> or<00:01:23.899> so<00:01:24.579> but<00:01:25.579> that's<00:01:26.270> a

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
15 pounds of fat or so but that's a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.990 
15 pounds of fat or so but that's a
misunderstanding<00:01:26.719> of<00:01:27.649> what's<00:01:28.189> going<00:01:28.399> on<00:01:28.670> I'm

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
misunderstanding of what's going on I'm

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.730 
misunderstanding of what's going on I'm
actually<00:01:29.240> not<00:01:29.930> losing<00:01:30.380> much<00:01:30.500> fat<00:01:30.770> at<00:01:30.950> all<00:01:32.740> if

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
actually not losing much fat at all if

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.770 
actually not losing much fat at all if
you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
you

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.420 
you
you're<00:01:34.990> relying<00:01:35.350> on<00:01:35.500> your<00:01:35.619> normal<00:01:36.220> basal

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
you're relying on your normal basal

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.859 
you're relying on your normal basal
metabolic<00:01:37.060> rate<00:01:37.420> say<00:01:38.020> was<00:01:38.229> 1800<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:40.570> yeah

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
metabolic rate say was 1800 then yeah

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.600 
metabolic rate say was 1800 then yeah
you've<00:01:41.110> been<00:01:41.140> losing<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.680> lot<00:01:41.710> more<00:01:41.979> fat<00:01:42.310> but

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
you've been losing a lot more fat but

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.310 
you've been losing a lot more fat but
you<00:01:42.729> got<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.909> remember<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.479> when<00:01:44.170> you're

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
you got to remember that when you're

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.570 
you got to remember that when you're
fasting<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:46.030> are<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:47.770> digesting<00:01:48.549> food

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
fasting you are not digesting food

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.730 
fasting you are not digesting food
digestion<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.810> one<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.440> most

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
digestion is one of the most

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.560 
digestion is one of the most
energy-intensive<00:01:51.430> things<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.420> body

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
energy-intensive things that the body

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.020 
energy-intensive things that the body
does<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.020> burns<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.560> lot<00:01:53.800> of<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.130> calories<00:01:54.399> that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
does it burns a lot of the calories that

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.810 
does it burns a lot of the calories that
are<00:01:55.810> part<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:56.710> your<00:01:56.890> basal<00:01:57.280> metabolic<00:01:57.310> rate

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
are part of your basal metabolic rate

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.730 
are part of your basal metabolic rate
and<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.930> when<00:01:59.110> you're<00:01:59.229> not<00:01:59.380> doing<00:01:59.710> that

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
and so when you're not doing that

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.499 
and so when you're not doing that
someone<00:02:00.159> my<00:02:00.310> size<00:02:00.340> is<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.880> only<00:02:01.030> burning<00:02:01.299> what

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
someone my size is the only burning what

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.539 
someone my size is the only burning what
a<00:02:01.540> thousand<00:02:02.020> calories<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.440> day<00:02:02.560> when<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.399> work

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
a thousand calories a day when you work

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.779 
a thousand calories a day when you work
that<00:02:03.729> out<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:04.119> about<00:02:04.500> 2.2<00:02:05.500> pounds<00:02:05.890> per<00:02:06.759> week

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
that out it's about 2.2 pounds per week

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.270 
that out it's about 2.2 pounds per week
so<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.670> far<00:02:10.000> I've<00:02:10.239> burned<00:02:11.140> maybe<00:02:11.620> less<00:02:12.070> than

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so so far I've burned maybe less than

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.300 
so so far I've burned maybe less than
five<00:02:12.519> pounds<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.120> fat<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:14.080> remainder<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
five pounds of fat the remainder a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.509 
five pounds of fat the remainder a
little<00:02:16.300> more<00:02:16.450> than<00:02:16.600> 10<00:02:16.840> pounds<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.560> actually

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
little more than 10 pounds is actually

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.750 
little more than 10 pounds is actually
water<00:02:19.090> weight<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.709> can<00:02:21.250> store<00:02:21.550> water

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
water weight now you can store water

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.190 
water weight now you can store water
weight<00:02:21.970> for<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> number<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.450> reasons<00:02:22.569> if<00:02:23.019> you're

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
weight for a number of reasons if you're

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.540 
weight for a number of reasons if you're
eating<00:02:23.290> an<00:02:23.440> unhealthy<00:02:23.830> diet<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.400> contains

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
eating an unhealthy diet that contains

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.340 
eating an unhealthy diet that contains
salt<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.360> other<00:02:25.420> foods<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.930> cause<00:02:26.080> water

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
salt and other foods that cause water

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.140 
salt and other foods that cause water
retention<00:02:26.590> yeah<00:02:27.160> you'll<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:27.760> you'll

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
retention yeah you'll just you'll

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.180 
retention yeah you'll just you'll
excrete<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.440> won't<00:02:29.800> gain<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.160> back

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
excrete that and you won't gain it back

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.670 
excrete that and you won't gain it back
from<00:02:30.900> assuming<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.080> go<00:02:32.230> back<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.470> a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
from assuming that you go back to a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.759 
from assuming that you go back to a
healthy<00:02:33.430> diet<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.150> doesn't<00:02:34.769> include

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
healthy diet that doesn't include

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.920 
healthy diet that doesn't include
processed<00:02:36.430> foods<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.790> salt<00:02:37.060> but<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.780> my<00:02:37.900> case

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
processed foods and salt but in my case

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.500 
processed foods and salt but in my case
I<00:02:38.319> wasn't<00:02:38.590> eating<00:02:38.769> those<00:02:38.920> things<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.000> why

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
I wasn't eating those things so why

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.229 
I wasn't eating those things so why
would<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.989> lose<00:02:41.230> water<00:02:41.500> weight<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
would I lose water weight then so the

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.490 
would I lose water weight then so the
body<00:02:43.510> uses<00:02:44.290> water<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.739> dilute<00:02:46.230> various<00:02:47.230> things

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
body uses water to dilute various things

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.069 
body uses water to dilute various things
in<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.980> body<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.579> make<00:02:48.820> them<00:02:49.030> usable<00:02:49.570> by<00:02:50.019> the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
in the body to make them usable by the

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.160 
in the body to make them usable by the
body<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.980> one<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.180> things<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.510> happens

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
body so one of the things that happens

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.650 
body so one of the things that happens
when<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.590> stop<00:02:54.220> eating<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.510> no

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
when you stop eating is that you no

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.750 
when you stop eating is that you no
longer<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:56.230> simple<00:02:56.980> sugars<00:02:57.310> coming<00:02:57.610> into

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
longer have simple sugars coming into

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.810 
longer have simple sugars coming into
the<00:02:57.850> body<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.500> your<00:02:59.500> body<00:02:59.890> switches<00:03:00.459> over<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
the body and your body switches over to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.120 
the body and your body switches over to
just<00:03:01.570> burning<00:03:02.019> fat<00:03:02.320> after<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> few<00:03:03.310> days<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:05.130> if

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
just burning fat after a few days and if

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.270 
just burning fat after a few days and if
enough<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.120> fat<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.600> going<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.530> you're

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
enough of this fat is going that you're

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.250 
enough of this fat is going that you're
soaked<00:03:09.609> it<00:03:09.850> converts<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.420> some<00:03:10.780> sugar<00:03:11.109> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
soaked it converts it to some sugar and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.349 
soaked it converts it to some sugar and
you've<00:03:11.500> got<00:03:11.650> some<00:03:11.980> it's<00:03:12.190> enough<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.579> live<00:03:12.790> but

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
you've got some it's enough to live but

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.630 
you've got some it's enough to live but
your<00:03:14.230> muscles<00:03:14.680> are<00:03:14.829> not<00:03:14.859> being<00:03:15.190> totally<00:03:15.489> to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
your muscles are not being totally to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.980 
your muscles are not being totally to
you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
you

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.960 
you
and<00:03:16.820> what<00:03:17.820> happens<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.480> as<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:19.970> because

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
and what happens is as your because

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.670 
and what happens is as your because
there's<00:03:21.150> no<00:03:21.330> more<00:03:21.600> sugar<00:03:22.020> getting<00:03:22.380> sent<00:03:22.620> to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
there's no more sugar getting sent to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.260 
there's no more sugar getting sent to
your<00:03:22.800> muscles<00:03:23.190> your<00:03:23.250> muscle<00:03:24.090> glycogen

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
your muscles your muscle glycogen

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.040 
your muscles your muscle glycogen
empties<00:03:24.960> out<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:26.700> water<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.540> was<00:03:27.750> being

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
empties out and the water that was being

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.620 
empties out and the water that was being
used<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:29.810> offset<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.620> glycogen<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:33.120> make<00:03:33.510> it

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
used to offset that glycogen and make it

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.170 
used to offset that glycogen and make it
usable<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.440> your<00:03:34.590> system<00:03:35.100> your<00:03:35.790> body<00:03:35.970> doesn't

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
usable in your system your body doesn't

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.580 
usable in your system your body doesn't
need<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.540> anymore<00:03:36.570> because<00:03:36.930> there's<00:03:37.170> no<00:03:37.380> more

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
need it anymore because there's no more

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.470 
need it anymore because there's no more
glycogen<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.520> it<00:03:38.640> just<00:03:38.790> empties<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.360> out

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
glycogen there so it just empties it out

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.470 
glycogen there so it just empties it out
so<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.070> end<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.370> seeing<00:03:41.610> happening<00:03:42.240> is

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
so what you end up seeing happening is

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.770 
so what you end up seeing happening is
that<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.320> body<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:44.030> quickly<00:03:45.030> dumped<00:03:45.600> this

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
that the body just quickly dumped this

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.600 
that the body just quickly dumped this
water<00:03:46.080> weight<00:03:46.350> within<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.830> first<00:03:47.070> week<00:03:47.340> week

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
water weight within the first week week

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.740 
water weight within the first week week
and<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.820> half<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:50.300> water<00:03:51.300> weight<00:03:51.480> loss

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
and a half and so the water weight loss

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.530 
and a half and so the water weight loss
at<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.230> beginning<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.860> dramatic<00:03:53.430> then<00:03:53.970> as<00:03:54.330> you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
at the beginning is dramatic then as you

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.390 
at the beginning is dramatic then as you
get<00:03:54.690> rid<00:03:54.870> all<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.230> water<00:03:55.440> weight<00:03:55.680> you're<00:03:56.190> down

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
get rid all the water weight you're down

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.190 
get rid all the water weight you're down
to<00:03:56.580> pretty<00:03:56.760> much<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.180> fat<00:03:57.480> loss<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.080> that

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
to pretty much just fat loss and that

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.410 
to pretty much just fat loss and that
takes<00:03:58.470> place<00:03:58.800> in<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> much<00:03:59.280> more<00:03:59.580> gradual<00:04:00.150> rate

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
takes place in a much more gradual rate

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
takes place in a much more gradual rate
so<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:02.310> can<00:04:02.520> see<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.720> has<00:04:04.050> had<00:04:04.410> a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
so you can see that this has had a

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.230 
so you can see that this has had a
dramatic<00:04:04.740> effect<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.580> me<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.300> these<00:04:06.810> are<00:04:06.870> size

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
dramatic effect on me so these are size

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.080 
dramatic effect on me so these are size
32<00:04:09.240> shorts<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.470> waist<00:04:10.680> size<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:13.970> used<00:04:14.970> to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
32 shorts the waist size and I used to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.310 
32 shorts the waist size and I used to
be<00:04:15.210> able<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.390> wear<00:04:15.540> them<00:04:15.630> without<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.870> belt<00:04:16.110> when

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
be able to wear them without a belt when

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.920 
be able to wear them without a belt when
I<00:04:16.380> got<00:04:16.620> here<00:04:16.950> but<00:04:17.520> as<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.480> kind<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.750> see

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
I got here but as you can kind of see

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.680 
I got here but as you can kind of see
now<00:04:19.160> they<00:04:20.160> pretty<00:04:20.549> much<00:04:20.670> would<00:04:21.120> fall<00:04:21.660> right

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
now they pretty much would fall right

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.650 
now they pretty much would fall right
off<00:04:22.109> my<00:04:22.650> hips<00:04:22.950> if<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:24.120> was<00:04:24.450> not

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
off my hips if I you know was not

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.570 
off my hips if I you know was not
keeping<00:04:25.560> them<00:04:25.710> up<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.070> if<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.250> didn't<00:04:26.430> have<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
keeping them up and if I didn't have a

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.610 
keeping them up and if I didn't have a
belt<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.510> bill<00:04:27.750> I'm<00:04:27.990> actually<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.530> the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
belt in the bill I'm actually in the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.680 
belt in the bill I'm actually in the
process<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:29.160> getting<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.490> new<00:04:29.970> loops<00:04:30.240> put<00:04:30.570> in

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
process of getting a new loops put in

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.960 
process of getting a new loops put in
because<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.230> they<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.100> does<00:04:32.310> does<00:04:32.670> they<00:04:32.820> don't

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
because it they it does does they don't

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.030 
because it they it does does they don't
really<00:04:33.150> fit<00:04:33.360> me<00:04:33.510> anymore<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:34.530> worth<00:04:34.770> noting

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
really fit me anymore it's worth noting

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.370 
really fit me anymore it's worth noting
a<00:04:35.490> lot<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.030> people<00:04:36.240> talk<00:04:36.480> about<00:04:36.510> loss<00:04:37.140> of

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
a lot of people talk about loss of

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.010 
a lot of people talk about loss of
muscle<00:04:37.650> mass<00:04:37.830> while<00:04:38.190> fasting<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.780> kind

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
muscle mass while fasting this is kind

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.040 
muscle mass while fasting this is kind
of<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.230> misunderstanding<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.570> first<00:04:42.570> 24<00:04:43.020> hours

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
little bit in the day for you're running

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.240 
little bit in the day for you're running

5 certainly day four or five you've

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.160 
5 certainly day four or five you've
switched<00:05:02.640> off<00:05:02.880> almost<00:05:03.090> entirely<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.870> bring

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
switched off almost entirely to bring

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.810 
switched off almost entirely to bring
fat<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:06.620> you're<00:05:07.620> not<00:05:07.890> really<00:05:08.190> going<00:05:08.460> you're

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
fat and you're not really going you're

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.520 
fat and you're not really going you're
not<00:05:08.940> really<00:05:09.120> destroying<00:05:09.630> any<00:05:09.840> muscle<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.380> do

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
not really destroying any muscle to do

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.300 
not really destroying any muscle to do
this<00:05:10.910> however<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.510> certainly<00:05:13.320> do<00:05:13.620> appear<00:05:14.280> to

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
this however you certainly do appear to

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.340 
this however you certainly do appear to
lose<00:05:14.820> muscle<00:05:15.120> but<00:05:15.540> as<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.780> mentioned<00:05:16.320> before

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
lose muscle but as I mentioned before

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.160 
lose muscle but as I mentioned before
this<00:05:17.340> is<00:05:17.550> just<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.970> water<00:05:18.270> weight<00:05:18.510> leaving

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
this is just the water weight leaving

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.010 
this is just the water weight leaving
your

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
your

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.839 
your
our<00:05:20.080> muscles<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:20.889> also<00:05:21.310> because<00:05:21.669> their

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
our muscles and also because their

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.360 
our muscles and also because their
unused<00:05:22.449> the<00:05:23.080> mitochondria<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.099> cells

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
unused the mitochondria and the cells

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.689 
unused the mitochondria and the cells
the<00:05:24.639> muscles<00:05:25.030> are<00:05:25.180> shrinking<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:27.220> yeah<00:05:27.610> it

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
the muscles are shrinking so yeah it

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.189 
the muscles are shrinking so yeah it
appears<00:05:27.789> like<00:05:28.180> your<00:05:28.449> muscles<00:05:28.780> are<00:05:28.870> deflated

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
appears like your muscles are deflated

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.770 
appears like your muscles are deflated
but<00:05:29.530> within<00:05:30.009> a<00:05:30.220> month<00:05:30.430> or<00:05:30.610> so<00:05:30.819> of<00:05:31.180> refeeding

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
but within a month or so of refeeding

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.469 
but within a month or so of refeeding
that<00:05:32.680> should<00:05:32.889> be<00:05:32.979> mostly<00:05:33.280> return<00:05:33.639> I've<00:05:34.090> got<00:05:34.330> an

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
that should be mostly return I've got an

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.300 
that should be mostly return I've got an
interesting<00:05:34.900> picture<00:05:35.139> myself<00:05:35.470> that<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.220> took

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
interesting picture myself that I took

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.070 
interesting picture myself that I took
before<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:36.849> fast<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.360> I'm<00:05:37.419> making<00:05:37.569> a<00:05:37.810> mussel

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
before the fast and I'm making a mussel

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.330 
before the fast and I'm making a mussel
and<00:05:38.580> my<00:05:39.580> muscle<00:05:39.940> looks<00:05:40.090> quite<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:41.560> stands<00:05:42.039> out

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
and my muscle looks quite it stands out

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.040 
and my muscle looks quite it stands out
because<00:05:42.550> you<00:05:43.240> know<00:05:43.360> it's<00:05:43.539> a<00:05:43.659> normal-looking

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
because you know it's a normal-looking

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.439 
because you know it's a normal-looking
muscle<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:44.680> I've<00:05:44.740> been<00:05:44.909> doing<00:05:45.909> weight

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
muscle and I've been doing weight

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.110 
muscle and I've been doing weight
training<00:05:46.479> for<00:05:47.169> over<00:05:47.349> a<00:05:47.379> year<00:05:47.470> now<00:05:47.680> and<00:05:48.039> I<00:05:48.879> was

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
training for over a year now and I was

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.770 
training for over a year now and I was
looking<00:05:49.569> at<00:05:49.750> my<00:05:50.460> muscle<00:05:51.460> now<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:52.030> you<00:05:52.659> know

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
looking at my muscle now and you know

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.240 
looking at my muscle now and you know
there's<00:05:53.050> a<00:05:53.110> little<00:05:53.319> bit<00:05:53.500> of<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.710> muscle<00:05:54.069> here

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
there's a little bit of a muscle here

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.860 
there's a little bit of a muscle here
but<00:05:54.430> it's<00:05:54.550> deflated<00:05:55.180> it<00:05:55.300> doesn't<00:05:55.659> look

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
but it's deflated it doesn't look

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.680 
but it's deflated it doesn't look
particularly<00:05:56.440> big<00:05:57.400> in<00:05:57.789> comparison<00:05:58.449> to<00:05:58.539> what

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
particularly big in comparison to what

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.260 
particularly big in comparison to what
it<00:05:58.780> looked<00:05:58.960> like<00:05:59.050> before<00:05:59.250> so<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.970> know<00:06:01.000> be

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
it looked like before so you know be

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.210 
it looked like before so you know be
interesting<00:06:01.750> to<00:06:01.870> see<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.020> visual<00:06:02.500> impact<00:06:02.949> of

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
interesting to see the visual impact of

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.380 
interesting to see the visual impact of
the<00:06:03.789> water<00:06:04.090> re-entering<00:06:04.690> my<00:06:04.900> muscles
