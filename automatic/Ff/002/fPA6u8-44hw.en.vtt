00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
he's scrambling a little bit here with

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.550 
he's scrambling a little bit here with
Vic<00:04:55.699> but<00:04:56.270> for<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.720> most<00:04:56.900> part<00:04:57.020> man<00:04:57.319> we<00:04:57.470> were

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
Vic but for the most part man we were

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.409
