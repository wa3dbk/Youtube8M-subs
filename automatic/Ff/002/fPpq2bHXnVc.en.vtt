00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
kind of a map made of hair so here

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
kind of a map made of hair so here
that's<00:00:38.250> gotten<00:00:38.520> down<00:00:38.670> there<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.059> all<00:00:39.149> gets

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
that's gotten down there it all gets

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.040 
that's gotten down there it all gets
twisted<00:00:40.050> together<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:41.780> shall<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.870> say

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
twisted together and then shall we say

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.979 
twisted together and then shall we say
various<00:00:43.730> organic<00:00:44.730> materials<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.600> caught<00:00:45.809> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
various organic materials get caught in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
various organic materials get caught in
that<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.440> spit<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> toothpaste

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that you know spit from the toothpaste

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
that you know spit from the toothpaste
and<00:00:48.090> whatever<00:00:48.539> else<00:00:48.989> pieces<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> toothpaste

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and whatever else pieces of toothpaste

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.100 
and whatever else pieces of toothpaste
and<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.940> forth<00:00:51.180> they<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.510> caught<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and so forth they get caught up in that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.389 
and so forth they get caught up in that
bat<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.530> what's<00:00:52.710> blocking<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> water

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
bat and that's what's blocking the water

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.510 
bat and that's what's blocking the water
flow<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.530> chemical<00:00:55.530> drain<00:00:55.800> cleaner<00:00:56.190> will

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
flow now the chemical drain cleaner will

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.299 
flow now the chemical drain cleaner will
try<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> dissolve<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.600> organic<00:00:58.109> material

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
try to dissolve that organic material

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.380 
try to dissolve that organic material
for<00:00:59.309> let<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.460> water<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.969> through<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
for let the water go through and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
for let the water go through and
sometimes<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> would<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:00.989> successful<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.340> in

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
sometimes it would be successful but in

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.149 
sometimes it would be successful but in
my<00:01:02.760> experience<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.840> hair<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.290> still<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.799> so

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
my experience the hair is still there so

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.740 
my experience the hair is still there so
basically<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> hair<00:01:06.060> there<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.570> just

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
basically with the hair there it's just

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
basically with the hair there it's just
a<00:01:06.930> matter<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.200> time<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> month<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:08.159> two<00:01:08.340> before

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
a matter of time a month or two before

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.640 
a matter of time a month or two before
it<00:01:09.119> starts<00:01:09.420> clogging<00:01:09.810> back<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.110> again<00:01:10.380> because

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it starts clogging back up again because

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.899 
it starts clogging back up again because
all<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> material<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.340> still<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> get

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
all the material is still going to get

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.820 
all the material is still going to get
caught<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.200> need<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
caught in it but you need to do is you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.100 
caught in it but you need to do is you
need<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> hair<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.450> now

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
need to get the hair out of there now

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
need to get the hair out of there now
there's<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.729> way<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
there's a this way that I'm going to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
there's a this way that I'm going to
suggest<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.170> pretty<00:01:19.470> inexpensive<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
suggest to you is pretty inexpensive and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.410 
suggest to you is pretty inexpensive and
you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> couple<00:01:20.820> minutes<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you can do it in a couple minutes it's a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
you can do it in a couple minutes it's a
little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.810> icky<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.680> big<00:01:23.250> solution<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
little bit icky the big solution is

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.140 
little bit icky the big solution is
actually<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> wrench<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
actually to go in with a wrench and a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.109 
actually to go in with a wrench and a
replacement<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> youtube<00:01:29.040> piece<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.880> catch

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
replacement the youtube piece that catch

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.690 
replacement the youtube piece that catch
underneath<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.960> sink<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.409> actually<00:01:32.280> replace

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
underneath the sink and actually replace

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
underneath the sink and actually replace
that<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> slime

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that because that will get all the slime

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
that because that will get all the slime
and<00:01:34.799> hair<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.430> everything<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.450> that's

bought an extra one just because I

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.940 
bought an extra one just because I
assumed<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.140> would<00:02:44.260> wear<00:02:44.500> out<00:02:44.710> more<00:02:44.890> quickly
