00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.990 
thing we're gonna look at is the
preserving<00:00:19.470> bin<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.189> go<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.910> see

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
preserving bin so here we go you can see

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.640 
preserving bin so here we go you can see
it<00:00:21.180> burns<00:00:21.570> simple<00:00:21.990> fuels<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.380> low

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it burns simple fuels that low

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
it burns simple fuels that low
temperatures<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.279> dehydrate<00:00:23.730> food<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.269> kill

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
temperatures to dehydrate food and kill

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.009 
temperatures to dehydrate food and kill
bacteria

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
bacteria

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.890 
bacteria
alright<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.910> definitely<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.180> be<00:00:27.330> good<00:00:27.539> for

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
if it works for berries but uh I guess

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.229 
if it works for berries but uh I guess
there's<00:00:34.380> only<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> find<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.430> alright

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
there's only one way to find out alright

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.970 
there's only one way to find out alright
so<00:00:36.540> we've<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> preserving<00:00:37.440> bin<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.890> we

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so we've got the preserving bin so we

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.000 
so we've got the preserving bin so we
can<00:00:38.129> access<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> inventory<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.770> you<00:00:40.770> start

preserving<00:00:54.120> bin<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:55.500> action<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> now

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
preserving bin is in action it is now

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.209 
preserving bin is in action it is now
preserving<00:00:57.059> our<00:00:57.210> meat<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.219> that'll

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
in there long enough it will turn into

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
in there long enough it will turn into
