00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.850
 world of warcraft 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.119
 blackstone game where we are going to play 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.259
 some place hunted but well it's fine 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.599
 by mentally walking 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.430
 quietly and suddenly I have 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.960
 seen a wish that is not there 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.910
 because if you get older mind is late 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.279
 and he told me to come to a brotherhood 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.720
 what is called something is eleven is something 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.580
 more limited a brotherhood and a half do not 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.340
 want from this brotherhood we give to the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.850
 to climb I do not know that we help you from masters 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.080
 false gold that is false do not fear not have 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.960
 done or house solved and I have been told 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.629
 welcome outside only seek light 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.339
 you know what is going to be needed in the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.379
 bank only need money look at the 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.930
 bank let's look at the bank if you see the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.729
 bank has 272 thousand euros 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 look at the gold they earn with the shit that 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.159
 we make blogs 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.470
 they really want me for what I spoil 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.809
 in everything that goes up and if you just invited the 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.010
 bank better clarified I can get it 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.839
 nothing in the bank do not put the eyelashes 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.150
 and sure there 's a fool who nava 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.400
 everything is there is a boss who stays all 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.920
 money for example here is one that 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.540
 well have I want to name what you do not want 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.130
 to name it, it was already 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.039
 touched this person but 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.550
 is what there is and that is called alarmed 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.440
 of you something 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.510
 and basically they believe that with my gold and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.580
 they are not going to keep my gold so 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.020
 I say this this is my gold and this is 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.100
 valuable if they want me to keep the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.010
 bands that have to give a commission 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 I need 5% of what bank 20 is a 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.760

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.470
