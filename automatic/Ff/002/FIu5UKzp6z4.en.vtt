00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 you are one of the lucky ones 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.080
 already got a one plus one 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.299
 to have 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.130
 congratulations now wanted to know 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.410
 how to remove the back 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.690
 no problem, we'll show you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.690
 so do not switch off a short break 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.980
 so I'm already with my one 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.920
 plus one and today i wanted to see you 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.159
 show how to replace the rear 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.019
 or can make off because I have to admit 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.070
 that is a bit tricky and I have 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.420
 also has a bit with me 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.460
 overcoming cost 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.809
 until I actually did it 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.159
 as I am a bit myself 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.930
 curious as I am here now before the 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.449
 Camera in that I do not get there 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.790
 finally out of the camera emigrant if 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.759
 because at least I will tell you 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.799
 what I did 

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:00.500
 from the principle, there are more 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.540
 covers that you can buy later 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.909
 at one place at the moment I think so 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.439
 first that bamboo cover is for sale 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.890
 acquirable but there are others 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.350
 give 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.470
 with jeans patterns and other woods 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.270
 ec talked good long enough 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.930
 you need to back off to the back 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.490
 do 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.810
 it goes once this beautiful 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.550
 key chains from the principle one 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.530
 small piekser in it has what you can 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.080
 sim-card tray can remove the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.270
 we need and depending on I have 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.600
 Here's a little spatula son 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.580
 Plastic lift that it's such a small 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.920
 special tool what people use the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.750
 hold a lot of rumfummeln on such devices 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.350
 if you do not have it that way 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.510
 tragic 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.130
 then you should always good the country 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.340
 have eaten them in the form of 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.170
 gummy bears and strong fingernails 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.920
 because that's what you're gonna do 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.330
 need 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.400
 then let's see how the whole thing 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.770
 works basically as yet to 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.530
 the very first of the sim-cards tray removed 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.630
 So you get that from it 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.790
 still relatively easy just pure 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.810
 press and that accordingly 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.659
 pull out 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.500
 that 's it for the first time with the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.349
 then mechanical side of the accessory 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.420
 we have to go to the bottom in the 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.280
 original it is explained that you can do it with 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.439
 to create a finger with one hand 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.349
 namely, by being here under the 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:24.500
 surge mod logo on it presses with the 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.109
 index finger up here in this usb 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.169
 bay goes in and that lifts it off 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.160
 is already here in the act 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.320
 because I already have one 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.390
 you have done two times so you see 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.640
 this is a bit different now 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.960
 can 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.640
 if that is not the case with you 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.320
 should and it will not be guaranteed 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.050
 be the case if you are the first time 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.840
 then do you take a little one 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.090
 Tool and goes in here and pushes 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.250
 because in here the plastic the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.070
 Plastic backside up 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.660
 yes , either with the fingernail 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.470
 but then he should really 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.390
 be strong 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.800
 have a bit of courage it works 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.030
 and it works that way and you can 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.830
 basically nothing taken basically 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.620
 break it unless you are too 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.150
 far in the usb port in there you have to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.940
 so be careful so only the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.250
 Plastic part of the USB port to grab 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.810
 and make him a bit too good 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.340
 let's go on, as we said we have that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.930
 a little bit at me all year 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.580
 by the way, the smartphone 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.990
 not completely shut down completely 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.530
 turned off but shut down 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.930
 so I do not carelessly to the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.580
 Volume down and the power button 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.660
 come and then any functions 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.260
 To run 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.380
 well so i go here now long and 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.910
 raise this before a little go up 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.650
 also on the sides that's one 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.390
 little bit tricky around the corners 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.740
 around and then on the next page 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.270
 He always does not want to do that right there 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.640
 like now I have it already 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.570
 little bit off I 'm doing here now 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.340
 even with the finger still in the camera 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.810
 that's part of the clinical experience 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.770
 the turn is micro a bit so 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.230
 Maybe if I have another one 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:08.690
 you have more so it makes me so 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.910
 louder his little plastic clicks 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.410
 were according to the then again 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.690
 he has already left here 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.100
 seized up again so here is again 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.140
 such a small place were the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.549
 volume quietly rocker and on the sim 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.620
 cards tray where it a bit 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.530
 harder because the material yes 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.130
 is relatively thin and it goes up too 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.320
 not so easy 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:35.270
 that already showed right in the fingernail 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:39.610
 yes so I hope I'm still in the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:43.270
 bild I 'll do it now 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.520
 for the first time with the fingernail that 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.439
 but apparently it works because I like 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.050
 said had been 12 times from 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:05:06.879
 so now i have you here rom 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:09.460
 already removed accordingly so now 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.770
 We did that in the back 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.020
 from and you can for just accordingly 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.039
 swap with another back 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.090
 swap as we like 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.340
 Please note the following 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.750
 So here is the louder one 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.550
 soft wipple in it 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.810
 yes, this little button is one 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.529
 separate part 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.960
 and here is the power button in there 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.580
 even as a plastic button it is me 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.789
 already happened that button 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.409
 suddenly failed here and if 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.919
 you should happen to that I should take 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.300
 now once again willfully so out her 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.210
 So look here now I have the 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.469
 accordingly in the hand and because if 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.849
 She thinks that back in too 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.930
 make the first you should not 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.000
 Of course, a little bit lose 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.400
 unfavorable and if you do not know how 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.500
 which comes in then look at you 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.479
 That's it on one side 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.430
 I take it the matters arising from the 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:05.830
 camera out in the hope that the 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.479
 sharp turns on one side 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.449
 so a little further plastic 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.759
 two buttons yes do not know if we can do that 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.490
 so see and on the bottom 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.710
 no plastic is not white 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.419
 plastic yes the side with the white 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.240
 Plastic must go up 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.009
 so cover her from these covers 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.800
 outside practically does not cover the 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.569
 back but just on the 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.000
 this cover with that somehow 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.539
 we can differentiate a bit 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.620
 because that has to go back in and so 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.300
 Now I think that here again 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.100
 accordingly pure in the louder quieter 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.170
 seesaw and 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.820
 so and so I do the device anyway 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:53.470
 again I close that in the me 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:57.520
 So let's put it that way 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:00.340
 and then that on all corners down 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:05.350
 press until it audibly accordingly 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:07.090
 it snaps up and down everywhere and then 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.490
 I have the device back in 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.680
 original condition closed 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.720
 yes so the vehicle without taken too 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.440
 already cards are quickly back in 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.970
 best with the sim card and then as 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.090
 the device is fully functional again 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.100
 how to get the one plus one 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.960
 back side changes in that sense when 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.220
 you like it has sams, and looks 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.180
 on our other tips and tricks 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.860
 bye bye bye 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.360
 if you forget the video of the case 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.980
 not subscribe to us and is 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.170
 maybe also via twitter google + and 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.740
 share facebook so others also 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.740
 have women 

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:45.509
 visit 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.820
 to the day of healthy
