00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:12.500
 www galera beauty 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.839
 in this video would be making comparisons 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.860
 between the digital recorder of the 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.450
 zoom model h 1 and the yoga microphone ht 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.430
 81 shot gun 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.680
 from now on the audio that you 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.620
 you will hear alternating between 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.350
 microphones for you know how ball 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.880
 we are in a moment will appear 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.520
 the image of the right side of the vehicle 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.750
 Let's start by telling the 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.060
 the will of each 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.070
 the zoom lawn in addition to being super 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.600
 compact has some super options 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.910
 interesting for example you can 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.340
 increase the gain of the microphone by 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.290
 he is more or less sensitive there. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.850
 depend on your need for example 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.770
 if you are making a recording on the street 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 there is a lot of noise you can download the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.310
 input volume now if you go 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.140
 record in an enclosed place 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.390
 you can increase the input to 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 capture the highest audio you too 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.579
 you can choose the recording format in 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.159
 one and i saw one mp3 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:09.619
 an interesting detail is that it records 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.799
 stereo with two microphones one 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.909
 facing right and another facing 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.100
 to the left 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.590
 this is the great advantage compared to the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 microphone yoga yoga is the microphone 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.969
 simple and is not a recorder 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.340
 so he has none of that to save 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.840
 between 3 and 6 of gain the only thing that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.439
 you can set in the eye 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.170
 you will capture normal or it is in the 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.520
 normal and capture only what is in the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.759
 front of him 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.130
 ignoring the sides and in recapture mode 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.529
 all that is rolling a good application 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.450
 for this it is for example if you do not 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:48.479
 an interview with someone where you play 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.460
 and another was there you put was 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.189
 addressed to the interviewee and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.799
 in normal mode or if it goes 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.880
 singing the sun that is in front of him goes 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.799
 ignore the sides 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.539
 When I say that it will void 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.970
 it means that bypassing seats in Tucson 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.920
 but it will greatly decrease the sounds that 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.509
 the sides are coming in a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 a little about the disadvantages of each 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.640
 one in case the recorder to 1 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.040
 The wicker and plastic finish is a is 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.220
 a fragile writer and one of the things 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.680
 I could see in my case that the thread 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.360
 to connect on the tripod is plastic 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.780
 so if you're not careful with the theme 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.360
 wearing to the point of being soft 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.790
 the only part resistant even of the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.010
 The recorder is the front 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.900
 the microphones he has an investment in 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.910
 party I do not know that stuff but but 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.950
 you can see which is stronger than the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.349
 score already the yoga microphone 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.959
 disadvantage does not work alone or 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.019
 or if there's nothing there for him 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.090
 he will not leave anything then to use it or 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.160
 you plug in your camera connect the one 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.500
 recorder in the blue zone plane has 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.940
 input from me for you to use in 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 if this type of microphone 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.620
 so I can not say it goes 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.139
 depend on your situation if you have 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.180
 conditions against the two because you will 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.319
 having the option to use the other depends on the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.000
 situation 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.310
 but if you can not afford both 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.510
 analysis is worth taking the recorder 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.500
 or a microphone your camera has input 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.840
 microphone 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.510
 if it may be that the yoga is 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.190
 an interesting one has a lower cost may 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.049
 help get started by feeling the way you are 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.850
 it will be capturing him such and there 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.139
 Then who knows, the owner has concluded. 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.370
 something better 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.709
 I will not go into much detail 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.720
 because this is a complicated subject, and I 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.110
 I can speak well here on the tape recorder of another 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.430
 person and will comment 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.410
 only that the printed recorder was 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.110
 staying here just one more thing I 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.370
 I produced some comedy videos from 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.110
 youtube channel 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.820
 access youtube on the channel is high 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.670
 voltage anyway I'll put 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.260
 A lot here for you to access was 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.540
 until the next video 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.560
 we got to the end of the video worth having 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.110
 assisted at the end 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.160
 watch our video from the right and 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.530
 from the left 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.200
 subscribe to our channel in favor of this 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.200
 video now worth until next time
