guess<00:02:25.600> all<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.140> different<00:02:26.620> sides<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
guess all the different sides of the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.340 
guess all the different sides of the
device<00:02:27.400> too<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.630> an<00:02:28.840> evolution

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
device too so this is like an evolution

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.050 
device too so this is like an evolution
of<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.500> same<00:02:29.709> inner<00:02:29.920> body<00:02:30.100> design<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.970> was

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
of the same inner body design that was

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.170 
of the same inner body design that was
in<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.360> other<00:02:31.480> 100<00:02:31.720> gotcha<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.970> is

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
in the other 100 gotcha and so is

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.699 
in the other 100 gotcha and so is
anything<00:02:34.480> specifically<00:02:35.170> different<00:02:35.590> about

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
anything specifically different about

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.140 
anything specifically different about
the<00:02:35.830> material<00:02:36.340> i<00:02:36.489> know<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.730> grass<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
the material i know the grass of the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.059 
the material i know the grass of the
glass<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.660> stronger<00:02:38.050> too<00:02:38.230> much<00:02:38.650> stronger

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
glass is stronger too much stronger

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.890 
glass is stronger too much stronger
uh-huh<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> closest<00:02:40.300> any<00:02:40.480> metal<00:02:40.780> can

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
uh-huh it's the closest any metal can

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.009 
uh-huh it's the closest any metal can
get<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.140> actually<00:02:41.890> diamond<00:02:42.700> ok<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:43.840> do

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
get to actually diamond ok so you can do

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.569 
get to actually diamond ok so you can do
anything<00:02:44.260> with<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> phone<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.799> doesn't<00:02:44.950> free

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579
