00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
airplane mode would be off but Wi-Fi

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.050

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
would be grayed out I wouldn't have the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.880 
would be grayed out I wouldn't have the
option<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.449> turn<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:24.990> off<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.500> anything

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
option to turn it on or off or anything

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.750 
option to turn it on or off or anything
I<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
I can do that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.800 
I can do that
and<00:00:26.990> even<00:00:27.990> using<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.710> function<00:00:29.429> keys<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:30.000> like

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and even using my function keys now like

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.150 
and even using my function keys now like
function<00:00:31.700> f3<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.690> only<00:00:34.020> turn<00:00:34.410> airplane<00:00:34.800> mode

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
function f3 that only turn airplane mode

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.660 
function f3 that only turn airplane mode
on<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.300> didn't<00:00:36.630> turn<00:00:36.890> Wi-Fi<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
on and off that didn't turn Wi-Fi that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.020 
on and off that didn't turn Wi-Fi that
didn't<00:00:38.910> turn<00:00:39.030> Wi-Fi<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.809> there's<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:44.000> way<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
didn't turn Wi-Fi on so there's a way to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.560 
didn't turn Wi-Fi on so there's a way to
fix<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.100> here's<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.399> did<00:00:48.469> you<00:00:49.469> need<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
fix it and here's what I did you need to

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.040 
fix it and here's what I did you need to
go<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:52.079> sirs<00:00:52.590> website<00:00:55.219> type<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:57.050> well

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
go to a sirs website type in there well

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
go to a sirs website type in there well
google<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:58.859> whatever<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:01:00.170> go

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
google it or whatever you want to do go

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.050

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.880 

and<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.300> you<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.570> gives<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> list<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.500> search

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and then you know gives a list of search

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.880 
and then you know gives a list of search

it's<00:01:14.370> a<00:01:14.430> quickest<00:01:14.790> way

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.239 

I<00:01:24.749> think<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.499> you're<00:01:25.619> doing<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
I think if you're doing this for the

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:27.739 
I think if you're doing this for the
first<00:01:26.399> time<00:01:26.579> I'm<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.329> sure<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.539> have<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
first time I'm pretty sure you have to

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:31.609 
first time I'm pretty sure you have to
pick<00:01:28.649> your<00:01:28.740> laptop<00:01:29.569> model<00:01:30.569> number<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.990> then

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
pick your laptop model number and then

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.559 
pick your laptop model number and then
you<00:01:31.859> can<00:01:32.249> see<00:01:32.429> that's<00:01:32.579> mine<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:32.880> there<00:01:33.090> I've

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
you can see that's mine right there I've

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:40.209 
you can see that's mine right there I've
already<00:01:33.840> done<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> saved<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:38.929> this<00:01:39.929> I

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
already done this so it saved it this I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.349 
already done this so it saved it this I
mean<00:01:41.219> I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.459> know<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.819> happens<00:01:42.209> on<00:01:42.329> a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
finishes then it restarts the computer

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.200 
finishes then it restarts the computer
and<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:17.350> when<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.920> noticed<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.490> it<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:18.910> booted

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
and it when I noticed it it just booted

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.760 
and it when I noticed it it just booted
up<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.830> there's<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.190> Wi-Fi<00:03:22.120> light<00:03:22.770> indicator

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
up and there's the Wi-Fi light indicator

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.090 
up and there's the Wi-Fi light indicator
light<00:03:24.100> was<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.150> before<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.260> had<00:03:26.470> done<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.980> was

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
light was on before I had done it it was

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.090 
light was on before I had done it it was
off<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.610> couldn't<00:03:27.910> get<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.210> turn<00:03:28.450> on<00:03:28.630> and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
off and I couldn't get it to turn on and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.090 
off and I couldn't get it to turn on and
that<00:03:30.100> fixed<00:03:30.520> everything<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:32.760> logged<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:36.010> I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
that fixed everything I logged in and I

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.300 
that fixed everything I logged in and I
was<00:03:36.280> able<00:03:36.460> to<00:03:37.050> go<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.110> my<00:03:38.320> networks<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:39.070> see

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
was able to go to my networks and see

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.010 
was able to go to my networks and see
that<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:40.330> Wi-Fi<00:03:40.720> was<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:43.750> weird

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
that the Wi-Fi was just on so it's weird

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.650 
that the Wi-Fi was just on so it's weird
but<00:03:45.780> that's<00:03:46.780> what<00:03:46.990> fixed<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:48.420> couldn't<00:03:49.420> find

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
but that's what fixed it I couldn't find

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
but that's what fixed it I couldn't find
anything<00:03:50.290> online<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:53.740> took<00:03:53.920> me<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.100> while<00:03:54.250> but

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
anything online it took me a while but

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.340 
anything online it took me a while but
while<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.830> are<00:03:56.860> at<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.520> could<00:03:57.670> probably

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
while you are at it you could probably

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.870 
while you are at it you could probably
update<00:04:00.480> or<00:04:01.480> download<00:04:01.959> all<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.260> other<00:04:02.410> drivers

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
update or download all the other drivers

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.460 
update or download all the other drivers
so<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:03.970> don't<00:04:04.150> run<00:04:04.330> into<00:04:04.510> any<00:04:04.720> more<00:04:04.840> problems

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
so you don't run into any more problems

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:14.850 
so you don't run into any more problems
I<00:04:05.620> guess<00:04:09.630> ok<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.660> hope<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:11.200> are<00:04:12.130> able<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.489> fix<00:04:12.700> it
