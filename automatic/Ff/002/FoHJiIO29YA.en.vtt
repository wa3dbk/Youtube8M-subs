one-sided<00:04:52.810> I've<00:04:53.620> seen<00:04:53.860> this<00:04:53.949> is<00:04:54.129> performing

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
one-sided I've seen this is performing

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.390 
one-sided I've seen this is performing
the<00:04:54.610> real<00:04:54.759> world<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.180> expected<00:04:55.750> them<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:55.930> win

however<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:58.000> Kennedys<00:04:58.330> performance<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:58.870> very

however the Kennedys performance is very
surprising<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.979> wouldn't<00:05:00.819> want<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.030> be<00:05:01.150> one<00:05:01.270> in

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
surprising I wouldn't want to be one in

the real world I knew we would win the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.460 
the real world I knew we would win the
whole<00:05:03.460> time<00:05:03.669> even<00:05:04.330> if<00:05:04.419> he<00:05:04.539> cited<00:05:04.840> his<00:05:04.990> gun<00:05:05.199> fast

enough<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.889> would<00:05:06.009> run<00:05:06.190> right<00:05:06.639> through<00:05:06.819> the

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
of a thousand times it's a ridiculous

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.270 
of a thousand times it's a ridiculous
