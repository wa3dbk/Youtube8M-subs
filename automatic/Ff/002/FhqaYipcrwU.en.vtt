00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
New Bags 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.220
in the Haldorádó

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.379
Assortment

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:20.290
New Bags in the Haldorádó Assortment

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.820
Haldorádó, beyond that it offers new baits, and groundbaits, it also pays attention to the special needs of fishermen.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.910
Unfortunately, the problem of the safe storage and carriage of our fishing tackle often comes into the picture only,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.340
when it comes to resentment, due to the lack of sufficient bags.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.469
Mixed up small items, rod broken during transport, carrying our stuff in plastic bags, these are all such inconvenience, which could be prevented.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:53.240
I would like to introduce the new Haldorádó HardBlue rod cases, and the large tackle bag, which is truly large! 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.519
The feeder and carp fishing bags of Haldorádó have been very popular ever so far,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.860
but many people noted that they would be glad to see a special rod case, which is hard, and would protect the rods carried in them during transportation for sure.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.429
This is extremely significant in the case of feeder rods, for most people carry their rods fully equipped,

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:28.719
and, as you can see it, in this hard rod case, stabilized to the back of the case, even the thinnest feeder rod tip can be transported with one hundred percent safety.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:36.659
One peculiarity of this rod case is that its stand is strong, it is made of hardened plastic, due to which it can stand on its own foot too.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.769
Of course this wasn’t made like this just to stand nice and straight on its own legs, but,

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:49.760
if for example we must put our rod case down into mud or grass, then by leaning it next to a bench, a tree, or even to our car,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.750
it won’t get wet from the ground, since this hard plastic is entirely waterproof, it will not soak up any moisture.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.560
All of the Haldorádó HardBlue rod bags are made in 160 centimetres length, and almost all three-piece rods fit into them in folded stance nicely.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.490
It is available in three, four, and five compartment varieties as well. The Haldorádó HardBlue five compartment make is unmatched on the market.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:20.879
Of course the compartments are divided by separators, and a rod-stabilizing wire is located in each of the compartments.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.199
The rod case attained its name after nothing else but its hard, strengthened sidewalls.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:36.739
The zipper, which we use most often on rod bags as you know, is really strong, both the slider and the rail are good quality.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.869
Thus, the rod case’s long-life is guaranteed.

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:50.850
In order to demonstrate how many things can fit into a bag like this, I brought one of my rod bags which I have been using for a long time now.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:07.360
Here is one rod, two rods, three rods with reels, four rods with reels, and here are the spare rods, the landing net handle and the umbrella in the side pocket.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.060
All these fit into one single rod case, and what is the best in it, is that they won’t get damaged during the way.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.489
One side pocket can be found on the side of the bag, in which we can store every kind of small accessories, or we can carry a towel in it as well.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:29.399
The shoulder straps and its handles are also made of a hard material, furthermore, the shoulder straps is also spongy, and thus it won’t irritate one’s shoulder during a long carriage.

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:36.609
The appearance of the bag is very elegant by the way, as all Haldorádó products, this also reflects high quality.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.329
If someone uses one of these bags, he certainly does not leave the protection of his tackle to chance.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.079
I should go fishing tomorrow, but I don’t have the time to pack my things in.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.599
Every stuff is scattered about, nothing is in its place, well, I believe many people have been like this before. But there is a solution for this!

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.139
As everything, the fishing tackle also deserves some orderliness.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:04.939
We need such a big-sized, strong bag, into which every stuff can fit into, and it also looks great into the bargain! 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.849
The Haldorádó big tackle bag provides a solution for everything. 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.459
This, large-sized bag has four separate pockets. Let’s proceed in order, I will show all of them.

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.919
This front, open pocket is very useful, where we can put our linen mixing bowls, landing net heads, sieves as well,

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.719
or we can even store and transport such huge hook line keepers in it like I use.

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:38.869
The side of this pocket is open, barred structured, thus the remaining humidity and smells can easily go away of it, and our bag won’t get muggy.

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:46.349
We can put smaller stuff into the two pockets located on the bag’s two shorter sides.

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.249
I store my cleaning detergents in here, with which I clean my rods.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:05:06.779
Strainers, worm scissors, gloves which are useful for winnowing earth, one more towel, and a brush which is very significant for cleaning the reels.

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:16.449
I store a bait sprayer in the opposite pocket, I can rewet the groundbait with it,

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:23.649
and also my favourite pumps with which I can use different kinds of aromas.

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:27.709
Let’s move on to the big pocket.

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:47.149
A hand towel. A complete little bating tray can fit into it, one towel for me in the summer heat.

00:05:47.149 --> 00:06:00.849
One little bag for my personal stuff, little accessories for preparing end-tackles. Hook line keeping box.

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:07.489
The things that take away the biggest part of the space are the fishing boxes. We can take out these completely like this.

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:11.539
The spare feeders, lines and other stuffs are in here.

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:25.480
Drinking water, spare reel, spare lines, and that is about all.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.799
As you can see it, I packed lots of things around me quite nicely. It is surprising that all this stuff fit into this big bag, but I had told you that this was big!

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:43.410
Now, that it is empty, I can show you another important feature of it, namely that its bottom is made of rubber and it is strengthened and waterproof.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.970
This prevents the bag from soaking up wetness from the ground when putting it onto wet grass.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.270
Ready!

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:22.070
Of course this bag becomes complete with comfortable spongy and strong shoulder straps, and strong as hell handles.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.559
This bag is recommended for those who go on longer journeys, and for the competitively fishing anglers,

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:34.310
who carry lot more tackles with themselves that is considered to be common! With the help of this bag, carrying our tackle is not a burden anymore.
