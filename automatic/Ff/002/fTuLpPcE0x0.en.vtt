 Episode 54: 22 Years in Pictures 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 On April 24, 1990, Hubble's telescope was built in collaboration with NASA and ESA 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 brought into space. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 In those 22 years he has made more than a million observations. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Introducing our most popular - one each year. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Among the first objects observed by Hubble was Saturn, 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 the picture is good but a little blurry 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 for which there may be a known problem with the main mirror. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.005
 Although not perfectly sharp, this image shows the Orion Nebula 

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.005
 richness of colors and structures 

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.000
 stars in this area. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 There are shreds of gas in the Orion Nebula 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 around newborn stars - astronomers call them Herbig-Har's ojects. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 In 1993, the first service mission resolved the growth problems of Hubble's telescope. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 The core images of spiral galaxy M100 before and after correction show 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 how the image quality has improved incredibly. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Shortly thereafter, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 A similar collision 65 million years ago may have contributed to the extinction of dinosaurs on Earth 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Hubble's film "Pillars of Creation" in Eagle Nebula is one of the most famous. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 These giant dust-filled structures hide deposits of star formation. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 The 1996 film shows a planetary nebula 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 the opposite of star life from the Eagle Nebula - a star grave. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 When Hubble took this picture in 1997, 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 was just on the way to the Pathfinder spacecraft. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 The Ring Nebula is one of the most famous planetary nebulae. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 The Keyhole Nebula is part of a complex in the keel - 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 - other star formation areas 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 which is rich in glowing gas. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Not all nebulae shine brightly. NGC 1999 is a dark spot 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 on a background illuminated by stars. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 We see dramatic consequences in this galaxy 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 collision between galaxies. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Further modernization in 2002 included new cameras, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 which again improved the resolution and image quality. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 This extremely sharp image demonstrates the capabilities of the new device. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 This extremely long exposure was the task 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 capture the farthest and weakest galaxies in the universe. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Dramatic collision of two spiral galaxies 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 is captured on a slide of galaxies called Tykadla. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 This picture of the Orion Nebula 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 is one of the largest and most detailed. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Globular clusters, roughly spherical clusters of stars 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 contain the oldest stars of the Milky Way. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Hubble can display individual stars in their crowded center. 

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:13.000
 Image taken shortly before electronics failure in January 2007 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 which damaged the main camera of the telescope. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 But other telescope devices could compete 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 with the best telescopes on Earth's surface. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 During a service mission in 2009, the defect was removed and a new camera was installed. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Hubble was in full shape again. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Using new devices 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 he looked into his heart incredibly dusty 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Centaurus A. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Image released in April 2012 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 The Tarantula Nebula contains Hubble's 2011 observations 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 with data obtained by the European Southern Observatory. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 It is one of the most detailed pictures of the star formation area 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 with 330 megapixels. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Most of the Hubble telescope data is published about a year after it is acquired. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 What will be the best Hubble film of 2012? We still have to wait for that ... 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
