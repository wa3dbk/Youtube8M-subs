denying the fact that the iPhones have
larger<00:03:53.549> bezels<00:03:53.970> which<00:03:54.150> looks<00:03:54.359> somewhat<00:03:54.659> dated

larger bezels which looks somewhat dated

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.869 
larger bezels which looks somewhat dated
next<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.409> phones<00:03:55.620> with<00:03:55.799> more<00:03:55.949> compact<00:03:56.459> designs

however the ultra-thin design makes

however the ultra-thin design makes
these<00:03:59.129> larger<00:03:59.519> phones<00:03:59.790> more<00:04:00.209> comfortable

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
these larger phones more comfortable

phones<00:04:02.579> are<00:04:02.760> pretty<00:04:02.939> long<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.479> make<00:04:03.599> them

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
phones are pretty long and make them

than some of the other competition with
even<00:04:07.229> larger<00:04:07.650> displays<00:04:08.159> so<00:04:09.090> what<00:04:09.209> do<00:04:09.299> you

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
even larger displays so what do you

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.849 
even larger displays so what do you
think<00:04:09.599> if<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.079> were<00:04:10.199> to<00:04:10.229> buy<00:04:10.470> one<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.709> these

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
think if you were to buy one of these

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.409 
think if you were to buy one of these
iPhones<00:04:11.069> what<00:04:11.489> screen<00:04:11.819> size<00:04:12.060> would<00:04:12.329> you
