 at the pre-premiere screening of the hobbit film 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.230
 cinema smaug's wasteland turned out much 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.230
 more serious and epic than the first part 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.940
 return your home I suggest you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.590

 sure that he will betray us no more 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.010
 there is no king under the mountain and never 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.269

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.269

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.620
 before watching the movie audience 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.899
 entertained in full by whom and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.899

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.750
 time flies completely unnoticed all three 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.060
 movie adventures of bilbo baggins 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.070
 goes to the cinema with exactly one difference 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.560
 year in quite recently we 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.200
 worried about this and resent 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.080
 so back to be honest but 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.540
 we are already sorry that in 2014 the next 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.000
 the journey with friends is over and who 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.500
 knows when and for what reason peter 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.120

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.650

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:30.340

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.340
 if our ipad and our enemy are back 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.430
 i found something in goblin caves 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:49.610

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.600
 useful proposal to split the hobbit 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:07.520
 on 17 parts 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.060
 Tolkien if you have not passed it then 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.459
 you have a whole year to correct 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.459
 more than enough time 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.660
