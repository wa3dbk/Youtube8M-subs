00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.300
 hi all welcome to spain 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.460
 on the small roads of almeria for the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.510
 press presentation of suzuki v strom 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.330
 1000 new motoc rom jackets failed 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.660
 be completely removed from the catalog 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.660
 suzuki 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.980
 then who finally reappeared that he 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.980
 was inspired by 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.890
 such 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.860
 dr 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.570
 buda who had participated 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 the station and who owned 1 and channel 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.530
 we find it's an invention 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.850
 it's him who did not bmw then this 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.890
 suzuki v strom 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.289
 she's wanted a lot at the level of the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.470
 part cycle on to frame completely 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.090
 new 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.670
 with a distance arm fork axis 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.500
 oscillating much shorter and one arm 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.490
 also have much longer by cons 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.890
 knows a bike a little more 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.820
 a little more agile we also have a 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.330
 fork that becomes reverse braking 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.840
 understand to d 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.450
 gsxr of 2009 gsxr 1000 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.049
 fourth radio 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.049
 and powerful enough 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.910
 we feel that he worked 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.910
 on his braking 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.869
 so 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.869
 we also have 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.320
 a tubular lattice rear frame 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.210
 quite light at the engine level one is 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.470
 on the basis of your enemies 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.909
 which was presented there is a good 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.320
 decade 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.570
 Woods has still not bad evolved them 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.750
 we have a new clutch with an anti 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.970
 dribble we removed the radiator 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.660
 of oil by adding a bigger 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.020
 radiator 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.120
 aulas pistons that are bigger 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.870
 we gain about 40 cubic centimeters 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.670
 to make a deal 37 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.140
 cubic centimeter on this picture 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.360
 we also have a gearbox that has 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 evolved 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.350
 particular in the sixth report 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.090
 which is a bit shorter at the level of 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.620
 protection we have a bubble said 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.620
 adjustable on three levels like this 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.960
 maximum hdmi and we can still the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.960
 raise up there she is still at maximum 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.010
 it's enough but 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.750
 manipulation is not easy 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.780
 from the cockpit we are still 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.819
 quite comfortably sitting there this is where 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.269
 and it's refined the tank also from 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.980
 it is easier to 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.439
 feet on the ground 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.280
 we are on a fairly similar position 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.340
 to the old model 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.280
 arms rested good distance the legs 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.310
 folded boss it's nice enough 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.489
 we feel 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.760
 little aligned kilometers here at 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.080
 level of na instrumentation 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.840
 everything we need 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.940
 a ratio indicator engaged the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.940
 little trip a consumption indicator 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.540
 temperature 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.980
 we have a way of 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 handle traction control 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.230
 here I am doing it in 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.670
 direct must cut the gas years is a he 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.500
 is manageable on two levels 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.480
 we like the level because it 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.690
 allows a small screw 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.690
 or 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.420
 we will not drift this machine 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.080
 then more of this rom jacket is 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.080
 his weight 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.550
 which remains fairly contained for the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.590
 category who made a bike manageable 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.990
 it is really between the 650 and 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.200
 she is sweet years or even very sense 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.200
 now 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.910
 we can simply regret a 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.320
 chain transmission 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.670
 we have many readers among you who 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.700
 love this model but who wanted 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.840
 see a cardan transmission this will be 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.330
 not yet this year you can 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.500
 always fit a scooter 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.780
 this is the solution for motorcycles to 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.889
 chain so this new suzuki jacket 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.780
 red 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.780
 it is already available in concession 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.060
 and you will find his complete essay 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.120
 in the next motorcycle magazine and at very 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.120
 soon
