00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.329
 fear of what it will take 60 seconds 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.890
 in the new vw golf 7 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.110
 not with axel griesinger this time 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 but with kim christopher makes 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.839
 just as much fun though the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.920
 drive expertise in things across 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.070
 maybe not quite herself 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.870
 I think that's all right 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.159
 but axel makes control i want 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.449
 So you and control with the golf 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.949
 it's a bit and colleagues the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.030
 pirelli on it have that a golf so 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.750
 a bit uncontrolled over that 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.150
 We have just seen this across the board 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.920
 as the best attack actually and that 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.299
 is now without any advertorials or anything 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.299
 but if you are really serious 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.460
 the short in the camera like here ours 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.070
 team paul the legendary cameraman and 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.570
 Sebastian the best photographer and best 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.979
 fast driver of the world we have 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.600
 even the music left just that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.650
 all this time it is made out with it 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.030
 maybe understand a little better 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.799
 but this time also professional sound 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.570
 the golf kim nice car design 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:37.450
 or what do you say now old professional 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.890
 a first designer the police 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.179
 police we had to short the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.770
 make a change of position because the 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.509
 career in your opinion, were you have to 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.700
 not with the speed of me 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.829
 fallen between roundabout driving at 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.600
 Sunday morning only so is heat without 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.340
 sunglasses are in me now 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.390
 otherwise I do not have them too easy today 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.039
 tomorrow, therefore, I have the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.909
 take off your sunglasses 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.979
 The golf is actually the golf that 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.100
 car that's right there they already have 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.159
 from actually right with her claim yes 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.689
 this may be the designer here 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.580
 it will not let that happen 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.830
 so we can short this time out was 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.140
 It always infotainment to the clock 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.950
 now for music in utah too 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.830
 short if we can here and second 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.450
 has is also seen what has already seen 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.970
 One has to see me when writing yes 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.340
 if we do it all sounds very 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.980
 Well let's have a look at driving data 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.260
 Abstatt vehicle start one now 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.730
 beautiful golf that's all quite 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.489
 funny 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.200
 Let's do it again so that we can do it 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.819
 how often does the camera stand? 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.540
 wrong now she stands a bit 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.000
 better just say what I'm talking about 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.090
 a lot is eating slowly so what should I do 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.799
 just say mine is so up to date 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.680
 not warm so 22 degrees 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.620
 We take the camera so that this 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.120
 time to time song so it's a gag 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.340
 on the event that one 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 just the bike that is not in the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.450
 Just handle this number makes up 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:15.970
 who are in the panorama , so to speak 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.970
 we also say very popular among blog 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:27.650
 you can maybe race who 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:31.329
 first lying position is you have that 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:39.470
 I win the race but I like that 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:44.239
 departure again high in the course again 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.829
 High now have perhaps 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.750
 stay we can not make a cut 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.310
 World Cups is for beginners who will now 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.379
 not so happy but this 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.090
 next few seconds not quite 1 minutes 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.260
 24 says the camera still has one 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.389
 The man is also driving a bit here 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.699
 with the scooter over it will be the 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.549
 citizens from the circle is yes that can 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.079
 that's what you have then to driving fun 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.150
 I mean I'm just doing the design 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.819
 here as well as are violently what do you say to 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.609
 driving pleasure like prius on the 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.870
 outside lane 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.250
 that is unbelievable that as well as the car 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.919
 You rolled off if you have your the pirelli 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.370
 sat the little petrol engine in the sixth 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.650
 Gang rolls 130 over the country road 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.780
 is amazing it really has to say 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.099
 and there's something about it 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.010
 is operated today at base and 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.010
 Sealing is details and double 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.430
 Sealing details of quasi no more 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:45.180
 very close to 235 on sunday morning 7 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.050
 27 5 degrees in mid-october that was over 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.320
 but it is actually sunglasses 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.320
 The End 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.740
 what 's to criticize on golf except 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.540
 this funny pattern on the bar 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.170
 golf 1 convertible golf 1 gabriel see it 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.360
 very good christians belong 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.490
 not much , actually 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.780
 design technically I have to say 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.160
 not so much changed with you 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.880
 Raffinessen tricks worked 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.440
 they are really cool 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.350
 technically the first time golf 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.400
 down was fun in any case 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.910
 you can maybe splash 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.170
 still be that the entry engines me 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.970
 was surprised when i saw it always 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.590
 again the 140 ps 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.120
 cylinder shutdown with 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.130
 manual transmission drives really nice 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.840
 if you're with the siebengang dsg that is 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.370
 completely toothless the value at all 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.750
 Team of the opponent knows straight in the 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.750
 do not really hide in serpentines 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.760
 to disengage spontaneously that is not so 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.560
 smells and also when the diesel engine 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.160
 diesel goes very well with the six-speed dsg 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.960
 beautiful 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.550
 all were surprised as now was the 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.210
 first time the first two kilometers 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.690
 literary circle flew with it yet 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.710
 save money yesterday but actually is 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.550
 It always stops us manually, yes 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.800
 In the end , a bit of the missing was missing 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.480
 Researcher you also need the 18 380 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.330
 ps can I have you times their both 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.620
 250 newton meters the small and the big one 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.180
 and in the otto normal city traffic applies 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.950
 no one switches that off at 7000 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.600
 revolutions the maximum at 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.640
 three three and a half, the courtyard was freaking out 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.290
 display anyway by heart at 1800 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.190
 switched there have the cars at 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.540
 the same torque 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.940
 who needs the big engine at all 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.740
 now the danger is that he was kim after all 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.220
 no idea I'm not talking 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.220
 interest 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.480
 the expert opinion the ventilation also rushes 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.320
 so hard that probably that one 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.580
 totally dirty or better than bad 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.350
 but we are now only after 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.529
 five minutes on I do not know how that 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:52.089
 Goes out here as often take the stuff 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:52.959
 Do you know an open this rest am 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:55.509
 Sunday morning 

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:58.649
 there come the carabinieri and now 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:00.729
 we have to end the program 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:07.139
 that was faked because not come 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:07.139
 carabinieri paul man that 's it
