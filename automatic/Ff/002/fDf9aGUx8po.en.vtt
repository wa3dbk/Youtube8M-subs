00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260

especially<00:01:44.800> when<00:01:45.040> we<00:01:45.190> want<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.370> do<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.520> video<00:01:45.790> of

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
especially when we want to do a video of

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.610 
especially when we want to do a video of
it<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.140> know<00:01:47.290> this<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.770> love<00:01:49.140> well<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.380> fits

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
it you know this is love well that fits

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.040 
it you know this is love well that fits
perfectly<00:01:51.190> I<00:01:51.490> like<00:01:51.760> that<00:01:51.790> because<00:01:52.480> that's<00:01:52.900> the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
perfectly I like that because that's the

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.830 
perfectly I like that because that's the
huge<00:01:53.530> disadvantage<00:01:54.300> with<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> couple<00:01:55.720> of

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
huge disadvantage with a couple of

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.320 
huge disadvantage with a couple of
sleeves<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.770> are<00:01:56.830> just<00:01:57.220> not<00:01:57.430> really<00:01:58.030> fitting

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
sleeves that are just not really fitting

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.190 
sleeves that are just not really fitting
so<00:01:59.220> precisely<00:02:00.570> let's<00:02:01.570> take<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.810> quick<00:02:02.170> look

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
so precisely let's take a quick look

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.470 
so precisely let's take a quick look
hard<00:02:02.800> or<00:02:03.100> what<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.370> does<00:02:03.550> with<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.850> buttons<00:02:04.210> so

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
hard or what it does with the buttons so

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.630 
hard or what it does with the buttons so
it's<00:02:05.050> kind<00:02:05.230> of<00:02:05.290> protecting<00:02:05.800> also<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.370> volume

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
it's kind of protecting also the volume

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.300 
it's kind of protecting also the volume
control<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.600> over<00:02:08.440> here<00:02:08.649> right<00:02:08.830> now<00:02:09.010> this<00:02:09.220> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
control and over here right now this is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.850 
control and over here right now this is
the<00:02:09.340> mute<00:02:09.640> button<00:02:09.670> right<00:02:10.540> after<00:02:11.110> we<00:02:11.470> updated

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
the mute button right after we updated

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.310 
the mute button right after we updated
it<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.760> power<00:02:13.030> button<00:02:13.300> also<00:02:13.750> lies<00:02:14.110> behind

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
it the power button also lies behind

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.070 
it the power button also lies behind
this<00:02:14.620> rubber<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.300> over<00:02:16.300> here<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.660> have<00:02:16.690> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
this rubber and over here we have the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.890 
this rubber and over here we have the
one<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.440> our<00:02:17.530> headset<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.480> one<00:02:19.750> by

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
one for our headset what is this one by

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.810 
one for our headset what is this one by
the<00:02:19.930> waist<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.380> microphone<00:02:20.890> Rebecca<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.610> think
