highly interested in photography I'll

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.190 
highly interested in photography I'll
just<00:00:11.340> searching<00:00:11.700> some<00:00:11.880> applications<00:00:12.480> for

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
just searching some applications for

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.620 
just searching some applications for
photography<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> look<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> I

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
photography just to have a look and I

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.390 
photography just to have a look and I
found<00:00:15.929> I've<00:00:16.289> come<00:00:16.470> across<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.890> one<00:00:17.039> actually

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
found I've come across this one actually

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.890 
found I've come across this one actually
and<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.580> thought<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:17.910> gonna<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
and I thought was just gonna be like a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.420 
and I thought was just gonna be like a
mess<00:00:19.320> around<00:00:19.439> application<00:00:20.070> since<00:00:20.279> it's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
mess around application since it's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.220 
mess around application since it's
called<00:00:20.550> putting<00:00:20.880> camera<00:00:21.390> however<00:00:22.050> one

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
called putting camera however one

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
called putting camera however one
actually<00:00:22.590> got<00:00:22.769> using<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.550> when<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> started

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
actually got using it when I started

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.480 
actually got using it when I started
using<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.810> actually<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.619> good<00:00:25.920> now

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
using it it's actually really good now

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.130 
using it it's actually really good now
it<00:00:26.609> doesn't<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> best<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.539> rayon<00:00:27.869> three

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it doesn't have the best of rayon three

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.689 
it doesn't have the best of rayon three
point<00:00:28.410> three<00:00:28.680> point<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> best

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
point three point a it's not the best

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.880 
point three point a it's not the best
however<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.170> actually<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.560> really<00:00:31.740> good

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
however it's actually a really good

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.819 
however it's actually a really good
application<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> will<00:00:32.880> show<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> why

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
application and I will show you why

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.530 
application and I will show you why
because<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:36.030> useful<00:00:36.239> for

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
because it's actually really useful for

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
because it's actually really useful for
someone<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> actually<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.410> interested<00:00:37.920> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
someone that actually is interested in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.220 
someone that actually is interested in
photography<00:00:38.480> you<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.629> know<00:00:39.750> why<00:00:39.930> because

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
photography you all know why because

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
photography you all know why because
this<00:00:40.430> takes<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.730> good<00:00:41.969> photos<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
this takes really good photos and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
this takes really good photos and
obviously<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.530> based<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> camera<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
obviously it's based on the camera you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.770 
obviously it's based on the camera you
have<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:44.700> actual<00:00:44.910> phone<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
have on your actual phone which I have a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
have on your actual phone which I have a
galaxy<00:00:46.079> s2<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.219> good<00:00:47.370> camera

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
galaxy s2 so it has a really good camera

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.970 
galaxy s2 so it has a really good camera
but<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.899> things<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.230> allows<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
but the things that allows you to do is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.410 
but the things that allows you to do is
actually<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.489> good<00:00:50.700> under<00:00:51.030> weight<00:00:51.210> does

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
actually really good under weight does

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
actually really good under weight does
it<00:00:51.600> now<00:00:52.050> here's<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.739> app<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> actual

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
it now here's the app what the actual

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.500 
it now here's the app what the actual
application<00:00:53.850> looks<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> background

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
application looks like in the background

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.880 
application looks like in the background
you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:55.079> still<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.289> anything<00:00:55.620> because

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you can we still see anything because

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.529 
you can we still see anything because
it's<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> camera<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.390> have

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it's the camera and I don't really have

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
it's the camera and I don't really have
nothing<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.320> show<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.859> let<00:00:59.370> me

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
nothing to show you right now let me

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
nothing to show you right now let me

settings<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.450> don't<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.689> much<00:01:21.960> options<00:01:22.680> but

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
settings you don't get much options but

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
settings you don't get much options but
you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.130> change<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> size<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> pixels<00:01:24.689> on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you can change the size so the pixels on

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.499 
you can change the size so the pixels on
the<00:01:25.020> actual<00:01:25.290> photo<00:01:26.060> geo-tagging<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> can

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the actual photo geo-tagging so you can

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.590 
the actual photo geo-tagging so you can
basically<00:01:28.640> track<00:01:29.640> where<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.939> took<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> fall

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
basically track where you took the fall

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.109 
basically track where you took the fall
why<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.200> location<00:01:31.860> whether<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
why the location whether you want the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
well this one's more like 50ml so that

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.089 
well this one's more like 50ml so that
would<00:03:13.230> be<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:14.269> camera<00:03:15.269> wise<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.139> SLR<00:03:16.470> 50

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
would be in camera wise like the SLR 50

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.189 
would be in camera wise like the SLR 50
mil<00:03:17.250> would<00:03:17.400> be<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> macro<00:03:17.970> lens<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.989> more
