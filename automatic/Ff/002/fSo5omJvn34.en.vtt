00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 ae 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.670
 is 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.150
 hello once again to all connected one 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.550
 chords and music design i am arthur 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.610
 government we had previously studied 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.120
 a song by antonio lauro called 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.150
 andrey on the turn won the number 2 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.140
 In this video lesson we will learn to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.550
 music 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.500
 Natalia or the Venezuelan waltz number 3 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.910
 for those who have not watched the video of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.630
 waltz number 2 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.030
 the andrey in the county because it has very 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.780
 many things that the two are alike 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:53.510
 in relation to the type of music the rhythm 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.269
 they are all two m 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.920
 so there's a lot like a glass 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.560
 There's a lot of advice I got in the other one. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.709
 music that can count on this now 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.890
 so it's worth the hint in lap number 3 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.550
 just as in the previous year the measure is 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.980
 can be counted in a varied way can 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.680
 be counted in both two and three 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.440
 is what we call a thousand there marking 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.010
 two and three alternates 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.799
 she is present in the notes that people 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.650
 Will you listen now we can listen now? 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.190
 the first part very slowly with assistance 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.190
 of the score 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.030
 very well, a detail that we can vote for 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.880
 since the first part is that there is a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.640
 accentuation of rhythmic marking 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.950
 in this song what we can perceive 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.950
 from the progress indication
