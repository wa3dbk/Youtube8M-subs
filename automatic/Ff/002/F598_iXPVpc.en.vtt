our framework lines up with this the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.949 
our framework lines up with this the
first<00:03:47.370> thing<00:03:47.549> we<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:47.820> have<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> top<00:03:48.570> div

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.110 
first thing we do have is a top div
where<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.380> orange<00:03:49.829> line<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.250> going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.880> be

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
where that orange line is going to be

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.569 
where that orange line is going to be
and<00:03:51.390> that's<00:03:52.110> correct<00:03:52.380> that's<00:03:52.799> what<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.010> want<00:03:53.340> to

gonna<00:05:38.100> go<00:05:38.220> ahead<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.490> minimize<00:05:38.640> that<00:05:39.270> and

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
gonna go ahead and minimize that and

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.920 
gonna go ahead and minimize that and
scroll<00:05:40.140> down<00:05:40.200> and<00:05:40.830> in<00:05:41.700> this<00:05:41.880> case<00:05:42.210> we<00:05:42.750> have

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
scroll down and in this case we have

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.680 
scroll down and in this case we have
left<00:05:43.320> nav<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:44.070> we<00:05:44.730> don't<00:05:44.910> actually<00:05:45.090> need<00:05:45.630> that

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
left nav and we don't actually need that

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.660 
left nav and we don't actually need that
because<00:05:46.380> we<00:05:46.680> don't<00:05:46.800> have<00:05:47.070> a<00:05:47.100> left<00:05:47.430> navigation

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
because we don't have a left navigation

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.250 
because we don't have a left navigation
area<00:05:48.390> so<00:05:48.570> I'm<00:05:48.660> going<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:48.870> go<00:05:48.930> ahead<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.170> delete

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
area so I'm going to go ahead and delete

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.550 
area so I'm going to go ahead and delete
that<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.910> we<00:05:51.030> do<00:05:51.180> have<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.510> content<00:05:52.050> area<00:05:52.350> and

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
that and we do have the content area and

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.110 
that and we do have the content area and
again<00:05:53.370> we<00:05:53.490> don't<00:05:53.700> have<00:05:53.850> a<00:05:54.000> right<00:05:54.300> side<00:05:54.630> div

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
again we don't have a right side div

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.470 
again we don't have a right side div
what<00:05:57.120> we<00:05:57.210> do<00:05:57.390> have<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> footer<00:05:58.760> this<00:05:59.760> right<00:06:00.120> side

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
what we do have a footer this right side

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.900
