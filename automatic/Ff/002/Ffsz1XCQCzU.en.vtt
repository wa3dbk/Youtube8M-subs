00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to everything in this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.279
 present you a very nail art 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.960
 graphical and geometric I have 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.820
 chose to achieve in black and white 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.660
 it is not difficult to do it takes 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.660
 just a little bit of patience 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.039
 first of all, I put my Belgian base 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.170
 for their club 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 then I did a french bias with 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
 a white polish then I took my 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.689
 watercolor palette I chose 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.699
 watercolor because I find it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.869
 is easier to master than 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.019
 acrylic 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 I then took a liner brush and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.460
 I drew a very very fine grid 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 hungry so first I made lines 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.420
 like that you see in width so I 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 did not do them well parallel because 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 that precisely I wanted to do a little 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.280
 optical effect you know a little bit like 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 the drawings of illusions that can be seen 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 and then I made lines so in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.750
 length likewise not parallel so who 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.870
 intersect a little bit in the shape of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.270
 diamond and black shaped like 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 Checkers 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 then I took the round brush 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.080
 watercolor black watercolor and I 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 completed the boxes 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 so that's where it's a little bit more 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.510
 long because you have to color everything so 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.340
 in colors the boxes one out of two you 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.200
 can of course faye do this is the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.909
 with varnish or with 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 acrylic paint acrylic paint 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.509
 it's going very well too 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.340
 I just wanted to test watercolor in 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.340
 did to see how that gave 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.070
 then I took a glitter varnish of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.220
 at allen cosmetics and I just 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.520
 does a mini degraded above this 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.350
 french then I took a glittery liner 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.530
 and I have limits and the french 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.530
 manicure 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.970
 and to finish I put a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.190
 rhinestones then the top coat so the top coat 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.130
 when you use the cua it is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.410
 very important to properly bordered the edges 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.900
 So the nail slice all 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.790
 sides so that especially the water falls 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.320
 not by two worries when between 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.120
 you know that watercolor even though she 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.040
 has dried for ten years she will get herself 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.390
 diluted so that's why maybe 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.070
 it's better to do it at the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.230
 clinic to avoid this little 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.820
 inconvenience but otherwise here you are bordered 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 well with your top coat and there is no 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.000
 problem by example and we add 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.340
 every two days in case 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.110
 and then here I hope this tutorial 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.490
 did you like it? Do not hesitate to tell me by 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.800

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.090
 very graphic nail art like this one to 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.090
