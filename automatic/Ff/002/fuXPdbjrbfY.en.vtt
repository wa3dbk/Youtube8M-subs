00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 الشاهد ..شاهده ..صوره ..غيره. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 You are in the pre-filming of the video "Witness" to make a film about advocating a cause. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Before filming, make sure that digital recording is your right choice to spread the truth. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Because there are potential risks you and your friends will face, your friends, and who will appear in your film. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 So assess the risk .. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 The risks that occur when shooting .. Montage .. Show. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 What is video advocacy and support issues? 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Do you have a goal? 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Maybe his plans, or sometimes, I was in the wrong place, but in time I saw something. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 To get the most impact for your film, focus on two things: 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Do you have a clear goal for change? 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And the public can help you achieve it .. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Whether you have a broad audience or a small group. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 When you finish your film, how can you show it to the right audience at the right time? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Timing is everything. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Organize a working day around the world and mobilize the support of the international community to take action online. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Or put your film in front of the judge with the key case. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Or legislator. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 What do you want from your audience? 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Make sure you have a message for your audience .. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Because it helps you directly, ask for concrete action based on your film. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Try to express this through your words and actions. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I stigmatize HIV / AIDS. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 "Release political detainees" 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 "Legislation to prevent pollution" 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 What is the best way to convey your message to your audience? 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 The story you will tell ... 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Pictures you choose .. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And the speakers .. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Your film is a way to communicate your message, so you should focus on: 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 A humane and convincing story .. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 On the basis of a strong personal experience .. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 As well as in time and place specific .. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 And people we care about. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Many advocacy videos contain strong and accurate facts, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And clips to help viewers understand the issues. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 The more successful, the more they become friends with their audience. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Make your viewers affected by a particular issue talk about it instead of telling it on their behalf. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Make sure they express what they want to see differently. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Get your audience to react. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Successful advocacy films are able to mobilize the public to take a reaction. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Make your audience feel: 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Participation, shyness, defense, 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Hope, anger. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Then I give them clear options for what to do next. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Video is only part of your campaign. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Make sure that your film goes hand in hand with other means of crowd and contact. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Such as organizing the public to react, 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Or pressure, writing reports and legal issues. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 In the same context on the Internet, submit your film .. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Provide viewers with ways to react on the Internet or on the ground. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Approve who you will photograph 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Make sure you have written consent from those you register with, 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 This means understanding the risks and benefits of registering with them. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Give them the right to choose to register with you, and tell you if they need to hide their identity. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 You may want to talk to them through the worst possible scenarios, 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Like what can happen when he sees who has suppressed the video. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Now I'm getting ready to shoot your film. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Remember that you do not need many equipment: - 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Mobil, video camera .. 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Or the possibility of recording video with a digital camera. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 But you need to be prepared. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Count your plan. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 What is your story? 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 How will you tell her? 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Where? And when? 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Will you register with whom? Who can help you? 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Remember, place your goal, your message, your audience in mind.
