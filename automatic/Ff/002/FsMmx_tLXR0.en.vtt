00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
corner so I did a little bit of checking

corner so I did a little bit of checking
out<00:01:10.580> online<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:13.479> suggested<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:14.509> maybe

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
out online and and suggested that maybe

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.540 
out online and and suggested that maybe
could<00:01:15.110> be<00:01:15.259> dead<00:01:15.500> pixels<00:01:15.979> or<00:01:16.280> or<00:01:18.009> frozen<00:01:19.009> pixels

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550
