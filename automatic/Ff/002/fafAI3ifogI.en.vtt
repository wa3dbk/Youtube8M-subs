00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 a long time ago I was in Russia baked pheasant 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.840
 considered an exquisite dish worthy 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.210
 became king 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 fashion for breeding pheasants and at home 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.550
 conditions come back and if western 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.250
 countries have already mastered this activity 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.650
 then we are just starting in this business 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.670
 to understand it means an opportunity 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 succeed in this business there 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.130
 let's consider an example of breeding 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.500
 pheasants at home 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.160
 Price for an adult cauldron varies from 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.680
 25 dollars to 35 dollars and to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 no need to grow such a bird 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.829
 more than 5 hyphen 10 dollars phase 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.070
 grow up 150 days after it 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.860
 hatching for birds 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.250
 you will need aviaries that you can 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.699
 build for this you will need 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.040
 the chain-link with size of a cell is from 2,5 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.130
 by 2.5 centimeters and nylon mesh on 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.280
 the roof of the enclosure so that the birds do not scatter 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.220
 count on each pheasant mean 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.299
 square meters aviary fill 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
 birds one week after treatment 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.040
 if your goal 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 breeding pheasants then you will need 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.009
 incubator average female postpones one 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.000
 egg in two days in total female 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.420
 can bring up to 12 pheasant eggs like 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.229
 chickens can spit their eggs so 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.329
 they should be removed immediately after laying 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.810
 the important point is proportions 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.299
 males and females if the most will be more 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.630
 males can trample here 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.000
 and if they will be less than males then 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.060
 one-to-one families are formed 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.790
 to one 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.640
 pheasant females or memory bushes they forget 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.890
 that the egg was demolished and the main thing is where they are 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.430
 done so you have to collect 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.630
 eggs throughout the aviary here exist and 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.880
 The pros female will better ride 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.180
 breeding pheasants at home 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.970
 All eggs are placed in the incubator and only 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.120
 after almost a month goes by 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.030
 the light will appear chicks and here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.400
 begins the most difficult thing in seven 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.110
 newborns will need careful 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.940
 care 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.299
 the first three weeks the temperature should not 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.239
 be below 38 degrees and humidity 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.299
 air not more than 60 percent 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.459
 a little later the temperature needs to be lowered 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.480
 a couple of tenths of a degree 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.180
 and increase the humidity by a couple of dozen 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.209
 young pheasants keeps smaller cages 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.700
 size so that they are not a poet 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.000
 april each other or not drowned in 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.970
 catch them constantly watch them them 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.380
 the diet consists of boiled egg greens and 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.560
 meal worms to adult young pheasant 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.530
 can be released in two months ration 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.470
 adult pheasants are exactly the same as when 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.450
 breeding chickens 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.079
 breeding pheasants and at home 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.700
 a very profitable business you can sell them in 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.390
 hunting farm 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.870
 restaurants and supermarket shops through 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.540
 friends in a restaurant or shop and 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.720
 sell the bird more difficult because 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.450
 imported frozen carcass cheaper in 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.640
 while many avid hunters with 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.340
 great pleasure to shoot at 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.819
 living 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.550
 therefore, hunting 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.440
 hunting purchased with pleasure 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.629
 a bird 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.180
 well why don't you organize your 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.629
 hunting club in addition to lasagna 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.629
