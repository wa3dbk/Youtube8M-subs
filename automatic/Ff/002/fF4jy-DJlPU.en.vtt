00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone we meet for a 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.879
 new little tutorial in the summer i'm going 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.040
 show you how to draw simply 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.170
 and quickly Japanese cherry or 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.900
 sakura in the most used for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.360
 designate 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.580
 I'm going to draw two and the two 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.750
 a rather simplified style, however 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.140
 the first I 'm going to do it on 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.820
 cardboard 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.770
 it allows us to see and test 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.150
 other supports and I find the carton 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.320
 very interesting for the colors 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.420
 clear that stand out very well 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 so I first start with a troll at 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.369
 know that the trunk is not necessarily 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.220
 law 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.410
 a bit like the good zain after having 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.320
 drawn the trunk and the base of the trunk 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 mausoleum I make main branches 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.720
 who leave the trunk its branches rest 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.090
 pretty thick and then I add some 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.670
 secondary branches that they are by 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.769
 against smaller and starts from 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.620
 of our main branches as well of 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.210
 now I'm going to give some 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.580
 volume to trains and branches 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 adding with a black pastel a 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.250
 dark mass on all the parties of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 right of the tree of course if we admit 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.570
 that the light comes from the left by 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.619
 example 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.530
 then I will add colors 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.110
 with polychrome bone or dry pastel 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.170
 I mix a little black edge with 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.390
 beige and then I come with pastel 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.140
 white to mix the end of the beige 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 with white so the left side of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.260
 the tree will be very white unlike 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.610
 right side that are rare 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.470
 it gives us a good relief effect 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.760
 very simple to do now the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.800
 leaves nothing easier 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.040
 I take a tool pastel pink pencil 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.590
 felt paint you have too and I'm going 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.670
 gather a lot of little dots a little 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.920
 around the small branches 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.570
 you can also add small ones 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.760
 orange and black red dots for 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.970
 give more effect to vary the 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.710
 colors and to give a frame effect 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.080
 you can for example make a square 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.790
 black around your drawing and colored 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.960
 outside with a darker color 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.850
 for cardboard for example now we 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 will do the same thing but on 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.190
 paper so I'm doing my trunk but 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.060
 branches and my secondary branches I 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.490
 color the inside in black and I redo 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.220
 pink peas in felt around 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.110
 small branches especially to the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.450
 tips of his branches so towards the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.300
 sizes in general more mass be 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.250
 little more realistic there too, for example 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.590
 add some beige red 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.750
 and I will even add by the Belgian 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.760
 on it but fun and went with my 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.330
 fade my finger to give the tree 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.850
 a kind of aura we can 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.970
 little scented touch that can be 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.010
 nice then you can do that 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.740
 you want to add text from 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.890
 landscape colors in any case I hope 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.000
 that this little tutorial you liked 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.040
 do not hesitate to try at home it's 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.660
 really very simple and for once 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.510
 I started a drawing contest on my 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.040
 chain tutorial art 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.340
 if you're interested you can go 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.319
 visit it and see its duration 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.370
 and on that I say good holidays to you 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.050
