but really I see these characters very

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
but really I see these characters very
often<00:00:23.340> um<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.359> jab<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> same<00:00:24.900> frame

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
often um is there jab the same frame

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.050 
often um is there jab the same frame
data<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.890> tomb<00:00:26.189> links<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.670> faster

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
data or is tomb links a little faster

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.910 
data or is tomb links a little faster
I'd<00:00:27.180> imagine<00:00:27.480> links<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.930> faster<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:28.680> I'm<00:00:28.769> not

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
I'd imagine links is faster if I'm not

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.330 
I'd imagine links is faster if I'm not
sure

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
sure

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.450 
sure
honestly<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.970> no<00:00:30.119> idea<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.769> links<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
honestly I have no idea I think links is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
honestly I have no idea I think links is
probably<00:00:32.669> better<00:00:32.790> overall<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.020> does

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
probably better overall because I does

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.600 
probably better overall because I does
have<00:00:34.410> eat<00:00:34.590> dizzle<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> good<00:00:35.399> money

um<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.579> don't<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.300> falling<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:03.870> was

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
um I don't all that falling up here was

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
um I don't all that falling up here was
something<00:01:04.140> different<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.040> don't<00:01:05.129> think

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
something different but I don't think

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.590 
something different but I don't think
that<00:01:05.519> auto<00:01:05.670> cancels<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> don't<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.540> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that auto cancels so I don't think it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.890 
that auto cancels so I don't think it
was<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> sacred<00:01:06.869> why<00:01:07.880> was<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.909> boring<00:01:09.570> came

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like Tim wins his head to head match

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
like Tim wins his head to head match
because<00:01:22.049> he<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.290> jump<00:01:22.560> he<00:01:22.710> has<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.070> movement

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
because he can jump he has the movement

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
because uh if you look at toolings frame

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.340 
because uh if you look at toolings frame
data<00:03:21.180> assuming<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.750> same<00:03:21.930> as<00:03:22.049> brawls

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
data assuming it's the same as brawls

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.380 
data assuming it's the same as brawls
it's<00:03:22.530> not<00:03:23.070> actually<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.640> good<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:24.269> he's

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.020 
it's not actually that good because he's
like<00:03:24.709> cuz<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:25.830> brawl<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.070> believe<00:03:26.370> his<00:03:26.489> jab<00:03:26.880> was

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
like cuz I'm brawl I believe his jab was

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.240 
like cuz I'm brawl I believe his jab was
framed<00:03:27.299> six<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:27.959> that's<00:03:28.890> pretty<00:03:29.100> slow

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
framed six so that's pretty slow

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.380 
framed six so that's pretty slow
compared<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.640> standard<00:03:29.820> frame<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.299> her

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
compared to the standard frame to her

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.560 
compared to the standard frame to her
frame<00:03:30.630> three<00:03:30.870> jab<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.380> Mario<00:03:31.850> five<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.360> these

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
frame three jab and Mario five and these

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.270 
frame three jab and Mario five and these
outside<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.019> mean<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.620> think<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.860> think<00:03:35.190> what

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
outside I mean you think I think what

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.440 
outside I mean you think I think what
Marvel<00:03:35.610> it's<00:03:35.700> going<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.880> get<00:03:35.970> part<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.239> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
Marvel it's going to get part of the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.210 
Marvel it's going to get part of the
advantage<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.440> metric<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.070> like

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
advantage of this metric is just like

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.150 
advantage of this metric is just like
tune<00:03:39.030> links<00:03:39.239> wait<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.959> yes<00:03:40.260> because<00:03:40.500> Mario<00:03:41.100> is

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
tune links wait and yes because Mario is

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.460 
tune links wait and yes because Mario is
