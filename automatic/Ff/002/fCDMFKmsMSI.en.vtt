00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hello and welcome to this demonstration

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.760 
hello and welcome to this demonstration
on<00:00:03.629> how<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:04.250> make<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.279> melody<00:00:06.029> using<00:00:06.990> natural

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
on how to make a melody using natural

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.000 
on how to make a melody using natural
harmonics<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.700> bass<00:00:09.360> guitar<00:00:09.710> now<00:00:10.710> I'm<00:00:10.800> going

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
harmonics on bass guitar now I'm going

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.950 
harmonics on bass guitar now I'm going
to<00:00:11.130> keep<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.519> quite<00:00:12.030> simple<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:12.690> going<00:00:12.900> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to keep this quite simple I'm going to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.990 
to keep this quite simple I'm going to
play<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> harmonics<00:00:13.799> only<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.730> position

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
play the harmonics only in one position

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.599 
play the harmonics only in one position
and<00:00:15.540> I'll<00:00:16.230> show<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> how<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.460> then

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
and I'll show you how that is and then

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.760 
and I'll show you how that is and then
I'll<00:00:17.730> explain<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.330> bit<00:00:18.690> more<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
I'll explain a little bit more so the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.529 
I'll explain a little bit more so the
one<00:00:19.949> position<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.699> putting<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> little

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
one position is putting the little

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.050 
one position is putting the little
finger<00:00:21.960> over<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.320> 5th<00:00:22.590> fret<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.670> barely

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
finger over the 5th fret just barely

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.870 
finger over the 5th fret just barely
touching<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.779> string<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:26.279> case<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.699> g

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
touching the string in this case the g

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.820 
touching the string in this case the g
string<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.390> then<00:00:27.810> I'll<00:00:27.960> pluck<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> quite

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
string and then I'll pluck it quite

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.099 
string and then I'll pluck it quite
firmly<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.699> right<00:00:30.060> hand<00:00:30.300> finger<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
firmly with my right hand finger and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.590 
firmly with my right hand finger and
then<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.219> let<00:00:32.430> go<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
then I can let go and you can see the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.350 
then I can let go and you can see the
harmonic<00:00:34.110> rings<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.649> quite<00:00:34.980> strongly<00:00:35.430> so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
harmonic rings out quite strongly so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
harmonic rings out quite strongly so
that's<00:00:36.510> over<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> 5th<00:00:37.079> fret<00:00:37.230> now<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> next

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that's over the 5th fret now the next

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.690 
that's over the 5th fret now the next
one<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.980> just<00:00:40.980> back<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
one I'm going to use is just back of the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.790 
one I'm going to use is just back of the
4th<00:00:42.000> fret<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.540> maybe<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.410> top<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
4th fret so maybe not right on top of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.930 
4th fret so maybe not right on top of
just<00:00:43.920> back<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.460> bit

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.750 

you<00:00:47.210> get<00:00:47.359> that<00:00:47.480> harmonic<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.320> then<00:00:49.160> finally

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
you get that harmonic and then finally

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.090 
you get that harmonic and then finally
just<00:00:49.789> in<00:00:50.359> front<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.079> third<00:00:51.320> fret<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:51.860> not

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
just in front of the third fret so not

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.279 
just in front of the third fret so not
on<00:00:52.250> top<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:52.879> is<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.149> fret<00:00:53.360> wire<00:00:53.390> I'm<00:00:53.899> talking

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
on top this is the fret wire I'm talking

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.560 
on top this is the fret wire I'm talking
about<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.280> not<00:00:55.430> quite<00:00:55.579> on<00:00:55.850> top<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.329> bit<00:00:56.480> in

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
about so not quite on top just a bit in

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.069 
about so not quite on top just a bit in
front<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:58.280> get<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.449> what<00:00:59.659> we<00:00:59.690> have

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
front and you get that so what we have

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.439 
front and you get that so what we have
if<00:01:00.469> I<00:01:00.620> play<00:01:00.829> those<00:01:01.070> three<00:01:01.339> consecutively<00:01:02.089> on

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
if I play those three consecutively on

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.100 
if I play those three consecutively on
the<00:01:02.659> g<00:01:02.870> string<00:01:02.899> I<00:01:03.350> have<00:01:03.530> these<00:01:03.890> notes<00:01:08.049> do<00:01:09.049> you

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
the g string I have these notes do you

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.899 
the g string I have these notes do you
recognize<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.770> sound<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.280> actually<00:01:10.729> a

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
recognize the sound it's actually a

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.170 
recognize the sound it's actually a
major<00:01:11.570> triad<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.430> G<00:01:13.759> major<00:01:14.000> triad

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
major triad and this is a G major triad

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.080 
major triad and this is a G major triad
on<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.869> g<00:01:15.200> string<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.100> if<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.369> transfer<00:01:16.940> the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
on the g string now if I transfer the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.710 
on the g string now if I transfer the
same<00:01:17.299> thing<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.950> D<00:01:19.850> string<00:01:19.909> I'm<00:01:20.390> going<00:01:20.630> to

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
same thing to the D string I'm going to

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.249 
same thing to the D string I'm going to
get<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.869> D<00:01:21.050> major<00:01:21.289> triad<00:01:21.670> using<00:01:22.670> frets<00:01:23.450> five

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
get a D major triad using frets five

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.850 
get a D major triad using frets five
four<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.190> three<00:01:28.149> D<00:01:29.149> F<00:01:29.330> sharp<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.810> on<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.830> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
four and three D F sharp a on the a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.719 
four and three D F sharp a on the a
string<00:01:30.979> it's<00:01:31.429> going<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.670> be<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.819> C<00:01:32.000> sharp<00:01:32.659> E

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.929 

now<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:38.020> became<00:01:38.530> not<00:01:38.890> quite<00:01:39.219> so<00:01:39.460> strong<00:01:39.759> so

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
now that became not quite so strong so

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.490 
now that became not quite so strong so
I'm<00:01:40.000> gonna<00:01:40.119> have<00:01:40.299> to<00:01:40.360> push<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.990> finger

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
I'm gonna have to push the finger

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.429 
I'm gonna have to push the finger
forward<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:42.009> tiny<00:01:42.280> bit<00:01:42.960> maybe<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:44.079> little<00:01:44.320> bit

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
forward a tiny bit maybe a little bit

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.249 
forward a tiny bit maybe a little bit
stronger<00:01:44.770> there<00:01:45.070> okay<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.750> same<00:01:46.899> pattern

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
stronger there okay and the same pattern

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.630 
stronger there okay and the same pattern
goes<00:01:47.409> for<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.649> e-string<00:01:47.829> it'll<00:01:48.340> be<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.610> E

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
goes for the e-string it'll be the E

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.289 
goes for the e-string it'll be the E
major<00:01:49.030> triad<00:01:49.360> which<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.960> e<00:01:50.200> G<00:01:50.530> sharp<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:51.130> B

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.179 

so<00:01:55.960> see<00:01:56.170> once<00:01:56.409> you've<00:01:56.560> generated<00:01:56.710> the

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
so see once you've generated the

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.279 
so see once you've generated the
harmonic<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> ring<00:01:58.390> for<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.200> long<00:01:59.439> long<00:01:59.679> time

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
harmonic is a ring for a long long time

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.440 
harmonic is a ring for a long long time
okay<00:02:02.289> I'm<00:02:02.500> not<00:02:02.710> going<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.100> use<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> string

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
okay I'm not going to use the a string

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.700 
okay I'm not going to use the a string
at<00:02:04.570> all<00:02:04.719> for<00:02:04.899> this<00:02:04.960> melody<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.560> I'm

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
at all for this melody that I'm

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.709 
at all for this melody that I'm
constructing<00:02:06.340> I'm<00:02:06.460> just<00:02:06.670> going<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:07.030> use<00:02:07.299> the

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
constructing I'm just going to use the

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.949 
constructing I'm just going to use the
Triads<00:02:08.379> from<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.300> from<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.450> top<00:02:10.690> three

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
Triads from the from the top three

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.220 
Triads from the from the top three
strings<00:02:11.290> from<00:02:11.379> the<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.670> D<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:13.060> g<00:02:13.569> strings<00:02:13.599> and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
strings from the a D and g strings and

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.699 
strings from the a D and g strings and
I'm<00:02:14.920> going<00:02:15.129> to<00:02:15.220> play<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.730> little<00:02:16.120> melody<00:02:16.720> based

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
I'm going to play a little melody based

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.820 
I'm going to play a little melody based
on<00:02:18.040> those<00:02:18.940> triad<00:02:19.629> so<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.989> chord<00:02:20.230> sequence<00:02:20.709> is

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
on those triad so the chord sequence is

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.930 
on those triad so the chord sequence is
going<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.129> be<00:02:21.220> essentially<00:02:22.140> four<00:02:23.140> bars<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.769> a<00:02:24.250> D

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
going to be essentially four bars of a D

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.199 
going to be essentially four bars of a D
and<00:02:25.360> nine<00:02:26.260> chord<00:02:26.739> so<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.220> chord<00:02:27.519> notes<00:02:27.970> would

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
and nine chord so the chord notes would

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.050 
and nine chord so the chord notes would
be<00:02:28.269> D<00:02:29.260> F<00:02:29.560> sharp<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.370> an<00:02:30.519> e<00:02:30.700> because<00:02:30.970> I'm

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
be D F sharp a and an e because I'm

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.330 
be D F sharp a and an e because I'm
going<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.299> put<00:02:31.420> an<00:02:31.510> e<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> melody<00:02:32.340> then

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
going to put an e in the melody then

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.850 
going to put an e in the melody then
four<00:02:33.670> bars<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.360> G<00:02:34.569> at<00:02:34.810> nine<00:02:34.989> chord<00:02:35.380> which<00:02:35.650> is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
four bars of a G at nine chord which is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.940 
four bars of a G at nine chord which is
G<00:02:37.200> B<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.560> D<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.640> also<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:41.440> ninth<00:02:41.680> in<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
G B and D and also in the ninth in the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.789 
G B and D and also in the ninth in the
melody<00:02:42.310> which<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.640> an<00:02:42.760> eighth<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:44.560> I'm

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
melody which is an eighth and then I'm

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.309 
melody which is an eighth and then I'm
going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.220> play<00:02:45.640> go<00:02:46.030> back<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> D<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.989> then

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
going to play go back to the D and then

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.110 
going to play go back to the D and then
for<00:02:47.860> another<00:02:47.920> four<00:02:48.280> bars<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.910> then<00:02:49.000> I'll

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
for another four bars and then I'll

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.690 
for another four bars and then I'll
alternate<00:02:49.599> between<00:02:49.720> D<00:02:50.230> g<00:02:50.950> DG<00:02:51.849> d<00:02:52.660> ad<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.489> that's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
alternate between D g DG d ad so that's

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.199 
alternate between D g DG d ad so that's
the<00:02:54.819> last<00:02:55.030> four<00:02:55.329> bars<00:02:55.510> half<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.170> bar<00:02:56.349> H<00:02:56.530> DG<00:02:57.040> DG<00:02:57.489> D

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
the last four bars half a bar H DG DG D

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.960 
the last four bars half a bar H DG DG D
a<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.810> D<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.069> that's<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.370> court<00:03:00.609> so<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.850> can

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
a and D so that's the court so it can

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.539 
a and D so that's the court so it can
still<00:03:01.239> matter<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.750> much<00:03:01.780> right<00:03:02.230> now<00:03:02.519> by<00:03:03.519> the

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
still matter so much right now by the

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.590 
still matter so much right now by the
way<00:03:03.730> if<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.480> want<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.930> find<00:03:05.230> out<00:03:05.410> exactly<00:03:05.560> how

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
way if you want to find out exactly how

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.879 
way if you want to find out exactly how
harmonics<00:03:07.600> are<00:03:07.780> generated<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.440> where<00:03:08.709> they

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
harmonics are generated and where they

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.590 
harmonics are generated and where they
are<00:03:09.100> over<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.519> entire<00:03:09.790> fretboard<00:03:10.389> of<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
are over the entire fretboard of the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.039 
are over the entire fretboard of the
bass<00:03:10.810> there<00:03:11.680> are<00:03:11.799> some<00:03:11.980> pretty<00:03:12.310> good<00:03:13.049> YouTube

little<00:03:39.579> band<00:03:40.329> in<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.569> box<00:03:40.780> track<00:03:41.139> with<00:03:41.380> those

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
little band in a box track with those

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.280 
little band in a box track with those
chords<00:03:42.250> I'll<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.579> bring<00:03:42.849> them<00:03:43.239> up<00:03:43.419> and<00:03:43.660> I'm

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
chords I'll just bring them up and I'm

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.470 
chords I'll just bring them up and I'm
going<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.650> play<00:03:44.829> this<00:03:45.160> melody<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.030> couple<00:03:46.389> of

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
going to play this melody a couple of

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.170 
going to play this melody a couple of
times<00:03:46.750> over<00:03:47.079> that<00:03:48.010> chord<00:03:48.579> sequence<00:03:49.090> just

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
times over that chord sequence just

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.849 
times over that chord sequence just
bring<00:03:49.419> up<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.690> chords<00:03:50.049> now<00:03:52.440> hit<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.650> play

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
bring up the chords now hit the play

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:46.950 
bring up the chords now hit the play
button<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:55.260> off<00:03:56.260> we<00:03:56.470> go

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:05:35.900 

I<00:04:47.020> think<00:04:47.650> again

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.730 

okay<00:05:36.930> so<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.050> was<00:05:38.170> twice<00:05:38.410> through

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
okay so that was twice through

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.590 
okay so that was twice through
essentially<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.280> same<00:05:39.520> melody<00:05:39.910> so<00:05:40.150> all<00:05:40.330> I<00:05:40.360> did

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
essentially the same melody so all I did

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.780 
essentially the same melody so all I did
on<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.050> D<00:05:41.230> major<00:05:41.530> chord<00:05:41.770> I<00:05:42.220> played<00:05:42.520> these

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
on the D major chord I played these

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.210 
on the D major chord I played these
notes<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:44.050> note<00:05:44.260> I'm<00:05:44.530> starting<00:05:44.950> with<00:05:45.040> is

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
notes the note I'm starting with is

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.130 
notes the note I'm starting with is
actually<00:05:45.610> an<00:05:45.730> a<00:05:45.880> on<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.270> string<00:05:46.390> remember<00:05:47.080> I

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
actually an a on the a string remember I

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.450 
actually an a on the a string remember I
went<00:05:47.320> through<00:05:47.500> that<00:05:47.620> in<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.830> beginning<00:05:48.220> this

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
went through that in the beginning this

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.940 
went through that in the beginning this
is<00:05:48.520> AC<00:05:48.850> sharp<00:05:49.150> e<00:05:49.690> here<00:05:50.250> but<00:05:51.250> I<00:05:51.340> sweat<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.730> II<00:05:52.950> then

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
is AC sharp e here but I sweat a II then

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.520 
is AC sharp e here but I sweat a II then
D<00:05:54.280> F<00:05:54.520> sharp<00:05:54.820> so<00:05:55.570> that's<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.900> basic<00:05:56.260> melody<00:05:58.530> so

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
D F sharp so that's the basic melody so

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.500 
D F sharp so that's the basic melody so
it<00:05:59.650> ends<00:05:59.950> on<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.220> third<00:06:00.550> of<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:00.970> D<00:06:01.150> major

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
it ends on the third of the D major

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:09.060 
it ends on the third of the D major
chord<00:06:01.720> it<00:06:02.080> ends<00:06:02.320> on<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.560> F<00:06:02.680> sharp<00:06:03.660> and<00:06:04.860> then<00:06:08.070> so

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
chord it ends on the F sharp and then so

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.680 
chord it ends on the F sharp and then so
just<00:06:09.280> went<00:06:09.430> across<00:06:09.520> from<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:12.430> D<00:06:13.030> to<00:06:13.540> the<00:06:13.660> a

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
just went across from the D to the a

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.170 
just went across from the D to the a
then<00:06:14.140> and<00:06:14.320> then<00:06:14.980> repeated<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.520> first<00:06:15.700> section

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
then and then repeated the first section

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:25.160 
then and then repeated the first section
so<00:06:16.390> I'll<00:06:16.660> just<00:06:16.810> go<00:06:17.200> through<00:06:17.230> that<00:06:17.440> slowly<00:06:17.860> and

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.010 

then<00:06:26.170> this<00:06:26.290> one<00:06:26.530> and<00:06:27.630> then<00:06:28.630> I'll<00:06:28.750> do<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:28.990> same

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
then this one and then I'll do the same

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:39.559 
then this one and then I'll do the same
sequence<00:06:29.650> on<00:06:29.800> the<00:06:29.890> next<00:06:30.130> two<00:06:30.280> strings

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:07:03.260 

just<00:06:40.569> in<00:06:40.689> front<00:06:40.869> of<00:06:40.959> that<00:06:41.079> third<00:06:41.319> for<00:06:41.559> it

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:09.179 

so<00:07:04.270> for<00:07:04.479> their<00:07:04.629> dgdg<00:07:06.809> so<00:07:07.809> this<00:07:07.989> is<00:07:08.139> D<00:07:08.679> F<00:07:09.129> sharp

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:09.189 
so for their dgdg so this is D F sharp

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:14.489 
so for their dgdg so this is D F sharp
harmonics<00:07:10.149> D<00:07:10.389> F<00:07:10.689> sharp<00:07:11.139> G<00:07:11.909> D<00:07:12.909> F<00:07:13.569> sharp<00:07:13.899> G<00:07:13.989> and

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:14.499 
harmonics D F sharp G D F sharp G and

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:21.209 
harmonics D F sharp G D F sharp G and
the<00:07:14.739> next<00:07:15.009> chord<00:07:15.219> is<00:07:15.339> d<00:07:15.639> ad<00:07:19.619> that's<00:07:20.619> a<00:07:20.769> sequence

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:21.219 
the next chord is d ad that's a sequence

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.189 
the next chord is d ad that's a sequence
try<00:07:21.879> it<00:07:21.939> out<00:07:22.089> for<00:07:22.269> yourself<00:07:22.599> of<00:07:22.749> course<00:07:22.959> if<00:07:23.110> you

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
try it out for yourself of course if you

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.079 
try it out for yourself of course if you
don't<00:07:23.289> have<00:07:23.409> a<00:07:23.499> backing<00:07:23.919> track<00:07:23.949> then<00:07:24.489> you<00:07:24.939> can

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:25.089 
don't have a backing track then you can

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:26.729 
don't have a backing track then you can
actually<00:07:25.300> just<00:07:25.659> throw<00:07:25.899> in<00:07:26.050> the<00:07:26.139> root<00:07:26.319> note<00:07:26.589> so

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:26.739 
actually just throw in the root note so

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:28.409 
actually just throw in the root note so
I've<00:07:26.800> got<00:07:26.979> the<00:07:27.099> E<00:07:27.129> string<00:07:27.550> still<00:07:27.879> free<00:07:28.119> to<00:07:28.269> do

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:28.419 
I've got the E string still free to do

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:33.230 
I've got the E string still free to do
that<00:07:28.449> so<00:07:28.779> I<00:07:28.809> could<00:07:28.899> go<00:07:29.139> like<00:07:29.379> this

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.939 

so<00:07:33.539> just<00:07:33.720> got<00:07:33.870> the<00:07:33.990> the<00:07:34.259> root<00:07:34.410> note<00:07:34.620> of<00:07:34.710> the<00:07:34.800> D

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:34.949 
so just got the the root note of the D

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:36.379 
so just got the the root note of the D
chord<00:07:35.280> and<00:07:35.490> the<00:07:35.550> same<00:07:35.789> thing<00:07:36.060> on<00:07:36.210> the<00:07:36.360> next

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
chord and the same thing on the next

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:41.839 
chord and the same thing on the next
chord<00:07:36.930> on<00:07:37.080> the<00:07:37.110> G<00:07:40.100> play<00:07:41.100> the<00:07:41.220> G<00:07:41.430> they're<00:07:41.669> all

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:41.849 
chord on the G play the G they're all

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:48.379 
chord on the G play the G they're all
down<00:07:42.060> there<00:07:45.740> that's<00:07:46.740> all<00:07:46.979> there<00:07:47.130> is<00:07:47.280> to<00:07:47.520> it<00:07:47.699> so

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:48.389 
down there that's all there is to it so

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:51.050 
down there that's all there is to it so
