HD capturing device and that's because

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.770 
HD capturing device and that's because
the<00:01:47.300> ps4<00:01:47.780> doesn't<00:01:48.440> support<00:01:49.210> composite<00:01:50.210> or<00:01:50.390> no

the ps4 doesn't support composite or no

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.110 
the ps4 doesn't support composite or no
component<00:01:51.380> component<00:01:51.890> cables<00:01:52.490> they<00:01:52.760> only

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
component component cables they only

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.440 
component component cables they only
have<00:01:53.570> hdmi<00:01:54.290> i'm<00:01:54.440> pretty<00:01:54.680> sure<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.460> only

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
have hdmi i'm pretty sure so the only

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.230 
have hdmi i'm pretty sure so the only
thing<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:56.960> can<00:01:57.440> record<00:01:57.830> with<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.400> the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
thing that you can record with it is the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.230 
thing that you can record with it is the
elgato<00:01:59.930> i'm<00:02:00.410> pretty<00:02:00.980> sure<00:02:01.130> there's<00:02:01.670> i'm<00:02:02.060> not

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
elgato i'm pretty sure there's i'm not

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.380 
elgato i'm pretty sure there's i'm not
sure<00:02:02.510> there<00:02:02.990> are<00:02:03.230> other<00:02:03.940> capturing<00:02:04.940> devices

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
sure there are other capturing devices

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.520 
sure there are other capturing devices
that<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:06.170> hdmi<00:02:07.040> capabilities<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.660> that's

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
that have hdmi capabilities but that's

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.960 
that have hdmi capabilities but that's
probably<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.979> main<00:02:10.160> reason<00:02:10.519> why<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> lot<00:02:10.910> of

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
probably a main reason why a lot of

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.930 
probably a main reason why a lot of
