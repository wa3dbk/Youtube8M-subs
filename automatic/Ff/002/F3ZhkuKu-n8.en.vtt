00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello with you tie already 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.680
 months have passed since the release of macbook 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.570
 12 or 2015 as it is also called read 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 opinion reviews on the internet have a feeling 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 that people do not fully understand what 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.059
 he has a peculiarity of this macbook 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 many unique properties which are now 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.390
 tell let's go thank you guys from 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 Media Mark for allowing this to be removed 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.020
 video in the battle zone apple for me is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.060
 my fundamental was very important 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 the belief is that the main feature 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.140
 this macbook is its difference from 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.140
 of all that the company did before 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 was retina 15 then 13 changed years 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.340
 but the pros and cons of these computers and so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.809
 clear case with macbook 12 until you 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.579
 keep it in your hands until you 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 look at its screen while you are not 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.660
 press the button and no trackpad 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.239
 impressions about this product do not add up 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.340
 It turns out I highlight 5 key differences 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.379
 from all that the company has done before 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.000
 and let's take a look at them first place 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.649
 What can you rate in the store? 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.320
 not available through photo-video materials 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.090
 friends' stories understand this exactly understand 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.680
 dimensions macbook it weighs only 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.750
 nine hundred and twenty grams as well 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.059
 can compare it with air 11 which 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.979
 weighs a kilogram 80 more recently we 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 called him weightless and today he 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.150
 it seems just critically heavy just 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.380
 hold them like this in the hands of his pancake 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.450
 my hand is already tired and I can't 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.979
 endure this thing nine hundred 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 twenty grams is ultraportable 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 device is the second feature of macbook 12 is 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 see on the screen yes we have seen similar 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.970
 lie on 1513 now I am a nerd again 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.080
 to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.479
 but before that in ultra portable 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.790
 segment, the company used tn + film 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.549
 the matrices are exactly like these stand at 11 inches and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 13 inch MacBooks in my opinion 2015 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.210
 it is already rather weak 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.340
 and one look enough at this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.500
 very screen and you never have anything else 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 don't want no need to run the screensaver i 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.799
 I mean it's really important 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.880
 for morning portable laptop for 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.920
 which you will spend a lot 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.869
 time to work the screen is key 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.939
 feature who would not say anything 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.740
 core i7 processor not powerful graphics not 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.140
 need to play on a laptop need with 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.509
 comfortably absorb information and nothing 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.119
 another like this screen you are so comfortable 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.549
 I will not give this to me 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.020
 speech for today at number three macbooks 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.450
 hiding a completely new keyboard 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.369
 which is built on butterfly technology 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.799
 very romantic name fell out at all 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.259
 inventors for this part at the expense of another 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.239
 Key entry she has two features in 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.000
 first it is actually the very small move of these 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.320
 keys 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.760
 can't initially refuses to believe 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.710
 what did you press the key 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.630
 the impression that she was stuck and second 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.940
 moment due to the fact that the whole key 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 pressed evenly in any part of where 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.860
 you would not click she does not warp 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.420
 as it was on the old keys is not so 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.910
 neat maybe old know they 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.740
 so swing do not create solidity here 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.240
 here the keyboard is similar to that of 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.130
 do not break 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.640
 it will work but the most important thing is all 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.140
 lyrics 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.209
 the fact that it is not really convenient 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.220
 typing is hard to understand but enough 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.840
 several times to type some text 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 just a couple of lines walk write 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.370
 hi with you 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.840
 vilsakom and that's enough for that 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.700
 To understand how this keyboard 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.989
 really innovative as far as 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.970
 quickly it allows you to type text 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.760
 thus saving the minutes which 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.050
 fold into watches and legendary 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.150
 makbuk productivity in this and 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.470
 lies he saves your time not 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.180
 need to steam over many things 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.370
 who have to deal with others 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.989
 computers and this is what we 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.600
 love this place we need you 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.940
 make a stop and i want to between 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.340
 everything was clear to me I have no task 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.989
 I’m not advertising it to sell you a macbook 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.120
 but I have a heightened feeling 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.670
 justice like any person who 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.440
 shoving a chip somewhere behind the wall 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.060
 that this is a really cool product and 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.260
 he was online in runet even in 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.330
 more misunderstood 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.910
 because everybody thinks it's expensive 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.500
 netbooks are exceptionally wrong and here 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.150
 holding it in your arms just coming 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 having looked as he consists on a table 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.680
 touching it materials gold color 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.690
 for the first time you understand 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.760
 how unique is this product 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.500
 I want to bring just touch to 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.989
 you had your own opinion you could 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.030
 say this is a bad macbook because then 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.440
 then you saw it yourself 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.480
 touched you know what he's like 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.850
 I present and I assure you that as 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.900
 only you will take his desire 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.379
 say that it is garbage over price you 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.540
 and what's what's the name disappear 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.220
 number four is a trackpad with technology 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.230
 force touch it is already available at all 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.599
 other macbooks but we can say that 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.280
 first appeared exactly in macbook 12 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.810
 here he was presented in what his 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.790
 key feature first he too 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.289
 built on a different technology here 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.120
 Now the magnet that works 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.280
 there is actually no feedback 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.050
 mechanical parts, and before that you 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.419
 did 3 finger gesture now you can 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.100
 do one just for a long time without pressing a 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.550
 It is strongly holding this 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.830
 trackpad 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.690
 look clicking on twitter much they don’t 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.400
 pops up wikipedia articles which 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.169
 tells what twitter 5 is 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.180
 a key feature i would call core m 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.919
 processor and passive cooling macbook 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.139
 made entirely of aluminum from her even 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.000
 aluminum hinge due to this 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.729
 passive cooling allows it to be 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.919
 super quiet, he does not get hot can be a 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.300
 ipad under some serious game 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.280
 that is, there is no such that it can not 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.260
 hold in my hands and it seems to me a victory 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.030
 company engineers if someone does not know 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.009
 the motherboard probably takes 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.009
 percent 10 of the total area of ​​the computer 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.830
 the rest of the place is a battery 9 hours from 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.919
 a single charge is awesome up to 1 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.410
 battered psy and portal that everyone was joking 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.210
 I give including but this philosophy 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.949
 computer in the morning charged all day 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.080
 go in the evening brought on exercises and 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.180
 use at home can be big 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.110
 monitor please and often me 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.169
 asked what is not with 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.849
 performance that he has with 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.889
 opportunity graphics because well 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.860
 the feeling that the Crimea is something very 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.960
 mobile and that will not pull os 10 into her 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.789
 pure form is actually nothing 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.250
 no lag no less control some 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.110
 we even ran all the games ourselves 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.849
 good and you need to understand what it is 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.650
 the computer is certainly not for gaming 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.120
 daily work for everyday 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.340
 tasks for those who appreciate ultra 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.080
 portability in general it has its 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.970
 features precisely in terms of 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.280
 positioning is far from all 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.870
 but on the other hand the one who understands 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.789
 what his strengths will be 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.409
 one hundred percent satisfied like this 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.810
 maybe it sounds a bit like an ad 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.650
 slogan but i really admire from 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.099
 this computer 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.240
 It seems to me that this is what is today 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.190
 is the apple company 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.180
 good sense of the word if you 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.909
 understand what I mean 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.680
 this is really a piece of art here we are 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.120
 discussed 5 key features of the new 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.350
 MacBook is first of all his 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.360
 dimensions and weight of fabric 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.730
 fry on the screen of course new 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.130
 core m keyboard and trackpad 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.960
 processor and generally passive cooling 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.880
 You can also say the color for the first time macbook 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.800
 Available in three colors 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.960
 golden space gray and silver 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.940
 classic and all this how would it 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.830
 funny did not sound need to look 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.750
 with your own eyes and touch it yourself 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.670
 to make a full impression about 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.350
 this product it is certainly not without 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.600
 flaws someone say that bark them 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.970
 the processor is rather a minus than a plus i am not 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.580
 I agree that this laptop seems to me 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.220
 gone as a kind of whole device and everything 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.440
 its features all components are connected 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.510
 with each other without one there would be 2 and 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.880
 so on in general this is what is in it 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.900
 good and frankly bad 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.850
 frankly cool

 the idea that this is a computer that is strong
