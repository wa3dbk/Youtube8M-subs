00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 I'll show you how to do that today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.940
 hottest hamburger in the world 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.309
 that's totally simple you need it 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.800
 gema just the right ingredients has an 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.210
 kitchen and you will never be back afterwards 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.430
 so rambo is a must at 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.250
 First I have my ingredients 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.949
 need a slice cheese roll we 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.939
 Need a petit and of course 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.660
 complain we come first to 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.189
 hamburger rolls 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 i used it for possibility and that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 is almost always when I see her 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.239
 get milk or quark rolls directly 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.520
 from the baker and not these seeds anymore 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 or normal bands packaged this too 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
 Buy there will be easy 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.010
 cut open and afterwards we asked 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.930
 the more beautiful 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 so now I have here pointing to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.539
 meat and what you see here 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.520
 is now traversed by the cross 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.609
 meat grinder has really nice 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.340
 you see for fat company completely 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.530
 normal beef mince once it 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.180
 is from the rind here you can see again 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.880
 really nice difference from 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.189
 fat content and the whole is now 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.460
 nice kneaded that I the two 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.430
 It was nice to connect that was one 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 have homogeneous minced meat 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.049
 In addition, as much air as possible 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.310
 out of the market 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.140
 because if we have too much air in it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.590
 then we have chopped meat afterwards 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.700
 the problem that we have the lot 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 it does not break that he is beautiful 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 it does not bring even now 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.509
 like a meatball that's airy 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.869
 should be but the beautiful should be 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.689
 I'll be a partie in front of me 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.070
 it does not work that way by hand 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.880
 good you can also with the help of 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.110
 make fresh bags or similar 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.340
 that may work a bit 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.290
 better but then you always have 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.840
 again garbage you have to throw away 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.030
 so here's the hand that is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.340
 relatively expensive the lot must 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.799
 be as evenly thick as possible 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.739
 and should not be on the side either 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.780
 somehow so scary have 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.400
 both then do not bring a fan 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.489
 so nice and there is a lot of juice 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.209
 out and how you see it here 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.319
 do not last that well and evenly 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.530
 now I do it all with one 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.930
 petitesse one of the few 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.940
 Kitchen utensils that I measure except 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.769
 us so quick then the meat 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.900
 just a little bit cried then nice 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.829
 ever in the petit in the lot 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.160
 press in and, if possible, press it 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.870
 a lot of pressure squeezed and then 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.560
 we have a uniform beautiful 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.739
 firm petty and that brings to anna 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 The flag is really nice and even 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.079
 does not deform in the world 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.299
 I do not do my hamburger at home 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.950
 in everyday life in a teflon pan the me 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.220
 Preheated here already 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.810
 that we is beautiful enforced makes 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.209
 something always on level 7 at a 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.569
 Induction field therefore 9 plus one power 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.299
 stage as a comparison for you and then 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.209
 the bacon and the part will be without fat 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.459
 seared for the meat as you are here 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.160
 nice she owns enough fat and herself 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.620
 that is also very important because fat is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.940
 a flavor carrier 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.060
 and that's exactly why I have 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.410
 also ordered the minced meat extra or 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.989
 let extra 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.880
 because normal minced meat has a lot 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.410
 too little fat than that of the citizens 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.669
 has really good tastes like 20 to 30 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.599
 the fat should be percent fat 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.790
 occupy 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.019
 because it usually takes me neck 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.430
 this is always the case with the butcher 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.799
 somehow not that's why I have that 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.280
 then done this time 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.139
 The portion is salted lightly and you 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.380
 looks as far as that on the edge 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.329
 gray high so far he is then 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.230
 I also like her almost all over 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.880
 favorite medium 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.919
 That's why I buy fresh food 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.530
 You can then easily eat minced meat 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:06.130
 eat without hesitation and here in this 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.720
 all fed now is the citizen 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.799
 fried bread 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.140
 because we want to be really nice afterwards 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.090
 So pave soft inside he should have 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.820
 white to the outside but be crispy 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.229
 and should not crumble, therefore 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.849
 namely the milk most of all 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.700
 or quark rolls that are 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.380
 totally cool are really nice 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.960
 delicious the crumbs content not too 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.280
 not if I do not fry them on yes 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.979
 beautiful draw through the field is quite 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.780
 important for the taste 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.270
 that works well with the finished 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.740
 Bands you can buy then 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.300
 They do not crumble if you only 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.760
 the toaster tackles puzzeln the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.469
 shut up I have the cheese now 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.849
 ever on the banner packed the 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:50.320
 bacon comes out now is already nice 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:52.419
 crispy and the track is only short of 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.219
 all sides seared and because of the 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.050
 Cheese here as extremely like the 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.729
 Teflon pan because that would be in one 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.849
 cast iron does not work now 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.469
 I also roast the cheese with that of the 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.110
 really nice that melts it now 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.479
 no melt cheese but somehow 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.370
 which one likes to keep it is tilsiter 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.580
 his gang or the country he be 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.020
 raclette cheese it's totally great so ever 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.659
 after what he likes, ideally 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.280
 in spicy cheese and by the 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.919
 Teflon coating he does not stop 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.650
 create differently then everything comes into the 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.590
 rolls will be served and that was it 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.880
 basically 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.260
 I'll be there in the short term 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.510
 decided to have some tomato with me 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.409
 to do it because a big mistake 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:38.080
 Often you often brew tomatoes 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.370
 Either way, it makes just that 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.370
 be cut open and then come 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.320
 she is very important on it but that one 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.419
 she just gets a bit more 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.120
 very little salt very small pinch 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.610
 sugar if you like it again 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.070
 with the pepper mill was then get the 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.130
 tomato taste and everything 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.389
 on the burger on it should be right 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:03.490
 taste good and that was it in the 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.620
 already taken no reason 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.570
 sauce mayonnaise not the we need 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.400
 Not when we have that 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.710
 schönefeld have meat from the 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.520
 then we do not have to be trivial behind 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:20.800
 boring sunflowers or rapeseed oil in 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.610
 mayonnaise mold with it and 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:31.090
 that's how the whole thing looks like 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:34.240
 us if it tastes you i believe it 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.630
 please taste me then let me 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.630
 alone 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.340
 Of course you can do more than just 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.680
 meat cheese on it we can have 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.900
 also in this class but interesting 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.020
 It will be like when, for example 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.810
 just it has when their electro coal 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.330
 on it off if you vinegar onions or 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.740
 painkiller with dried on it 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.980
 tomatoes have become olive pancetta 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.000
 boiled egg 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.020
 There are a thousand possible variations 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.180
 fried eggplant is for example 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.570
 also totally fantastic straight in 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.870
 connection with lamb knob hole is 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.620
 totally great on the sauces 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.320
 experiment with the basic concept 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.750
 the citizen is taken but basically 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.240
 that is exactly how we are like you 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.260
 I wish you much fun 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.480
 when trying out 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.020
 send us nice pictures of yours 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.710
 favorite naturalise and has lots of fun while 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.520
 to cook 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.520
 Until next time 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:42.930
 but there is someone in his harem exactly 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.930
 always nice the whole set
