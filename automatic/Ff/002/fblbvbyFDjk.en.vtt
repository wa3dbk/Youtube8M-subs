00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.100
 no 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.930
 and the geeks today we get 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.480
 find on gt5 online to make 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.580
 part of a brand new and his feet on 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.020
 the gene and on next gen so for this 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.140
 hysterical I advise you to take 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.760
 a submarine which is located 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.240
 near here a thing to show on the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.500
 map 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.330
 so if you do not have a submarine 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.170
 you're also going into story mode and 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.240
 put you in mode 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.580
 finally do the cheat code to be 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.110
 invincible so to find that spirit 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.270
 I put you the location it's just 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.940
 here in this area there to the bahamas 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.080
 finally towards under the sea pop of which you 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.790
 just go into your 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.100
 submarine direct you to this area 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.460
 there and the lester reggae a little bit 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.680
 finally it's cool to be hungry 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.960
 a lot of debris I know but it's 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.379
 still something to see so we 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.900
 has military trucks we also have 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.780
 tanks and also nuclear missiles 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.460
 so here I show you on the on the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.470
 video whose vista you see zinc the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.790
 quality and not too disgusting but 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.310
 I try to do my best so 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.920
 here I was in session I was in line 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.250
 on old gen so the quality we will say 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.439
 pretty low so I showed you the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 first point that has two so that's it 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.430
 the second time they do not feel 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 Too much as I was assured I was 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.729
 line so maybe give in as long as we 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.500
 will have in a next dlc 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.640
 finally I do not know it's just a 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.649
 hypothesis in any case these debris 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.960
 cause an approximate war not 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.250
 very far so I say you're lying 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.700
 does she comment to you what you 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.530
 think 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.359
 there are even cases of ammunition and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.679
 it's really to discover them by you 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.210
 even go to the game location 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.070
 unionized and will tell you in the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.539
 comment i hope this end this 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.609
