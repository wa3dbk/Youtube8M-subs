00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.210
 We are there as brutal in the garden 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.770
 john english lord 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.630
 lived everywhere motor Only one thing 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.700
 mean well must 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.920
 blood will be welcomed in 2014 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.920
 the Netherlands with such a stolen rain 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.390
 we become completely different seconds 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 start the first video with a bit 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 news hunter watching is here of course 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.070
 not the Geneva motor show but there 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.840
 are different scoops 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 are incredibly strong infiniti 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.300
 the eau rouge are in fresh creations from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 the mx-5 in the 208 gti 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.269
 and he is a world first cut the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
 jaguar from there is the f time project 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.110
 say totally exclusive car 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.239
 and well frank as more as key I stand 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.159
 think he will be market his very handsome 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 piece of grass out here leaves late 9 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.350
 Sun is going to ask a question 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.350
 how you do that 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.409
 well i think it counts now 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.539
 Of course a lot for the 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.950
 formula so high time to argue your car 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.509
 named after the most 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.429
 unclear bend on the formula 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.869
 1-calendar on the circuit of 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.869
 spa-francorchamps after this has the engine 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.750
 of a gtr nissan gt-r 3.8 liter v6 with 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.189
 five 168 hp and that your course 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
 nice with the m's 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.990
 there are the remains of the auditory rsi diego 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.340
 there for example it's the 50th if you 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.229
 knows as you may have already driven 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.659
 car week live but then fall with the place 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 carbon accents cooling slots for the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.619
 cat brakes all work 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 I 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.939
 hide a tent is almost below 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.009
 this mclaren mso 650s and me like that 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.479
 of mclaren special operations you can 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.830
 a whole lot that let ghosts make something 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.880
 I think, by the way, what then can follow 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.950
 me there is doctor 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.570
 always very special things this 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.030
 car on wheels with interior details 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.399
 then paint a lot of carbon fiber 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.570
 and a very limited edition both convertible 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.570
 as well as a coupÃ© 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.150
 look nice and nice but that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.439
 street cars from mclaren like a car 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.890
 naturally own home on the circuit 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.689
 of the twelve 7 sultry GT3 version 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.060
 the 12v is no longer that is the six 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.700
 cards he has become and this is the 650 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.739
 s of the gt3 championship 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.739
 trav 2015 are the start here 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.860
 new blood is also improving 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.840
 focus and you stand there a lot 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.770
 Anyway towed relative to the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.940
 previous 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.200
 but the biggest news is that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.580
 nowadays also livable with a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.660
 diesel engine 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.130
 you will ask me how do you know the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.360
 database to the two days 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.380
 not at all sure because it looks 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.740
 exactly the same as the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.740
 gasoline version 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.740
 well this is the nissan concept twenty 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.870
 twenty he is still very embryonic 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.090
 stage altea touch through the window 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.700
 there's nothing in it, it's one 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.320
 harbinger of how the nissans in the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.870
 sports cars will look like in the future 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.470
 then maybe 2020 will be that GT-R 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.300
 look like this 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.070
 na comes directly from the headline key 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.290
 fast gran turismo 6 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.000
 and well despite that actually 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.900
 I think only with an outing 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.459
 to report that anyway 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.540
 has four-wheel drive and active 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.100
 wheel suspension 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.300
 well i won't ask if they ants up 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.870
 want to put the bridge because has to 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.870
 are going to check 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.420
 I have nothing to do with it 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.190
 computer game and yes this one 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.110
 distance marketing could not ignore it 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.730
 The DP-100 he comes from Gran Turismo 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.310
 Nissan Nation that not before 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.599
 presented and yes he does not exist anything 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.130
 but again have a go once he 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.110
 the computer world is coming to an end 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.709
 computer world has that in the back 810 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.310
 pk 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.310
 that you only know 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.489
 The Peugeot appeared 30 years ago 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.620
 205 gti so time for one 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.230
 Anniversary is not even a French descendant 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.420
 the 208 this year the special 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.890
 Performances lot of extra goody's he 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.690
 the centimeter is lower than one 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.519
 normal 208 gti 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.380
 and the african shakes with 8 that it 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.360
 total brings in 208 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.360
 208 yes that is no coincidence of course 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.340
 and we have another anniversary and there 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.400
 makes my heart beat faster 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.110
 know it and x 5 that's my car for 25 years 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.490
 again it exists in a tent 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.900
 had anniversary and two chat 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.849
 anniversary edition to the fifth 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.680
 third generation anniversary 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.849
 facelifted third generation 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.500
 and it is also a bit of a goodbye 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.000
 model think because next year is coming 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.620
 there is a completely new mx-5 that she has 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.960
 together with alfa romeo 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.340

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.500
 stand 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.580
 Frank the jungle seemed to do another one 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.870
 little in england 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.550
 yes the nice thing is of course that they are yes 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.800
 English car sees a huge blow 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.960
 went through last 10 but 20 years 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.610
 what remains is to notice its tute 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.530
 and life like crazy because look 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.210
 it is busier that where you walk on the 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.400
 jaguar stronger real our with 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.840
 different busiest places feels weird 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.120

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.880
