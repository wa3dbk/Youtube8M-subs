lie between Jupiter at the Sun and they

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.410 
lie between Jupiter at the Sun and they
feel<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.350> opposite<00:01:45.920> sides<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.550> sky<00:01:47.080> so

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
feel the opposite sides of the sky so

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.020
