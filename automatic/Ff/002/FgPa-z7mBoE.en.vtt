of electric bike performance our

of electric bike performance our
mentality<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.189> essentially<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.390> record

mentality was essentially if a record
exists<00:01:07.200> break<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> record<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.610> it

exists break the record and if it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.899 
exists break the record and if it
doesn't<00:01:08.909> exist<00:01:09.119> try<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.020> set<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> record<00:01:10.909> we

doesn't exist try and set that record we

doesn't exist try and set that record we
were<00:01:12.000> having<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.780> fun<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.740> was
