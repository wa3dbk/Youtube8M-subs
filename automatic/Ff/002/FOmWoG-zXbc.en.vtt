that's<00:03:22.040> basically<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> only<00:03:22.760> reason<00:03:23.120> why<00:03:23.329> you

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
that's basically the only reason why you

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.800 
that's basically the only reason why you
run<00:03:23.720> those<00:03:26.319> two<00:03:27.319> evo<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:27.919> does<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:29.329> SLS<00:03:29.690> you

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
run those two evo so does the SLS you

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.189 
run those two evo so does the SLS you
get<00:03:30.019> out<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:30.590> mega<00:03:31.129> heracross<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:35.780> do<00:03:35.959> run

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
get out the mega heracross so you do run

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.379 
get out the mega heracross so you do run

bargain<00:03:39.079> is<00:03:39.230> pretty<00:03:39.470> vital<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.340> decks

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
bargain is pretty vital to the decks

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.059 
bargain is pretty vital to the decks
performance<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:42.440> that's<00:03:42.739> definitely<00:03:43.370> needed

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
performance so that's definitely needed

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.569 
performance so that's definitely needed
then<00:03:46.069> three<00:03:46.730> energy<00:03:47.150> switch<00:03:47.889> it<00:03:48.889> doesn't<00:03:49.370> seem

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
then three energy switch it doesn't seem

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.610 
then three energy switch it doesn't seem
like<00:03:49.609> it<00:03:49.910> should<00:03:49.940> be<00:03:50.120> using<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.810> deck<00:03:51.019> because

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
like it should be using the deck because

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.949 
like it should be using the deck because
you<00:03:51.799> have<00:03:51.949> the<00:03:52.190> dragonite<00:03:52.760> but<00:03:53.540> what<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.840> can

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
you have the dragonite but what you can

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.629 
you have the dragonite but what you can
do<00:03:54.109> is<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.440> if<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.709> have<00:03:54.739> three<00:03:55.040> energy<00:03:55.400> /

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
do is that if you have three energy /

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.250 
do is that if you have three energy /
you<00:03:55.819> can<00:03:56.000> barge<00:03:56.239> in<00:03:56.449> an<00:03:56.569> attached<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:57.079> faux

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
you can barge in an attached a faux

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.610 
you can barge in an attached a faux
stone<00:03:57.560> triple<00:03:58.129> energy<00:03:58.519> switch<00:03:59.079> max<00:04:00.079> potion

and<00:04:00.769> gain<00:04:02.319> for<00:04:03.319> your<00:04:03.500> football<00:04:03.739> this<00:04:04.669> is<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:04.940> in

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
and gain for your football this is a in

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.930 
and gain for your football this is a in
case<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.199> day<00:04:06.349> to<00:04:06.409> notice<00:04:06.889> now<00:04:07.609> your<00:04:07.760> hair

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
case you day to notice now your hair

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.449 
case you day to notice now your hair
crosses<00:04:08.510> through<00:04:08.720> your<00:04:08.930> three<00:04:09.319> air<00:04:09.650> crosses

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
crosses through your three air crosses

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
crosses through your three air crosses
three<00:04:10.699> or<00:04:10.879> three<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:12.819> drag<00:04:13.819> tinnitus<00:04:14.269> through

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
three or three and drag tinnitus through

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.050 
three or three and drag tinnitus through
retreat<00:04:14.900> so<00:04:15.109> basically<00:04:15.440> 75%<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.400> your<00:04:16.549> pokemon

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
retreat so basically 75% of your pokemon

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.940 
retreat so basically 75% of your pokemon
have<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:18.310> retreat<00:04:19.310> cost<00:04:19.549> of<00:04:19.789> three

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
have a retreat cost of three

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.940 
have a retreat cost of three
so<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:22.340> probably<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:23.180> best<00:04:23.530> choice<00:04:24.530> to

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
so it's probably the best choice to

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.500 
so it's probably the best choice to
search<00:04:28.510> then<00:04:29.770> or<00:04:30.770> max<00:04:31.040> potion<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.970> want<00:04:32.270> know<00:04:32.390> if

search then or max potion I want know if

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.830 
search then or max potion I want know if
I<00:04:32.600> should<00:04:32.630> run<00:04:32.930> for<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:34.520> i'm<00:04:34.910> running<00:04:35.300> for<00:04:35.330> for
