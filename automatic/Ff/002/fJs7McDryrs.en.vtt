00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
can see there's nothing there so we call

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.760 
can see there's nothing there so we call
the<00:01:07.740> manufacturer<00:01:08.250> Bryan<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.880> he<00:01:11.880> told<00:01:12.180> me

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
the manufacturer Bryan and he told me

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
the manufacturer Bryan and he told me
that<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.189> means<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:16.939> screw<00:01:17.939> down<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> brake

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that it means to be screw down the brake

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
that it means to be screw down the brake
pivot<00:01:19.080> pin<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.920> said<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.520> was

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
pivot pin but I said and I think it was

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.210 
pivot pin but I said and I think it was
just<00:01:23.850> screwed<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.840> could<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.320> so

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
just screwed down as it could be so

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:36.319 
just screwed down as it could be so
let's<00:01:26.460> try<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.740> maybe<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.979> needs<00:01:29.299> more<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:36.210> he

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
let's try it maybe it needs more and he

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.990 
let's try it maybe it needs more and he
can't<00:01:36.630> turn<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> anymore<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:41.970> down

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
can't turn it anymore it doesn't go down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
can't turn it anymore it doesn't go down
anymore<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.590> down<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.340> going

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
anymore it's about as down as it's going

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.170 
anymore it's about as down as it's going
to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.549> down<00:01:47.700> anymore

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to be and it's not going down anymore

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.069 
to be and it's not going down anymore
and<00:01:48.420> he<00:01:48.540> said<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> he<00:01:50.310> told<00:01:50.579> me<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.960> they
