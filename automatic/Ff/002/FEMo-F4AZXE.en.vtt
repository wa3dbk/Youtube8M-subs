 new era in the life of the people of the era of flight 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.870
 in space and the name of Gagarin 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.780
 inextricably linked with the name of the queen i 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.030
 I gave the Vikings 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:56.430

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:40.890

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 years ago 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.920
 Yuri Gagarin made the first in history 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.020
 humanity flight 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.110
 outer space realized something about 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.959
 than dreamed millions of people opened an era 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.289
 space travel of course this 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.689
 the merit of tens and hundreds of thousands of people 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.579
 Those who made this flight may congratulate 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.869

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.780
 Happy Cosmonautics 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:16.140
 and now let us fast forward to you 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:18.019
 3300 first year of the world or you start with 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.049
 description of a small patch 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.150
 Friday server update 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.750
 1.2.0 7 and most interesting changes 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.610
 in my opinion the following and approaching 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.569
 neutral capital ship you will 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.150
 warned 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.430
 one kilometer if you continue 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.200
 moving on then he will become hostile 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.019
 to you on a few hundred meters to 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.519
 him 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.780
 computer ships will no longer be 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:49.769
 steal your bounty if npc killed 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.389
 ship shot propulsion if 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.970
 when approaching the station the player will 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.459
 scanned by police and player status 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.470
 being sought before docking will be 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.760
 it is forbidden in the form but in order to 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.989
 not rats or near stations mates 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.239
 the pilots then to quickly fill it 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.739
 throw off fines 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.500
 hold burglars are no longer marked as 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.959
 stolen it was a tank and one more 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.940
 change now appeared in the statistics 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.310
 research scans second and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.590
 level three it turned out was not 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.480
 reserve for the future and just detailed 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.380
 scan and scan with 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.329
 scanner surfaces also in the patch was 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.310
 several other less significant ones and mine 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.790
 a look of correction I talk about them 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.880
 I will not now to the description of the powerplay 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.510
 what became known this week 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.189
 developer diaries michael 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.560
 ux thanked all the players for 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.829
 support and clarified the situation with the keys 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.450
 stim frontier heard players wanting 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.000
 move your game to steam 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.849
 but the problem is that it is not 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.739
 so easy to transfer just one hundred 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.930
 percent of players by force in steam it 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.690
 not an option because they probably do not want 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.750
 all and besides it is not free for 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.549
 developers as a frontier solution to this 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.980
 problems they will need several weeks 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.930
 new task developers consider 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.159
 priority and we can only 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.639
 wait big powerplay announcement 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.620
 take place in a couple of weeks and particular 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.139
 hp or play will be completely redone 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.780
 mission system this is not part of 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.270
 addon says jersey just released this 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.160
 will be with him first 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.330
 developers want to provide a wide 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.490
 spectrum of messi 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.580
 the easiest and most convenient way with 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.320
 a large number of variations of missions 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.180
 also where possible it will be possible 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.660
 choose the locations and goals of the mission 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.669
 galactic and system maps will be 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.740
 more actively used mailbox 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.840
 I think the players mean here 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.979
 transaction tab today or 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.500
 maybe really lead 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.930
 some game mail and secondly 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.789
 probably the most important developers 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.410
 note that missy is interesting now 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.690
 novice players only 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.030
 and for the more experienced they are often not 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.789
 attractive and they want it too 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.919
 change for more experienced players will 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.410
 special missions which will 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.449
 go into depending player experience 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.440
 and maybe hope the reward will be 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.800
 appropriate 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.289
 and finally, what I would like to say about 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.810
 missions will change the reward system 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.430
 for the reputation of helping the weaker factions 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.090
 missions you will get more 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.830
 high reward as in any 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.320
 a large pharmacy will be a bunch of different 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.750
 improving current mechanic says michael 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.760
 and here are some of them maximum 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.800
 the amount of the insurance loan will depend 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.580
 from the rank of pilot of the federation of pilots and 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.860
 will grow with your progress change 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.680
 in the customization of the ship will be 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.320
 put more than one fuel tank 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.870
 this is an interesting change if the fuel 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.660
 the tank will take its place inside the slot and there 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.990
 maybe instead 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.550
 much tank can be put cream 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.680
 and at least for ships with small 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.340
 fuel tank significantly improved 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.630
 opportunities for the ship 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.630
 newsletter showed early 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.460
 concept of a ship diamond run this ship 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.060
 will also be released in update by 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.970
 rubles for the news release you 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.160
 watched the battle of two cruisers 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.770
 imperial and federation system derin u 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.160
 planet 2b there is a war between capitals 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.140
 empire federation where up to this planet is 90 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.420
 thousand light seconds from the main star 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.150
 it's about 10 minutes of real time 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.970
 if you have time and desire you can fly 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.860
 look looks beautiful at the cruiser 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.350
 shoot quite hurt so 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.360
 be careful 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.170
 I think steam play will be released in beta. 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.040
 early may 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.660
 so it remains to wait a couple of weeks 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.420
 I personally have high hopes for 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.810
 new mission system but it will justify them 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.270
 or not soon we'll see you in the news 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.710
 next week sure will be new 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.350
 details about powerplay 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.680
 but that's all with you was gif and successful 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.680
 you flight
