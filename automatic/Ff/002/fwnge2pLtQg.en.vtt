00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.759 
through the cycle of this machine and we
are<00:00:19.340> through<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.520> nitrogen<00:00:21.029> cycle<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.840> have

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
are through the nitrogen cycle and have

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.500 
are through the nitrogen cycle and have
moved<00:00:23.160> some<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> coral<00:00:23.939> over<00:00:24.090> which<00:00:24.330> I'll

things<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.539> room<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.890> eventually<00:01:02.730> but

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
things and room for more eventually but

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
things and room for more eventually but
we're<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> let<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.710> good

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
we're going to let this thing get good

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.760 
we're going to let this thing get good
and<00:01:05.070> settled<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.519> before<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.140> put<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:07.320> coral

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and settled out before we put more coral

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
and settled out before we put more coral
in<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.549> move<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> fish<00:01:09.390> over<00:01:09.750> which

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
in it and also move the fish over which

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.770 
in it and also move the fish over which
will<00:01:10.049> probably<00:01:10.350> happen<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.770> weekend<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
will probably happen this weekend but

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.000 
will probably happen this weekend but
one<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> things<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> noticed<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
one of the things that I noticed and I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
one of the things that I noticed and I
don't<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.430> we'll<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.640> able<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> let<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
don't know if we'll be able to let you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.740 
don't know if we'll be able to let you
see<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.490> if<00:01:17.490> you've<00:01:17.820> set<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.540> an

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
see this but if you've set up an

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
see this but if you've set up an
aquarium<00:01:19.229> before<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> end<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
aquarium before you know that the end of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
aquarium before you know that the end of
the<00:01:20.880> nitrogen<00:01:21.390> cycle<00:01:21.420> means<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.500> beginning

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the nitrogen cycle means the beginning

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.749 
the nitrogen cycle means the beginning
of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.580> brown<00:01:23.820> cycle<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.610> fortunately<00:01:26.610> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of the brown cycle and fortunately this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.319 
of the brown cycle and fortunately this
tank<00:01:27.000> has<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> lot<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.750> circulation<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.979> I'm

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
tank has a lot of circulation so I'm

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.880 
tank has a lot of circulation so I'm
hoping<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.390> there<00:01:31.170> won't<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> whole<00:01:31.829> lot

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
hoping that there won't be a whole lot

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.640 
hoping that there won't be a whole lot
of<00:01:32.250> brown<00:01:32.430> algae<00:01:32.670> show<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> seabed<00:01:34.350> but

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of brown algae show up on the seabed but

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.899 
of brown algae show up on the seabed but
the<00:01:35.159> brown<00:01:35.400> cycle<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> brown<00:01:36.689> algae<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.909> maybe

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the brown cycle is brown algae and maybe

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.460 
the brown cycle is brown algae and maybe
you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.450> maybe<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> can't<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.079> right

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you can see it maybe you can't but right

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.340 
you can see it maybe you can't but right
here<00:01:40.829> behind<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.030> toadstool

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
here behind the toadstool

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.490 
here behind the toadstool
there's

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
there's

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.030 
there's
a<00:01:44.560> big<00:01:45.250> piece<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.490> shell<00:01:46.000> there<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.630> right

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
a big piece of shell there to the right

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.900 
a big piece of shell there to the right
that's<00:01:48.040> brown<00:01:48.400> algae<00:01:48.670> coming<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:50.550> on<00:01:51.550> this

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
that's brown algae coming also on this

that's brown algae coming also on this
piece<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.210> rock<00:01:52.480> right<00:01:52.990> below<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.620> piece<00:01:54.220> of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
piece of rock right below the piece of

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.290 
piece of rock right below the piece of

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
opinion pretty good and I did lose a

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.990 
opinion pretty good and I did lose a
couple<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:39.720> little<00:04:40.800> buds<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.340> my<00:04:42.970> favorite

hammer<00:04:43.570> coral<00:04:44.020> there<00:04:44.200> you<00:04:44.320> can<00:04:44.470> see<00:04:45.150> there<00:04:46.150> on

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
hammer coral there you can see there on

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.540 
hammer coral there you can see there on
the<00:04:46.570> right<00:04:46.960> side<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.800> couple<00:04:48.130> of<00:04:48.310> them<00:04:48.430> are

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
the right side that a couple of them are

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.240 
the right side that a couple of them are
showing<00:04:48.730> their<00:04:49.000> skeleton<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:50.200> I<00:04:50.650> think<00:04:50.890> I<00:04:51.040> had

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
showing their skeleton and I think I had

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.700 
showing their skeleton and I think I had
that<00:04:51.750> tipped<00:04:52.750> over<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.110> little<00:04:53.350> bit<00:04:53.470> in<00:04:53.620> the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
tank and I think that was leaned up

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.240 
tank and I think that was leaned up
against<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.510> tank<00:04:55.720> wall<00:04:55.930> but<00:04:56.080> anyway<00:04:56.440> all<00:04:56.650> in

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
against the tank wall but anyway all in

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.030 
against the tank wall but anyway all in
all<00:04:57.400> things<00:04:57.700> turned<00:04:57.970> out<00:04:58.150> pretty<00:04:58.360> good
