00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.910
 denis moraes was trying to jump in the clouds and events and we have some 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.830
 indications of which organisms on planet earth English for example 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.510
 can use with support as their source of water so it is quite encouraging 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.980
 for the life of young women at least in terms of water availability 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.690
 to know if the real estate heard and the philippines 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.500
 the bachelor of collection the show chiara top of a source of hot water 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.060
 Seek vehicles circulate in the clouds we live 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.510
 first five queues were little green in the mouth that's encouraging 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 maybe actually find someone 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.330
 analyzes show that microbes can watch the book because it had 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.090
 civic 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.390
 suggesting that life could survive in a world in which we live 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.680
 to put theory in dublin 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.800
 but the proof 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.940
 he saw me organisms plan high into the atmosphere 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.900
 she launched the whole spectrum of microbes 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 some for more than 30 kilometers 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.760
 a region where temperature and pressure fall though most of the 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.930
 of life forms would die 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.150
 pink matos 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.190
 many of the limnology research objects he survived 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.460
 some researchers even found organisms capable of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.000
 reproduce in the atmosphere 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.430
 research shows that life in hot clouds and teams is worse path 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.450
 possible 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.590
 perhaps not even the felipÃ£o 'in the clouds' ten years 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
 with cults in those strangers and dark spots 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.060
 its dirty chips run 140 million kilometers around the planet and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 completed six weeks of cartridge collection 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.450
 she proved that in the past 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.280
 denis looked like planet earth 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.989
 with a pleasant climate 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.989
 but of the oceans and perhaps even 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.799
 but being too close to the sun - was doomed 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.539
 despite the fear 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.089
 for us blind 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 but even of what life can develop 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.339
 protected in the midst of clouds 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.309
 it is possible that we have to wait all 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:43.959
 thank goodness that the secret is revealed almost a day another mission to Venus 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.439
 you can find the holy grail of space 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.879
 doubt 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.879
 besides our side 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.199
 the new version 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.829
 but mine are paulo
