00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.420 
the reason I put the glass bowl inside
of<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.390> pot<00:04:08.630> end<00:04:08.960> the<00:04:09.710> reason<00:04:09.950> why<00:04:10.010> we<00:04:10.130> don't

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
of the pot end the reason why we don't

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.430 
of the pot end the reason why we don't
put<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.060> crown<00:04:11.240> directly<00:04:11.750> into<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.140> pot<00:04:12.290> is

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
put the crown directly into the pot is

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.980 
put the crown directly into the pot is
because<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.310> crayon<00:04:13.580> burns<00:04:13.940> very<00:04:14.150> easily<00:04:14.270> so

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
because the crayon burns very easily so

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.070 
because the crayon burns very easily so
this<00:04:15.200> kind<00:04:15.410> of<00:04:15.440> helps<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:16.450> warm<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.600> up<00:04:17.690> slowly

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
this kind of helps to warm it up slowly

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.770 
this kind of helps to warm it up slowly
and<00:04:19.270> less<00:04:20.270> severely

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.490 

takes<00:04:25.650> about<00:04:25.800> 30<00:04:26.490> seconds<00:04:27.450> 10<00:04:27.690> minute<00:04:28.020> for<00:04:28.320> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
takes about 30 seconds 10 minute for the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.930 
takes about 30 seconds 10 minute for the
crown<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:29.010> melt<00:04:29.220> so<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.460> really<00:04:29.640> doesn't<00:04:29.910> take

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
crown to melt so it really doesn't take

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.050 
crown to melt so it really doesn't take
very<00:04:30.060> long<00:04:30.390> at<00:04:30.600> all
