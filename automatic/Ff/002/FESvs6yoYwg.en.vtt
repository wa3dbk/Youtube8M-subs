00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.529
 tattoo machine be it a tree with 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.080
 using a needle that moves up and down 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.450
 pierce machine later and introduces a drop 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.170
 ink under the victim's skin to the depth 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.970
 one and a half millimeters and there is a skin for 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.660
 order to fill 5 square 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.060
 centimeters of skin need to perforate it 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 28,000 times so the machine works with 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.680
 tremendous speed with incredible 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.539
 speeds 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.800
 Kitych her work involved two powerful 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 factors she 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 elasticity is metal and la here 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.760
 readme.ru and electromagnetism and everything for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 to pierce the skin 100 times in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.030
 second here is this yes machine for 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.239
 tattoo needle it moves up and down 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 and punctures the skin with a foot pedal 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 she starts and stops the typewriter and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.440
 AC device 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.899
 she controls the force with which the needle 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.799
 pierces the skin when the pedal is pressed which 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.799
 is about steam 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.250
 player disassembling the device into parts we 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.580
 see that tattoo machine is 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.660
 electrical circuit with a positive 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.190
 the terminals the voltage goes across 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.190
 two copper windings 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.990
 intel contact and kim syrup 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.160
 flows through two metal strips to 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.970
 negative terminals are very simple on 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.270
 a simple background timofti glo moves through 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.730
 electromagnetic interaction forces 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.980
 when the current passes through the copper winding it 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.850
 magnetized and transformed into 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.100
 electromagnet 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.990
 this is exactly what happens with two 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.990
 windings in tattoo machines 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.280
 fighting me winding located stator 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.350
 in which metal is attached 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.300
 rod of force at the end of the rod needle we 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.490
 adjust when the current flows through the windings 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.110
 coils become electromagnets 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.690
 which attract the stator with 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.970
 metal rod thanks to this 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.190
 pull the metal rod into 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.190
 to which the stator is attached and lowered 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.970
 the table as a result the stator moves 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.190
 down and pressed against the windings 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.130
 dragging along the rod at the end 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.770
 which is the needle the needle pierces 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.700
 skin this one puncture pulling down the stator 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.640
 electromagnetic force breaks the circuit 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.209
 between contact screw and metal 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.209
 stripe electrical circuit opens 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.299
 There is no electricity in 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.340
 electromagnets means that the coils 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.799
 demagnetized and they no longer create 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.599
 electromagnetic field contact sam floor 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.849
 with stator made of extremely 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.470
 strong and at the same time elastic metal 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.519
 so she instantly straightens 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.170
 like a spring the needle rushes up 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:47.280
 after the metal plate 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:53.220
 likes spain daniel cam zap spelled numbers 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.620
 and Cycle language instantly repeated so 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.660
 how when the needle moves up the stator 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.390
 renews the connection between the contact 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.859
 screw and metal strip 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.000
 restoring the coil circuit 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.430
 one thing again becomes 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.410
 electromagnets electromagnetic forces 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.730
 pull the stator and everything repeats 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.970
 again and again 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.010
 affairs vokru resident nai speed fight 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.709
 between the electromagnetic force which 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.169
 pulls the needle down the elastic plate 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.000
 which pushes her up continues 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.300
 move the needle until pressed 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.300
 pedal 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:34.229
 ost his tattoo machines 

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:35.609
 both simple and complex simple 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.579
 because she represents 

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:40.829
 elementary electrical circuit difficult 

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:43.439
 and because the tattoo machine 

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:47.909
 unlocks and restores itself 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:50.489
 electrical circuit and all this in order 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:54.949
 to move the needle that pierces 

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:54.949
 skin is a masterpiece
