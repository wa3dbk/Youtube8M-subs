00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.349
 I am graduating and I organized 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.330
 jewelry art fair 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.640
 We can do all kinds of jewelry here 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.740
 seeing very modern becomes very classic 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.680
 all materials 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.440
 all sizes really everything in terms of area 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.750
 of jewelery art we have 185 here 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.760
 sira designer from all over the world 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.470
 It is striking that there is an intense amount 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.510
 different types of jewelry are these 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.680
 years perhaps more than other years 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.280
 people who 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.260
 work with 3d printing and this year 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 especially peggy bannenberg stands out 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
 it has a new series this year 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.140
 included 3D 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.600
 which can thus move in a piece of jewelry 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.230
 Bracelet i moves and that really then 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.920
 you play 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920
 it is very special 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.030
 back has been going on for a long time so 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 Rietveld graduated years ago 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 has made fantastic jewelry on 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040
 all kinds of area and all kinds of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.689
 materials but she's been around for a year or so 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.090
 start focusing on 3d eight years ago 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.229
 printing and it is real for the Netherlands 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.759
 a pioneer 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.830
 they are always manners things 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.380
 special things and leave it on the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.479
 stock market so you can see your 3d ring 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.159
 or bracelet is printed 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.590
 i am peggy bannenberg and i am making 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.600
 jewelry using 3d printing 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.100
 I make you of all kinds 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 jewelry 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.520
 I think bracelets pendants for we 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520
 everything is possible 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.490
 3d printing is in contrast to almost 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.280
 it is all other traditional methods 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.369
 building material actually any 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.069
 other method takes material away and 3d 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.009
 printing is just technology 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.670
 material used where it is needed 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.799
 the 3d drawing is the starting point that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.409
 software continues through the planer city 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.769
 in very thin slices and the printer 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.880
 does not build slices together again until 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.310
 a whole 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.579
 I make all the drawings myself 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.459
 because that is the work 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.329
 the printer material is behind 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.470
 on 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.390
 on a roll and to get those colors 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.870
 I used to cut pieces and that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.450
 I already have here 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.580
 tucked in 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.720
 a motor does that material 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.670
 spiciness 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:46.120
 that is called that block which is 210 degrees 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.120
 and it comes out liquid 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.770
 printer that I have myself can do all kinds of 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.310
 types of plastics but for example 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.190
 also 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.110
 prince where does other more complicated the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.900
 printers that can 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.870
 metals too 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.720
 titanium steel brass there becomes gold 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.250
 printed silver so the possibilities are 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.250
 are practically endless
