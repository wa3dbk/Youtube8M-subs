00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.940 
Mickey there's the UNSC symbol and
basically<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.160> repaint<00:02:42.760> off<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:44.710> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
basically it's just a repaint off of the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.140 
basically it's just a repaint off of the
other<00:02:45.960> ODST<00:02:46.960> figures<00:02:47.560> except<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:49.090> one

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
other ODST figures except that this one

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.900 
other ODST figures except that this one
comes<00:02:50.020> with<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.410> different<00:02:50.860> shoulder<00:02:51.220> pad<00:02:51.430> and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
a different backpack and now I think

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.090
