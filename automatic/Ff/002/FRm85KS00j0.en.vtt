00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that arm in that mr. so I can duplicate

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.899 
that arm in that mr. so I can duplicate
the<00:01:10.140> recipe<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.890> always<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> same

really want to continue to use them if
they<00:05:12.040> were<00:05:12.100> all<00:05:12.400> similar<00:05:13.090> in<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.840> same<00:05:14.110> tone

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
they were all similar in the same tone

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.650 
they were all similar in the same tone
what<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:16.930> was<00:05:17.200> trying<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.980> do<00:05:18.100> now<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.540> free<00:05:19.540> up

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
what I was trying to do now is free up

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.780 
what I was trying to do now is free up
some<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:20.050> my<00:05:20.080> other<00:05:20.530> misters<00:05:21.100> that<00:05:21.400> four

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
some of my other misters that four

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.990 
some of my other misters that four
colors<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.360> always<00:05:22.870> use<00:05:23.170> and<00:05:23.880> some<00:05:24.880> of

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
colors that I always use and some of

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.490 
colors that I always use and some of
those<00:05:25.060> experimental<00:05:25.810> colors<00:05:26.670> like<00:05:27.670> um<00:05:27.970> I

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
those experimental colors like um I

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.260 
those experimental colors like um I
really<00:05:29.500> I<00:05:29.740> know<00:05:29.770> that's<00:05:29.920> like<00:05:30.370> a<00:05:30.400> red<00:05:30.700> tone<00:05:31.000> I

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
really I know that's like a red tone I

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.440 
really I know that's like a red tone I
don't<00:05:31.840> know<00:05:31.960> what<00:05:32.140> that<00:05:32.170> is<00:05:32.460> but<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.730> probably

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
don't know what that is but I probably

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.490 
don't know what that is but I probably
won't<00:05:35.190> want<00:05:36.190> to<00:05:36.490> really<00:05:36.730> use<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.090> again<00:05:37.450> so<00:05:38.170> I

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
won't want to really use it again so I

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.180 
won't want to really use it again so I
was<00:05:38.770> using<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.610> regular<00:05:40.060> spray<00:05:40.540> bottle<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.190> you

was using a regular spray bottle and you

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.640 
was using a regular spray bottle and you
know<00:05:42.580> it's<00:05:42.880> gonna<00:05:43.630> be<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.840> shimmery<00:05:44.290> color

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650
