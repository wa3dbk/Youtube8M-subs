00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:15.230
 welcome to diablo 3 beta server dpa 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.270
 that's patch 2.0 students ever 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.960
 show me how I am with my game 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.970
 the nice thing about the new patch is that 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.150
 is now albums out there with so 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.609
 entertainment with special fixes on it 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.809
 the whole place is simple 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.280
 Change is great fun 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.780
 I'll show you something now 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.460
 I think it's all about 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.500
 two cars that the whole already possible 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.019
 do 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:48.010
 and yes that would be the one here 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:50.809
 amulet it on johann 506 kleinert 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.589
 witthus cooldown gold of monsters and 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.860
 Now here comes this special ability 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:03.019
 dance and hip polin enemies gates target 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.680
 and slow that means if you are already an opponent 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.450
 also on hit then everyone else will 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.030
 opponents around him tightened as there is 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.219
 just a chance on it and it is 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.770
 a hundred times better than icon strike so 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.890
 you really pull everything on us 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.619
 Often the amulet has no critical one 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.799
 on it and more loses stop 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.740
 little harm then the next album 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.259
 Here is the ax disguise leaves 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.590
 I do not have a socket on it now 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.340
 only by the old always free who club 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.619
 6000 lost but lost anyway 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.719
 Just listen farm and kills beat 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.630
 because the two effects so clean 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.090
 this means 18 percent chance means 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.249
 enemies if jupiter so i have now 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.130
 first no idea what that is this 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.330
 effect what do you even like skin 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.450
 the rhine and is 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.800
 the madness it goes off so well so me 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.690
 I really have fun with the ax in the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.280
 endeffekt it looks like that without 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.020
 lightning from the sky comes on the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.270
 enemy of the thunders and easy 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.430
 mercilessly hurt much power it's real 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.200
 is pretty hard on the two 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.840
 I have now laid out my quasi 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.670
 one applies 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 I also have the word fast 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.220
 found 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.010
 28% joke to explode often ford 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.720
 to that present time trains that means 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.020
 if I get hit , there is one 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.720
 28 percent chance that storm around me 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.760
 Just shoot it out for 200 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.040
 percent weapon damage is whole 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 funny because the enjoyed everyone notes 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.209
 then through the amulet through the pool 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.030
 who are always planning on me and haunold 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.110
 too, and the thing is coming too 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.330
 There are a few now 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.170
 different skills the effect of 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.959
 amulett the brocken for example the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.239
 strike that means I passion sun pure 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.620
 and event immediately all contracted 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.620
 buy mirror and they are gone 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.290
 the strikers I have the last round 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.570
 took 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.390
 that's like such a mini little one 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.040
 shadow pages strike so you have more 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.769
 more or attack then stop 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.780
 triggers for every 500 weapon damage 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.550
 just under two seconds goes the whole 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.780
 then as a standard attack I have the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:37.590
 Nativity scene with the hour to the spirit 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.959
 generate kipling wave my goodness is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.580
 everything has been all about here 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.420
 look at everything 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.670
 the ax prokop all that will be all 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.209
 Guests clicked critically for each opponent 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.950
 also my first choice now whole 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.830
 time in any case better than that 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.560
 Other skills The mantra is definitely 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.780
 much better than before 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.330
 So you just really have much more 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.370
 hurt out with the last peace you have 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.730
 you have effects for 100% 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:19.019
 Damage also causes sacred harm 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.320
 really good then swing swing with swing 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.200
 when it just fire there 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.600
 higher radius of the pact also on the 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.880
 Amulet that means I have to go around now 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.630
 Handy types so that pulled to me then 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.580
 become 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.490
 the firestone can do that too 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.460
 and with the hilsenrath is fast and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.919
 it just sounds a lot is just great 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.390
 thing in any case 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:48.780
 then I have the world with explosive body 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.320
 yes the balls on a good damage 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.200
 klotzen slap everything determine the 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.840
 And finally, talk to me again 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.810
 with the cure just knowing safe 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.400
 so in good here now as 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.919
 single lost 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.229
 it does not matter who the less but if 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.090
 late four games max am there 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.979
 sometimes really nasty elite come and 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.110
 Then you have three four elite packs 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:16.880
 a heap and then it is already 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.880
 kartbahn because you can already help times 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.830
 I'll show you how the whole thing 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.140
 I'm off here on the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.150
 Battlefield 3 is the monster table 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.660
 which is no longer on 108 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.630
 reset 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.030
 1:07 patch times I'll show you once the 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.720
 skills in detail first the ax 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.800
 what does he do with the amulet without 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.780
 Something tells this flash date 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.240
 skin and lightning make the skin easy 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.419
 everything away 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.659
 they just blow everything away, it works too 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.890
 I have always put on my liter 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.890
 Okay here 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.680
 You also see the elite boys fall 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.600
 like the fly 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.600
 they are gone the boys 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:22.180
 So I'll show you the dating strike 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:25.200
 the iss exchanged and everything together 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.170
 pulled on it 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.460
 I always watch the shoulders too 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:42.010
 just pull it all with one 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:43.570
 together and wings are on and you see 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.920
 I'll see the net's bags 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:52.020
 still dressed without the 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.520
 skin just has to wind through 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.860
 met just once with all the 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.700
 Replacement of the group is in seconds 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.700
 is the down 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:11.119
 that just works right here 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:15.619
 in short the animation of the dell 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:17.709
 streak is again the attacks easy 

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:24.139
 only flicker rum around looks very cool 

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:25.279
 very horny effect is fun with the 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.279
 dashing strike is a bit too 

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:31.599
 faster you can go first 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:31.599
 prevail everywhere 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:42.629
 yes and so stick stick a lot of harm so 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:44.699
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:47.060

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.060
