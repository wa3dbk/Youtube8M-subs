to know what she did to the children

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.460 
to know what she did to the children
because<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:32.730> probably<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.510> little<00:02:33.600> weird<00:02:33.870> and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
because it's probably a little weird and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.330 
because it's probably a little weird and
on<00:02:35.430> top<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.850> she<00:02:36.540> eventually<00:02:37.340> killed

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
both of the babies it was it was a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
both of the babies it was it was a
double<00:02:40.140> homicide<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.700> he<00:02:41.790> said<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.030> was

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
double homicide I think he said it was

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.630 
double homicide I think he said it was
it<00:02:42.270> was<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.420> double<00:02:42.600> homicide<00:02:42.920> she<00:02:43.920> killed<00:02:44.220> both

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
it was a double homicide she killed both

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.190 
it was a double homicide she killed both
the<00:02:44.850> babies<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.570> then<00:02:45.720> shortly<00:02:46.110> after

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the babies and then shortly after

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.960 
the babies and then shortly after
committed<00:02:46.980> suicide<00:02:47.810> now<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.230> don't<00:02:50.130> understand

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
committed suicide now I don't understand

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.360 
committed suicide now I don't understand
at<00:02:51.240> all<00:02:51.300> why<00:02:52.050> anybody<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.890> want<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.190> do<00:02:53.340> that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
at all why anybody would want to do that

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.600 
at all why anybody would want to do that
I'm<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:54.090> sure<00:02:54.150> what<00:02:54.690> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.960> gain<00:02:55.610> comes

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
I'm not sure what kind of gain comes

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.330 
I'm not sure what kind of gain comes
from<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.000> first<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.810> all<00:02:57.960> I'm<00:02:58.500> gonna<00:02:58.890> say<00:02:58.980> I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
from that first of all I'm gonna say I

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.040 
from that first of all I'm gonna say I
think<00:02:59.700> suicide<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.210> kind<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.450> selfish<00:03:00.870> to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
think suicide is kind of selfish to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.320 
think suicide is kind of selfish to
begin<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.709> think<00:03:02.310> there's<00:03:02.459> more<00:03:02.700> ways<00:03:02.970> in

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
begin with I think there's more ways in

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.820 
begin with I think there's more ways in
other<00:03:03.510> ways<00:03:03.690> than<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.470> take<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.800> own

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
other ways than just to take your own

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.430 
other ways than just to take your own
life<00:03:04.950> um<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:06.120> believe<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:07.170> there's<00:03:07.350> other

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
life um I I believe that there's other

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.150 
life um I I believe that there's other
things<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.280> do<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:10.440> kill<00:03:10.770> two

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
things that you can do and to kill two

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.180 
things that you can do and to kill two
innocent<00:03:11.190> little<00:03:11.850> babies<00:03:12.360> for<00:03:13.200> what<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:14.040> know

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
innocent little babies for what you know

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.130 
innocent little babies for what you know
I<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.640> don't<00:03:15.000> think<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.480> babies<00:03:15.840> could<00:03:16.020> have

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
I I don't think the babies could have

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.440 
I I don't think the babies could have
been<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.440> bad<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.980> don't<00:03:17.400> think<00:03:17.610> her<00:03:17.820> life<00:03:18.030> was

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
been that bad I don't think her life was

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.780 
been that bad I don't think her life was
that<00:03:18.810> bad<00:03:19.080> but<00:03:19.890> then<00:03:20.070> again<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.459> know<00:03:20.550> there's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
that bad but then again you know there's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.520 
that bad but then again you know there's
always<00:03:20.940> two<00:03:21.209> sides<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.660> story<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.170> maybe<00:03:22.380> her

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
always two sides to a story so maybe her

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.350 
always two sides to a story so maybe her
life<00:03:22.709> was<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.130> bad<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.520> still<00:03:23.850> don't<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.330> I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
life was that bad I still don't I like I

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.270 
life was that bad I still don't I like I
