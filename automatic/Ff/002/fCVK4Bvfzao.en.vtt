right i think i think for every domestic
offer<00:01:17.340> every<00:01:17.670> player<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> world<00:01:18.420> they

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
talk about it but i think in terms of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.380 
talk about it but i think in terms of
domestic<00:01:20.430> county<00:01:20.790> players<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> opportunity

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
domestic county players the opportunity

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.810 
domestic county players the opportunity
to<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> farm<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.470> Lord<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.310> something

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
