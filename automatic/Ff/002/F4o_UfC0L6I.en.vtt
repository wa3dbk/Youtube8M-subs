clinic we call it the n54 and in its
simplest<00:00:50.570> terms<00:00:50.810> it's<00:00:51.380> a<00:00:51.530> medical<00:00:51.890> implant

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
simplest terms it's a medical implant

however<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.330> one<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:53.780> very<00:00:54.140> small<00:00:54.470> and<00:00:54.820> so

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
however this one is very small and so
