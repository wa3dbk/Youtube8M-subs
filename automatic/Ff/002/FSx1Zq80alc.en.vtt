27<00:00:12.240> which<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.630> really<00:00:12.870> great<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.440> had<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> pretty

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
27 which is really great I had a pretty

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.499 
27 which is really great I had a pretty
bad<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.549> round<00:00:14.820> though<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> finished<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
bad first round though I finished the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.810 
bad first round though I finished the

the<00:00:17.880> reason<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.359> because<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:19.020> kept

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the reason for that is because I kept

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.720

want<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.619> talk<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.950> guys<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.189> I'm

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
want to talk to you guys about I'm

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.569 
want to talk to you guys about I'm
actually<00:01:45.119> thinking<00:01:45.720> about<00:01:46.350> making<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.399> new

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
actually thinking about making a new

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.060 
actually thinking about making a new
channel<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.479> starting<00:01:48.840> fresh<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> the

channel and just starting fresh and the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.770 
channel and just starting fresh and the
reason<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.390> know<00:01:51.630> some

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.090 
reason for that is because you know some
of<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> follow<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.350> Twitter<00:01:52.619> may<00:01:52.829> have
