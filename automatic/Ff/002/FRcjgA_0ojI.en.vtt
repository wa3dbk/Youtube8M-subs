00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey it's tell me what the code guys and

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.900 
hey it's tell me what the code guys and
today<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> be<00:00:02.760> showing<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.419> to

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.680 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
create<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.589> minecraft<00:00:07.589> world<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.300> fairly

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
create a minecraft world that is fairly

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.970 
create a minecraft world that is fairly
flat<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:11.750> this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> seed<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.679> just

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
flat and this is a seed that I just

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.180 
flat and this is a seed that I just
randomly<00:00:14.219> found<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> internet<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:16.190> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
randomly found on the internet that the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.310 
randomly found on the internet that the
spawn<00:00:17.520> point<00:00:17.850> starts<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> fair

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
spawn point starts out with a fair

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.630 
spawn point starts out with a fair
amount<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:20.779> flat<00:00:21.779> space<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.740> not<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.340> most

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
amount of flat space it's not the most

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.599 
amount of flat space it's not the most
that<00:00:24.029> I've<00:00:24.150> ever<00:00:24.390> seen<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.859> does<00:00:26.160> start

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that I've ever seen but it does start

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
more flat land now you can get a mod to

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.209 
more flat land now you can get a mod to
do<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> perfectly<00:01:52.710> flat<00:01:52.860> land<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.920> I'm<00:01:55.920> just

people that are not really interested in
using<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.200> mod<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:02.130> stay<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:03.320> regular<00:02:04.320> seed

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
using a mod to stay in a regular seed

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.119 
using a mod to stay in a regular seed
now<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.770> has<00:02:07.770> desert<00:02:08.729> and
