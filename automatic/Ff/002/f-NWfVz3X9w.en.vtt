forklift batteries this expansion has

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.950 
forklift batteries this expansion has
resulted<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> need<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> very<00:01:48.570> large

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
resulted in a need for a very large

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.609 
resulted in a need for a very large

warehouses these people that have all

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.149 
warehouses these people that have all
these<00:01:56.969> electric<00:01:57.420> forklifts<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.950> their

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
these electric forklifts so their

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.069 
these electric forklifts so their
batteries<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.880> be<00:02:00.000> checked<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.570> serviced

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
batteries can be checked and serviced

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.469 
batteries can be checked and serviced
with<00:02:01.229> battery<00:02:01.619> chem<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.909> life<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.360> these

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
with battery chem so the life of these

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.749 
with battery chem so the life of these
batteries<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.409> extended<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.549> are

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
batteries can be extended there are

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
batteries can be extended there are
actually<00:02:06.360> millions<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.170> these<00:02:07.590> electric

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
actually millions of these electric
