grid<00:00:32.360> now<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.510> you're<00:00:33.630> creating<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.020> grid<00:00:34.290> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
grid now when you're creating a grid you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.680 
grid now when you're creating a grid you
can<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.250> anywhere<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> track<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.390> it's

can do it anywhere in the track but it's

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.740 
can do it anywhere in the track but it's
usually<00:00:36.809> best<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.250> very<00:00:38.430> start

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
usually best to do it at the very start

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
usually best to do it at the very start
so<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.710> ahead<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.219> right

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
notice that in the center is a little

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.740 
notice that in the center is a little
box<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> number<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
box with a number and that is the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.010 
box with a number and that is the
approximate<00:01:07.560> BPM<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> track<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.930> eat

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
approximate BPM of the track I don't eat

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
approximate BPM of the track I don't eat
that<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.290> box<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.490> little

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that little box you have two little

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
that little box you have two little
numbers<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> need<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.380> half

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
numbers and that is if you need to half

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.450 
numbers and that is if you need to half
or<00:01:14.100> double<00:01:14.130> time<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.479> track<00:01:16.340> remember<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
or double time the track remember this

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.160 
or double time the track remember this
is<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.670> approximation<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
is an approximation so I know that this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.120 
is an approximation so I know that this
track<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.650> 128<00:01:20.250> BPM<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> gets<00:01:21.390> 21<00:01:22.130> 27.78

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
track is 128 BPM but it gets 21 27.78

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.749 
track is 128 BPM but it gets 21 27.78
which<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.150> pretty<00:01:24.330> close<00:01:24.950> now<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.130> what

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
which is pretty close now I know what

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
which is pretty close now I know what
the<00:01:26.909> exact<00:01:27.270> ppm<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.960> track<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the exact ppm of this track is so to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
the exact ppm of this track is so to
edit<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.450> ahead<00:01:30.630> and

click on that box I'm going to select
the<00:01:33.479> whole<00:01:33.600> numbers<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.650> i'm<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220

markers that come before it one thing

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.010 
markers that come before it one thing
that's<00:02:34.800> important<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> know<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.550> how<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.570> DJ

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
that's important to know is how one DJ

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.680 
that's important to know is how one DJ
works<00:02:37.350> with<00:02:37.560> these<00:02:37.709> grid<00:02:37.980> markers<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.660> go

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
works with these grid markers so if I go

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.600 
works with these grid markers so if I go
back<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.470> very<00:02:40.650> beginning<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> track

back to the very beginning of the track

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.979 
back to the very beginning of the track
and<00:02:43.430> take<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> look<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.819> our<00:02:44.850> region<00:02:45.390> you'll<00:02:45.780> see

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
and take a look at our region you'll see

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.260 
and take a look at our region you'll see
that<00:02:46.200> there<00:02:46.380> are<00:02:46.410> two<00:02:46.830> arrows<00:02:47.250> here<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
that there are two arrows here on the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.210 
that there are two arrows here on the
left<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.780> right<00:02:48.810> side<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.820> grid<00:02:51.480> region

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
left and right side of the grid region

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.620 
left and right side of the grid region
depending<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.310> how<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.519> have<00:02:53.850> these<00:02:54.120> arrows

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
depending on how you have these arrows

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.750 
depending on how you have these arrows
set<00:02:54.959> up<00:02:55.170> you'll<00:02:55.560> be<00:02:55.620> affecting<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> grid<00:02:56.610> in

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
set up you'll be affecting the grid in

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.960 
set up you'll be affecting the grid in
different<00:02:57.030> ways<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:58.560> example<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.400> set

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
different ways so for example if I set

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.290 
different ways so for example if I set
this<00:03:00.150> arrow<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.410> left<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:02.070> out<00:03:02.280> when<00:03:03.239> I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
this arrow to in and left to out when I

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.870 
this arrow to in and left to out when I
go<00:03:03.480> ahead<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.750> change<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.709> grid<00:03:05.010> you'll<00:03:05.670> see

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
go ahead and change the grid you'll see

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.920 
go ahead and change the grid you'll see
that<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.239> moves<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.810> entirety<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.530> degree

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
that it moves the entirety of degree

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.320 
that it moves the entirety of degree
however<00:03:09.930> if<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.470> then<00:03:10.650> go<00:03:10.980> ahead<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.730> put<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
however if I then go ahead and put the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.140 
however if I then go ahead and put the
left<00:03:12.540> side<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.230> right<00:03:13.800> side<00:03:14.010> out<00:03:14.150> you'll

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
left side in and right side out you'll

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.180 
left side in and right side out you'll
see<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.780> will<00:03:15.930> only<00:03:16.170> affect<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.980> grade

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
see that it will only affect the grade

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.920 
see that it will only affect the grade
