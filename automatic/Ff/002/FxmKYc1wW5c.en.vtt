now attaching it to a keyring is pretty
simple

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
simple

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.900 
simple
all<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.110> need<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.470> do<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.920> well<00:02:24.610> I've<00:02:24.730> taken

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
all you need to do is well I've taken

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.370 
all you need to do is well I've taken
this<00:02:25.180> little<00:02:25.420> key<00:02:25.600> ring<00:02:25.630> here<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.110> attached

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
this little key ring here and attached

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.229 
this little key ring here and attached
some<00:02:26.410> chain<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.489> not<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.670> hard<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
some chain to it it's not that hard and

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.270 
some chain to it it's not that hard and
you'll<00:02:28.330> need<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.660> little<00:02:29.040> jump<00:02:30.040> ring<00:02:30.750> basically

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
you'll need a little jump ring basically

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.300 
you'll need a little jump ring basically
you<00:02:33.280> just<00:02:33.310> take<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.820> ring<00:02:34.030> open<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:35.280> put<00:02:36.280> it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
you just take the ring open it up put it

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.560 
you just take the ring open it up put it
on<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:36.550> link<00:02:36.820> of<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.030> chain<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.739> then<00:02:39.570> you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
on a link of the chain and then you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.290 
on a link of the chain and then you
could<00:02:40.930> take<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.680> put<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.370> any<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
could take it and put it in any of the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.000 
could take it and put it in any of the
little<00:02:43.540> things<00:02:43.570> here<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.620> putting<00:02:44.769> it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
little things here but I like putting it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.199 
little things here but I like putting it
in<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> corner<00:02:45.550> because<00:02:45.730> then<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:45.910> kind<00:02:46.090> of

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
in the corner because then it kind of

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.240 
in the corner because then it kind of
hangs<00:02:46.930> at<00:02:47.110> an<00:02:47.230> angle<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.800> think<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.100> looks

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
hangs at an angle and I think it looks

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.979 
hangs at an angle and I think it looks
kind<00:02:48.489> of<00:02:48.519> cool<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.330> can<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.540> however<00:02:49.750> you

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
kind of cool but you can do however you

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.080 
kind of cool but you can do however you
want<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.190> slip<00:02:51.370> through<00:02:51.700> one<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:51.940> the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
want so just slip through one of the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.259 
want so just slip through one of the
holes<00:02:54.660> close<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.840> off<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.489> like<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.700> tuck<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
holes close it off I like to tuck the

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.000
