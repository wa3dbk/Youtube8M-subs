00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
forward a little bit which gives it a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.860 
forward a little bit which gives it a
sleek<00:02:16.190> design<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.390> have<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.660> navigation

sleek design you have the navigation
here<00:02:18.770> um<00:02:19.270> function<00:02:20.270> one<00:02:20.510> function<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.319> left

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
here um function one function to left

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.610 
here um function one function to left
right<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.819> this<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.599> kind<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.140> like<00:02:24.319> a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
but I'm guessing this is the pen the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.690 
but I'm guessing this is the pen the
stylus<00:02:32.690> as<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.470> would<00:02:33.680> call<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:36.140> know

generally here you would draw with it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.339 
generally here you would draw with it
here<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.540> um<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:43.190> cables<00:02:43.819> here<00:02:44.239> for<00:02:44.810> setup

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
here so um this cables here for setup

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.410 
here so um this cables here for setup
and<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:47.170> imagine<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.800> boot<00:02:49.250> CD<00:02:49.550> so
