00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
squeals but it didn't get caught and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.710 
squeals but it didn't get caught and
here<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.799> goes<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.130> there<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> huge<00:02:31.180> cheer

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.810 
here it goes that there is a huge cheer
going<00:02:32.200> up<00:02:32.410> from<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.920> grandstand

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
going up from the grandstand

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.270 
going up from the grandstand
just<00:02:34.090> opposite<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.810> where<00:02:35.049> Rusty's<00:02:35.620> car<00:02:35.980> has

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
just opposite of where Rusty's car has

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.610 
just opposite of where Rusty's car has
come<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.670> arrest<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.299> we<00:02:37.630> assume<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
come to arrest and we assume that the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.710 
come to arrest and we assume that the
cheers<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.160> because<00:02:39.579> he<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:39.970> out<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> car

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
cheers are because he is out of the car

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.740 
cheers are because he is out of the car
or<00:02:41.290> at<00:02:41.590> least<00:02:41.890> they<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.400> see<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.030> he<00:02:43.209> has

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
or at least they can see that he has

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.190 
or at least they can see that he has
received<00:02:44.170> no<00:02:44.350> serious<00:02:44.799> injuries
