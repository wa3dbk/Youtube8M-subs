to<00:05:06.669> be<00:05:06.730> coarsely<00:05:07.180> ground<00:05:07.450> so<00:05:07.810> we<00:05:07.930> are<00:05:08.200> going<00:05:08.410> to

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
to be coarsely ground so we are going to

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:20.430 
to be coarsely ground so we are going to
use<00:05:08.770> our<00:05:08.980> hand<00:05:09.250> blender<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.790> do<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:20.169> next
