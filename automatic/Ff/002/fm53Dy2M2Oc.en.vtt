 anise oman so without seine-and-marne 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.250
 today of 20 years he started his 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.500

 with the port here I'll have a small 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 parenthesis 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.320
 so he played at roissy-in-brie 2.99 at 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.330
 2006 to go a year precisely 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.910
 from one season to him came out who 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.770
 is also in cinema and from 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.090
 there he was recruited by the hard 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.840
 rock one of the best centers of 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.009
 training of France or even Europe and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.850
 2009 the big manchester united club 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.500
 still separated one recruited him 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.280
 from there he does not have much 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.250
 played he played well his first game on 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.220
 September 20, 2011 Occitan quite accurate 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.930
 so I still have the archives of which he 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.430
 had just replaced in the second half 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 Ryan Giggs Your colleagues figure 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.570
 emblematic of manchester united 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.670
 and during that season that is upon his 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.070
 arrival he was used to this recovery 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.660
 of all competitions 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.970
 by sir alex out of the tawke field 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.280
 manchester united coach 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.680
 and unfortunately for bob our friend 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.340
 Paul hurts his ankle in April 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.920
 2012 and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.580
 so it's safe but fine in quotation marks 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.330
 prematurely at his season and the same 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 month in april 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.890
 lucent alkali he can keep it even if 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.920
 the pop art contract and as a crew member 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.220
 race expires in june 2012 there 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.380
 wants to keep it but he also declares that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.330
 this 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.660
 said himself this boy has a lot of 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:56.390
 potential and he's in the right club 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:58.580
 brief during these injury the rumors 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.750
 run and who wanted to go to the judge 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.190
 in the spring and ferguson play the pine 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.900
 he wanted not actively suspicious 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.810
 rhetoric even wanted 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.560
 extend his contract but in the end on 3 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.810
 August 2012 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.450
 okba engages with the juventus of 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.150
 terrain ground will kill study of 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.610
 wood then there if it's just the explosion 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.100
 of the player it's me I knew him 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.540
 already before I passed farewell on lucas 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.050
 so already he had told me 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.930
 but it's really these machines gets put 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.270
 that a seriously never seen a player 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.310
 we can talk because and because 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.050
 is very young too but a player who 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.420
 has so much potential so you can 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.860
 see it in the pictures cuba en 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.290
 background there the guy is ready y'a 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.510
 no words seriously it's a future 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.690
 very big player 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.090
 and yeah I gave you my opinion for 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.940
 care for his selection in blue gold for 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.280
 me popa it's a phenomenon 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.320
 finally it will really be a phenomenon of 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.750
 football when you played them three four 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.700
 seasons at this level so at the level where he 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.560
 is actually 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.500
 but there is no doubt that I am 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.950
 sure its interesting potential and there 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.930
 the features and the head ends the 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.359
 mental to go much further and 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.350
 the future depends on him if he continues on 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.560
 its momentum 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.360
 he is vain if he does not like 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.010
 some players did it no I did not 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.420
 directly from players who come in 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.060
 head there but here he's not starting to take 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.490
 big to big head 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.830
 frankly if I will not say that far 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.140
 but it's a very big day I was going 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.210
 to say that can be a future zidane in 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.800
 France team 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.630
 but yeah am the city ​​will not be 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.250
 away if they continue like that whose 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.530
 middle Turin so not big 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.460
 chances to compete in the World Cup 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.250
 2014 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.990
 of course our dear team of 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.060
 France manages to validate its ticket 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.040
 for the Brazilian rendezvous for real 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.830
 to say I will not be really surprised 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.960
 that he must not or yet raphael 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.050
 varane so to see 19 years 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.990
 central defender of the real madrid 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.640
 holder now to know when 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.060
 even as a man holder at real madrid 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.260
 I think it would not surprise me that 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.490
 these two embodies the new 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.910
 French generation 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.400
 I would say ultra talented because 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.220
 that frankly period edge 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.870
 varannes like thursday there are plenty of 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.670
 matches him who is the holder 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.150
 incontestable of paris saint germain 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.260
 frankly it would not surprise me that 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.800

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.680
