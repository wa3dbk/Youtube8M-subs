00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 and that where people who are less video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.710
 more than what promises to record two today is 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
 we come as we have called bull 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.349
 craft which allows us to have is like 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.000
 a complement in industrial craft but 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.310
 since the industrial craft has not been able 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 to leave even because it has not left many of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.740
 seen many videos that say industrial 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 craft 1.4 point 5 but I do not work 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.010
 I'm telling you because you 've downloaded all 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.519
 those fucking videos that say it's the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.099
 1.4 point 5 but since it is not so 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.420
 came out can you believe when I say it 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.489
 it has not come out I have a page 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.960
 reliable and no is not mini craft forum 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.850
 because he is in English and I hate 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.290
 English words that I understand but 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.660
 well I have a page where always 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.850
 the most up-to-date ones came up and they did not come out 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 industry the krafft number two for one 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.879
 in point 4.5 without more from a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.770
 integration of many are going to 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.399
 percentage I tell you at the beginning then 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.539
 search percentage data percentage 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.920
 from now on I'm telling you that 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.289
 they need the minicar itself so 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.110
 are in some notation here in a 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.720
 YouTube screen 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.790
 usually click and so the video and 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.160
 well let's go to mini craft then 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
 when I touch minicar force leave this 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.130
 folder called moto the only thing you have 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.600
 what to do is put witchcraft file 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.690
 here now I will show you 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.870
 how they see mini craft 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.090
 much 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.580
 soon I'll make a pack of motorcycles so if 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.190
 you want to cut us click on I like it and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 I do not want to comment on them apart 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.280
 will be about 40 or 30 much here is the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.880
 that I said in front of the previous video the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.880
 they went in chains 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.880
 I did not just put you here 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:48.229
 as you can see they are five modes in one but 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.329
 let's show them what it is 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.610
 basically does the bully camps that is 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.789
 like the industry the good krafft one of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.250
 the mobilities that I like the most 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.429
 industrial craft code of the wild craft is 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.679
 this one that was left to build here because 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.179
 I just started a world and well it's not 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.090
 played minecraft long time because no 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.670
 It has a lot of time but good I do what 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.650
 what can I do with what you have and this is 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.450
 and what's good for me as 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 important in the engine 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.290
 for me this is the most important thing that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.870
 I can do it in the tree craft 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.410
 call aquarium quarry as you 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.300
 want to call 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.209
 but good basically what is this 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.050
 machine is what does the whole miner do 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.700
 mining for you or mining for you and 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.709
 this sun is one of the machines that 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.120
 you can do with the kraft that between the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.280
 day the machine is these are engines that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.620
 you also have to be and carbon version 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.010
 but good with the kraft you can do 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.780
 gears this is your tube is for 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.750
 transport things depending on what you 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.760
 you want keys can be wells weight 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.150
 of oil machines such as table 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.959
 architect and many things trick the no 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.269
 that you do not see items doing things there 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:08.459
 all this is this 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.860
 and as guys it's basically what he does 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.130
 this will add machines especially 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.290
 machines there for what 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.410
 but it would need to be the industrial craft 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.200
 wall to update good if you want 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.340
 all kind of machinery very good 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.290
 I would need without industrial craft which 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.810
 just leave because I will not install 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.030
 just leave because I occupy it I need it 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.700
 and I have a lot of fun with him having 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.650
 sawyers compressors and a lot of 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.480
 things which make minecraft 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.920
 what makes one have fun in 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.630
 minecraft sea 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.010
 to do interesting things because 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.560
 just be with the real minecraft 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.870
 force itself bores a lot and I say that 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.610
 happens is because it bores a lot like the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.099
 what he does is to mine only the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.560
 strips friendly tubes and as you see from 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.120
 the work of mining for you can not go 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.500
 extending to wherever you want by 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 example if you want to put a new trunk 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.950
 you just put this here and good is going to go 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.540
 for there 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.020
 good it seems that everything comes here 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.020
 but good 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.780
 no no no no no no I lost control signals 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.740
