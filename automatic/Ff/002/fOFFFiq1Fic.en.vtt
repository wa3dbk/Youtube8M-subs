00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
actually an acting role play now they

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.820 
actually an acting role play now they
could<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.730> narrative<00:00:20.730> devices<00:00:21.439> they<00:00:22.439> could<00:00:22.650> be

could be narrative devices they could be

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.609 
could be narrative devices they could be
accents<00:00:23.820> imitations<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> they<00:00:25.380> could<00:00:25.529> be

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
accents imitations and they could be

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
accents imitations and they could be
metaphors<00:00:26.160> Pettiford<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:26.939> could<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.240> staged

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000 
monologues the list goes on and on and
on<00:00:32.820> there's<00:00:33.270> lots<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.870> ways<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.710> use

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
on there's lots of ways you can use

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.760 
on there's lots of ways you can use
these<00:00:35.309> techniques<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.600> enact<00:00:36.930> good<00:00:37.230> roleplay

these techniques to enact good roleplay

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
these techniques to enact good roleplay
now<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> tool<00:00:38.940> set<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.149> important<00:00:39.750> because

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
now the tool set is important because

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.250 
now the tool set is important because
the<00:00:40.290> more<00:00:40.320> tools<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.160> at<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.640> disposal

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
the more tools you have at your disposal

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.420 
the more tools you have at your disposal
the<00:00:43.260> greater<00:00:43.530> depth<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> be

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the greater depth you're going to be

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
the greater depth you're going to be
able<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> use<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> actually<00:00:46.190> assemble

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
able to use when you actually assemble

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.840 
able to use when you actually assemble
that<00:00:47.399> scene<00:00:48.649> now<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:50.010> leads<00:00:50.250> unto<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that scene now this leads unto the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.540 
that scene now this leads unto the
second<00:00:51.360> key<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:52.440> these<00:00:52.469> keys<00:00:52.920> build<00:00:53.250> upon

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
second key and all these keys build upon

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
second key and all these keys build upon
each<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.899> second<00:00:55.320> key<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.680> being

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
each other and the second key is being

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180 
each other and the second key is being
able<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.640> choose<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.690> right<00:00:57.989> tool<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:59.129> your

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
able to choose the right tool from your

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.000 
able to choose the right tool from your
toolset<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.109> wide<00:01:01.590> array

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
toolset so if you have this wide array

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.820 
toolset so if you have this wide array
of<00:01:02.039> tools<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.539> need<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.809> figure<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.290> how

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of tools you now need to figure out how

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.490 
of tools you now need to figure out how
to<00:01:04.860> decide<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.869> time<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> use

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to decide when is the right time to use

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.429 
to decide when is the right time to use
a<00:01:07.710> particular<00:01:08.040> tool<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.479> takes<00:01:09.810> experience

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
a particular tool this takes experience

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
a particular tool this takes experience
it<00:01:11.070> takes<00:01:12.710> experimentation<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> here's<00:01:15.060> an

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it takes experimentation so here's an

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
it takes experimentation so here's an
example<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> time<00:01:16.080> where<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.590> might<00:01:16.860> not

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
example of a time where you might not

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
example of a time where you might not
want<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> tool<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> person

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
want to use a tool if you're a person

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
want to use a tool if you're a person
that<00:01:19.530> likes<00:01:19.830> using<00:01:20.240> cinematography

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
that likes using cinematography

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.679 
that likes using cinematography
something<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.020> cut<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:23.880> person<00:01:24.509> gets

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
something like a cut to a person gets

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
something like a cut to a person gets
attacked<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> war<00:01:26.130> hammer<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.670> hammer

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
attacked with a war hammer the hammer

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.819 
attacked with a war hammer the hammer
comes<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.390> bearing<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.170> their<00:01:28.380> head<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
comes down bearing on their head and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
comes down bearing on their head and
then<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> cut<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> scene<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.329> say<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
then you cut the scene and you say a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
then you cut the scene and you say a
melon<00:01:31.229> explodes<00:01:33.290> you've<00:01:34.290> used<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.710> cinematic

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
melon explodes you've used a cinematic

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
melon explodes you've used a cinematic
technique<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.659> don't<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.350> do

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
technique now what you don't want to do

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.399 
technique now what you don't want to do
is<00:01:37.770> use<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.610> technique<00:01:39.270> over<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.990> over<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
is use that technique over and over and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.120 
is use that technique over and over and
over<00:01:40.920> again<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.689> same<00:01:42.899> game<00:01:43.259> scene<00:01:43.770> after

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
over again in the same game scene after

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.620 
over again in the same game scene after
scene<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> begin<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> water<00:01:45.420> down

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
scene because you begin to water down

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.440 
scene because you begin to water down
the<00:01:45.689> effect<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.970> than<00:01:48.149> just

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the effect so it's more than just

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.749 
the effect so it's more than just
looking<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.290> single<00:01:49.740> situation<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
looking at that single situation it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.609 
looking at that single situation it
requires<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.630> look<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> whole<00:01:52.350> game

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
requires you to look at the whole game

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.770 
requires you to look at the whole game
what<00:01:53.070> you've<00:01:53.250> done<00:01:53.430> before<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
what you've done before and what you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
what you've done before and what you
plan<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.020> doing<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.500> future<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.369> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
plan on doing in the future and this is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
plan on doing in the future and this is
tricky<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.689> important<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
tricky but it's really important to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.300 
tricky but it's really important to
start<00:01:58.409> thinking<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.490> way<00:02:01.250> now<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
start thinking of it in that way now the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.969 
start thinking of it in that way now the

way<00:04:07.080> you're<00:04:07.260> trying<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.650> implement<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.130> skill

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
way you're trying to implement the skill

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.080 
way you're trying to implement the skill
now<00:04:10.049> this<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.829> all<00:04:10.980> pretty<00:04:11.250> basic<00:04:11.430> stuff<00:04:11.730> right

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
now this is all pretty basic stuff right

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.650 
now this is all pretty basic stuff right
the<00:04:12.989> reason<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.680> lay<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.070> out<00:04:14.220> in<00:04:14.610> these<00:04:15.060> three

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
the reason I lay it out in these three

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.940 
the reason I lay it out in these three
different<00:04:15.870> keys<00:04:16.260> are<00:04:16.530> these<00:04:16.650> three<00:04:16.919> different

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
different keys are these three different

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.500 
different keys are these three different
steps<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.760> are<00:04:17.820> built<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.060> top<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.299> each

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
steps that are built on top of each

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.319 
steps that are built on top of each
other<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:19.070> because<00:04:20.070> when<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.640> play<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.120> game

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
other is because when you play in a game

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.409 
other is because when you play in a game
and<00:04:21.660> something<00:04:22.320> goes<00:04:22.590> horribly<00:04:22.919> wrong<00:04:23.419> you're

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
and something goes horribly wrong you're

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.300 
and something goes horribly wrong you're
gonna<00:04:24.539> know<00:04:24.810> what<00:04:24.990> went<00:04:25.169> wrong<00:04:25.229> which<00:04:26.130> you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
gonna know what went wrong which you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.129 
gonna know what went wrong which you
might<00:04:26.580> not<00:04:26.820> know

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
might not know

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.969 
might not know
right<00:04:27.259> away<00:04:27.379> is<00:04:27.770> where<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.669> went<00:04:28.879> wrong

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
right away is where it went wrong

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.070 
right away is where it went wrong
because<00:04:30.979> it<00:04:31.219> can<00:04:31.370> fail<00:04:31.669> at<00:04:31.969> either<00:04:32.659> of<00:04:32.900> these

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
because it can fail at either of these

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.659 
because it can fail at either of these
three<00:04:33.289> stuff<00:04:33.590> so<00:04:33.830> normally<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.400> at<00:04:34.520> the

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
three stuff so normally it's at the

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.300 
three stuff so normally it's at the
later<00:04:34.879> two<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:38.270> need<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.710> watch<00:04:39.710> what<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.009> did

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
later two you need to watch what you did

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.929 
later two you need to watch what you did
and<00:04:40.520> honestly<00:04:41.509> ask<00:04:41.749> yourself<00:04:42.520> did<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:43.909> a

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
and honestly ask yourself did I have a

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.050 
and honestly ask yourself did I have a
tool<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:44.330> really<00:04:44.749> fit<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.110> situation<00:04:46.060> did

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
tool that really fit that situation did

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.779 
tool that really fit that situation did
I<00:04:47.150> choose<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.719> right<00:04:47.900> tool<00:04:48.110> or<00:04:48.800> was<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.729> just

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
I choose the right tool or was that just

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.330 
I choose the right tool or was that just
a<00:04:50.060> matter<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.449> me<00:04:50.870> not<00:04:51.199> being<00:04:51.560> able<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:52.069> pull

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
a matter of me not being able to pull

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.779 
a matter of me not being able to pull
the<00:04:52.520> tool<00:04:52.729> off<00:04:54.039> because<00:04:55.039> your<00:04:55.219> answer<00:04:55.580> that

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
the tool off because your answer that

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.189 
the tool off because your answer that
question<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.300> going<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.509> inform<00:04:56.930> where<00:04:57.110> you

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
question is going to inform where you

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.640 
question is going to inform where you
need<00:04:57.349> to<00:04:57.409> put<00:04:57.590> in<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.800> work<00:04:57.979> and<00:04:58.370> this<00:04:59.270> is<00:04:59.650> so

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
need to put in the work and this is so

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.429 
need to put in the work and this is so
so<00:05:01.159> so<00:05:01.520> important<00:05:02.240> especially<00:05:02.569> to<00:05:02.990> your<00:05:03.110> ego

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
so so important especially to your ego

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.429 
so so important especially to your ego
because<00:05:04.129> we<00:05:04.430> need<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.669> realize<00:05:05.319> when<00:05:06.319> we're

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
because we need to realize when we're

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.869 
because we need to realize when we're
trying<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.740> improve<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.189> something<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.550> role

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
trying to improve it something like role

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.149 
trying to improve it something like role
play<00:05:08.090> it's<00:05:08.990> not<00:05:09.229> going<00:05:09.439> to<00:05:09.529> be<00:05:09.680> complete

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
play it's not going to be complete

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.159 
play it's not going to be complete
success<00:05:10.550> or<00:05:10.699> complete<00:05:11.060> failure<00:05:11.419> we're<00:05:12.080> gonna

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
success or complete failure we're gonna

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.350 
success or complete failure we're gonna
have<00:05:12.379> a<00:05:12.409> lot<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.770> minor<00:05:13.039> successes<00:05:13.729> for

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
have a lot of minor successes for

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.029 
have a lot of minor successes for
instance<00:05:14.719> when<00:05:15.020> you<00:05:15.139> just<00:05:15.349> start<00:05:15.590> out<00:05:15.740> at

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
instance when you just start out at

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.619 
instance when you just start out at
trying<00:05:16.520> to<00:05:16.580> become<00:05:16.849> a<00:05:16.879> better<00:05:17.060> role<00:05:17.360> player

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
trying to become a better role player

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.269 
trying to become a better role player
and<00:05:17.870> actually<00:05:18.169> putting<00:05:18.529> a<00:05:18.680> lot<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.949> effort

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
and actually putting a lot of effort

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.950 
and actually putting a lot of effort
into<00:05:19.430> that<00:05:19.639> you're<00:05:20.449> going<00:05:20.750> to<00:05:20.779> notice<00:05:21.139> that

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
into that you're going to notice that

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.510 
into that you're going to notice that
simply<00:05:23.960> knowing<00:05:24.319> when<00:05:24.589> to<00:05:24.620> do<00:05:24.949> something<00:05:25.339> cool

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
simply knowing when to do something cool

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.839 
simply knowing when to do something cool
or<00:05:25.759> when<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.300> do<00:05:26.419> something<00:05:26.749> effective<00:05:27.229> is

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
or when to do something effective is

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.029 
or when to do something effective is
really<00:05:28.849> really<00:05:29.270> important<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.529> fact<00:05:30.770> that

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
really really important the fact that

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.499 
really really important the fact that
you're<00:05:31.219> able<00:05:31.339> to<00:05:31.520> know<00:05:31.819> what<00:05:32.120> would<00:05:32.300> work

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
you're able to know what would work

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.320 
you're able to know what would work
there<00:05:32.810> is<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.319> huge<00:05:33.740> triumph<00:05:34.180> regardless<00:05:35.180> of

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
there is a huge triumph regardless of

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.300 
there is a huge triumph regardless of
you<00:05:35.419> can<00:05:35.569> actually<00:05:35.870> pull<00:05:36.080> it<00:05:36.199> off<00:05:36.319> or<00:05:36.500> not<00:05:36.680> it

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
you can actually pull it off or not it

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.189 
you can actually pull it off or not it
doesn't<00:05:38.029> matter<00:05:38.180> how<00:05:38.479> good<00:05:38.689> of<00:05:38.719> a<00:05:38.810> role<00:05:38.990> player

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
doesn't matter how good of a role player

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.829 
doesn't matter how good of a role player
you<00:05:39.439> are<00:05:39.469> you<00:05:40.129> will<00:05:40.400> unskillful<00:05:41.330> we<00:05:41.389> do<00:05:41.539> things

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:41.839 
you are you will unskillful we do things

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.610 
you are you will unskillful we do things
that's<00:05:42.589> gonna<00:05:42.830> happen

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
that's gonna happen

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.260 
that's gonna happen
so<00:05:45.620> being<00:05:45.889> able<00:05:45.949> to<00:05:46.099> take<00:05:46.339> partial<00:05:46.879> successes

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
so being able to take partial successes

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.209 
so being able to take partial successes
from<00:05:47.509> your<00:05:47.719> failures<00:05:48.139> is<00:05:48.349> going<00:05:48.949> to<00:05:49.069> go<00:05:49.189> a

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
from your failures is going to go a

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.850 
from your failures is going to go a
tremendous<00:05:50.029> distance<00:05:50.599> and<00:05:50.870> giving<00:05:51.649> you<00:05:51.740> the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
tremendous distance and giving you the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.089 
tremendous distance and giving you the
inspiration<00:05:52.430> you<00:05:52.460> need<00:05:52.729> to<00:05:52.789> finish<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.270> task

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
inspiration you need to finish the task

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.939 
inspiration you need to finish the task
so<00:05:55.270> this<00:05:56.270> was<00:05:56.449> a<00:05:56.479> fast<00:05:56.839> video<00:05:57.080> I<00:05:57.289> think<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:57.830> was

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
so this was a fast video I think it was

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.829 
so this was a fast video I think it was
a<00:05:57.979> little<00:05:58.159> bit<00:05:58.370> more<00:05:58.490> high<00:05:58.729> octane<00:05:59.180> than<00:05:59.719> I

00:05:59.829 --> 00:05:59.839 
a little bit more high octane than I

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.649
