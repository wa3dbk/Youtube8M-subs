where<00:01:29.619> they<00:01:29.889> developed<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.670> our<00:01:31.149> facility<00:01:31.689> an

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
where they developed it our facility an

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.599 
where they developed it our facility an
Oregon<00:01:32.200> Thunder<00:01:32.530> ranch<00:01:32.709> is<00:01:32.889> actually<00:01:33.219> a<00:01:33.280> green

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
Oregon Thunder ranch is actually a green

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.270 
Oregon Thunder ranch is actually a green
facility<00:01:34.179> by<00:01:34.329> that<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.539> mean<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:34.959> shoot

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
facility by that I mean we shoot

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.129 
facility by that I mean we shoot
frangible<00:01:36.280> lead-free<00:01:36.819> ammunition<00:01:37.119> well<00:01:37.899> then

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
frangible lead-free ammunition well then

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.139 
frangible lead-free ammunition well then
on<00:01:38.350> top<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:38.920> besides<00:01:39.069> being<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.639> really<00:01:39.939> good

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
on top of it besides being a really good

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.239 
on top of it besides being a really good
defensive<00:01:40.749> load<00:01:40.990> what's<00:01:41.499> happened<00:01:41.859> is<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
defensive load what's happened is the

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.489 
defensive load what's happened is the
DPX<00:01:42.789> load<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.209> we<00:01:43.299> make<00:01:43.509> falls<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.469> that

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
DPX load that we make falls on that

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.050 
DPX load that we make falls on that
criteria<00:01:44.859> because<00:01:45.249> there's<00:01:45.399> no<00:01:45.520> heavy<00:01:45.729> metals

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
criteria because there's no heavy metals

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.819 
criteria because there's no heavy metals
in<00:01:46.179> it<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:46.450> we<00:01:46.569> can<00:01:46.749> shoot<00:01:46.959> the<00:01:47.139> copper<00:01:47.560> and

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
in it so we can shoot the copper and

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.069 
in it so we can shoot the copper and
we're<00:01:47.979> not<00:01:48.189> causing<00:01:48.459> any<00:01:48.759> problems<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.329> lot

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
we're not causing any problems and a lot

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.709 
we're not causing any problems and a lot
of<00:01:50.109> that<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.469> political<00:01:50.979> correctness<00:01:51.399> and

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
of that is political correctness and

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.179 
of that is political correctness and
bullcrap<00:01:52.719> everybody<00:01:53.259> knows<00:01:53.439> that<00:01:53.590> but<00:01:54.100> at<00:01:54.159> the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
bullcrap everybody knows that but at the

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.709 
bullcrap everybody knows that but at the
same<00:01:54.429> time<00:01:54.670> it's<00:01:54.880> still<00:01:55.029> our<00:01:55.209> facilities<00:01:55.689> so

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
same time it's still our facilities so

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.469 
same time it's still our facilities so
we<00:01:55.899> opted<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.770> do<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.159> so<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.909> way<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.270> could

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
we opted to do that so that way we could

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.690 
we opted to do that so that way we could
sort<00:01:59.349> of<00:01:59.409> preempt<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.889> argument<00:02:00.369> before<00:02:00.459> it

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
sort of preempt that argument before it

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.069 
sort of preempt that argument before it
started<00:02:01.029> where<00:02:01.209> someone<00:02:01.479> goes<00:02:01.630> hey<00:02:01.779> you<00:02:01.840> know

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
started where someone goes hey you know

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.629 
started where someone goes hey you know
you're<00:02:02.259> like<00:02:02.469> polluting<00:02:02.920> no<00:02:03.099> actually<00:02:03.490> we're

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
you're like polluting no actually we're

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.809 
you're like polluting no actually we're
not

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
not

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.849 
not
and<00:02:03.999> the<00:02:04.240> DPX<00:02:04.779> is<00:02:04.959> not<00:02:05.139> only<00:02:05.319> won<00:02:05.529> a<00:02:05.560> really

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
and the DPX is not only won a really

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.370 
and the DPX is not only won a really
serviceable<00:02:06.609> load<00:02:07.299> but<00:02:07.779> it<00:02:07.899> fulfills<00:02:08.229> that

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
serviceable load but it fulfills that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.230 
serviceable load but it fulfills that
criteria<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.250> that's<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.610> reason<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:09.940> we

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
criteria and that's the reason that we

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.559 
criteria and that's the reason that we
help<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.840> was<00:02:11.080> one<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.350> thing

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
help that was one of the thing

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.170 
help that was one of the thing
helped<00:02:11.870> us<00:02:11.959> pick<00:02:12.109> that<00:02:12.260> process<00:02:12.739> yep<00:02:13.310> exactly

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
helped us pick that process yep exactly

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.420 
helped us pick that process yep exactly
I<00:02:14.209> think<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.049> DPX<00:02:15.650> load<00:02:15.859> has<00:02:16.040> been<00:02:16.159> really

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
I think that DPX load has been really

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.129 
I think that DPX load has been really
successful<00:02:16.639> for<00:02:16.999> the<00:02:17.180> school<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.019> know

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
successful for the school and you know

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.949 
successful for the school and you know
bluntly<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:19.069> only<00:02:19.400> do<00:02:19.519> like<00:02:19.700> 400<00:02:20.359> people<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.749> year

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
bluntly I only do like 400 people a year

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.330 
bluntly I only do like 400 people a year
so<00:02:21.170> it's<00:02:21.319> not<00:02:21.409> like<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.920> know<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:22.099> doing

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
so it's not like you know I'm doing

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.670 
so it's not like you know I'm doing
4,000<00:02:22.969> people<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.389> the<00:02:23.569> product<00:02:24.319> line<00:02:24.499> is

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
4,000 people but the product line is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.530 
4,000 people but the product line is
still<00:02:24.889> accepted<00:02:25.370> well<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:26.329> look

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
still accepted well and then we look

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.319 
still accepted well and then we look
forward<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> future<00:02:27.609> making<00:02:28.609> a<00:02:28.730> small

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
forward to in the future making a small

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.330 
forward to in the future making a small
caliber<00:02:29.599> rifle<00:02:30.230> line<00:02:30.409> probably<00:02:30.709> like<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.159> two

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
caliber rifle line probably like in two

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.849 
caliber rifle line probably like in two
to<00:02:31.459> three<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.819> using<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.239> same<00:02:32.859> components

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
to three and using that same components

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.770 
to three and using that same components
so<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.189> we<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.549> have<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.030> lead<00:02:35.359> free<00:02:35.569> thing

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
so that we can have the lead free thing

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.809 
so that we can have the lead free thing
kind<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.109> going<00:02:36.319> for<00:02:36.500> us<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.769> still<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.639> could

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
kind of going for us and still you could

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.099 
kind of going for us and still you could
actually<00:02:38.000> shoot<00:02:38.359> it<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.659> fulfil<00:02:39.079> that

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
actually shoot it in fulfil that

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.809 
actually shoot it in fulfil that
criteria<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:39.859> still<00:02:40.069> have<00:02:40.219> a<00:02:40.250> really<00:02:40.519> good

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
criteria but still have a really good

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.459 
criteria but still have a really good
defensive<00:02:41.239> load<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.659> that's<00:02:42.049> some<00:02:42.230> day<00:02:42.349> we

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
defensive load so that's some day we

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.409 
defensive load so that's some day we
look<00:02:42.620> forward<00:02:42.919> to<00:02:43.129> probably<00:02:43.700> even<00:02:43.969> can<00:02:44.150> go<00:02:44.299> up

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.419 
look forward to probably even can go up

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.349 
look forward to probably even can go up
into<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.810> 308<00:02:45.109> caliber<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.889> that's<00:02:46.669> something

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
into the 308 caliber so that's something

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.940 
into the 308 caliber so that's something
that<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.569> look<00:02:47.599> forward<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.079> in<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.739> future

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
that we look forward to in the future

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.709 
that we look forward to in the future
and<00:02:49.549> I<00:02:49.730> think<00:02:49.760> that'd<00:02:50.060> make<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.269> great<00:02:50.510> addition

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
and I think that'd make a great addition

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.590 
and I think that'd make a great addition
within<00:02:51.199> the<00:02:51.260> family
