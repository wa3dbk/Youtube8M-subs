00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
cage off because that's when the cork

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.200 
cage off because that's when the cork
can<00:01:06.140> fly<00:01:06.380> out<00:01:06.579> pull<00:01:07.579> the<00:01:07.670> napkin<00:01:08.000> over<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.329> top

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
can fly out pull the napkin over the top

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.730 
can fly out pull the napkin over the top
switch<00:01:11.210> your<00:01:11.360> grip<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.750> thumb<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.110> forefinger

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
switch your grip to thumb and forefinger

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.429 
switch your grip to thumb and forefinger
and<00:01:13.060> now<00:01:14.060> because<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.659> bottom<00:01:14.960> of<00:01:15.079> the<00:01:15.140> bottle

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
and now because the bottom of the bottle

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.260 
and now because the bottom of the bottle
has<00:01:15.649> a<00:01:15.680> greater<00:01:16.009> circumference<00:01:16.610> in<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.969> cork

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
has a greater circumference in the cork

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.030 
has a greater circumference in the cork
you<00:01:17.899> have<00:01:17.990> better<00:01:18.170> leverage<00:01:18.409> if<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:18.710> turn<00:01:18.890> the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
you have better leverage if you turn the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.100 
you have better leverage if you turn the
bottle<00:01:19.159> so<00:01:19.700> I'm<00:01:19.790> holding<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.240> cork<00:01:20.509> but

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
bottle so I'm holding the cork but

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.109 
bottle so I'm holding the cork but
turning<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.560> bottle<00:01:21.920> usually<00:01:22.579> turn<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
turning the bottle usually turn the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.840 
turning the bottle usually turn the
bottle<00:01:23.329> towards<00:01:23.689> me<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.229> as<00:01:25.100> soon<00:01:25.189> as<00:01:25.399> I<00:01:25.579> feel

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
bottle towards me and as soon as I feel

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.370 
bottle towards me and as soon as I feel
the<00:01:26.000> cork<00:01:26.270> starting<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.630> push<00:01:26.810> its<00:01:26.960> way<00:01:27.049> out

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
the cork starting to push its way out

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.520 
the cork starting to push its way out
I'm<00:01:27.710> going<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.579> hold<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.909> cork<00:01:29.180> in<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.439> I'm

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'm going to hold the cork in so I'm

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.170 
I'm going to hold the cork in so I'm
holding<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.920> cork<00:01:31.159> I<00:01:31.280> feel<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:31.640> pushing<00:01:32.000> now

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
holding the cork I feel it pushing now

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.020 
holding the cork I feel it pushing now
I'm<00:01:32.420> holding<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.110> tightly<00:01:33.700> because<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.880> don't

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
I'm holding it tightly because I don't

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.929 
I'm holding it tightly because I don't
want<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.329> pop<00:01:35.360> out<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.289> you<00:01:37.159> want<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.490> just

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
want it to pop out and you want it just

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.170 
want it to pop out and you want it just
to<00:01:38.119> come<00:01:38.390> out<00:01:38.619> gently<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.770> slowly<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.759> get

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
to come out gently and slowly so you get

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:50.410 
to come out gently and slowly so you get
a<00:01:41.360> little<00:01:41.659> bit<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.930> noise<00:01:42.049> like<00:01:43.039> this<00:01:49.420> there

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
a little bit of a noise like this there

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.950 
a little bit of a noise like this there
you<00:01:50.450> go

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
you go

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.260 
you go
the<00:01:51.530> first<00:01:51.829> time<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.490> put<00:01:52.700> any<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.090> wine

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
the first time you put any of the wine

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.749 
the first time you put any of the wine
into<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.509> glass<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:54.259> foams<00:01:54.740> up<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.100> lot<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:55.700> you

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
into the glass it foams up a lot so you

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.240 
into the glass it foams up a lot so you
do<00:01:55.939> what's<00:01:56.119> called<00:01:56.270> priming<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.960> glass<00:01:57.250> and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
do what's called priming the glass and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.240 
do what's called priming the glass and
you<00:01:58.429> pour<00:01:58.789> it<00:01:58.820> in<00:01:59.060> just<00:01:59.689> enough<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:00.979> foams

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
you pour it in just enough so it foams

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.940 
you pour it in just enough so it foams
up<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:04.179> then<00:02:05.179> you<00:02:05.329> stop<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.090> stop

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
up and then you stop so you stop

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.270 
up and then you stop so you stop
wait<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> minute<00:02:11.280> until<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.670> goes<00:02:12.120> back<00:02:12.390> down

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
wait a minute until it goes back down

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.760
