there's<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.800> paint<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.640> converted

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
there's to this paint can be converted

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.440 
there's to this paint can be converted
to<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:33.420> ways<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.059> like

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
to see ways like a but this the like

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.880 
to see ways like a but this the like
this<00:00:36.690> high<00:00:36.930> current<00:00:37.590> height<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:39.710> like<00:00:40.710> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
this high current height here like this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.139 
this high current height here like this
height<00:00:41.190> where<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.640> convert<00:00:41.820> into<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
height where you can convert into a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.810 
height where you can convert into a
table<00:00:42.510> faint<00:00:42.719> body<00:00:42.930> I'll<00:00:43.739> show<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
so you can loosen this by unscrewing it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
so you can loosen this by unscrewing it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
base here or this to the head to the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.510 
base here or this to the head to the
head<00:00:59.539> I'm<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> shoot<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.440> back<00:01:01.620> here

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.260

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
you get the question tiny because a job

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.050 
you get the question tiny because a job
proofs<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:14.900> for<00:01:15.900> safety<00:01:16.440> safety<00:01:17.280> reasons

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
proofs which for safety safety reasons

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.220 
proofs which for safety safety reasons
so<00:01:18.620> there's<00:01:19.620> a<00:01:19.710> good<00:01:19.890> cool<00:01:20.160> future<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.230> we

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
so there's a good cool future and we

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.560 
so there's a good cool future and we
I'll<00:01:22.680> try<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> find<00:01:23.400> both<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.730> sketch<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.540> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
I'll try to find both the sketch when I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
I'll try to find both the sketch when I
find<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.140> keep<00:01:25.620> growing<00:01:25.860> art<00:01:26.130> sales<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:28.410> this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
find I keep growing art sales and this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.150 
find I keep growing art sales and this
the<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.880> new<00:01:30.450> date<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.380> new<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> little

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
the the new date the new one is a little

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.760 
the the new date the new one is a little
bit<00:01:32.370> different<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:32.910> this<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.710> by<00:01:34.710> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
bit different from this one here by this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.880 
bit different from this one here by this
because<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> blaze<00:01:35.850> our<00:01:36.360> white<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
because the blaze our white this is a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.070 
because the blaze our white this is a
highly<00:01:38.160> well<00:01:38.340> Honeywell<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.300> so<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:39.930> how

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
highly well Honeywell here so that's how

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.880 
highly well Honeywell here so that's how
they're<00:01:40.260> different

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
they're different

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:55.310 
they're different
now<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> pick<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:43.970> tripod<00:01:45.740> on<00:01:46.740> chart<00:01:54.140> ok<00:01:55.140> later

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
now I pick this tripod on chart ok later

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.100 
now I pick this tripod on chart ok later
on

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.790 

so<00:02:04.110> here's<00:02:04.470> high<00:02:05.360> without<00:02:06.360> oscillation

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.430 

anyways<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.100> thing<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.850> go<00:02:12.120> down<00:02:12.300> here

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
anyways this thing this can go down here

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.400 
anyways this thing this can go down here
it<00:02:13.440> has<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> chopper<00:02:14.640> real<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:16.260> your
