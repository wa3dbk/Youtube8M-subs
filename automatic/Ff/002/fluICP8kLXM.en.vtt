coat i think it's nearly a one coder but

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
coat i think it's nearly a one coder but
i<00:00:29.699> just<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> few<00:00:30.539> bald<00:00:30.869> spots<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.439> i'm

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
one covers completely on two coats so it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
one covers completely on two coats so it
was<00:00:51.960> nearly<00:00:52.410> opaque<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.879> second<00:00:54.210> coat

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
holographic but this has multi chroma

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.710 
holographic but this has multi chroma
flakies<00:01:17.980> mixed<00:01:18.310> into<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.270> here<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.540> one

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
flakies mixed into it so here is one

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.280 
flakies mixed into it so here is one
coat<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.850> this<00:01:22.030> one<00:01:22.210> covers<00:01:22.570> pretty<00:01:22.870> well<00:01:23.080> on

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
coat so this one covers pretty well on

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.780 
coat so this one covers pretty well on
the<00:01:23.380> first<00:01:23.590> coat<00:01:23.830> it's<00:01:24.040> still<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.250> little<00:01:24.580> bit

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
the first coat it's still a little bit

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.250 
the first coat it's still a little bit
sheer<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.450> going<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.660> need<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> second

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
sheer so it is going to need a second

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.380 
sheer so it is going to need a second
the<00:01:26.620> formula<00:01:27.040> 1's<00:01:27.340> like<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.790> last<00:01:27.970> one<00:01:28.090> is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
the formula 1's like the last one is

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.900 
the formula 1's like the last one is
very<00:01:28.690> smooth<00:01:29.170> very<00:01:29.440> easy<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.310> apply<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.670> does

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
very smooth very easy to apply it does

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.550 
I'm really happy to see how well those
multi<00:01:45.880> chrome<00:01:46.119> flakies<00:01:46.479> stand<00:01:46.840> out<00:01:47.020> amongst

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
multi chrome flakies stand out amongst

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.170 
multi chrome flakies stand out amongst
the<00:01:47.590> hollow<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:48.130> lot<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.580> times<00:01:48.760> when<00:01:48.910> you<00:01:49.030> mix

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the hollow a lot of times when you mix

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.300 
the hollow a lot of times when you mix
things<00:01:49.479> in<00:01:49.720> with<00:01:50.140> hollow<00:01:50.380> polishes<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.130> can

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
things in with hollow polishes you can

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.740 
things in with hollow polishes you can
lose<00:01:51.490> them<00:01:51.670> because<00:01:52.180> there's<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:52.450> much<00:01:52.570> going

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
lose them because there's so much going

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.570 
lose them because there's so much going
on<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.260> linear<00:01:53.440> hollow<00:01:53.770> in<00:01:54.040> general<00:01:54.430> but

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
on in a linear hollow in general but

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.340 
on in a linear hollow in general but
these<00:01:54.760> actually<00:01:55.060> stand<00:01:55.330> out<00:01:55.479> really<00:01:55.750> well<00:01:55.869> so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
these actually stand out really well so

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.300 
these actually stand out really well so
there<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.619> two<00:01:56.860> coats<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.369> it's<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.790> secret

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.520 

and<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:04.090> last<00:02:04.240> polish<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.810> called<00:02:05.110> crystal

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
and the last polish is called crystal

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.679 
and the last polish is called crystal
couture<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.250> this<00:02:06.399> is<00:02:06.610> kind<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.180> silvery

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
couture and this is kind of a silvery

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.109 
couture and this is kind of a silvery
holographic<00:02:08.349> base<00:02:08.560> with<00:02:08.860> very<00:02:09.099> strong<00:02:09.429> pinky

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
holographic base with very strong pinky

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.420 
holographic base with very strong pinky
purple<00:02:10.450> flash<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.620> then<00:02:12.160> there<00:02:12.310> are

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
purple flash to it and then there are

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.120 
purple flash to it and then there are
also<00:02:12.610> some<00:02:13.540> hot<00:02:13.870> pink<00:02:14.170> metallic<00:02:14.410> glitters<00:02:15.099> and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
also some hot pink metallic glitters and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.180 
also some hot pink metallic glitters and
chunkier<00:02:16.120> silver<00:02:16.720> holographic<00:02:17.290> glitters<00:02:17.590> so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
chunkier silver holographic glitters so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.540 
chunkier silver holographic glitters so
here's<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.670> coat<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:20.620> one<00:02:20.800> actually<00:02:21.040> again

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
here's one coat this one actually again

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.520 
here's one coat this one actually again
it<00:02:21.730> covers<00:02:22.030> surprisingly<00:02:22.690> well<00:02:22.959> on<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.319> first

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
it covers surprisingly well on the first

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.259 
it covers surprisingly well on the first
coat<00:02:23.769> I<00:02:23.800> was<00:02:24.010> kind<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.190> expecting<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.209> be

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
coat I was kind of expecting this to be

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.509 
coat I was kind of expecting this to be
more<00:02:25.569> like<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> topper<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:27.190> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> be

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
more like a topper but it's going to be

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.610 
more like a topper but it's going to be
totally<00:02:27.790> fine<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.269> two<00:02:28.450> coats<00:02:28.690> i<00:02:28.900> think<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
totally fine on two coats i think the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.100 
totally fine on two coats i think the
formula<00:02:30.069> on<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.580> super<00:02:30.880> smooth<00:02:31.450> super

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
formula on this is super smooth super

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.410 
formula on this is super smooth super
easy<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.620> apply<00:02:32.830> even<00:02:33.550> though<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.700> has<00:02:33.910> some

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
easy to apply even though it has some

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.970 
easy to apply even though it has some
chunkier<00:02:34.930> glitter<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.410> there<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.739> doesn't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
chunkier glitter in there it doesn't

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.070 
chunkier glitter in there it doesn't
feel<00:02:36.220> chunky<00:02:36.700> or<00:02:36.850> gritty<00:02:37.090> at<00:02:37.269> all<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.900> there<00:02:38.049> is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
feel chunky or gritty at all so there is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.250 
feel chunky or gritty at all so there is
one<00:02:38.440> coat<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.700> two<00:02:40.000> coats<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:41.140> this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
one coat so here is two coats so this

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.229 
one coat so here is two coats so this
one<00:02:41.410> covers<00:02:41.709> completely<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.459> two<00:02:42.640> coats<00:02:42.880> it

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
one covers completely in two coats it

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.809 
one covers completely in two coats it
really<00:02:43.750> did<00:02:44.019> look<00:02:44.260> pretty<00:02:44.530> opaque<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.549> one<00:02:45.790> I

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
really did look pretty opaque on one I

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.280 
really did look pretty opaque on one I
could<00:02:46.090> still<00:02:46.299> see<00:02:46.330> my<00:02:46.600> nail<00:02:46.750> line<00:02:46.959> but<00:02:47.140> this

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
could still see my nail line but this

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.110 
could still see my nail line but this
has<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.830> much<00:02:47.950> going<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.730> helps<00:02:48.970> make

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
has so much going on that it helps make

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.690 
has so much going on that it helps make
it<00:02:49.239> look<00:02:49.390> opaque<00:02:49.870> sooner<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.980> does<00:02:51.310> dry<00:02:51.610> a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
it look opaque sooner it does dry a

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.130 
it look opaque sooner it does dry a
little<00:02:51.940> bit<00:02:52.150> textured<00:02:52.569> so<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.780> will<00:02:52.930> want<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
little bit textured so you will want a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.199 
little bit textured so you will want a
good<00:02:53.319> top<00:02:53.530> coat<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.799> smooth<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.400> out<00:02:54.489> although

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
good top coat to smooth it out although

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.050 
good top coat to smooth it out although
I'm<00:02:55.299> surprised<00:02:55.720> at<00:02:55.989> how<00:02:56.620> little<00:02:56.980> textured<00:02:57.880> it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
I'm surprised at how little textured it

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.729 
I'm surprised at how little textured it
felt<00:02:58.330> like<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.690> definitely<00:02:59.110> did<00:02:59.349> but<00:02:59.530> not<00:02:59.620> as

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
felt like it definitely did but not as

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.589 
felt like it definitely did but not as
much<00:02:59.860> as<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.099> was<00:03:00.190> expecting<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.450> there

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
much as I was expecting it to so there

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.220 
much as I was expecting it to so there
is<00:03:01.720> two<00:03:01.930> coats<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.440> crystal<00:03:02.980> couture

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.290
