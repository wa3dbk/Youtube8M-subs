professional<00:00:17.300> driver<00:00:17.480> we've<00:00:18.170> also<00:00:18.350> added<00:00:18.620> a

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
professional driver we've also added a

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.040 
professional driver we've also added a
TFT<00:00:19.490> giving<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.910> lot<00:00:20.090> more<00:00:20.270> digital<00:00:20.720> readout

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
TFT giving a lot more digital readout

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.390 
TFT giving a lot more digital readout
including<00:00:21.980> g-force<00:00:22.820> speed<00:00:23.890> RPMs<00:00:24.890> will<00:00:25.130> all<00:00:25.280> be

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
including g-force speed RPMs will all be

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.420 
including g-force speed RPMs will all be
now<00:00:25.550> in<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.940> modern<00:00:26.530> cluster<00:00:27.530> and<00:00:27.770> then<00:00:28.160> one<00:00:28.310> of

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
now in a modern cluster and then one of

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.420 
now in a modern cluster and then one of
the<00:00:28.550> biggest<00:00:28.789> additions<00:00:29.300> we<00:00:29.450> made<00:00:29.690> in<00:00:30.250> 2015<00:00:31.250> as

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
the biggest additions we made in 2015 as

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.900 
the biggest additions we made in 2015 as
we've<00:00:31.580> added<00:00:31.880> an<00:00:32.119> automatic<00:00:32.930> transmission<00:00:33.199> to

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
we've added an automatic transmission to

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.140 
we've added an automatic transmission to
the<00:00:34.910> Abarth<00:00:35.360> as<00:00:35.510> well<00:00:36.140> as<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.380> turbo<00:00:37.150> models

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
the Abarth as well as the turbo models

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.360 
the Abarth as well as the turbo models
well<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.530> biggest<00:00:39.829> reason<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:40.310> the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
well the biggest reason for the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.520 
well the biggest reason for the
automatic<00:00:40.670> is<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.090> competitive<00:00:41.600> set<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.110> 50%

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
automatic is the competitive set so 50%

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.590 
automatic is the competitive set so 50%
of<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.010> sales<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:43.730> come<00:00:44.060> from<00:00:44.390> our

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
of the sales that come from our

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.569 
of the sales that come from our
competitors<00:00:44.840> are<00:00:45.350> an<00:00:45.649> automatic

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
competitors are an automatic

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.150 
competitors are an automatic
transmission<00:00:47.200> we<00:00:48.200> didn't<00:00:48.380> have<00:00:48.500> one<00:00:48.710> in<00:00:48.829> sales

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
transmission we didn't have one in sales

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.010 
transmission we didn't have one in sales
have<00:00:49.309> been<00:00:49.340> pretty<00:00:49.610> brisk<00:00:49.850> we're<00:00:50.030> up<00:00:50.120> 16%<00:00:50.510> year

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
have been pretty brisk we're up 16% year

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.139 
have been pretty brisk we're up 16% year
over<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.230> year<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.649> this<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:52.550> gonna<00:00:52.730> appeal<00:00:53.120> to

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
over a year and this is gonna appeal to

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.880 
over a year and this is gonna appeal to
a<00:00:53.329> much<00:00:53.480> larger<00:00:53.719> audience<00:00:53.930> I<00:00:54.530> mean<00:00:54.770> quite

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
a much larger audience I mean quite

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.110 
a much larger audience I mean quite
frankly<00:00:55.160> some<00:00:55.399> people<00:00:55.640> don't<00:00:55.850> know<00:00:55.940> how<00:00:56.059> to

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
frankly some people don't know how to

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.910 
frankly some people don't know how to
drive<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.360> stick<00:00:56.690> or<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:57.350> simply<00:00:57.559> don't<00:00:57.680> want

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
drive a stick or just simply don't want

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.500 
drive a stick or just simply don't want
to<00:00:58.040> do<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:58.309> one<00:00:58.790> of<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:58.940> great<00:00:59.120> things<00:00:59.329> we've

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
to do it one of the great things we've

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.450 
to do it one of the great things we've
done<00:00:59.690> with<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.140> automatic<00:01:00.680> transmission<00:01:01.100> is

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
done with the automatic transmission is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.430 
done with the automatic transmission is
we've<00:01:01.610> actually<00:01:01.850> geared<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:02.570> calibrated<00:01:03.200> it

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
we've actually geared it calibrated it

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.489 
we've actually geared it calibrated it
to<00:01:03.920> respond<00:01:04.850> like<00:01:05.149> you<00:01:05.569> would<00:01:05.810> if<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.469> were

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:06.499 
to respond like you would if you were

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.830 
to respond like you would if you were
driving<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:07.039> manual<00:01:07.369> transmission<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.179> we<00:01:08.659> did

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
driving a manual transmission so we did

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.830 
driving a manual transmission so we did
some<00:01:09.079> fuel<00:01:09.709> cutoff<00:01:10.009> up<00:01:10.459> shifts<00:01:10.939> we<00:01:11.329> did<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.509> gear

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
some fuel cutoff up shifts we did a gear

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.480 
some fuel cutoff up shifts we did a gear
hold<00:01:12.109> so<00:01:12.319> if<00:01:12.409> you're<00:01:12.530> coming<00:01:12.770> into<00:01:12.889> a<00:01:13.009> corner

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
hold so if you're coming into a corner

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.550 
hold so if you're coming into a corner
it<00:01:13.609> really<00:01:13.819> holds<00:01:13.999> the<00:01:14.240> gear<00:01:15.109> that<00:01:15.259> you're<00:01:15.439> in

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
it really holds the gear that you're in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.870 
it really holds the gear that you're in
to<00:01:15.679> give<00:01:15.829> you<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.100> torque<00:01:16.399> right<00:01:16.609> when<00:01:16.759> you

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
to give you that torque right when you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.209 
to give you that torque right when you
you<00:01:17.179> step<00:01:17.630> on<00:01:17.749> the<00:01:17.869> gas<00:01:17.899> again<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.590> then<00:01:19.069> it

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
you step on the gas again and then it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.580 
you step on the gas again and then it
also<00:01:19.369> does<00:01:19.729> rep<00:01:20.329> matches<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.259> there's<00:01:21.439> some

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
also does rep matches so there's some

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.340 
also does rep matches so there's some
great<00:01:21.920> features<00:01:22.219> that<00:01:22.549> you<00:01:22.759> would<00:01:22.939> as<00:01:23.119> a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
great features that you would as a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.499 
great features that you would as a
manual<00:01:24.350> driver<00:01:24.649> on<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> track<00:01:25.549> want<00:01:26.179> to<00:01:26.299> have

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
manual driver on a track want to have

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.179 
manual driver on a track want to have
the<00:01:27.200> ability<00:01:27.499> to<00:01:27.529> control<00:01:27.889> that<00:01:27.950> we

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
the ability to control that we

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.709 
the ability to control that we
integrated<00:01:28.999> into<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.450> automatic

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
integrated into the automatic

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.480 
integrated into the automatic
transmission<00:01:30.349> so<00:01:30.920> from<00:01:31.249> a<00:01:31.310> performance

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
transmission so from a performance

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.270 
transmission so from a performance
perspective<00:01:31.999> there<00:01:32.630> very<00:01:32.810> cool

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
perspective there very cool

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.580 
perspective there very cool
the<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:34.390> torque<00:01:34.660> is<00:01:34.780> actually<00:01:35.110> better<00:01:35.290> on<00:01:35.470> the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
the the torque is actually better on the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.680 
the the torque is actually better on the
automatic<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.520> little<00:01:36.970> bit<00:01:37.060> less<00:01:37.240> horsepower

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
automatic a little bit less horsepower

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.200 
automatic a little bit less horsepower
but<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.950> zero<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.250> 60<00:01:39.550> time<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.970> within

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
but the in a zero to 60 time is within

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.240 
but the in a zero to 60 time is within
two<00:01:40.660> tenths<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.140> second<00:01:41.620> so<00:01:41.800> for<00:01:42.130> all

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
two tenths of a second so for all

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.920 
two tenths of a second so for all
intents<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.760> purposes<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.240> get<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.720> same

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
intents and purposes you get the same

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.960 
intents and purposes you get the same
performance<00:01:44.050> so<00:01:44.860> we<00:01:45.400> want<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.670> go<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.790> little

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
performance so we want to go a little

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.640 
performance so we want to go a little
bit<00:01:46.180> younger<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.690> know<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.290> younger

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
bit younger you know the the younger

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.010 
bit younger you know the the younger
demographic<00:01:47.740> is<00:01:48.520> less<00:01:49.120> inclined<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.600> want<00:01:49.930> to

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
demographic is less inclined to want to

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.000 
demographic is less inclined to want to
drive<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.200> stick-shift

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
drive a stick-shift

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.400 
drive a stick-shift
we<00:01:51.790> do<00:01:51.970> well<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.540> metropolitan<00:01:52.750> areas

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
we do well in the metropolitan areas

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.200 
we do well in the metropolitan areas
where<00:01:53.619> traffic<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.130> concern<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:54.850> maybe<00:01:55.060> it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
where traffic is a concern so maybe it

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.780 
where traffic is a concern so maybe it
isn't<00:01:55.600> as<00:01:55.930> convenient<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.740> drive<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.250> manual<00:01:57.520> as

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
isn't as convenient to drive a manual as

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.880 
isn't as convenient to drive a manual as
well<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:58.390> expect<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.900> significant<00:01:59.500> lift<00:01:59.680> and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
well we expect a significant lift and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.520 
well we expect a significant lift and
sales<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.310> can't<00:02:00.580> give<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:00.760> an<00:02:00.910> exact<00:02:01.210> number

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
sales I can't give you an exact number

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.810 
sales I can't give you an exact number
but<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.740> know<00:02:02.830> somewhere<00:02:03.160> in<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.369> 20-30

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
but you know somewhere in the 20-30

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.639 
but you know somewhere in the 20-30
percent<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.270> think<00:02:04.450> would<00:02:04.600> be<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:05.229> will<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.440> safe

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
percent I think would be it will be safe

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.920 
percent I think would be it will be safe
to<00:02:05.680> assume<00:02:05.860> we<00:02:06.130> can<00:02:06.250> get<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.460> those

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
to assume we can get to those

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.819 
to assume we can get to those
