it<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> bay<00:01:52.439> view<00:01:52.680> map<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> onslaught

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
it was the bay view map on the onslaught

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
it was the bay view map on the onslaught
last<00:01:53.880> week<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> guys<00:01:54.780> didn't<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.259> that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
last week if you guys didn't see that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.010 
last week if you guys didn't see that
video<00:01:55.799> actually<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:57.149> they<00:01:57.299> did<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
video actually what they did when the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690 
video actually what they did when the
patch<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.439> actually<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.770> reduced<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
patch was actually they reduced the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
patch was actually they reduced the
amount<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.969> kills<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.360> took<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.290> leaning

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
what titanfall is basically it is a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.050 
what titanfall is basically it is a
potential<00:02:55.709> call<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.250> duty<00:02:56.549> killer<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.000> i'm

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
potential call of duty killer and i'm

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.849 
potential call of duty killer and i'm
not<00:02:57.209> sure<00:02:57.269> at<00:02:57.599> this<00:02:57.629> point<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.139> call<00:02:58.349> duty<00:02:58.590> can

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859

ever<00:02:59.010> be<00:02:59.189> completely<00:02:59.730> killed<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.260> game

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
ever be completely killed but this game

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.490 
ever be completely killed but this game
is<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:02.069> definitely<00:03:02.819> competing<00:03:03.540> game<00:03:03.959> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
is a definitely competing game the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.099 
is a definitely competing game the
developers<00:03:05.069> for<00:03:05.310> our<00:03:05.519> old<00:03:06.120> i<00:03:06.540> think<00:03:06.989> they're

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
developers for our old i think they're

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.780 
developers for our old i think they're
old<00:03:07.290> Infinity<00:03:07.829> Ward<00:03:08.040> developers<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.579> think

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
old Infinity Ward developers to think

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.220 
old Infinity Ward developers to think
Vince<00:03:09.000> Zampella<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.599> one<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.870> big<00:03:09.989> ones

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
Vince Zampella is one of the big ones

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.690 
Vince Zampella is one of the big ones
and<00:03:10.349> now<00:03:10.530> they've<00:03:10.769> created<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.250> new<00:03:11.489> thing

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
and now they've created this new thing

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.910 
and now they've created this new thing
called<00:03:11.730> respawn<00:03:12.480> games<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.049> believe<00:03:13.620> not

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
called respawn games I believe not

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.640

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
duty developers and people that may call

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.199 
duty developers and people that may call
to<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.319> before<00:03:19.590> developing<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.699> game<00:03:21.030> and

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
to you before developing this game and

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.520 
to you before developing this game and
what<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.449> game<00:03:21.629> basically<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.169> like<00:03:22.199> this

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
what this game basically is like this

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.619 
what this game basically is like this
futuristic<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.970> kind<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.359> like<00:03:24.449> it's

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
futuristic it's kind of like it's

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.559 
futuristic it's kind of like it's
basically<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.109> call<00:03:25.379> of<00:03:25.560> duty<00:03:25.590> shooter<00:03:26.569> but

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
basically a call of duty shooter but

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.360 
basically a call of duty shooter but
there's<00:03:28.049> twist<00:03:28.500> that's<00:03:28.709> more<00:03:28.889> futuristic

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
there's twist that's more futuristic

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.860 
there's twist that's more futuristic
there's<00:03:29.669> like<00:03:29.760> jet<00:03:30.060> packs<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.419> you<00:03:30.599> have<00:03:30.750> on

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
there's like jet packs that you have on

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.270 
there's like jet packs that you have on
your<00:03:30.989> back<00:03:31.169> where<00:03:31.349> you<00:03:31.409> can<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.650> triple<00:03:32.040> jump

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
your back where you can like triple jump

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.580 
your back where you can like triple jump
basically<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.970> fly<00:03:33.510> all<00:03:33.690> over<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.049> areas<00:03:34.379> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
basically and fly all over the areas and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.339 
basically and fly all over the areas and
there's<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.730> mechs<00:03:36.060> which<00:03:36.329> are<00:03:36.569> these<00:03:36.989> giant

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
there's the mechs which are these giant

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.979 
there's the mechs which are these giant
robot<00:03:38.010> things<00:03:38.280> basically<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.629> think<00:03:39.930> like

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
robot things basically and I think like

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.050 
robot things basically and I think like
you<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.379> like<00:03:40.500> up<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.799> two<00:03:41.040> or<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.489> or<00:03:41.519> per

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
you get like up to two or one or per

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.879 
you get like up to two or one or per
team<00:03:42.449> or<00:03:42.629> whatever<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.139> game<00:03:43.349> but

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
team or whatever in the game but

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.680 
team or whatever in the game but
basically<00:03:44.099> these<00:03:44.819> Mets<00:03:45.239> you're<00:03:45.389> allowed<00:03:45.569> to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
basically these Mets you're allowed to

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.719 
basically these Mets you're allowed to
go<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:45.989> as<00:03:46.229> a<00:03:46.260> player<00:03:46.889> of<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.190> pilot<00:03:47.609> they're

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
go in as a player of the pilot they're

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.449 
go in as a player of the pilot they're
called<00:03:47.909> pilots<00:03:48.299> not<00:03:48.479> soldiers<00:03:49.159> pilots<00:03:50.159> can<00:03:50.310> go

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
called pilots not soldiers pilots can go

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.009 
called pilots not soldiers pilots can go
in<00:03:50.579> these<00:03:50.669> giant<00:03:51.060> robot<00:03:51.359> mechs<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.750> go<00:03:51.900> around

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
in these giant robot mechs and go around

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.629 
in these giant robot mechs and go around
and<00:03:52.379> basically<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.769> mechs<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.159> guns<00:03:53.430> are

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
and basically the mechs have guns are
