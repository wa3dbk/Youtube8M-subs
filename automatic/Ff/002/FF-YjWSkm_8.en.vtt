flywheel especially for the electric
skateboards<00:00:33.870> I've<00:00:34.020> cut<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.650> half<00:00:34.740> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
skateboards I've cut this one in half so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.370 
skateboards I've cut this one in half so
you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.400> see<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> core<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you can see some of the core and the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.080 
you can see some of the core and the
profile<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> urethane<00:00:38.310> material<00:00:38.580> and<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
kind of put this in perspective here's a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.160 
kind of put this in perspective here's a
fifty-two<00:00:41.160> millimeter<00:00:41.670> wheel<00:00:41.940> which<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
fifty-two millimeter wheel which is a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.630 
fifty-two millimeter wheel which is a
little<00:00:43.680> less<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:43.890> half<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:46.490> half<00:00:47.490> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
little less than half the half the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
little less than half the half the
diameter<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.630> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.020> there's<00:00:49.440> way

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
diameter but as you can see there's way

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.440 
diameter but as you can see there's way
more<00:00:49.710> than<00:00:50.100> twice<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.400> much<00:00:50.760> wheel<00:00:51.060> here<00:00:51.330> in

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
more than twice as much wheel here in

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.600 
more than twice as much wheel here in
terms<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.080> know<00:00:52.110> mass<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.040> urethane

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
terms of you know mass and urethane

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.730 
terms of you know mass and urethane
there's<00:00:53.880> really<00:00:54.030> no<00:00:54.240> comparison<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:55.470> is<00:00:55.650> an

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
there's really no comparison this is an

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.410 
there's really no comparison this is an
electric<00:00:56.190> skateboard<00:00:56.490> with<00:00:56.940> wireless

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420

electric skateboard with wireless
bluetooth<00:00:57.500> remote<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> closest<00:00:59.340> thing

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
bluetooth remote it's the closest thing

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.220 
bluetooth remote it's the closest thing
to<00:00:59.640> actually<00:00:59.760> surfing<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.050> asphalt

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to actually surfing on the asphalt

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.620 
to actually surfing on the asphalt
because<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:02.700> need<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.880> wave<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.480> have

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
because you don't need a wave to have

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.149 
because you don't need a wave to have
perpetual<00:01:04.140> motion<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.799> don't<00:01:04.979> need<00:01:05.129> a
