00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
control that rear end but it can be a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
control that rear end but it can be a
little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.550> confusing<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.120> we're<00:01:03.390> gonna<00:01:03.480> back

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
little bit confusing so we're gonna back

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.570 
little bit confusing so we're gonna back
up<00:01:04.229> we're<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> start<00:01:05.220> from<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> very

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
up we're going to start from the very

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
up we're going to start from the very
beginning<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.659> sort<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:07.799> bit<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
beginning on sort of a little bit of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
beginning on sort of a little bit of
suspension<00:01:08.640> 101<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.450> makes<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.930> bit

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
suspension 101 so it makes a little bit

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.969 
suspension 101 so it makes a little bit
of<00:01:10.229> sense<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

is<00:01:31.890> we're<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.250> rid<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> leaf

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
is we're going to get rid of the leaf

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550 
is we're going to get rid of the leaf
springs<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.320> lower

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
springs and we're going to go to a lower

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.050 
springs and we're going to go to a lower
control<00:01:35.009> arm<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> slide<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
control arm so I'm going to slide the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
control arm so I'm going to slide the
axle<00:01:36.180> tube<00:01:36.570> over<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.020> clamp<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> down<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.979> got

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
axle tube over here clamp it down I got

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.819 
axle tube over here clamp it down I got
one<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> side<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.290> pivot<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
one on that side and if I pivot on the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
one on that side and if I pivot on the
front<00:01:41.130> where<00:01:41.460> Willy's<00:01:41.729> hand<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.329> now

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
front where Willy's hand is right now

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.060 
front where Willy's hand is right now
I'm<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> swing<00:01:43.409> through<00:01:43.619> an<00:01:43.740> arc<00:01:43.890> I've

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
I'm going to swing through an arc I've

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
I'm going to swing through an arc I've
got<00:01:44.220> some<00:01:44.520> amount<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> control<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> can

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
got some amount of control but I can

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
got some amount of control but I can
still<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.530> side<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.890> side<00:01:47.070> there's<00:01:47.700> nothing

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
still go side to side there's nothing

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
still go side to side there's nothing
holding<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.509> right<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
holding me there right and with the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.960 
holding me there right and with the
amount<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.040> torque<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:50.939> through

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
amount of torque that's going through

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
amount of torque that's going through
this<00:01:51.560> axle<00:01:52.560> whether<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.920> from<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> engine

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
this axle whether it's from the engine

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510 
this axle whether it's from the engine
or<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.479> tires<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.320> you're<00:01:55.439> braking<00:01:55.979> right

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
or the tires when you're braking right

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.240 
or the tires when you're braking right
this<00:01:56.850> axles<00:01:57.719> wanting<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> rotate<00:01:58.619> forward<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
this axles wanting to rotate forward and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
this axles wanting to rotate forward and
backwards<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.270> pinion<00:02:00.659> angles<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> go

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
backwards the pinion angles want to go

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.600 
backwards the pinion angles want to go
all<00:02:01.500> over<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.770> place<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:01.979> we've<00:02:02.219> got<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> add

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
all over the place so we've got to add

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.920 
all over the place so we've got to add
another<00:02:02.939> element<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.509> control

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
another element of control

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.499 
another element of control
the<00:02:04.530> torque<00:02:04.890> arm<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.939> torque<00:02:06.240> arm

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the torque arm right and the torque arm

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.119 
the torque arm right and the torque arm
especially<00:02:06.899> when<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.079> get<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.560> beefy

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
especially when you get one this beefy

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.859 
especially when you get one this beefy
it's<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> help<00:02:08.640> control<00:02:08.789> all<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.479> axle

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it's going to help control all that axle

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.690 
it's going to help control all that axle
wrap<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.530> happens<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
wrap so what happens if you get on the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
wrap so what happens if you get on the
rear<00:02:11.910> end<00:02:12.090> right<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
rear end right it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.250 
rear end right it
to<00:02:13.079> lift<00:02:13.349> up<00:02:13.560> he<00:02:13.680> wants<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.159> this<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:15.260> know

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
to lift up he wants to do this I know

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.259 
to lift up he wants to do this I know
your<00:02:16.620> rear<00:02:16.829> end<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.159> going<00:02:17.310> up<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:17.849> right

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
your rear end is going up and down right

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.690 
your rear end is going up and down right
but<00:02:18.719> since<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.409> tied<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.250> unibody

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
but since we have it tied to the unibody

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.459 
but since we have it tied to the unibody
with<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.209> crossmember<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.900> comes<00:02:22.079> with<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
with this crossmember that comes with to

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.380 
with this crossmember that comes with to
be<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> market<00:02:23.099> we<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.640> control<00:02:23.909> out<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.269> that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
be a market we can control out of that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.940 
be a market we can control out of that
same<00:02:24.750> way<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.140> braking<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.680> wants<00:02:25.859> to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
same way with the braking it wants to

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.080 
same way with the braking it wants to
dive<00:02:26.189> down<00:02:26.519> right

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
dive down right

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.970 
dive down right
what<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.569> tied<00:02:27.900> into<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.409> frame<00:02:28.739> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
what is tied into the frame and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.920 
what is tied into the frame and
therefore<00:02:29.609> eliminates<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.180> lot<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.540> AXA

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
therefore eliminates a lot of that AXA

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.199 
therefore eliminates a lot of that AXA
wrap<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.349> yet<00:02:31.739> another<00:02:32.099> function<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.939> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
wrap and yet another function of the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.750 
wrap and yet another function of the
leaf<00:02:33.420> spring<00:02:33.719> yeah<00:02:34.079> so<00:02:34.859> now<00:02:35.069> we've<00:02:35.310> got<00:02:35.549> all

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
leaf spring yeah so now we've got all

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.240 
leaf spring yeah so now we've got all
the<00:02:36.000> linkage<00:02:36.389> we<00:02:36.569> really<00:02:36.989> need<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.799> control

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the linkage we really need to control

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.720 
the linkage we really need to control
the<00:02:38.459> motion<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.450> down<00:02:39.629> right<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.859> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the motion up and down right and the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.699 
the motion up and down right and the
rotation<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> axle<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.230> we're<00:02:43.379> pretty

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
rotation of the axle so we're pretty

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.729 
rotation of the axle so we're pretty
close<00:02:44.269> except<00:02:45.269> for<00:02:45.510> now<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:45.870> got<00:02:46.109> side<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.500> side

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
close except for now we got side to side

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.280 
close except for now we got side to side
now<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> common<00:02:48.060> component<00:02:48.389> is<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> panhard<00:02:49.169> bar

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
now a common component is a panhard bar

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.619 
now a common component is a panhard bar
but<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.519> case<00:02:50.790> we're<00:02:51.239> going<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.389> use

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
but in this case we're going to use

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.179 
but in this case we're going to use
something<00:02:52.319> that's<00:02:52.500> been<00:02:52.590> around<00:02:52.680> for<00:02:52.950> quite<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
something that's been around for quite a

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.909 
something that's been around for quite a
long<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:54.000> watch<00:02:54.389> link<00:02:54.780> now<00:02:55.290> watch<00:02:55.530> link<00:02:55.799> is

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
long time a watch link now watch link is

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.770 
long time a watch link now watch link is
really<00:02:56.340> cool<00:02:56.579> let's<00:02:57.000> get<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.239> set<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.659> you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
really cool let's get it set up so you

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.690 
really cool let's get it set up so you
can<00:02:57.930> actually<00:02:58.019> see<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.650> work<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.219> then<00:02:59.519> we<00:02:59.579> can

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
can actually see it work and then we can

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.530 
can actually see it work and then we can
explain<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.419> it's<00:03:00.569> doing

and<00:03:17.010> you've<00:03:17.130> got<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.760> simple

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
and you've got this really simple

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.840 
and you've got this really simple
linkage<00:03:18.450> here<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.960> it's<00:03:19.650> basically<00:03:20.070> just<00:03:20.160> you

the motion side to side now a lot of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.250 
the motion side to side now a lot of
cars<00:03:28.830> use<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.430> panhard<00:03:30.090> bar<00:03:30.180> now<00:03:30.810> panhard<00:03:31.170> bar

cars use a panhard bar now panhard bar

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.560 
cars use a panhard bar now panhard bar
just<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.770> it's<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.340> link<00:03:32.580> from<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.240> know<00:03:33.360> one

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
just see it's a link from you know one

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.810 
just see it's a link from you know one
side<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:33.960> car<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.740> one<00:03:35.010> side<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.430> axle

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
side of the car to one side of the axle

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.730 
side of the car to one side of the axle
and<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.540> link<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.960> swings<00:03:37.350> but

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
and it's a link that swings but

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.280 
and it's a link that swings but
unfortunately<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.760> swings<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.180> an<00:03:39.300> arc<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
unfortunately as it swings to an arc the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.080 
unfortunately as it swings to an arc the
axles<00:03:40.740> moving<00:03:41.040> one<00:03:41.220> direction<00:03:41.670> as<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.880> swings

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
axles moving one direction as it swings

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.460 
axles moving one direction as it swings
down<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.420> other<00:03:42.570> way<00:03:42.660> it's<00:03:42.780> moving<00:03:43.110> back<00:03:43.320> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
down the other way it's moving back and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.980 
down the other way it's moving back and
forth<00:03:43.740> so<00:03:43.980> your<00:03:44.430> rear<00:03:44.640> end<00:03:44.820> isn't<00:03:45.240> quite<00:03:45.780> as

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
forth so your rear end isn't quite as

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.050 
forth so your rear end isn't quite as
centered<00:03:46.470> as<00:03:46.560> you'd<00:03:46.740> like<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.580> it's

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
centered as you'd like it to be and it's

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.760 
centered as you'd like it to be and it's
moving<00:03:48.450> back<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.780> forth<00:03:49.050> with<00:03:49.620> your

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
moving back and forth with your

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.740 
moving back and forth with your
suspension<00:03:50.310> travel<00:03:50.520> so<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.420> perfect

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
suspension travel so this is the perfect

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.930 
suspension travel so this is the perfect
way<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.170> keeping<00:03:52.530> everything<00:03:52.980> exactly<00:03:53.790> where

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
way of keeping everything exactly where

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.480 
way of keeping everything exactly where
you<00:03:54.000> want<00:03:54.240> it<00:03:54.390> completely<00:03:55.170> lined<00:03:55.890> up<00:03:56.070> through

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
you want it completely lined up through

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.370 
you want it completely lined up through
whatever<00:03:56.700> suspension<00:03:57.420> travel<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.840> want<00:03:58.050> and

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
whatever suspension travel you want and

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.440 
whatever suspension travel you want and
what's<00:03:58.920> neat<00:03:59.130> about<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.640> it's<00:04:00.120> got<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.300> lot

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
what's neat about it is it's got a lot

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.090 
what's neat about it is it's got a lot
of<00:04:00.540> adjustability<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.680> move<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.920> Watts

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
of adjustability you can move the Watts

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.310 
of adjustability you can move the Watts
link<00:04:02.340> up<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:02.670> down<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.120> effectively<00:04:03.960> change
