previous<00:00:57.510> versions<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> call<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> duty<00:00:58.559> now

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
previous versions of call of duty now

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
previous versions of call of duty now
the<00:00:59.489> reason<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> use<00:01:00.239> both<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.480> these

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the reason you want to use both of these

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
the reason you want to use both of these
is<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:00.899> obviously<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.620> an<00:01:01.680> assault

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
is because obviously it's an assault

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
is because obviously it's an assault
rifle<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:02.609> strafing<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> be

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
rifle so you're strafing is going to be

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.670 
rifle so you're strafing is going to be
a<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:03.809> slower<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.290> don't<00:01:04.530> have

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
a little bit slower if we don't have

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
a little bit slower if we don't have
that<00:01:04.710> stock<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> reason<00:01:05.790> use<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> silencer

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that stock now the reason use a silencer

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.640 
that stock now the reason use a silencer
again<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.439> hopping

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
again is you're going to be hopping

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.170 
again is you're going to be hopping
around<00:01:07.890> doing<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> noise<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
around doing a lot of noise you want to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580 
around doing a lot of noise you want to
stay<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.390> stuffy<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.780> possible<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.380> kill

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
stay as stuffy as possible when you kill

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
stay as stuffy as possible when you kill
someone<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.340> might<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:11.939> three

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
someone there might be two or three

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.370 
someone there might be two or three
other<00:01:12.240> people<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
other people with them and you want to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
other people with them and you want to
make<00:01:13.439> sure<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> aren't<00:01:14.460> getting<00:01:14.610> caught

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
make sure that you aren't getting caught

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
make sure that you aren't getting caught
earlier<00:01:15.479> than<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.780> should<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:16.049> no<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
earlier than you should be no that's it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
earlier than you should be no that's it
to<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.430> advantage<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.970> weapon

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
to really take advantage of this weapon

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
to really take advantage of this weapon
I<00:01:18.390> decided<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.020> were<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> use

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I decided that we were not going to use

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.380 
I decided that we were not going to use
a<00:01:19.860> secondary<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> move<00:01:21.330> on

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
a secondary so we're going to move on

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.030 
a secondary so we're going to move on
now<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> perks<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> guys

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
now to the perks that I think you guys

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
now to the perks that I think you guys
should<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.340> using<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> course<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.420> first<00:01:24.689> one

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
should be using of course the first one

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
should be using of course the first one

that basically makes the map a lot

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
that basically makes the map a lot
bigger<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.990> makes<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> better<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.829> if
