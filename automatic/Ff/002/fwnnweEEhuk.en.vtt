00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.180
 I greet all lovers by 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.349
 milling and of course by soldering but 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.009
 Today we will talk about the winners so 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:18.390
 put aside the soldering iron aside and take 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:21.390
 what we take call last video 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.390
 I talked about mounting for a little 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.930
 Frazer time but since I went this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.109
 booze then today tell you how 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 to fasten such a big router on 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.930
 this milling machine 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:50.460
 rise ferlin Model Model 1100 MVD 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:55.010
 power 1100 watts and maximum 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.010
 turns 3000 revolutions per minute 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.640
 switch switch button which 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.939
 fixes it in the on position then 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 have you turn it on with your fingers 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.390
 then it is sharply necessary that it work without 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.250
 your participation press the button fixing 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 additional 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.869
 pimpochka and all this wheel 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.640
 governed revolutions maximum what 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.070
 they want to tell very much when I 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.780
 planned to assemble this machine 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.330
 there was a difficult choice over what 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.300
 frezer put here because 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.409
 required to continue work on 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.080
 several hours and 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.940
 few such frezer from sold in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.000
 stores could survive such a load 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.700
 generally stare at 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.140
 oh how is it called 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:06.030
 do not remember very so gray-red 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:10.209
 frezer it seems there can be dreamed of 600 820 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.920
 very many will exhibit their complex 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.480
 machine tools 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.910
 he proved himself so very 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.060
 reliable machine 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:23.050
 In short, I will give a link or photo forgot 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:29.050
 how is it called farm farms shorter brother 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:33.640
 will not be better then I will write and now but 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.329
 We certainly can not buy it anywhere our 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.079
 order a small town through 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:45.730
 the Internet can of course but the country was worth 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.450
 at that time around six thousand plus 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.390
 delivery 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.329
 and as if I was not sure what will happen 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.170
 she wo n't work plus wanted 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.350
 universal tool so you can 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.360
 it was milled like a machine 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.579
 and directly tame yours there 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.000
 by chance he came across a form that 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:11.440
 there man has food cutters fiolent 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.480
 read honored yes he is not comfortable it 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.760
 so here is connected and as you can see yes 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.870
 here I let go wriggle will matrix 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:25.400
 yes all this wedged him noisy 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:31.290
 here are the ones you have done completely Polessk 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:34.010
 but the main advantage of this frezer on the streets 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.140
 was the fact that since childhood is not killed motor 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.220
 that is, it can work there for hours and 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.040
 there will be nothing 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.830
 and then I remembered that when I was in 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.490
 the tool store just 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.630
 saw such 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:52.200
 and for the inscription fiolent not exactly 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.380
 professional and it cost twice 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.390
 Cheaper from that most popular all 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.470
 frezer to that is it like 3000 &amp; style 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.630
 Well, quickly call a relative 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.610
 prudent come here so well in 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.060
 tom that store saw take please 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.970
 buy drove leads like this from me 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.690
 This tool appeared and what I want 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:20.880
 say really worked for me but also 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.290
 I know, but the number 20 has definitely served without 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.520
 any complaints to k on the machine and 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:33.660
 the club teaches boards chose a quarter and 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.200
 nothing bad to say I can not, and the main 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.150
 a plus 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:43.020
 but rather the motor except that it is 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.590
 that he can detect how many 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.060
 seconds turns out again 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.770
 stationary or this is just 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:58.200
 unscrew 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.200
 one cog that holds the ruler 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:19.470
 piece of iron hairstyle on the line unscrew 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:22.780
 this pen of the river took this pen 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:27.190
 By the way, it is dragging the price of circling 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:31.630
 frezer so the nut does not fall out well and 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:39.250
 figs with it a line of revenue and 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:43.990
 and all here we have is stationary April 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:47.940
 which is easily mounted on the machine here 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:51.430
 there are no such big chunks of his 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.440
 which interfere usually just here one 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.960
 this type of festool 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:01.000
 Well, of course, the budget for the chair and everything 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.910
 same easily typed turns into manual 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.320
 frezer 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:13.120
 that is, to the left, here's the drop 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.310
 put on 1 de tube fasten handle 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.740
 taught meyka and again for a few 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:22.920
 seconds everything is fine with us 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.700
 stationary is obtained by hand-made postcards 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.310
 awesome design and at the same time 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.560
 pretty securely with bills to 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.360
 aside 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.790
 so as not to interfere now show how 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:42.330
 attach it to the machine you know 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.270
 Of course there is some jokes may 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.350
 be 2 liters in connection with the latter 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.960
 events in Ukraine 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.120
 for those who are in the tank, I will say that the enzyme 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:57.270
 This is a Ukrainian company producing face 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:03.590
 tool the question is some 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:09.230
 there will be no spare parts in warehouses but suddenly 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:13.470
 comrades will say went to his somewhere 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:17.660
 Muscovites such we do not give them spare parts him 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:27.450
 we will sit with a broken frezer 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:30.840
 Incidentally still jigsaw Fiolent Orsk already 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:37.290
 dofig years nothing is done to him either 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:39.470
 and it does not break and that 's all Ukrainian 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.470
 manufacturers
