00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.020 
modern warfare 2 again that's what I get
from<00:01:29.159> their<00:01:29.369> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> looks<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.820> there's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
from their kind of looks like there's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.569 
from their kind of looks like there's
like<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.150> broken<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.070> highway<00:01:32.070> structure

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
like a broken kind of highway structure

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
like a broken kind of highway structure
in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> part<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
in the back you know like the part that

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
in the back you know like the part that
actually<00:01:34.470> stabilizes<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> highway<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
actually stabilizes the highway and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
actually stabilizes the highway and
uplink<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.740> can't<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.040> tell<00:01:38.280> anything

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
uplink you can't really tell anything

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.249 
uplink you can't really tell anything
from<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.540> looks<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.140> going

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
from that one it looks like it's going

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.960 
from that one it looks like it's going
to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.409> maybe<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.860> satellite<00:01:41.250> station<00:01:41.820> or

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to be maybe like a satellite station or

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.240 
to be maybe like a satellite station or
something<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.619> uplink<00:01:43.619> obviously<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
something like that uplink obviously you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.740 
something like that uplink obviously you
got<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> uplink<00:01:44.759> information<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.450> maybe<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
got to uplink information so maybe like

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600 
got to uplink information so maybe like
some<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.110> processing<00:01:46.680> facility<00:01:47.460> or

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
get on this one if you notice on the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.410 
get on this one if you notice on the
actual<00:02:29.010> image<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.730> zombies<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.209> called

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
actual image of the zombies is called

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.599 
actual image of the zombies is called
buried<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.500> looks<00:02:31.829> like<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.069> zombies<00:02:32.430> kind

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
buried and looks like the zombies kind

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.199 
buried and looks like the zombies kind
of<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:33.299> cowboy<00:02:33.930> hats<00:02:34.260> on<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.209> another

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
of have a cowboy hats on so another

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.399 
of have a cowboy hats on so another
thing<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.510> notice<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.900> their<00:02:37.200> eyes<00:02:37.379> are

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
thing you notice is that their eyes are

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.500 
thing you notice is that their eyes are
blue<00:02:38.069> again<00:02:38.400> they're<00:02:38.730> not<00:02:38.879> red<00:02:39.120> like<00:02:39.359> they

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
blue again they're not red like they

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.660 
blue again they're not red like they
were<00:02:39.659> in<00:02:39.870> mop<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.139> the<00:02:40.230> dead<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:40.650> once<00:02:41.250> again<00:02:41.430> we

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
were in mop of the dead so once again we

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.670 
were in mop of the dead so once again we
get<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:41.969> idea<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.599> Richthofen<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.469> once

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
get that idea that Richthofen is once

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.129 
get that idea that Richthofen is once
again<00:02:43.829> in<00:02:44.159> control<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.760> zombies<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.989> is

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
again in control the zombies so this is

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.979 
again in control the zombies so this is
more<00:02:46.650> than<00:02:46.769> likely<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.099> continuation<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
more than likely a continuation of the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.050 
more than likely a continuation of the
actual<00:02:49.680> storyline<00:02:50.069> that's<00:02:50.430> continuing<00:02:50.970> that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
actual storyline that's continuing that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.360 
actual storyline that's continuing that
like<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.269> side<00:02:51.569> story<00:02:51.840> type<00:02:52.139> thing<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.620> mob<00:02:53.250> of

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
like a side story type thing that mob of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.710 
like a side story type thing that mob of
the<00:02:53.400> dead<00:02:53.459> ones<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:53.939> this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> actual

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the dead ones so this is a actual

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.690 
the dead ones so this is a actual
continuation<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.409> don't<00:02:55.680> know<00:02:55.799> if<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.549> means

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
continuation I don't know if this means

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.429 
continuation I don't know if this means
