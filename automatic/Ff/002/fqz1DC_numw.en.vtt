00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
 What is the most famous card game in the world? 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.380
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.780
 What is anime whose heroes have anti-gravity hair? 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.680
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.760
 What is the game that can cost up to $ 200? 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.600
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.080
 Yogi is a manga by Kazuki Takahashi 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.420
 Have a successful anime, and a more successful game 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.440
 The game is one of the most difficult card games to have complex and diverse cards 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.760
 In each generation new papers and laws are added 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.200
 And approximately new sheets are released every month 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.360
 And played by people of all ages 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.920
 Young, young, senior, boys or girls 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.000
 Of course, the smarter you are, the greater your chances of profit 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 In this video I will talk about five facts that many do not know about Yogi 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.800
 In fact, the symbols that appear in the first generation of Yogi are not Masonic symbols 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.760
 Are symbols of Egyptian mythology, since the story speaks of the pharaohs 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.680
 It is said that Kazuki traveled to Egypt to gather information before he started writing the story of Yogi 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.880
 These symbols disappeared in later generations. If you insist on conspiracy theory, it is useless, no one knows the truth 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.660
 The beginning of the game was different from what we know today the start was with Bandai 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.560
 The game was simple, the shape of the leaves are different, and contain only 13 code 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.340
 Then Konami adopted them 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 And produced a book containing 30 pages of laws that do not stop growing and changing 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.700
 It is divided into levels, and the higher the level, the greater your knowledge of other laws 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.300
 The nice thing is that the original game relied on luck only 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.640
 The current depends on intelligence and thinking 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 Also, it was supposed to be the name of the game Magic and Wizards 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.080
 But was changed because of the similarity of the name with the American game Magic the Gathering 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.700
 Season 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.540
 The first season of Yogi is not the season you know 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.080
 The first season is called "Season 0" 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.820
 He talks to Yogi and his friends in their everyday lives 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.700
 And every time, one of the bad guys causes a problem, and then comes Yogi to defeat him in a game 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.120
 Unfortunately, this season has not been successful and has not been recognized 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.620
 If you've seen Yogi on MBC3, you've actually watched a 4KIDS version dubbed for Arabic 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.640
 A copy of 4KIDS is filled with deleted scenes 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.100
 Beginning of blood deletion, punching or punching 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.160
 And access to Nazareth things trivial without reason, such as the scene of the two men who threaten you with their fingers 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.280
 Whatch out! We have two fingers and we are not afraid to use them! 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.420
 But what has changed most is the shadow kingdom 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.360
 It is known that whoever loses in a shadow game, his soul goes to the shadow kingdom 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.700
 But originally, there is no shadow kingdom. 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.080
 The loser dies 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
 Death of characters was also deleted 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.020
 No one dies in Yogi! 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.660
 Also if a boy appears without a shirt, they add it 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.280
 There is also a twist in the story, and this is an example 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.580
 Rafael in the fourth season is digging to find a duel disk 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.420
 But in the original story, he stoned his parents to find their skulls 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 Then he realized their death and began to cry 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.300
 Your childhood was a lie! 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.500
 In addition, Japanese papers differ from other papers around the world 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040
 All religion related to the papers was deleted 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.020
 No great appearance of violence 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.220
 And the breasts! 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.220
 If I talk about everything I've done, it will take me a day to finish 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.800
 Yogi has two records in Guinness Book 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.960
 The first in being the most selling best selling game around the world 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:50.600
 Where since 1999 it has sold more than 25,175,567,833 papers 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.700
 The second record relates to the organization of Yogi for the largest round of paper matches in the world 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.040
 This was done in Long Beach, California, USA 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.120
 4364 players participated 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.040
 And broke the previous record of the game Magic the gathering, which collected 2227 players 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.080
 Due to the large number of attendees, the organizers expanded the space to equal 12 US football fields 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.360
 The winner in this session is Michael Balan who won the Dark World 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.020
 He won a paper, a trip to the World Championship qualifiers, and Ipad 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.860
