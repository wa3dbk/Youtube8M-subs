video for the pdw-57 now I think this
weapon<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.110> probably<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> best<00:00:13.469> weapon<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
weapon it's probably the best weapon and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.880 
weapon it's probably the best weapon and
all<00:00:14.400> ecology<00:00:14.880> black<00:00:15.150> ops<00:00:15.360> 2<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> couple

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
all ecology black ops 2 for a couple

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010 
all ecology black ops 2 for a couple
reasons<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
reasons and so first of all it's the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.130 
reasons and so first of all it's the
clip<00:00:19.350> size<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.830> 50<00:00:20.340> bullet<00:00:21.090> clip<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.600> an<00:00:21.779> SMG

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.570 
clip size like 50 bullet clip on an SMG
that<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.800> amazing<00:00:23.010> that's<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.430> having

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
that is like amazing that's like having

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.269 
that is like amazing that's like having
an<00:00:23.760> LMG<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.900> being<00:00:25.260> able<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.590> run<00:00:25.769> around<00:00:25.859> fast

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
an LMG but being able to run around fast

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.710 
an LMG but being able to run around fast
with<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.820> turn<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.119> into<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.390> rushing

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
with it and turn it into a rushing

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689 
with it and turn it into a rushing
weapon<00:00:27.990> basically<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.949> that's<00:00:29.340> an<00:00:29.519> amazing

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
weapon basically so that's an amazing

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.179 
weapon basically so that's an amazing
thing<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.359> also<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:31.830> low<00:00:31.949> recoil

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
thing and also it has really low recoil

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.450 
thing and also it has really low recoil
which<00:00:32.790> helps<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.540> lot<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.320> longer<00:00:34.739> ranges<00:00:35.190> with

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
which helps a lot for longer ranges with

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.069 
which helps a lot for longer ranges with
it<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:35.880> still<00:00:36.210> decent<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.630> long<00:00:36.809> range

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it so it's still decent at long range

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
it so it's still decent at long range
and<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.520> also<00:00:38.640> has<00:00:38.879> pretty<00:00:39.090> good<00:00:39.239> bullet

and then it also has pretty good bullet
damage<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.530> too<00:00:40.710> bad<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.219> it's

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
here because UAV first of all it's easy

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.090 
here because UAV first of all it's easy
to<00:05:01.750> get<00:05:01.900> it's<00:05:02.200> only<00:05:02.350> takes<00:05:02.590> like<00:05:02.680> what<00:05:02.890> two

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
to get it's only takes like what two

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.420 
to get it's only takes like what two
kills<00:05:03.370> three<00:05:03.640> kills<00:05:03.850> with<00:05:04.500> hardline<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.770> then

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
kills three kills with hardline and then

once<00:05:06.640> you<00:05:06.730> get<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.000> gives<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.360> edge<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.930> know

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
once you get it gives the edge to know

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.570 
once you get it gives the edge to know
where<00:05:08.200> everyone<00:05:08.410> is<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:08.890> can<00:05:08.980> go<00:05:09.130> rack<00:05:09.370> up

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
also putting century going on there's

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.370 
also putting century going on there's
great<00:05:19.090> for<00:05:19.240> objectives<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.870> just<00:05:20.140> get<00:05:20.290> your

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
great for objectives you just get your

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.840 
great for objectives you just get your
sentry<00:05:20.710> gun<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:20.950> planted<00:05:21.130> in<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.580> good<00:05:21.760> place

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
sentry gun you planted in a good place

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.370 
sentry gun you planted in a good place
out<00:05:22.090> in<00:05:22.120> inject<00:05:22.450> them<00:05:22.600> it<00:05:22.720> kills<00:05:22.930> anyone<00:05:23.169> that

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
out in inject them it kills anyone that

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.409 
out in inject them it kills anyone that
tries<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.620> come<00:05:23.890> near<00:05:24.040> there<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.669> you<00:05:25.270> don't

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
tries to come near there and you don't

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.960 
tries to come near there and you don't
need<00:05:25.540> to<00:05:25.660> control<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.200> so<00:05:26.680> cuz<00:05:27.130> like<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.550> think

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
need to control it so cuz like I think

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.110 
need to control it so cuz like I think
it's<00:05:28.060> better<00:05:28.600> not<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.930> have<00:05:29.050> controlled

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
it's better not to have controlled

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.950 
it's better not to have controlled
scorestreaks<00:05:31.120> just<00:05:31.360> because<00:05:31.510> you<00:05:31.690> could<00:05:31.840> be

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
scorestreaks just because you could be

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.600 
scorestreaks just because you could be
out<00:05:32.050> on<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.290> field<00:05:32.440> with<00:05:32.740> your<00:05:33.010> scorestreak

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
out on the field with your scorestreak

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.480 
out on the field with your scorestreak
getting<00:05:34.300> like<00:05:34.450> double<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:34.810> kills<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:36.340> that's

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
getting like double the kills so that's

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.010 
getting like double the kills so that's
always<00:05:36.610> good<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:37.000> then<00:05:37.150> put<00:05:37.570> last<00:05:37.750> one

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
always good and then put last one

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.200 
always good and then put last one
