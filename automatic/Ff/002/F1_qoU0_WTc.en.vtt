beautiful<00:00:18.840> um<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:20.039> reason<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.580> this

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
beautiful um the reason I have this

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
beautiful um the reason I have this
guy's<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.390> he<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.289> Italian<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:22.949> he's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
guy's because he is Italian and he's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.089 
guy's because he is Italian and he's
gonna<00:00:23.340> link<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.939> both<00:00:24.300> lead<00:00:24.779> defenders<00:00:25.289> if

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
gonna link with both lead defenders if

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.560 
gonna link with both lead defenders if
you<00:00:26.250> could<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.550> stuck<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> want<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.420> then

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you could get stuck if you want but then

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.419 
you could get stuck if you want but then
the<00:00:28.260> whole<00:00:28.380> idea<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.859> team<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.340> has

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the whole idea of this team is that has

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.700 
the whole idea of this team is that has
green<00:00:29.730> lines<00:00:29.970> absolutely<00:00:30.779> everywhere<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
green lines absolutely everywhere and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.850 
green lines absolutely everywhere and
there's<00:00:32.460> no<00:00:32.610> dead<00:00:32.790> links<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.739> go

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
there's no dead links at all so for go

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.410 
there's no dead links at all so for go
on<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:35.610> centre-backs<00:00:35.940> we've<00:00:36.300> got

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
on to the two centre-backs we've got

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.130 
on to the two centre-backs we've got
Chiellini<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.370> yet<00:00:38.370> he's<00:00:38.790> such<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> beast<00:00:39.660> 82

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
Chiellini and yet he's such a beast 82

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
Chiellini and yet he's such a beast 82
pace<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.710> he's<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.489> consistent<00:00:42.149> he

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
pace and he's just so consistent he

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.150 
pace and he's just so consistent he
catches<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.020> pretty<00:00:43.620> much<00:00:43.710> every

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
catches up with pretty much every

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.479 
catches up with pretty much every
defender<00:00:44.610> he's<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.539> 86<00:00:45.930> heading<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.440> mean<00:00:46.710> 85

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

back<00:00:52.559> from<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> same<00:00:53.160> league<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> I've<00:00:54.719> gone

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
back from the same league so I've gone

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.209 
back from the same league so I've gone
with<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> play<00:00:55.320> called<00:00:55.500> gamberini<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.129> know

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
with a play called gamberini I know

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
with a play called gamberini I know
there's<00:00:56.520> another<00:00:56.760> player<00:00:57.030> called<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.539> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
there's another player called up it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.260 
there's another player called up it's
Santa<00:00:58.260> cross<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.739> something<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.789> but

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
Santa cross or something like that but

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
Santa cross or something like that but
they're<00:01:00.420> both<00:01:00.570> quite<00:01:01.140> similar<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.590> one's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
they're both quite similar this one's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.789 
they're both quite similar this one's
got<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> 79<00:01:02.280> pace<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.480> he's<00:01:03.629> 6<00:01:04.140> foot<00:01:04.290> 1<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.680> he's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
got a 79 pace but he's 6 foot 1 so he's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.200 
got a 79 pace but he's 6 foot 1 so he's
a<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.189> tall<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> makes

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a little bit tall and I think that makes

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.910 
a little bit tall and I think that makes
him<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.600> bit<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.810> consistent<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
him a little bit more consistent so

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.780 
him a little bit more consistent so
you're<00:01:08.040> 78<00:01:08.400> heading<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.880> 77<00:01:09.920> again<00:01:10.920> 77<00:01:11.549> head<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you're 78 heading in 77 again 77 head in

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.920 
you're 78 heading in 77 again 77 head in
and<00:01:11.939> 78<00:01:12.659> defending<00:01:13.380> um<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> yeah<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.390> far<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and 78 defending um but yeah so far you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.149 
and 78 defending um but yeah so far you
can<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> green<00:01:16.560> lines<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> he's

can see all the green lines and he's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
can see all the green lines and he's
this<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:17.939> trio<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.720> gonna<00:01:18.869> work

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
really well in the defense they're gonna

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.310 
really well in the defense they're gonna
hard<00:01:21.330> they're<00:01:21.600> gonna<00:01:21.720> position<00:01:21.990> themselves

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
hard they're gonna position themselves

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.620 
hard they're gonna position themselves
really<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:22.920> against<00:01:23.700> any<00:01:23.820> incumbent

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
really well against any incumbent

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
really well against any incumbent
attackers<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.009> go<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> our<00:01:26.369> right<00:01:26.640> back

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
attackers and if we go to our right back

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
attackers and if we go to our right back
to<00:01:27.030> my<00:01:27.150> already<00:01:27.330> guess<00:01:27.630> he<00:01:27.780> knows<00:01:27.900> Italian

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
one to the tally of 5 stars killers go

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.040 
one to the tally of 5 stars killers go
up<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.340> next<00:03:21.610> one<00:03:21.730> got<00:03:21.880> roubini<00:03:22.269> own<00:03:22.480> this

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
up to the next one got roubini own this

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.390 
up to the next one got roubini own this
is<00:03:23.200> gonna<00:03:23.320> keep<00:03:23.590> their<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.130> bright<00:03:24.370> green

is gonna keep their the bright green

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.460 
is gonna keep their the bright green
chemistry<00:03:24.880> because<00:03:25.660> he's<00:03:25.959> from<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.260> same

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
chemistry because he's from the same

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.830
