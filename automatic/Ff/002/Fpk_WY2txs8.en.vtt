final<00:03:34.940> thing<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.210> want<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.480> note<00:03:35.720> but<00:03:35.990> this<00:03:36.230> is

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
final thing I want to note but this is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.190 
final thing I want to note but this is
that<00:03:36.740> you<00:03:36.920> don't<00:03:37.100> get<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.820> achievement<00:03:38.200> until

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that you don't get the achievement until

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.900 
that you don't get the achievement until
the<00:03:39.440> chocolate<00:03:39.590> gets<00:03:39.920> off<00:03:40.130> which<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.700> main

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
the chocolate gets off which is the main

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.240 
the chocolate gets off which is the main
reason<00:03:41.360> why<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.600> cut<00:03:41.960> off<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.110> bottom<00:03:42.650> ending

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
reason why I cut off the bottom ending

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.550 
reason why I cut off the bottom ending
because<00:03:43.940> even<00:03:44.420> if<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.540> reach<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.320> chopper

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
because even if you reach the chopper

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.520 
because even if you reach the chopper
like<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.100> minute<00:03:46.550> if<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.840> bots<00:03:48.110> are<00:03:48.290> still

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
like a minute if the bots are still

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.290 
like a minute if the bots are still
alive<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:49.100> they<00:03:49.190> take<00:03:49.400> like<00:03:49.580> six<00:03:49.880> minutes<00:03:50.270> to

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
alive and they take like six minutes to

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.270 
alive and they take like six minutes to
either<00:03:50.480> die<00:03:50.900> or<00:03:50.930> get<00:03:51.410> on<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.740> chopper<00:03:51.920> you

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
either die or get on the chopper you

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:04.520 
either die or get on the chopper you
