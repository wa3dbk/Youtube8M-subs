00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello good here Juan Daniel 25 10 with 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.910
 another video another small tutorial about 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.390
 a very useful way in my opinion and it is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.070
 the crafting table 3 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.630
 before you ask or what 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.000
 ask someone the crafting table 2 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.700
 already stopped having support they left it in 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.140
 the 1.1 at least have not done the 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.330
 update even though I already think it's 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.850
 a little late to be updates and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.439
 you could say that he is already leaving 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.640
 support and good have taken the crafting 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.350
 table 3 with apart from the improvements 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 I already had my face without a tablet 2 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.520
 with a couple more that we're going to teach good 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
 is costing this way like a crash 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.990
 normal tablet team and a book and get 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 a crafting tablet 3 equal 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.220
 now we are here as you see 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.680
 is going to give you all the possible punishments 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.300
 that you can have that you can get out of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 this from what you have in the inventory 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.770
 but they are going to have done it in a way 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 somewhat special if he played at 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 used this used the creation 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.640
 table 2 will also see that they change 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.759
 some things for example this table does not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.100
 it only allows you to create things with 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.619
 the ones you have in the inventory but that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 You can make them craft that I repeat the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.940
 cristeros required to reach 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.580
 certain object for example ham 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.470
 ax as you see I do not have sticks but that's 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.630
 sticks will take us out of the wood the va 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.009
 to turn into wood into plates of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 wood that's going to turn them into 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.250
 that will turn them together 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.530
 with the diamonds that I have here in the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.450
 ax and good let's give an example 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.850
 this sale here is used to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.000
 what are you going to play and for the works is 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 say no longer you're not going to click and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.640
 drag with the mouse and then put in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.039
 your inventory not what you have to do 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.929
 is for example to see with what program 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.050
 'school done I already say theoretically 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.210
 they should have two wooden two two 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.690
 sticks and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.810
 as you see it is not 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.940
 you click and you're not going to stay in the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.890
 put the mouse but it will be placed 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.530
 directly here and good with button 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 right nothing happens well there was 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.390
 tried and good as you come you already have this 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.150
 here that are the works and the product 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 final that is called access and good if 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.180
 you make it is based is another way by 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.569
 example of this already directly catches you 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.219
 the two clubs here for example I know 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.359
 the areas with the tail of this is that 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.719
 I have also installed the industrial 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.719
 kraft 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.090
 for example that is this this this way 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.709
 is whatever anything after 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.859
 the kraft and gives directly as you see 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.359
 also allows you from the same trunk 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.700
 you can take out the four types of wood 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.290
 different you do not have to have a the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.500
 darker trunk to get the most 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 dark if not from normal allows you 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.060
 take out the four different types of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 wood and good that's all basically 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.459
 then for why are you taking that from here 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.120
 and now we 're going and you leave something and you take the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.310
 table because you see that it falls all other 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.159
 thing to say about the table is that although 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.400
 see that I am in normal mode breaks 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.439
 of a punch already and falls is something can 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.969
 seem useful to some to some to me 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.240
 I do not find it very useful could have 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.920
 put a time d 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.900
 that is to say that it breaks very easily 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.490
 but not so much that it's a touch anymore 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.840
 it is already falls I do not know always are the 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.300
 accidents and over now you have to 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.190
 put it back but well I do not know is to 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.950
 my opinion and well I hope that you have 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.290
 liked the video like and subscribe and 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.290
 until the next video
