00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.299
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.410
 another video of me my name is at 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.640
 rita he says at gap to the keyboard 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.099
 not even from time to time this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.800
 need to ask yourself what if 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.270
 it does not exist just once 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 to follow up and get upset about it 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.529
 that one thing you do 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 absolutely did not want to do 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.340
 because because it did not work where 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.870
 According to you or whatever they are 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.280
 not to upset about it 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.390
 So that's why I'm so great 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.980
 that at bcg miles article is the one 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 hour gameplay of star wars 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.660
 Battlefront 3 shows it's a pre 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.810
 alpha but what you see there is 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.149
 just great and we can not 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.660
 because the project was discontinued 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.489
 because disney lucasarts bought one 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
 Suck it play us all unfortunately 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.460
 it was gone through the rag 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.409
 probably not anymore 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.700
 is recorded because it was not 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.009
 extended is simply canceled 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.649
 its pre alpha phase of being too present 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.150
 now all and wanders and a pre 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.610
 alpha phase now from another 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.320
 would collect developer with a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 similar disaster as duke nukem 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.380
 forever hands and well, really a pity 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.140
 very much a pity for anyone who wants that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.280
 wants to look at bitter bitter tears 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.369
 to cry 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.170
 So I already had one or 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.720
 other tears suppress that me 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.220
 has looked at the can definitely on 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 click the link in the description 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.240
 this leads to the article by pc gamer 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.310
 I can not show anything here because 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.080
 it's under copyright so i'm asking 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.729
 me how long that is still in it 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.350
 will stay how long that will be 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.970
 because I'm allowed to link 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.650
 pretty sure that either disney 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.720
 or someone else in there pretty much 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.470
 beam hammer foreskin so in this 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.360
 location 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.189
 look at it and as quickly 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.009
 as it goes only if absolutely necessary 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.049
 otherwise really wanted very switch 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.350
 what can you say about it unfortunately not 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.140
 too much it is really very sad 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.300
 together with star wars 2013, it's fine 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.750
 definitively dead 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.190
 it will not come back though 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.130
 individual aspects shown here 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.210
 single new feature are greeks to 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.620
 that is in a pre alpha phase 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.080
 but we can perhaps a kickstart 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.720
 get something for that, that the pre 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.400
 alpha as well as reads i 'd dare i cant 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.920
 again for ten euros spend the pre 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.840
 alpha looked damn cool i would 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.070
 even if it over sees it too 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.020
 Dax I had it there are some 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.940
 passionate mother from the 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.560
 community the game in a sensible 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.540
 alpha or ventricle beta phase 1 2 through 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.280
 Of course, mods will not work that way 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.780
 we the original team work on it 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.760
 but they make people he's with 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.380
 passion doing that comes back from 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.190
 Maybe pixar will get please 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.320
 anyone 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.190
 i would really earn money for that 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.930
 want to spend 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.350
 extremely sad that we do not have that 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.900
 could I do not want is about to 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.670
 really heartbreaking and me 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.750
 many people do not have that 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.030
 if you really easy to watch 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.040
 Annoy what you are easy on how 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.960
 I nevertheless so it is very 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.670
 too bad I just wanted it for a short time 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.900
 communicate before it is maybe gone 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.620
 before it was maybe locked 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.620
 otherwise discussed comments such as 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.490
 it's shit but it's first with ochs 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.490
