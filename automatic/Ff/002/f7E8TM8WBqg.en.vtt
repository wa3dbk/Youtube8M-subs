00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 Hello friends with you Hades and today 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.780
 we look mod for minecraft which 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.270
 will add us new pets 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 these pets can become friendly 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.580
 mobs that already have a default on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.100
 minecraft 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.080
 but let's get everything in order first 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.210
 you need to knock out 8 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 special essences these assessments and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.199
 drop out absolutely from any mobs I 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.870
 chose the zombies let's kill 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.210
 it is them now I will knock out one thing and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 we have enough of this I really have no luck 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 now they fall out quite often i 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.390
 measured and somewhere with 5 mobs falls 1 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.210
 esencia is such a statistic 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.910
 but I obviously have no luck I already killed five 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.520
 and the essence didn't fall you do n't even know 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.129
 how does she look here she is finally 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.649
 we got the essence and let's say I drank 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 Already eight pieces now I can craft 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.129
 rainbow essence plus I will need 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 another gold bar 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.660
 and already from it you can do 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.750
 absolutely all mob summoners who 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.080
 exist in fashion let's take them here 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.260
 and here they are all on my panel 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.799
 7 pieces only 7 pieces and let's go for 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.350
 order 1 could this cow summoner for 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.570
 cows crafting that way and thatâ€™s how 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.689
 she looks like an ordinary seemingly cow 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.790
 which has a true 24 life but she can 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.400
 attack if we right click on it 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.560
 mouse button she says she does 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.439
 there is now it costs we order 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.360
 now it well, so we said sarcastically 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.180
 can stop to eat that is 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.579
 she follows us call zombies and she 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.860
 it will attack blows it for 5 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.490
 hp and look pretty jumps 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.680
 effectively 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 yes we got a very strong cow 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.079
 maybe it even if someone knows come on 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.790
 kills his zombie zombies actually 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.740
 very stupid could therefore not even 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.360
 attack pets for example if we 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.159
 take the spiders then they will already be 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.700
 fight with our pets 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.680
 so we still test on the shelves 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.229
 here and the spider also jump on our cow 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.420
 and now he fights well, but still 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.220
 the cow is much stronger you can't 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.370
 treat her with no meat or anything 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.690
 like she herself will be regina 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.959
 feast for some time 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.760
 until fully recovered well then 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.890
 cows we looked you also by the way 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.720
 can you give her armor and armor this 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.330
 any helmet that is you can't 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.239
 give bibs for wearing shoes only 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.280
 helmet for example take a diamond helmet 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.780
 so you can see the difference that is, we 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.209
 hit with but 8 kb family 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.030
 Now we wear a diamond helmet there in chat 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.480
 it is written that he gives 20 defenses well 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.410
 and now take it and demolish only 1 x n 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.239
 you are serious 2 hp 1 hp and I have already checked and 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.099
 could never do it 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.700
 there is so much this helmet gives a lot 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.160
 of protection 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.930
 I would give it to me but I will have to kill 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.150
 this cow because she will be us 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.280
 stop you from looking at other mobs and I 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.470
 I tell you once I do not have to chew p 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.299
 you will have to kill her, and then he will write me again 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.519
 You are body art and flayer, by the way. 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.700
 the diamond helmet that we gave her fell 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.349
 now call sheep a summoner for 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.480
 sheep are crafting like this 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.040
 use a variety of wool by the way 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.680
 look beautiful it looks 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.230
 sheep and 20 kb and she's about the same 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 that the cow also blows 5 hp 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.489
 the truth attacks me a little bit 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.700
 faster generally could differ by 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.400
 speeds differ in damage and 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.829
 differ in attack type but some 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.660
 jump some no what 's this 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.599
 I think that's a sheep to look beyond personal 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.010
 so we will go faster farther 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.930
 we are coming chicken 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.780
 here it will be fun chicken crafting 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.879
 here and so let 's call it 16x foam 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.829
 so small and really very 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.169
 weak i wouldn't recommend it to you 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.870
 do the chicken because it blows down 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.730
 23 hp and almost lost a spider 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.989
 and for falls somehow strange 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.060
 look she flies away 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.879
 flies away from the spider maybe he's her now 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.730
 Chicken wins, please beat him 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.090
 yes she still won her stayed 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.000
 one hp which i will forgive myself 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.560
 chicken but need further we go 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.680
 sheep 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.109
 although there is no sheep of course a pig 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.760
 I'm already confused I can never call 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.329
 many mobs farther we have a pig 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.340
 the pig is crafted from the skin of the pig very 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.380
 it would seem strange what kind of skin 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.360
 pigs she falls out of the ordinary pigs 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.930
 it's like with a cow that is when we 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.370
 we kill 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.590
 personal pigs we get this here 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.449
 skin let's test again and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.729
 really fell skin by the way 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.039
 Essence also fell well let 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.900
 let's call a pig it seems to me just 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.539
 yet the strongest pet because 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.419
 her very strong attack let's attack 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.580
 for 6 damage she takes down and also blows 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.940
 pretty quickly then let's call 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.930
 already 2 spiders and see who will win 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.500
 of course our pig 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.600
 up to one hundred percent win though she is now 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.419
 so losing and she had nine 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.820
 PPC after three spiders 9 HP seems to me 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.400
 very well, well, well, let's go further 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.430
 kill our mumps and look further at 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.530
 we go mushroom cow she craft 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.270
 so here it is the same as 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.430
 ordinary cow just with a different skin 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.320
 if you like mushrooms or mushroom 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.380
 cow you can choose yourself this 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.840
 she is no different than the same cow 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.729
 what is there really spiders and beats 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.680
 more energetic through the windows got caught 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.520
 strong what is such a cow 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.800
 killed 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.900
 and we go further we have a dog and 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.909
 this dog is no different than 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.080
 what is already minecraft you have it 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.050
 you can only craft 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.570
 attack the same dog look 5 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.520
 damage same attack even collar there 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.070
 that is, the author did not even change anything 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.199
 This really is such a dog to me the way 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.630
 like a doggie cool he but me 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.520
 have to kill him unfortunately this is so i 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.770
 he had to kill him now 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.470
 farther we go last could it 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.720
 the cat is crafting from two fish and 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.599
 general then here so let 's call it 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.289
 and I got my beautiful orange 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.539
 favorite color 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.729
 well i mean of cats of course there 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.130
 just cats have two colors black and 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.979
 I like orange more 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.110
 so my favorite color is blue 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.940
 here are such cats by the way creepers and 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.220
 they will be interesting to attack or not 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.470
 because the rest of the creeper pets aren't 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.849
 attack before the cat also does not attack 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.710
 creepers because creepers 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.750
 these are dangerous mobs and they are big 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.750
 likely to undermine your pets 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.750
 so the author took this into account and the pets just 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.720
 don't attack cats let's hang cat 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.699
 cow cat won then we 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.099
 there are still some things that 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.930
 added by this mod now I tell you them 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.370
 I will show first this here 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.350
 mars essence 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.460
 it is crafted from mossy cobblestones and 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.740
 rainbow essence 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.870
 and she needed to make a saddle 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.880
 someone told me the saddle can be easily 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.000
 to craft leather and iron in general 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.669
 default minecraft on version 1.7.10 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.940
 but now you can with this mod 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:01.400
 craft it so we still have 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.530
 we have such a wand poet went 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.810
 Kraft it here and now I tell you 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.699
 show what she does holding the left shift 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.280
 and poked in the right mouse button you can 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.800
 change modes and now we have selected 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.410
 armor mode that is, you can see what 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.010
 put on our sheep like this 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.169
 wand 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.960
 further by clicking again you can open 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.690
 chat chat with your pets is very strange 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.180
 that sounds but let's use this i 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:30.380
 I'll be quiet make a lot of noise 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:32.810
 shut your mouth time talk no noise 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.610
 Well and phrases in a style not yet begin 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.340
 repeat and it can be used 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.330
 only if you are very bored over there 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.100
 party time 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.199
 and on this all I hope you mod 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.940
 liked if so then put likes 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:47.169
 subscribe to the channel and I wish you 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.169
 good luck everyone bye friends
