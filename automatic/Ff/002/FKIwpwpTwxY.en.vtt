because<00:02:14.130> believe<00:02:14.700> me<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:15.090> turned<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:15.630> what

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
because believe me it's turned into what

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.350 
because believe me it's turned into what
a<00:02:15.900> lot<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> people<00:02:16.320> want<00:02:16.650> now<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.360> sometimes

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
a lot of people want now and sometimes

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.730 
a lot of people want now and sometimes
it<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:20.900> sometimes<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> whole<00:02:22.170> concept<00:02:22.530> is

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
it is sometimes the whole concept is

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.830 
it is sometimes the whole concept is
attempting<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:24.540> able<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.870> appeal<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:27.390> think

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
attempting to be able to appeal I think

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
attempting to be able to appeal I think
if<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.050> was<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.500> then<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.459> would

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
if I was to do that then I would

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.930 
if I was to do that then I would
effectively<00:02:30.000> become<00:02:31.130> absolutely<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.730> have

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
effectively become absolutely and I have

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.840 
effectively become absolutely and I have
my<00:02:33.360> if<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:36.630> driving<00:02:36.870> strength<00:02:40.850> I

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
my if I have the driving strength I

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.030 
my if I have the driving strength I
think<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:42.270> revealed

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
