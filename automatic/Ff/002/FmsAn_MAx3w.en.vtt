I can XP farm with it too instead of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.070 
I can XP farm with it too instead of
just<00:02:32.310> collect<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> resources<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.690> kill

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
just collect the resources I can kill

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.970 
just collect the resources I can kill
them<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.290> they're<00:02:34.500> weakened<00:02:34.830> by<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
them because they're weakened by the
