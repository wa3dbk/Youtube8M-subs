00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
greens in the late 90s people began to

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.870 
greens in the late 90s people began to
discover<00:00:22.850> a<00:00:23.770> feathered<00:00:24.770> dinosaurs<00:00:25.310> diners

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
discover a feathered dinosaurs diners

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.030 
discover a feathered dinosaurs diners
with<00:00:26.119> Dino<00:00:26.420> fuzz<00:00:26.779> at<00:00:27.080> that<00:00:27.470> point<00:00:27.770> became

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
with Dino fuzz at that point became

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.790 
with Dino fuzz at that point became
interesting<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.640> know<00:00:28.790> what<00:00:29.600> that<00:00:30.140> how<00:00:30.529> that

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
interesting to know what that how that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.200 
interesting to know what that how that
those<00:00:31.130> feathers<00:00:31.460> could<00:00:31.610> have<00:00:31.730> influenced<00:00:32.120> the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
those feathers could have influenced the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.030 
those feathers could have influenced the
appearance<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.750> it

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.370 

we<00:00:37.670> found<00:00:37.850> out<00:00:38.030> is<00:00:38.240> that<00:00:38.270> fossil<00:00:39.230> fighters

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
we found out is that fossil fighters

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.010 
we found out is that fossil fighters
they<00:00:39.680> preserve<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.450> melanin<00:00:41.450> that<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:41.900> the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
they preserve the melanin that is the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.360 
they preserve the melanin that is the
pigment<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:42.470> gives<00:00:42.560> the<00:00:42.800> color<00:00:43.040> to<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
pigment that gives the color to the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.430 
pigment that gives the color to the
feather<00:00:43.580> so<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.510> way<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:44.600> I<00:00:44.810> got<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.080> I<00:00:45.290> got

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
feather so the way that I got it I got

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.230 
feather so the way that I got it I got
the<00:00:45.770> idea<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.100> we<00:00:46.340> could<00:00:46.520> potentially<00:00:46.910> use

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
the idea that we could potentially use

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.120 
the idea that we could potentially use
this<00:00:47.570> to<00:00:47.810> put<00:00:48.080> colors<00:00:48.380> and<00:00:48.560> dinosaurs<00:00:48.950> came

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
this to put colors and dinosaurs came

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.860 
this to put colors and dinosaurs came
from<00:00:49.310> a<00:00:49.430> very<00:00:49.580> odd<00:00:49.760> angle<00:00:50.210> because<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.750> was

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
from a very odd angle because I was

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.110 
from a very odd angle because I was
actually<00:00:51.020> looking<00:00:51.170> at<00:00:51.500> puzzles<00:00:51.890> quits<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:52.970> we

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
actually looking at puzzles quits and we

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.140 
actually looking at puzzles quits and we
find<00:00:53.360> fossils<00:00:53.600> quits<00:00:54.310> that<00:00:55.310> have<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.700> ink<00:00:55.910> sac

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
find fossils quits that have the ink sac

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.570 
find fossils quits that have the ink sac
preserved<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.890> quite<00:00:57.890> interestingly<00:00:58.130> when

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
preserved and quite interestingly when

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.729 
preserved and quite interestingly when
you<00:00:58.700> look<00:00:58.850> at<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.060> fossilized<00:00:59.750> ink<00:01:00.200> you<00:01:00.620> can

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
you look at this fossilized ink you can

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.560 
you look at this fossilized ink you can
actually<00:01:00.860> see<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.880> preserves<00:01:02.330> the

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
actually see that it preserves the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.380 
actually see that it preserves the
pigments<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:04.160> made<00:01:04.430> me<00:01:04.550> think<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:04.880> we

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
pigments and that made me think that we

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.440 
pigments and that made me think that we
should<00:01:05.570> be<00:01:05.660> able<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.930> find<00:01:06.610> this<00:01:07.610> pigment

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
should be able to find this pigment

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.359 
should be able to find this pigment
which<00:01:08.690> is<00:01:08.900> melanin<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.500> other<00:01:09.950> kinds<00:01:10.160> of

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
which is melanin in other kinds of

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.220 
which is melanin in other kinds of
fossils<00:01:10.759> such<00:01:11.300> as<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:11.630> for<00:01:11.810> example<00:01:12.140> feathers

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.460 

melanin<00:01:18.100> pigments<00:01:18.460> are<00:01:18.580> created<00:01:19.000> by

melanin pigments are created by

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
melanin pigments are created by
pigment<00:01:20.010> cells<00:01:20.190> which<00:01:20.790> package<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.450> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
pigment cells which package them in

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.480 
shapes we have a locality in Denmark
that<00:01:33.510> is<00:01:33.600> about<00:01:33.780> 55<00:01:34.320> million<00:01:34.590> years<00:01:34.830> old<00:01:35.070> where

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that is about 55 million years old where

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.430 
that is about 55 million years old where
we<00:01:35.580> find<00:01:35.790> fossilized<00:01:36.330> birds<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:37.050> feathers

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
we find fossilized birds with feathers

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.870 
we find fossilized birds with feathers
I'm<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.890> took<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.220> fossil<00:01:38.610> under<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I'm going to took this fossil under a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
I'm going to took this fossil under a
scanning<00:01:39.180> electron<00:01:39.360> microscope<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> started

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
scanning electron microscope and started

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310 
scanning electron microscope and started
zooming<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.730> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.120> under<00:01:42.660> fossil<00:01:42.990> feathers

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
zooming in on the under fossil feathers

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.980 
zooming in on the under fossil feathers
I<00:01:44.010> was<00:01:44.400> just<00:01:44.520> met<00:01:44.790> by<00:01:44.940> this<00:01:45.120> ocean<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.690> little

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I was just met by this ocean of little

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.760 
I was just met by this ocean of little
sausage<00:01:46.380> shake<00:01:46.590> structures<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
sausage shake structures and that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.140 
sausage shake structures and that
confirmed<00:01:49.770> my<00:01:49.890> expectations<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.550> melon<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
confirmed my expectations that melon is

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.520 
confirmed my expectations that melon is
very<00:01:51.869> abundant<00:01:52.410> in<00:01:53.100> fossils<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.229> also<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
very abundant in fossils and also it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.230 
very abundant in fossils and also it
means<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.880> sort<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
means that we can use this sort of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.149 
means that we can use this sort of
information<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.930> put<00:01:58.110> colors<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.710> dinosaurs

plumage what Rick he said when he first

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.750 
plumage what Rick he said when he first
saw<00:02:55.319> this<00:02:55.500> thing<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:55.980> started<00:02:56.280> realizing

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
saw this thing and we started realizing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.339 
saw this thing and we started realizing
what<00:02:56.909> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> color<00:02:57.329> Patterson<00:02:57.780> hat<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.230> that

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
what kind of color Patterson hat is that

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.680 
what kind of color Patterson hat is that
it<00:02:58.530> looks<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.920> spangled<00:02:59.370> Hamburg<00:02:59.760> if<00:03:00.510> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it looks like a spangled Hamburg if you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.130 
it looks like a spangled Hamburg if you
see<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.560> entry<00:03:02.190> owners<00:03:02.549> as<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:02.849> cold<00:03:03.150> and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
see this entry owners as it's cold and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.780 
see this entry owners as it's cold and
just<00:03:04.500> have<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.829> quick<00:03:05.069> look<00:03:05.129> at<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.640> look

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
just have a quick look at it and look

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.729 
just have a quick look at it and look
away<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:06.030> think<00:03:06.390> most<00:03:06.629> people<00:03:06.870> would<00:03:06.900> say<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
away I think most people would say that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.450 
away I think most people would say that
it<00:03:08.010> looks<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> chicken

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.760 

this<00:03:15.210> fossil<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.630> from<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.530> late

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
this fossil is from the late

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.100 
this fossil is from the late
jurassic<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.790> learning<00:03:18.390> province<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.080> china

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
jurassic of learning province in china

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.070 
jurassic of learning province in china
so<00:03:20.000> these<00:03:21.000> chinese<00:03:21.450> examples<00:03:21.960> are

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
so these chinese examples are

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.720 
so these chinese examples are
extraordinary<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.010> many<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> them<00:03:23.550> do

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
extraordinary and that many of them do

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.260 
extraordinary and that many of them do
have<00:03:24.000> an<00:03:24.300> outline<00:03:24.990> of<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.290> feathers<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.890> both

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
have an outline of the feathers on both

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.490 
have an outline of the feathers on both
extinct<00:03:27.270> birds<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.840> these<00:03:28.080> are<00:03:28.470> early

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
extinct birds and these are early

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.730 
extinct birds and these are early
dinosaurs<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> interesting<00:03:31.050> prospect<00:03:31.680> of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
dinosaurs so the interesting prospect of

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.620 
dinosaurs so the interesting prospect of
this<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.340> we<00:03:32.460> can<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.150> mountain<00:03:33.360> is

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
this is that we can see that mountain is

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.140 
this is that we can see that mountain is
preserved<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.740> all<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.400> fossil<00:03:35.820> feathers

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
preserved in all these fossil feathers

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.990 
preserved in all these fossil feathers
it's<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:37.260> rule<00:03:37.530> rather<00:03:38.370> than<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.670> exception

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.600 

the<00:03:45.000> future<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:46.200> dinosaur<00:03:46.830> paleontology<00:03:47.430> and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
the future in dinosaur paleontology and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.820 
the future in dinosaur paleontology and
with<00:03:47.820> an<00:03:48.300> ontology<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.690> birds<00:03:48.960> and<00:03:49.260> mammals

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
with an ontology of birds and mammals

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.670 
with an ontology of birds and mammals
will<00:03:50.490> be<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.940> we<00:03:51.330> will<00:03:51.930> probably<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.380> able<00:03:52.590> to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
will be that we will probably be able to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.060 
will be that we will probably be able to
reconstruct<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.490> some<00:03:53.910> detail<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:55.770> color

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
reconstruct in some detail the color

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.340 
reconstruct in some detail the color
that<00:03:56.940> they<00:03:57.060> had<00:03:57.240> in<00:03:57.270> life<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:58.050> is<00:03:58.200> like

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
that they had in life this is like

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.980 
that they had in life this is like
