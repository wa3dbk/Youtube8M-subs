00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
here

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.020 
here
hang<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.830> Traxxas<00:01:51.580> Talon

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
hang on so this is the Traxxas Talon

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.060 
hang on so this is the Traxxas Talon
wheel<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:55.450> trencher<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:56.920> they're

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
wheel and this is a trencher so they're

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.700 
wheel and this is a trencher so they're
similar<00:01:57.430> in<00:01:57.700> size<00:01:57.910> but<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:59.080> trenchers<00:01:59.530> are

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
similar in size but the trenchers are

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.150 
similar in size but the trenchers are
definitely<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.930> aggressive<00:02:02.500> in<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.860> tread

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
definitely more aggressive in the tread

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.880 
definitely more aggressive in the tread
and<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:04.300> think<00:02:04.510> these<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:05.110> think<00:02:05.740> these<00:02:05.830> have

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
and I think these I think these have

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.710 
and I think these I think these have
been<00:02:06.160> maybe<00:02:06.580> run<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:09.090> two<00:02:10.090> or<00:02:10.240> three<00:02:10.270> times

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
been maybe run just two or three times

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.740 
been maybe run just two or three times
maybe<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:12.070> they're<00:02:12.460> basically<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:13.330> brand

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
maybe so they're basically like brand

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.410 
maybe so they're basically like brand
new<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.460> they<00:02:16.300> are<00:02:16.630> gonna<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.370> awesome<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:19.209> my
