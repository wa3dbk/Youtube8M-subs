subs

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
subs

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.910 
subs
we're<00:02:10.060> almost<00:02:10.209> at<00:02:10.509> halfway<00:02:10.959> mark<00:02:11.560> we're

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
we're almost at halfway mark we're

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.720 
we're almost at halfway mark we're
almost<00:02:12.040> at<00:02:12.250> 500<00:02:12.760> subs<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.099> think<00:02:15.459> getting

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
almost at 500 subs but I think getting

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.860 
almost at 500 subs but I think getting
that<00:02:15.849> thousand<00:02:16.360> dollars<00:02:16.599> in<00:02:16.720> one<00:02:16.840> day

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
that thousand dollars in one day

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.000 
that thousand dollars in one day
justifies<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.769> very<00:02:18.040> very<00:02:18.340> easily<00:02:18.610> now<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
justifies it very very easily now the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.289 
justifies it very very easily now the
reason<00:02:21.370> why<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.489> wanted<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:21.970> get<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.239> tattoo

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
reason why I wanted to get this tattoo

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.970 
reason why I wanted to get this tattoo
is<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.930> mainly<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.530> people<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:23.890> have

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
is is mainly for the people that have

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.860 
is is mainly for the people that have
watched<00:02:24.190> mine<00:02:24.370> draw<00:02:24.579> real<00:02:24.730> life<00:02:24.880> video<00:02:25.180> if<00:02:25.780> you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.460 
haven't seen it scroll down it's in
there<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.790> think<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.150> at<00:02:28.239> about<00:02:28.450> 60,000<00:02:29.230> views
