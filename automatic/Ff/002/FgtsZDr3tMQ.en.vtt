00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
gets foamy on the top and at this point

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.450 
gets foamy on the top and at this point
you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.240> add<00:01:57.600> cream<00:01:58.289> of<00:01:58.439> tartar<00:01:58.860> cream

longer<00:03:41.000> period<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:42.019> time<00:03:42.349> because<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:43.489> tends

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
longer period of time because it tends

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.009 
longer period of time because it tends
to<00:03:43.849> separate<00:03:44.419> a<00:03:44.450> little<00:03:44.660> bit<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:48.040> I'm<00:03:49.040> using

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.069 

that<00:03:55.489> I<00:03:55.609> wiped<00:03:55.940> with<00:03:56.120> white<00:03:56.660> distilled

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
that I wiped with white distilled

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.020 
that I wiped with white distilled
vinegar<00:03:57.169> to<00:03:57.620> make<00:03:57.769> sure<00:03:57.919> there<00:03:58.069> is<00:03:58.160> no<00:03:58.370> fat<00:03:58.730> and

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
vinegar to make sure there is no fat and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.080 
vinegar to make sure there is no fat and
then<00:03:59.599> you<00:03:59.720> can<00:03:59.900> also<00:04:00.579> place<00:04:01.579> a<00:04:01.669> piece<00:04:01.910> of

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
then you can also place a piece of

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.650 
then you can also place a piece of
plastic<00:04:02.540> wrap<00:04:02.599> on<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.079> top<00:04:03.319> this<00:04:03.739> will<00:04:04.190> help

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
plastic wrap on the top this will help

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.050 
plastic wrap on the top this will help
to<00:04:05.660> keep<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.349> icing<00:04:06.829> fresh<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.519> prevent<00:04:07.940> it

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
to keep the icing fresh and prevent it

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.390 
to keep the icing fresh and prevent it
from<00:04:08.090> crusting<00:04:08.780> because<00:04:09.620> once<00:04:09.859> icing<00:04:10.250> is

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
from crusting because once icing is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.589 
from crusting because once icing is
exposed<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:10.940> air<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.299> will<00:04:11.419> crust<00:04:11.780> over<00:04:12.579> and

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
exposed to air it will crust over and

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.020 
exposed to air it will crust over and
now<00:04:14.599> you're<00:04:14.810> ready<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.139> use<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.430> icing<00:04:16.820> or
