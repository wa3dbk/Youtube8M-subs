MVP<00:00:19.619> votes<00:00:20.000> than<00:00:21.000> Kevin<00:00:21.390> Durant<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.109> year<00:00:22.380> I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
MVP votes than Kevin Durant this year I

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.179

think<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.070> Griffin<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
think that Griffin is going to have a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.310 
think that Griffin is going to have a
monster<00:00:26.189> year<00:00:26.609> he's<00:00:27.090> gonna<00:00:27.330> score<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.810 
high 20s he's going to rebound above 12
rebounds<00:00:31.170> he's<00:00:31.650> gonna<00:00:31.800> get<00:00:32.070> four<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.489> five

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
rebounds he's gonna get four or five

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970

assists<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> night<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:34.320> gonna<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.950> easy

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
assists a night it's gonna be so easy

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
assists a night it's gonna be so easy
with<00:00:35.550> him<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:36.030> Paul<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.360> everyone<00:00:37.050> else

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
with him with Paul and everyone else

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.069 
with him with Paul and everyone else
that<00:00:37.500> he<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.820> take<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.840> world

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that he is just going to take this world

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
that he is just going to take this world
by<00:00:40.379> storm<00:00:40.489> similar<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.239> Derrick<00:00:42.809> Rose<00:00:43.079> did

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
by storm similar to how Derrick Rose did

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.010 
by storm similar to how Derrick Rose did
in<00:00:43.590> his<00:00:43.739> third<00:00:44.040> year<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:45.360> good<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.719> Durant

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
in his third year and as good as Durant

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.619 
in his third year and as good as Durant
is<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.590> could<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.250> him<00:00:47.460> getting<00:00:47.670> votes<00:00:48.300> split

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
is I could see him getting votes split

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
is I could see him getting votes split
with<00:00:48.930> Westbrook<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.860> same<00:00:50.070> way<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.460> Paul

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
with Westbrook the same way that Paul

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.630 
with Westbrook the same way that Paul
might<00:00:50.760> get<00:00:51.239> him<00:00:51.360> split<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:52.219> with<00:00:53.219> Griffin

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
might get him split with with Griffin

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
might get him split with with Griffin
but<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> Griffin's<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
but I think that Griffin's kind of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
but I think that Griffin's kind of
flashiness<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.699> gonna<00:00:56.969> head<00:00:57.210> being<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
flashiness is gonna head being in a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
flashiness is gonna head being in a
humongous<00:00:58.469> market<00:00:59.010> he's<00:00:59.430> gonna<00:00:59.640> push<00:00:59.879> him

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
humongous market he's gonna push him

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
humongous market he's gonna push him
over<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> top<00:01:01.579> now<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:04.350> what

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
over the top now I think I see what

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
over the top now I think I see what
you're<00:01:04.589> saying<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:06.119> makes<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.659> little

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you're saying and it it makes a little

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.940 
you're saying and it it makes a little
bit<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> sense<00:01:07.580> Durant<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:09.350> just<00:01:10.350> he's<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.710> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
bit of sense Durant is just he's just so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.120 
bit of sense Durant is just he's just so
important<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.670> team<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:14.220> know
