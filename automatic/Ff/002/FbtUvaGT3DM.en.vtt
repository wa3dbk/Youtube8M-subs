00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
for the pressure and you'll probably

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.000 
for the pressure and you'll probably
need<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.450> lot<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:30.050> strands<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.070> tape<00:02:31.280> for<00:02:31.940> this

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and if this ends up happening like that

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
and if this ends up happening like that
just<00:02:51.640> get<00:02:52.390> your<00:02:52.600> razor<00:02:53.380> real<00:02:53.710> quick<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.190> make

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
it wider like about that wide and just

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:45.199 
it wider like about that wide and just
keep<00:03:08.560> taping<00:03:08.830> it

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:53.670 

and<00:03:46.209> then<00:03:46.329> it<00:03:47.019> should<00:03:47.500> be<00:03:47.799> done<00:03:50.760> then<00:03:52.349> you<00:03:53.349> push

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
and then it should be done then you push

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.770 
and then it should be done then you push
it<00:03:53.709> in<00:03:53.980> more<00:03:54.189> and<00:03:54.459> when<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.700> light<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.060> it

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
it in more and when you light it it

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.860 
it in more and when you light it it
should<00:03:56.200> explode<00:03:56.620> from<00:03:57.609> all<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:58.030> pressure

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
should explode from all the pressure

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.490 
should explode from all the pressure
inside<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.590> it<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:01.629> make<00:04:01.810> sure<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.170> make<00:04:02.469> sure

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
inside of it to make sure and make sure

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.089 
inside of it to make sure and make sure
it's<00:04:02.920> all<00:04:03.159> taped<00:04:03.519> cut<00:04:03.790> down<00:04:04.000> good<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.540> no<00:04:04.750> air

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
it's all taped cut down good so no air

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.819 
it's all taped cut down good so no air
so<00:04:06.099> no<00:04:06.579> air<00:04:06.760> escapes<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.689> that's<00:04:08.319> how<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.590> make

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
so no air escapes and that's how to make

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.579 
so no air escapes and that's how to make
the<00:04:08.980> firework<00:04:09.370> bomb
