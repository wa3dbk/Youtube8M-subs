are<00:01:52.829> figures<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:54.570> maybe<00:01:54.720> aside<00:01:55.049> from

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
are figures I think maybe aside from

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.639 
are figures I think maybe aside from
Godzilla<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.950> had<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.460> SH<00:01:57.270> M<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
Godzilla I think I had you know SH M a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.969 
Godzilla I think I had you know SH M a
Godzilla<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.009> um<00:02:00.079> yeah<00:02:01.079> maybe<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:01.890> just

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
Godzilla but um yeah maybe I'm just

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
Godzilla but um yeah maybe I'm just
little<00:02:02.219> bit<00:02:02.310> spoiled<00:02:02.640> by<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.000> which<00:02:03.479> might<00:02:03.719> be

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
little bit spoiled by now which might be

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.740 
little bit spoiled by now which might be
it<00:02:04.049> maybe<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.430> don't<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.420> because

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
it maybe but I don't think so because

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
it maybe but I don't think so because
one<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> other<00:02:09.020> Pacific<00:02:10.020> Rim<00:02:10.200> figures<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
one of the other Pacific Rim figures I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.280 
one of the other Pacific Rim figures I
really<00:02:11.069> really<00:02:11.310> liked<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.330> think

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
really really liked so I just think
