a<00:00:00.269> common<00:00:00.900> problem<00:00:01.260> people<00:00:01.439> find<00:00:01.979> their<00:00:02.250> own

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
a common problem people find their own

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.039 
a common problem people find their own
video<00:00:02.610> graphics<00:00:03.000> cards<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.480> that<00:00:03.659> after<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
video graphics cards is that after a

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.430 
video graphics cards is that after a
while<00:00:04.259> they<00:00:04.470> tend<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.859> run<00:00:05.160> quite<00:00:05.580> hot<00:00:06.410> now<00:00:07.410> I

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
while they tend to run quite hot now I

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.500 
while they tend to run quite hot now I
plug<00:00:08.099> Peter<00:00:08.460> on<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> little<00:00:09.000> while

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
plug Peter on for a little while

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.410 
plug Peter on for a little while
already<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.860> I'm<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:11.790> doing<00:00:12.030> any<00:00:12.120> video

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
moment I am just running two screens off

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.269 
moment I am just running two screens off
my<00:00:17.609> GPU<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.680> at<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> moment<00:00:20.010> I've<00:00:20.250> been

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
my GPU and at the moment I've been

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.800 
my GPU and at the moment I've been
averaging<00:00:20.689> around<00:00:21.689> 70<00:00:22.380> degrees<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
averaging around 70 degrees which is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.740 
averaging around 70 degrees which is
quite<00:00:24.810> hot<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.320> honest<00:00:26.420> one<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> easy

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
quite hot to be honest one of the easy

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.710 
quite hot to be honest one of the easy
ways<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.349> found<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.039> drop<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.910> temperature<00:00:30.480> is

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
ways I found to drop this temperature is

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.799 
ways I found to drop this temperature is
to<00:00:30.960> use<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.380> Nvidia<00:00:31.710> control<00:00:31.830> panel<00:00:32.099> now<00:00:32.809> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to use the Nvidia control panel now a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.869 
to use the Nvidia control panel now a
default<00:00:34.440> setting<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.960> fan<00:00:37.380> speed<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.160> 40%

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
default setting for the fan speed is 40%

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.319 
default setting for the fan speed is 40%
which<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> really<00:00:40.440> low<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.180> it's<00:00:42.180> on

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
which is really low and it's on

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.529 
which is really low and it's on
automatic<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.890> won't<00:00:44.309> increase<00:00:44.760> unless

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
automatic so it won't increase unless

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.260 
automatic so it won't increase unless
you<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:45.930> doing<00:00:46.379> something<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.610> demanding

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you are doing something more demanding

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.650 
you are doing something more demanding
like<00:00:48.539> playing<00:00:48.840> game<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.440> example<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
like playing game for example so this

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.900 
like playing game for example so this
means<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> Nvidia<00:00:52.699> software<00:00:53.699> isn't

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
means that the Nvidia software isn't

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
means that the Nvidia software isn't
really<00:00:54.510> reacting<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> high<00:00:55.739> temperature

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
really reacting to the high temperature

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
really reacting to the high temperature
of<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.489> card<00:00:56.730> only<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.079> letting<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
of a card only to what you're letting it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.389 
of a card only to what you're letting it
do<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> first<00:01:00.449> easy<00:01:01.140> thing<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
do so first easy thing to do is to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.939 
do so first easy thing to do is to
switch<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.940> manual<00:01:03.120> control<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:04.019> turn

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
switch it to manual control and turn

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.850 
switch it to manual control and turn
temperature<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.500> initially<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
temperature up so initially I'm going to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.450 
temperature up so initially I'm going to
wake<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.369> full<00:01:09.560> full<00:01:10.560> speed<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
wake it up to full full speed just to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.600 
wake it up to full full speed just to
let<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.640> cool<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.560> initially<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.920> I'll

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
let it cool down initially and I'll

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.020 
let it cool down initially and I'll
lower<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> speed<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.570> once<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.110> has<00:01:16.350> dropped

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
lower the speed down once it has dropped

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.460 
lower the speed down once it has dropped
about<00:01:18.030> 10<00:01:18.270> degrees<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.780> other<00:01:21.810> easy<00:01:22.170> ways

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
about 10 degrees the other easy ways

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.460 
about 10 degrees the other easy ways
well<00:01:23.220> less<00:01:23.640> easy<00:01:23.939> ways<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.470> decrease

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
well less easy ways to decrease

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
well less easy ways to decrease
temperature<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.970> play<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
temperature is to play about the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.460 
temperature is to play about the
hardware<00:01:28.970> one<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> most<00:01:30.329> common<00:01:30.780> things

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
hardware one of the most common things

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.520 
hardware one of the most common things
that<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.970> affect<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.600> temperature<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that can affect the temperature is that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.710 
that can affect the temperature is that
if<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.150> file<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> GPU<00:01:36.810> itself<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:38.689> full<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
if the file on the GPU itself is full of

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.429 
if the file on the GPU itself is full of
dust

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
dust

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
dust
this<00:01:41.100> means<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.549> fan<00:01:41.790> won't<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.060> able<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> do

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
this means the fan won't be able to do

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
this means the fan won't be able to do
its<00:01:42.479> job<00:01:42.689> properly<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.920> won't<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.250> able<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
its job properly and it won't be able to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.120 
its job properly and it won't be able to
get<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> heat<00:01:45.270> off<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> card<00:01:45.869> itself<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
get all the heat off the card itself so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.910 
get all the heat off the card itself so
I<00:01:47.579> will<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.420> doing<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.689> follow<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:48.990> video<00:01:49.200> which

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
I will be doing a follow up video which

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.609 
I will be doing a follow up video which
will<00:01:50.189> show<00:01:50.460> taking<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> cards<00:01:52.229> taking

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
will show taking out the cards taking

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.010 
will show taking out the cards taking
off<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> fan<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.689> cleaning<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
off the fan and cleaning out all the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.600 
off the fan and cleaning out all the
dust<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.430> show<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.939> results

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
dust and then I will show the results

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.550 
dust and then I will show the results
following<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> install<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
following this I'm going to install a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.819 
following this I'm going to install a
another<00:02:02.219> fan<00:02:02.520> which<00:02:03.329> will<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.750> located<00:02:04.350> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
another fan which will be located just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.719 
another fan which will be located just
to<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.640> side<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> graphics<00:02:06.689> card<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:08.250> on

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to the side of the graphics card on on

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.820 
to the side of the graphics card on on
the<00:02:08.940> case<00:02:09.119> itself<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.840> I'm<00:02:10.229> hoping<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.679> this

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the case itself and I'm hoping that this

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.960 
the case itself and I'm hoping that this
would<00:02:11.160> not<00:02:11.940> knock<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> down

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
would not knock it down

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.340 
would not knock it down
few<00:02:13.180> degrees<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.480> Nvidia<00:02:16.960> control<00:02:17.080> panel

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
few degrees and the Nvidia control panel

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.650 
few degrees and the Nvidia control panel
at<00:02:17.770> default<00:02:18.010> doesn't<00:02:18.790> always<00:02:18.970> come<00:02:19.330> with<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
at default doesn't always come with the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.590 
at default doesn't always come with the
performance<00:02:20.170> tab<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.640> will<00:02:21.820> include<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.390> link

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
performance tab so I will include a link

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.850 
performance tab so I will include a link
on<00:02:22.780> my<00:02:22.810> blog<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.480> download<00:02:25.480> site<00:02:25.860> where

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
on my blog to the download site where

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.680 
on my blog to the download site where
you<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.100> get<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.610> driver<00:02:28.060> for<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
you can get the driver for the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.190 
you can get the driver for the
performance<00:02:29.380> tab<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.090> also<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> location<00:02:31.780> for

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
performance tab and also a location for

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.830 
performance tab and also a location for
the<00:02:32.590> speed<00:02:33.580> fan<00:02:33.820> software<00:02:34.360> which<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.660> quite

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the speed fan software which is quite

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.940 
the speed fan software which is quite
handy<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.200> have<00:02:35.670> as<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:37.300> shows<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.110> what

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
handy to have as it shows you what

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.110 
handy to have as it shows you what
temperature<00:02:39.160> all<00:02:39.580> your<00:02:39.760> different

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
temperature all your different

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.410 
temperature all your different
components<00:02:40.690> are<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:42.250> three<00:02:42.880> temperatures

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
components are so the three temperatures

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.690 
components are so the three temperatures
got<00:02:43.630> there<00:02:43.930> are<00:02:44.340> four<00:02:45.340> different<00:02:45.459> locations

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
got there are four different locations

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.570 
got there are four different locations
inside<00:02:46.450> my<00:02:46.660> case<00:02:46.900> they<00:02:47.860> obviously<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.370> hard

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
inside my case they obviously the hard

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.550 
inside my case they obviously the hard
drive<00:02:48.870> temperature<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.110> then<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.350> full

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
drive temperature and then the full

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.580 
drive temperature and then the full
cores<00:02:50.920> on<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.430> CPU<00:02:52.209> as<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.260> see<00:02:53.380> they're

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
cores on my CPU as you can see they're

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.390 
cores on my CPU as you can see they're
all<00:02:54.660> severely<00:02:55.660> lower<00:02:56.380> than<00:02:56.770> my<00:02:56.920> GPU

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
all severely lower than my GPU

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.260 
all severely lower than my GPU
temperature<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.850> one<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.180> be

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
temperature so that's the one to be

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.260 
temperature so that's the one to be
concerned<00:03:01.690> with<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:03.610> already<00:03:03.940> knocked<00:03:04.090> down

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
concerned with is already knocked down

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.170 
concerned with is already knocked down
about<00:03:04.600> four<00:03:04.900> degrees<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.650> I'd<00:03:06.490> expect<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.090> to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
about four degrees and I'd expect it to

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.620 
about four degrees and I'd expect it to
go<00:03:07.300> down<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.480> bit<00:03:07.600> further<00:03:08.640> but<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:10.000> do<00:03:10.150> have<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
go down a bit further but I do have the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.800 
go down a bit further but I do have the
feeling<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:11.020> there<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.620> dust<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.100> my<00:03:12.250> fan<00:03:12.520> and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
feeling that there is dust in my fan and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.690 
feeling that there is dust in my fan and
this<00:03:13.810> will<00:03:13.959> mean<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.380> won't<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.430> fan

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
this will mean that it won't the fan

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.780 
this will mean that it won't the fan
won't<00:03:15.970> be<00:03:16.120> fully<00:03:16.480> effective<00:03:16.989> at<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.170> moment

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
won't be fully effective at the moment

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.070 
won't be fully effective at the moment
so<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:18.850> hope<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.090> find<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.390> video<00:03:19.510> useful

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
so I hope you find this video useful

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.840 
so I hope you find this video useful
please<00:03:21.180> comment<00:03:22.180> below<00:03:22.300> thanks
