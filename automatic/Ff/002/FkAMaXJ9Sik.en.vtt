00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
small ones that they seem to be saying

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.539 
small ones that they seem to be saying
if<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.659> under<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> certain<00:01:37.170> weight<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.070> rules

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
if it's under a certain weight the rules

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.910 
if it's under a certain weight the rules
and<00:01:38.700> regulations<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.240> sort<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.689> away

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
and regulations will sort of go away

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
and regulations will sort of go away
once<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.430> bigger<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.030> think<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
once they get a bit bigger I think it's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
once they get a bit bigger I think it's
it's<00:01:43.530> right<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.860> proper<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.399> should

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's right and proper that they should

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
it's right and proper that they should
have<00:01:44.850> restrictions<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.439> big<00:01:46.619> difference

third<00:04:49.220> thing<00:04:49.430> is<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:50.050> Phantom's<00:04:51.050> have<00:04:51.440> a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
third thing is the Phantom's have a

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.420 
third thing is the Phantom's have a
built-in<00:04:51.970> database<00:04:53.200> so<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.710> literally<00:04:55.130> can't

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
things could work as far as I'm aware

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.640 
things could work as far as I'm aware
you'd<00:05:22.610> have<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:23.000> have<00:05:23.360> somebody<00:05:23.840> watching<00:05:24.380> it

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
you'd have to have somebody watching it

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.000 
you'd have to have somebody watching it
and<00:05:25.510> sort<00:05:26.510> of<00:05:26.630> being<00:05:26.960> able<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:27.229> possibly<00:05:27.800> take

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
and sort of being able to possibly take

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.250 
and sort of being able to possibly take
control<00:05:28.340> which<00:05:28.760> yeah<00:05:29.570> it<00:05:29.870> doesn't<00:05:30.020> make<00:05:30.229> sense

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
control which yeah it doesn't make sense

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.250 
control which yeah it doesn't make sense
for<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.740> Amazon<00:05:31.070> model<00:05:31.370> but<00:05:32.360> perhaps<00:05:32.540> rules

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
for the Amazon model but perhaps rules

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.200 
for the Amazon model but perhaps rules
will<00:05:33.470> change<00:05:33.800> in<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.370> fullness<00:05:34.550> of<00:05:34.669> time<00:05:34.820> I

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
will change in the fullness of time I

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.880 
will change in the fullness of time I
think<00:05:35.540> the<00:05:35.630> aircraft<00:05:36.380> would<00:05:36.530> have<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.770> have

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
think the aircraft would have to have

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.350 
think the aircraft would have to have
some<00:05:37.070> kind<00:05:37.100> of<00:05:37.340> collision<00:05:37.550> avoidance<00:05:38.000> system

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
some kind of collision avoidance system

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.510 
some kind of collision avoidance system
of<00:05:38.450> their<00:05:38.570> own<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:39.410> there<00:05:39.590> are<00:05:39.680> things<00:05:39.860> in<00:05:40.220> the

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
of their own and there are things in the

pipeline along them a beta tester for a

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
product that would detect something and

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.070 
product that would detect something and

if<00:05:46.169> there<00:05:46.349> was<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.470> problem<00:05:47.060> but<00:05:48.060> yeah<00:05:48.210> at<00:05:48.300> the

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
if there was a problem but yeah at the

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.629 
if there was a problem but yeah at the
moment<00:05:48.599> it's<00:05:49.259> not<00:05:49.349> really<00:05:49.650> feasible<00:05:49.830> with

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
now on sale the sky really is the limit

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.600 
now on sale the sky really is the limit
