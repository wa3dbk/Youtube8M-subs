00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
in front of you when you do this this is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.090 
in front of you when you do this this is
the<00:00:50.660> feint<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.110> will<00:00:51.230> fool<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.500> opponent<00:00:52.010> to

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
the feint that will fool the opponent to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.170 
the feint that will fool the opponent to
thinking<00:00:52.430> you're<00:00:52.550> moving<00:00:52.820> in<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.030> direction

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
thinking you're moving in this direction

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.750 
thinking you're moving in this direction
so<00:00:53.719> they<00:00:54.230> will<00:00:54.410> -<00:00:54.620> which<00:00:54.829> creates<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.309> space<00:00:55.550> for

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
so they will - which creates a space for

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.990 
so they will - which creates a space for
you<00:00:55.850> on<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.059> other<00:00:56.090> side<00:00:56.800> step<00:00:57.800> 3<00:00:58.190> with<00:00:58.820> all

sidestep fake about two yards away from
the<00:02:14.750> opponent<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.290> they<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:15.950> enough<00:02:16.190> space

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489

mistake<00:02:22.340> number<00:02:22.489> three<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.150> player

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
mistake number three is that the player

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.030 
mistake number three is that the player
doesn't<00:02:23.720> emphasize<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.410> fake<00:02:24.650> by<00:02:24.890> not

doesn't emphasize the fake by not

stepping far enough across and leaning

stepping far enough across and leaning
the<00:02:27.230> upper<00:02:27.440> body<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:28.700> makes<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.090> easy<00:02:29.270> for

for<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.040> player<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.430> really<00:02:34.700> step<00:02:34.970> across<00:02:35.209> and
