00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.949
 year preparing it this is a contest that 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.949
 is being done through the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.470
 national federation of rural women 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.000
 since I think it's about 20 years like that 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.570
 we have been going to this contest 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.299
 and 15 years with this since it was 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.450
 that the association was founded is the second 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.450
 Once we won already in the year 98 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.659
 we won in hontalbilla segovia and in the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.469
 year 99 the paellas were made 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.469
 here in talavera la real 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.439
 I'm not Juan Borrego, national president 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.789
 and international federation of the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.659
 rural woman 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:45.200
 Today we are in Talavera with 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.200
 the paellas contest number 20 that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.219
 we have been 20 years since the federation year 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.990
 after year watching how and in what way 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.939
 they make the paellas in each of the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.950
 communities of spain are the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.979
 differences that exist between ones and 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.799
 another one is mixture of both chicken 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.459
 rabbits pig another chicken and vegetables 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.920
 another one of vegetables already we think that it is 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.129
 something for chefs to have 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.040
 consider making a specific book and 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.590
 special about how women perform 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.209
 mostly rural that are very good 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.910
 I believe that the best cooks 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.720
 they exist because they also maintain those 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.930
 typical traditional dishes and it 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.690
 they also apply to the modern kitchen but 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.329
 above all you see the experience that 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.000
 has rural women had us 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.980
 invited to participate in this in this 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.010
 event that gathers here today because I think that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.829

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.030

 those two thousand five hundred people 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.140

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.740
 that badajoz or talavera had won the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.140
