it's influenced me since I was a tiny
little<00:01:39.639> child<00:01:40.329> i<00:01:40.659> grew<00:01:40.689> up<00:01:40.929> in<00:01:41.109> a<00:01:41.289> in<00:01:41.740> an

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
little child i grew up in a in an

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.300 
little child i grew up in a in an
italian-american<00:01:42.819> family<00:01:43.420> my<00:01:43.569> father<00:01:44.310> had

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
italian-american family my father had
