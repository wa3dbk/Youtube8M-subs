00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.949
 Hello dear friends of Track DV 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.949
 via today in the fifth episode is about it 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.919
 we wanted to uncover my big mess 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.779
 Lisa's first name stroll side stripes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.150
 with percent with green a dog 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 and what I found there so that's a real last one 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.239
 first choice 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.729
 that was there to hear 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.690
 that reduces 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.160
 does it have to be that way 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.590
 here Sieber becomes paper with the treeless yes 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 the power-couple Ecker 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.190
 the circle Unna 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700
 GrÃ¼nberg's narrowest 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.920
 or here 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 externally is made lost 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 there has 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.750
 Treptow 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.909
 Memmingen 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.930
 act 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 So it seems like a little no 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.620
 this is how Post relies on Europe 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.080
 So to be Buckley 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.670
 but still 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 thanks again for 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.060
 So Amon, I thank you again that you are this time again 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.900
 Time has come for track the woman 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.230
 and around 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.470
 This way should be a bit shorter because I have no time 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.490
 at large companies like that 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.730
 because I wanted to open my message again 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.870
 it keeps growing 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.109
 use 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.109
 whether money 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.000
 important is sufficient 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 the cockpit is all so committed to the environment and now around 7 4 percent 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.200
 Cook 2 still something to solve 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.889
 Davis is how it is with women 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.770
 the whole money has been and for both of us are in shock 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.340
 that's why it's now well suited to show only two victories 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.359
 with arrangements and it is also water to take away Chur 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.489
 come as a breakthrough Erkrath 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.949
 Bitburg 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.039
 Goc pulled Loew 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.919
 Forrester 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:35.469
 Schweitzer
