00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
janemba actually absorbed cell and they

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.610

were<00:00:40.149> able<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.659> come<00:00:40.809> up<00:00:40.899> with<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.109> fusion

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
were able to come up with a fusion

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.680 
were able to come up with a fusion
capable<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.640> powerful<00:00:42.699> enough<00:00:43.389> to<00:00:43.420> combat

cell<00:00:48.429> i<00:00:48.670> do<00:00:48.879> believe<00:00:49.239> that<00:00:49.479> would<00:00:49.629> actually

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
cell i do believe that would actually

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.959 
cell i do believe that would actually
help<00:00:50.079> out<00:00:50.379> janemba<00:00:50.889> a<00:00:51.010> lot<00:00:51.280> especially<00:00:51.519> in

that<00:00:52.120> form<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.749> course<00:00:53.109> we<00:00:53.229> never<00:00:53.409> really

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
that form of course we never really

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.709 
that form of course we never really
truly<00:00:53.769> saw<00:00:54.100> how<00:00:54.309> powerful<00:00:54.789> gogeta<00:00:55.239> actually

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
truly saw how powerful gogeta actually

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.750 
truly saw how powerful gogeta actually
is<00:00:55.899> so<00:00:56.469> i<00:00:56.499> do<00:00:56.589> believe<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.339> end<00:00:57.519> out

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
is so i do believe in the end out

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.899 
is so i do believe in the end out
somehow<00:00:58.209> some<00:00:58.749> way<00:00:58.949> Gogeta<00:00:59.949> will<00:01:00.339> find<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.789> way

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
somehow some way Gogeta will find a way

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.729 
somehow some way Gogeta will find a way
to<00:01:00.969> win<00:01:01.179> if<00:01:01.479> he<00:01:01.659> actually<00:01:01.839> was<00:01:02.350> able<00:01:02.499> to

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
to win if he actually was able to

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.680 
to win if he actually was able to
transfer<00:01:03.219> him<00:01:03.339> further<00:01:03.579> into<00:01:04.299> a<00:01:04.330> super<00:01:04.659> saiyan

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
transfer him further into a super saiyan

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.289 
transfer him further into a super saiyan
to<00:01:05.140> super<00:01:05.530> saiyan<00:01:05.710> 3<00:01:05.799> but<00:01:06.369> honestly<00:01:06.790> guys<00:01:06.970> with

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
to super saiyan 3 but honestly guys with

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.240 
to super saiyan 3 but honestly guys with
cell<00:01:07.630> backing<00:01:08.049> up<00:01:08.170> Janemba<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.830> with<00:01:09.159> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
cell backing up Janemba and with the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.100 
cell backing up Janemba and with the
ability<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.700> regenerate<00:01:10.210> i<00:01:10.540> do<00:01:10.600> believe<00:01:10.870> that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
ability to regenerate i do believe that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.780 
ability to regenerate i do believe that
they<00:01:11.290> actually<00:01:11.770> hold<00:01:11.980> an<00:01:12.100> advantage<00:01:12.640> over

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
they actually hold an advantage over

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.430 
they actually hold an advantage over
gogeta<00:01:13.420> given<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.720> fact<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:13.960> goji<00:01:14.140> they

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
gogeta given the fact that goji they

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.920 
gogeta given the fact that goji they
can't<00:01:14.680> really<00:01:14.800> recover<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.420> end<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:16.870> do

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
can't really recover so in the end I do

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.960 
can't really recover so in the end I do
believe<00:01:17.290> Gogeta<00:01:17.890> would<00:01:18.130> win<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.490> battle<00:01:18.790> if

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
believe Gogeta would win the battle if

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.850 
believe Gogeta would win the battle if
he<00:01:19.120> took<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.450> fight<00:01:19.660> as<00:01:19.870> serious<00:01:20.410> as<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.740> when

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
he took the fight as serious as you when

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.010 
he took the fight as serious as you when
he<00:01:20.950> met<00:01:21.190> Jenna<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.700> first<00:01:21.910> time<00:01:22.180> but<00:01:22.900> if

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
he met Jenna the first time but if

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.380 
he met Jenna the first time but if
Gogeta<00:01:23.740> actually<00:01:24.190> drag<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.640> fight<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.240> do

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
Gogeta actually drag the fight on I do

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.570 
Gogeta actually drag the fight on I do
believe<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:26.110> gem<00:01:26.440> cell<00:01:26.740> would<00:01:26.920> be<00:01:26.980> able<00:01:27.370> to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
believe that gem cell would be able to

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.610 
believe that gem cell would be able to
get<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.090> better<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.360> Gogeta<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.200> possibly

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
get the better of Gogeta and possibly

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.310 
get the better of Gogeta and possibly
beat<00:01:29.890> him<00:01:30.040> down<00:01:30.190> before<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:31.420> time<00:01:31.990> limit

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
beat him down before the time limit

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.070 
beat him down before the time limit
