guide and of course to mount the cone in
its<00:00:39.809> place<00:00:41.840> before<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.079> mount<00:00:43.379> the

its place before we actually mount the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.600 
its place before we actually mount the
cone<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:44.309> need<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> small<00:00:45.030> wrench<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
cone we need a small wrench and the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.279 
cone we need a small wrench and the
young<00:00:47.789> guide<00:00:48.059> mounts<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:49.610> under<00:00:51.079> the

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.770 

washer<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.620> here

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.780

type it as such just do a small and okay

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.399 
type it as such just do a small and okay
you<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:21.119> mount<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:23.549> winder<00:01:24.350> on<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you then you mount the winder on a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:35.270 
you then you mount the winder on a
stable<00:01:28.130> now<00:01:29.180> we<00:01:30.180> mount<00:01:31.820> or<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.030> install<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
stable now we mount or we install the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.870 
stable now we mount or we install the
cone<00:01:36.290> then<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> thread<00:01:38.159> through<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
cone then when you thread through the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.460 
cone then when you thread through the
yarn<00:01:39.090> through<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> young<00:01:39.930> guy<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:43.049> through

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
yarn through the young guy and through

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.010 
yarn through the young guy and through
the<00:01:43.590> flier

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.549 

and<00:01:51.350> put<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> yarn<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> slot
