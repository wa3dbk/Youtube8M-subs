00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
pour your bubble solution in there

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.280 
pour your bubble solution in there
unless<00:02:32.359> of<00:02:32.510> course<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.870> have<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.170> other

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
larger cap system you could put the

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.490 
larger cap system you could put the
whole<00:02:35.030> bottle<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.540> then<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:35.959> just<00:02:36.109> sits<00:02:36.349> right

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
whole bottle on then it just sits right

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.199 
whole bottle on then it just sits right
