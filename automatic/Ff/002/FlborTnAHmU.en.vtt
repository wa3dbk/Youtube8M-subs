00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
look pretty cool like either that or the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.139 
look pretty cool like either that or the
only<00:00:36.570> stuff<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.020> could<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.350> will<00:00:38.149> good

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
only stuff that we could do will good

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.900 
only stuff that we could do will good
because<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.719> break<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.170> future<00:00:40.649> uh<00:00:40.920> will

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
because if we break the future uh will

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.060 
because if we break the future uh will
cause<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.450> paradox<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.920> what
