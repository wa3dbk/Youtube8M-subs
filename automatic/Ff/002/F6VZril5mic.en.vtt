now youtubers you want to show you the
parent<00:00:04.350> online<00:00:04.730> this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.000> parent<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.480> my

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
parent online this is the parent on my

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.160 
parent online this is the parent on my
it<00:00:07.830> looks<00:00:08.160> just<00:00:08.370> like<00:00:11.000> it's<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.240> copper

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
it looks just like it's just copper

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.519 
it looks just like it's just copper
tubing<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.400> use<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.910> make<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:16.230> I

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
tubing that I use to make it and I

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.420 
tubing that I use to make it and I
didn't<00:00:17.430> use<00:00:18.410> let's<00:00:19.410> hold<00:00:19.770> or<00:00:19.980> anything<00:00:20.220> I'll

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
didn't use let's hold or anything I'll

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.990 
didn't use let's hold or anything I'll
just<00:00:20.460> use<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.630> solder<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> browse<00:00:22.500> good<00:00:23.000> so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
just use so the solder to browse good so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.870 
just use so the solder to browse good so
that's<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> best<00:00:24.449> thing<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> use<00:00:25.160> setup<00:00:26.160> late

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
that's the best thing to use setup late

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.009 
that's the best thing to use setup late
as<00:00:27.570> they<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.650> poisoning

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
as they can be poisoning

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.479 
as they can be poisoning
so<00:00:31.019> I'll<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> show<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:34.190> that's<00:00:35.190> at

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so I'll just going to show you that's at

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.530 
so I'll just going to show you that's at
the<00:00:35.700> top<00:00:35.940> end<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:37.489> is<00:00:38.489> made<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the top end of it that is made up the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.920 
the top end of it that is made up the
actual<00:00:39.719> alcohol<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> come<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.930> it's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
actual alcohol is going to come out it's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770 
actual alcohol is going to come out it's
going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> fly<00:00:43.350> back<00:00:43.590> into<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> that's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
going to fly back into there and that's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
going to fly back into there and that's
going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.350> outlet<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> alcohol

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
going to be the outlet for the alcohol

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.860 
going to be the outlet for the alcohol
let's<00:00:48.750> say<00:00:48.960> our<00:00:49.079> cake<00:00:49.289> pop<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:50.660> that's<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
let's say our cake pop there that's the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.889 
let's say our cake pop there that's the
inlet<00:00:52.140> pop<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:53.120> it's<00:00:54.120> got<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> hole<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
inlet pop there it's got a hole at the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:55.569 
inlet pop there it's got a hole at the
bottom

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
bottom

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.220

let's<00:00:56.579> join<00:00:56.879> onto<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
let's join onto there and there just to

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.760 
let's join onto there and there just to
give<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.649> extra<00:00:58.829> support<00:00:59.809> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> use<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
give it extra support this is a use it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.120 
give it extra support this is a use it's
a<00:01:02.010> four<00:01:02.879> centimeter<00:01:03.329> reducer<00:01:06.770> but<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> can

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
a four centimeter reducer but if you can

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.670 
a four centimeter reducer but if you can
see<00:01:08.310> rabbits<00:01:08.520> five<00:01:09.210> centimeters<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> copper

want to die only small in 25 millimeters

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.719 
want to die only small in 25 millimeters
or<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:21.600> inch<00:01:22.369> otherwise<00:01:23.369> you'll<00:01:23.610> get

flowering was that applies if we're
going<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.220> let<00:02:38.400> load<00:02:38.720> pakka<00:02:39.720> vary<00:02:40.189> and<00:02:41.189> it<00:02:42.090> will

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
going to let load pakka vary and it will

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.619 
going to let load pakka vary and it will
drop<00:02:42.840> drip<00:02:43.170> through<00:02:43.379> as<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:45.150> got<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> little

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
drop drip through as this got a little

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.000 
drop drip through as this got a little
highway<00:02:46.230> or<00:02:47.129> this<00:02:47.849> item<00:02:48.180> into<00:02:48.510> pulp<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.079> just

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
highway or this item into pulp and just

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.569 
highway or this item into pulp and just
drips<00:02:50.280> through<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:52.099> I'll<00:02:53.099> just<00:02:53.400> get<00:02:53.519> a

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
drips through so I'll just get a

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:00.979 
drips through so I'll just get a
harmonica<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.530> show<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.769> as<00:02:59.629> our<00:03:00.629> drama

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
harmonica and just show you as our drama

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.520 
harmonica and just show you as our drama
tip<00:03:01.290> will<00:03:02.389> Robbie<00:03:03.389> in<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.780> display<00:03:04.260> enough

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
tip will Robbie in a display enough

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.809 
tip will Robbie in a display enough
spice<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:05.760> give<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.030> correct<00:03:06.870> reading<00:03:07.489> so<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
spice to give you correct reading so the

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.899 
spice to give you correct reading so the
liquid<00:03:08.970> comes<00:03:09.359> in<00:03:09.569> there<00:03:10.280> goes<00:03:11.280> down<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.819> the

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
liquid comes in there goes down to the

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.750 
liquid comes in there goes down to the
bottom<00:03:12.209> there<00:03:12.889> eventually<00:03:13.889> it<00:03:14.159> will<00:03:14.280> push<00:03:14.519> up

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
bottom there eventually it will push up

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.240 
bottom there eventually it will push up
this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.720> slightly<00:03:15.959> higher<00:03:16.409> please<00:03:16.980> know<00:03:17.220> that

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
this is slightly higher please know that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
this is slightly higher please know that
this<00:03:17.579> is<00:03:17.819> slack<00:03:18.180> your<00:03:18.389> eye<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.750> I'm<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.049> one

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
this is slack your eye and I'm this one

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.189 
this is slack your eye and I'm this one
so<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.579> liquids<00:03:20.910> got<00:03:21.060> overflow<00:03:21.599> in<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:21.959> one

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
so the liquids got overflow in this one

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.770 
so the liquids got overflow in this one
and<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.609> was<00:03:23.669> in<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.299> little<00:03:24.599> cup

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and then if I was in this little cup

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.259 
and then if I was in this little cup
theory<00:03:25.609> just<00:03:26.609> like<00:03:26.760> that

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
theory just like that

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.470 
theory just like that
site<00:03:27.750> overflows<00:03:28.290> from<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:30.000> little<00:03:30.269> cup

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
site overflows from the that little cup

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.879 
site overflows from the that little cup
and<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:31.019> dries<00:03:31.230> through<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> little

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
and it dries through like a little

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.039 
and it dries through like a little
hallway<00:03:32.459> into<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.599> bottle

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
hallway into the bottle

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.870 
hallway into the bottle
thanks<00:03:34.859> for<00:03:35.040> watching<00:03:35.870> Cheers
