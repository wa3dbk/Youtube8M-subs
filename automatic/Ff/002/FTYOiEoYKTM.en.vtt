00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and compiled them into a series of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.389 
and compiled them into a series of
videos<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:31.380> another<00:00:31.560> question<00:00:31.740> here

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
videos so I have another question here

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.150 
videos so I have another question here
and<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:33.000> say<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:34.110> person<00:00:34.260> says<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and they say this person says when I

the<00:00:37.829> first<00:00:38.070> 100<00:00:38.550> yards<00:00:38.820> after<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.020> feel

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the first 100 yards after that I feel

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
the first 100 yards after that I feel
like<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.980> spend<00:00:41.250> most<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.610> effort<00:00:42.000> just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like I spend most of my effort just

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.779 
like I spend most of my effort just
getting<00:00:42.420> air<00:00:42.829> running<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.100> biking<00:00:44.190> doesn't

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
training I know my endurance is not what

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
training I know my endurance is not what
it<00:00:49.260> yet<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> should<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.610> yet<00:00:51.030> why<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it yet what it should be yet why is the

it yet what it should be yet why is the
swimming<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.829> more<00:00:53.219> draining<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.879> my

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
swimming so much more draining on my

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.470 
swimming so much more draining on my
breathing<00:00:54.449> uh<00:00:55.760> yes<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> good<00:00:57.300> question

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
breathing uh yes it's a good question

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
breathing uh yes it's a good question
that<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> race<00:01:01.280> then

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that if is that if that's in a race then

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
that if is that if that's in a race then
uh<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.480> I'd<00:01:03.600> ask<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.260> doing<00:01:04.470> warm

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
uh you know I'd ask if you're doing warm

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
uh you know I'd ask if you're doing warm
up<00:01:04.830> before<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.900> something

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
up before it or not but with something

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.260 
up before it or not but with something
generally<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> jump<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> water<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
generally if you jump in the water the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.570 
generally if you jump in the water the
first<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> three<00:01:10.409> hundred<00:01:10.500> meters<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
first one to three hundred meters that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.490 
first one to three hundred meters that
you<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.939> they're<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> take<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.350> breath

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you do they're going to take your breath

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
you do they're going to take your breath
away<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.760> you're<00:01:15.150> still<00:01:15.390> warming

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
away because it's you're still warming

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.920 
away because it's you're still warming
up<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.680> getting<00:01:16.860> used<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.930> if

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
up and you're getting used to it so if

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
up and you're getting used to it so if
that's<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.560> training<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.970> through<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's in training then get through a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.460 
that's in training then get through a
couple<00:01:21.299> hundred<00:01:21.479> meters<00:01:21.840> warm<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> then

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
couple hundred meters warm up and then

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.399 
couple hundred meters warm up and then
you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.430> sort<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> judge<00:01:24.390> how<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:25.110> breath

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you can sort of judge how much breath

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.550 
you can sort of judge how much breath
you've<00:01:25.979> got<00:01:26.189> left<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> need<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.470> need

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you've got left so what you need to need

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.929 
you've got left so what you need to need
a<00:01:28.619> warm-up<00:01:28.950> whether<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.400> race<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.790> whether

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
a warm-up whether it's a race or whether

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
a warm-up whether it's a race or whether
it's<00:01:30.119> training<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.200> need<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> add<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> few

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it's training you need to add a few

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's training you need to add a few
hundred<00:01:31.770> meters<00:01:32.159> done<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:32.670> before<00:01:33.380> but

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
hundred meters done first before but

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.190 
hundred meters done first before but
feeling<00:01:34.740> comfortable<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> water<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
feeling comfortable in the water and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.359 
feeling comfortable in the water and
otherwise<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.530> could<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.040> matter<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
otherwise it could just be a matter of

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.310 
otherwise it could just be a matter of
technique<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> stroke<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
technique and stroke you might be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.999 
technique and stroke you might be
working<00:01:41.070> too<00:01:41.430> hard<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.329> water<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.009> you're

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
working too hard in the water and you're

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.710 
working too hard in the water and you're
not<00:01:44.070> gliding<00:01:44.340> enough<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:45.030> relaxing<00:01:45.540> because

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
not gliding enough not relaxing because

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
not gliding enough not relaxing because
that's<00:01:45.990> that's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> big<00:01:46.710> part<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.979> steering<00:01:47.250> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
that's that's a big part of steering is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.940 
that's that's a big part of steering is
just<00:01:47.399> staying<00:01:47.790> relaxed<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.450> gliding<00:01:49.320> with

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
just staying relaxed and gliding with

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
just staying relaxed and gliding with
each<00:01:50.159> stroke<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.240> could<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.630> matter<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
each stroke so it could be a matter of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.350 
each stroke so it could be a matter of
technique<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.710> you'll<00:01:53.310> probably<00:01:53.579> might<00:01:54.240> be

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
technique and you'll probably might be

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.780 
technique and you'll probably might be
flight<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> water<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.049> bit<00:01:55.200> more<00:01:55.380> than<00:01:55.790> than

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
flight in the water a bit more than than

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
flight in the water a bit more than than
what<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.090> should<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.860> what's<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:59.040> take<00:01:59.810> yeah

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
what you should be what's your take yeah

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.050 
what you should be what's your take yeah
I<00:02:00.840> agree<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.700> i<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I agree with that and and i think the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.580 
I agree with that and and i think the
warm-up<00:02:03.360> thing<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.659> an<00:02:03.780> important<00:02:04.110> point<00:02:04.229> like

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
warm-up thing is an important point like

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440 
warm-up thing is an important point like
a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.950> especially<00:02:05.250> triathletes<00:02:05.909> tend<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
a lot of especially triathletes tend to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.219 
a lot of especially triathletes tend to
skip<00:02:06.689> warm<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> races<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.869> in<00:02:09.869> that's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
skip warm up for the races and in that's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.140 
skip warm up for the races and in that's
just<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.590> horrible<00:02:11.310> idea<00:02:11.400> especially<00:02:11.819> when

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
just the horrible idea especially when

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
just the horrible idea especially when
you're<00:02:12.270> getting<00:02:12.450> into<00:02:12.629> cold<00:02:12.810> water<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you're getting into cold water you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.870 
you're getting into cold water you
you're<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.370> kind<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.610> shock

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
you're going to have that kind of shock

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.400 
you're going to have that kind of shock
feeling<00:02:15.390> at<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.570> beginning<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.110> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
feeling at the beginning and that I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.080 
feeling at the beginning and that I
still<00:02:16.740> get<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.550> know<00:02:17.610> if<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.730> jump<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.030> a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
still get that you know if I jump in a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
still get that you know if I jump in a
cold<00:02:18.300> water<00:02:18.450> without<00:02:18.780> any<00:02:19.050> kind<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.350> warm<00:02:19.500> up

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
cold water without any kind of warm up

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.460 
cold water without any kind of warm up
and<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.820> will<00:02:21.030> really<00:02:21.360> hurt<00:02:21.630> your<00:02:21.840> swim<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and that will really hurt your swim and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.750 
and that will really hurt your swim and
the<00:02:22.530> red<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.890> kind<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.100> sets<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.550> rest

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the red and it kind of sets up the rest

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.370 
the red and it kind of sets up the rest
of<00:02:23.850> your<00:02:23.910> race<00:02:24.150> from<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.900> beginning<00:02:25.050> when

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
of your race from that beginning when

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.810 
of your race from that beginning when
you're<00:02:25.500> kind<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.770> panicking<00:02:26.160> over<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
you're kind of panicking over that that

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.170 
you're kind of panicking over that that
cold<00:02:27.150> shock<00:02:27.600> feeling<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.920> yeah<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
cold shock feeling so yeah I think the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.840 
cold shock feeling so yeah I think the
warm-up<00:02:30.450> thing<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.780> important<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.440> then

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
warm-up thing is important and then

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.430 
warm-up thing is important and then
learning<00:02:32.850> how<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.120> breathe<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.690> also<00:02:33.930> that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
learning how to breathe is also that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.020 
learning how to breathe is also that
would<00:02:34.560> be<00:02:34.650> really<00:02:34.860> important<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.820> one<00:02:35.970> of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
would be really important that's one of

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.220 
would be really important that's one of
the<00:02:36.120> artists<00:02:36.390> things<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.840> we<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> lot<00:02:37.170> of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the artists things and we get a lot of

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.390 
the artists things and we get a lot of
questions<00:02:37.650> both<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.010> us<00:02:38.130> get<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> lot<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
questions both of us get a lot of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
questions both of us get a lot of
questions<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.000> how<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.990> breathe<00:02:40.230> in

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
questions on how do you breathe in

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.430 
questions on how do you breathe in
swimming<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.700> I'm<00:02:42.230> focusing<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.320> that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
swimming and so I'm focusing on that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.470 
swimming and so I'm focusing on that
technique<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.160> learning<00:02:44.820> how<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.000> how<00:02:45.450> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
technique and learning how to how to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 
technique and learning how to how to
take<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.960> breath<00:02:46.290> without<00:02:46.680> throwing<00:02:47.100> your

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
take a breath without throwing your

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.060 
take a breath without throwing your
whole<00:02:47.490> stroke<00:02:47.820> off<00:02:48.420> rhythm<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.920> there's<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
whole stroke off rhythm so and there's a

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.590 
whole stroke off rhythm so and there's a
lot<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.490> into<00:02:50.610> there<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:51.150> basically

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
lot we can go into there but basically

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.750 
lot we can go into there but basically
instead<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.620> what<00:02:52.830> most<00:02:52.980> people<00:02:53.190> do<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.340> they

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
instead of what most people do is they

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280 
instead of what most people do is they
lift<00:02:54.000> their<00:02:54.090> head<00:02:54.270> up<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.810> breathe<00:02:55.020> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
lift their head up to breathe and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
lift their head up to breathe and
instead<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.070> looking<00:02:56.160> your<00:02:56.400> head<00:02:56.520> up<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.880> want

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
instead of looking your head up you want

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.610 
instead of looking your head up you want
to<00:02:57.090> get<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.300> point<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.720> breathing<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
to get to the point of breathing to the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.160 
to get to the point of breathing to the
side<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.459> you're<00:02:59.580> not<00:02:59.610> wasting<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.630> lot<00:03:01.110> of

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
side so that you're not wasting a lot of

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.870 
side so that you're not wasting a lot of
energy<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:02.690> basically<00:03:03.860> by<00:03:04.860> damaging<00:03:05.760> your

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
energy and basically by damaging your

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.640 
energy and basically by damaging your
stroke<00:03:06.240> or<00:03:06.420> having<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.900> stroke<00:03:07.170> that's<00:03:07.410> going

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
stroke or having a stroke that's going

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.430 
stroke or having a stroke that's going
to<00:03:07.709> kind<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.520> fall<00:03:08.670> apart<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.200> yeah<00:03:10.200> that's

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
to kind of fall apart on you yeah that's

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.590 
to kind of fall apart on you yeah that's
right<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.310> doesn't<00:03:11.550> matter<00:03:11.790> how<00:03:11.940> goodness

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
right and I doesn't matter how goodness

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.730 
right and I doesn't matter how goodness
to<00:03:12.690> me<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:13.080> you're<00:03:13.260> always<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> be

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
to me you are you're always going to be

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.110 
to me you are you're always going to be
out<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:13.950> breath<00:03:14.100> those<00:03:14.400> first<00:03:14.670> few<00:03:14.850> hundred

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
out of breath those first few hundred

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.280 
out of breath those first few hundred
meters<00:03:15.360> where<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.600> body<00:03:15.750> gets<00:03:15.930> used<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.170> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
meters where your body gets used to it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
meters where your body gets used to it
so<00:03:17.130> definitely<00:03:17.610> do<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> warm-up<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.330> you're

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
so definitely do a warm-up if you're

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.199 
so definitely do a warm-up if you're
training<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:19.560> racing<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.730> yeah<00:03:20.910> with<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
training or racing and yeah with the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.610 
training or racing and yeah with the
breathing<00:03:21.420> breathe<00:03:21.780> more<00:03:22.110> towards<00:03:22.500> your

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
breathing breathe more towards your

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.080
