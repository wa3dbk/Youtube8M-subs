a<00:00:52.230> large<00:00:52.590> number<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.010> magnetic<00:00:53.370> atoms<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.030> all

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a large number of magnetic atoms and all

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
a large number of magnetic atoms and all
these<00:00:54.420> magnetic<00:00:54.960> atoms<00:00:55.230> act<00:00:55.469> together<00:00:55.649> to

these magnetic atoms act together to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520 
these magnetic atoms act together to
make<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.789> bit<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.270> magnetic<00:00:57.690> information<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
make one bit of magnetic information and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
make one bit of magnetic information and
so<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.340> scale<00:00:59.640> down<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.180> we

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so if we can scale down and we

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.540 
so if we can scale down and we
correspondingly<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> much<00:01:02.070> larger

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
correspondingly get a much larger

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850 
correspondingly get a much larger
