00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:20.820
 I know a galaxy y pro but there to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 as different as the fans I 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 pass the TVs samsung not blackberry 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.700
 etc. that samsung 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.300
 so here I 'm going to famous code finally you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.129
 see the crazy all simple and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.829
 today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.750
 hate code to see if your phone 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 so walk cu 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 finally you can conquer the nose with a 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.879
 little bit like this so we have to do 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.879
 star diez 0 and poems diez 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.500
 this appears to you so you have real 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:14.659
 so this is the red screen like that if 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 google green screen greens blue screen and 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.869
 wake rambla with a little music or 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.060
 a little music that I do not understand 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.009
 why vibrations 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.689
 so he vibrates with friends if he is too 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.259
 colors at the same time so it takes 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:39.130
 touch for that skin 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.289
 clear or not but then proclaims it's the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.439
 photo but I will not introduce you 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:49.530
 since river quotas amaze me see 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.130
 we can not get out 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.399
 then after they do not move him who 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.200
 is very strange because good after we have 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.080
 a lot of little things you 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.439
 must know if you are a specialist 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.319
 and there's marked test images but what 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.549
 I do not understand what is boring 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.590
 sleeve that appears on the screen that I do not 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.510
 do not understand so if you are strong 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.360
 find out why 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.540
 then after we go that's the screen 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.959
 touch see if it works well so we can 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.209
 do strokes and to get out there 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.760
 must color all the gap is open 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.060
 so for that we just have to switch between 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.769
 on it here you see created after the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.269
 mark passed without saved any 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:47.680
 to do then after I 'm more like that 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.810
 be a single hymn saas mode and for the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.060
 metro that goes to sleep 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.120
 I do not have to do it because 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:01.980
 after I have to redo my code etc 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:08.700
 spie spie says it's your ringtone 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:12.609
 So you are your wet soil 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.069
 then after pete is then that it serves 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.319
 all of phone see little arrow 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.970
 it's the team with a variant style 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.910
 for me goes the space bar 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.440
 etc., etc 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:38.670
 falling down here there 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:38.670
