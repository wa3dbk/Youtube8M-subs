hello everyone welcome to another CSS

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.570 
hello everyone welcome to another CSS
tutorial<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.560> video<00:00:04.890> we're<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.490> be

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
tutorial in this video we're going to be

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.560 
tutorial in this video we're going to be
covering<00:00:05.990> CSS<00:00:06.990> shadows<00:00:08.090> now<00:00:09.090> there<00:00:09.240> are<00:00:09.330> two

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
covering CSS shadows now there are two

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.060 
covering CSS shadows now there are two
types<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.290> shadows<00:00:10.469> we'll<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.800> dealing<00:00:10.920> with

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
types of shadows we'll be dealing with

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.209 
types of shadows we'll be dealing with
today<00:00:12.170> text<00:00:13.170> shadow<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.830> we'll<00:00:13.980> apply<00:00:14.070> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
today text shadow so we'll apply a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.670 
today text shadow so we'll apply a
shadow<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.820> heading<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:16.109> second<00:00:16.500> is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
shadow to this heading and the second is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.519 
shadow to this heading and the second is
box<00:00:17.250> shadow<00:00:17.789> which<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.510> will<00:00:18.660> apply<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.410> this

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
box shadow which we will apply to this

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.310 
box shadow which we will apply to this
white<00:00:19.830> container<00:00:20.340> element<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> let's<00:00:22.140> dive

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
white container element so let's dive

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.480 
white container element so let's dive
right<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.740> let's<00:00:22.920> head<00:00:23.070> over<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.310> our<00:00:23.430> CSS<00:00:24.029> file

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
right in let's head over to our CSS file

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.920 
right in let's head over to our CSS file
we're<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> create<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> new<00:00:27.390> rule<00:00:27.689> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
we're going to create a new rule to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
we're going to create a new rule to
target<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:28.949> heading<00:00:29.279> level<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
target our heading level one and the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.940 
target our heading level one and the
property<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.199> simply<00:00:31.679> text<00:00:32.219> shadow<00:00:33.800> now<00:00:34.800> we're

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
property is simply text shadow now we're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.590 
property is simply text shadow now we're
going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> string<00:00:35.489> together<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.940> few<00:00:36.239> values

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
going to string together a few values

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440 
going to string together a few values
here<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.020> define<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.730> appearance<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
here to define the appearance in the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.510 
here to define the appearance in the
positioning<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> shadow<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> first

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
positioning of the shadow so the first

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
positioning of the shadow so the first
value<00:00:41.809> controls<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.989> horizontal

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
value controls the horizontal

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920 
value controls the horizontal
positioning<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.280> offset<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> shadow<00:00:45.270> so

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
positioning or offset of the shadow so

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
positioning or offset of the shadow so
let's<00:00:46.110> say<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.430> sit<00:00:47.670> three<00:00:48.210> pixels

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
let's say we want it to sit three pixels

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.430 
let's say we want it to sit three pixels
to<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> text<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> next<00:00:52.230> value

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to the right of the text the next value

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.920 
to the right of the text the next value
is<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.860> vertical<00:00:53.190> offset<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.329> where<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.840> we

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
is the vertical offset so where do we

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
is the vertical offset so where do we
want<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> shadow<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> sit<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.980> relation<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
want the shadow to sit in relation to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.189 
want the shadow to sit in relation to
the<00:00:56.640> text<00:00:56.940> vertically<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.809> we'll<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.079> go

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the text vertically so we'll just go

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.790 
the text vertically so we'll just go
ahead<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.440> zero<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> third<00:01:00.570> value<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
ahead with zero the third value is the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.280 
ahead with zero the third value is the
blur<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.399> shadow<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.690> enter<00:01:03.809> zero

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
blur of the shadow so if we enter zero

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.679 
blur of the shadow so if we enter zero
it'll<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> very<00:01:05.280> sharp<00:01:05.700> shadow<00:01:05.970> it'll<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.570> as

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it'll be a very sharp shadow it'll be as

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.440 
it'll be a very sharp shadow it'll be as
as<00:01:06.900> sharp<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> text<00:01:08.369> itself<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.210> enter

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
as sharp as the text itself if we enter

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.840 
as sharp as the text itself if we enter
a<00:01:09.570> larger<00:01:10.380> value<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.369> text<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.790> be

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
a larger value here the text will be

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.990 
a larger value here the text will be
blurred<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:13.220> finally<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> fourth<00:01:14.580> value<00:01:14.760> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
blurred and finally the fourth value is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
blurred and finally the fourth value is
the<00:01:15.180> color<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> shadow<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.430> just

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the color of the shadow so I will just

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.969 
the color of the shadow so I will just
pick<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.180> gray<00:01:19.400> now<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> refresh<00:01:21.950> we<00:01:22.950> can

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
pick a gray now if you refresh we can

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.390 
pick a gray now if you refresh we can
see<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> shadow<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.900> applied<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> let's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
see that a shadow is applied now let's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.499 
see that a shadow is applied now let's
just<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.670> ahead<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.850> tweak<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> values

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
just go ahead and tweak the values

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.850 
just go ahead and tweak the values
really<00:01:27.689> quickly<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> good

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
really quickly so you can get a good

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.219 
really quickly so you can get a good
idea<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.280> how<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.700> different<00:01:29.880> values<00:01:30.360> work<00:01:30.540> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
idea of how the different values work so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
idea of how the different values work so
again<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.680> change<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.579> zero<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
again if we change this from zero to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
again if we change this from zero to
three<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> second<00:01:33.840> value<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.920> vertical

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
three the second value is the vertical

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.569 
three the second value is the vertical
offset<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.900> refresh<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.430> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
offset so if we refresh you see that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.800 
offset so if we refresh you see that
it's<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:38.909> pushed<00:01:39.240> down<00:01:39.479> three<00:01:39.930> pixels

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's now pushed down three pixels

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's now pushed down three pixels
finally<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.380> edit<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.340> third<00:01:44.640> value

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
finally if we edit this third value

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.630 
finally if we edit this third value
change<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> three<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.250> instead

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
change this to three we see that instead

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.819 
change this to three we see that instead
of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.450> shadow<00:01:48.750> being<00:01:49.049> sharp<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> now

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
of the shadow being sharp it is now

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.870 
of the shadow being sharp it is now
blurred<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:52.320> common<00:01:52.799> question<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.369> okay<00:01:53.850> so

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
blurred now a common question is okay so

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
blurred now a common question is okay so
I<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.360> place<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> shadow<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.409> bottom<00:01:55.950> or

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
I can place the shadow to the bottom or

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
I can place the shadow to the bottom or
the<00:01:56.219> right<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.969> original<00:01:57.420> text<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the right of the original text what if I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.440 
the right of the original text what if I
want<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> place<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> shadow<00:01:59.250> above<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
want to place the shadow above or to the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.380 
want to place the shadow above or to the
left<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> original<00:02:01.530> text<00:02:01.950> well<00:02:02.820> it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
left of the original text well it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.940 
left of the original text well it's
pretty<00:02:03.509> simple<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.560> make<00:02:04.740> these

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
pretty simple you can just make these

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
pretty simple you can just make these
values<00:02:05.250> negative<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:06.930> negative

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
values negative so if we go negative

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
values negative so if we go negative
three<00:02:07.619> pixel<00:02:08.009> horizontal<00:02:08.520> negative<00:02:09.000> three

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
three pixel horizontal negative three

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.410 
three pixel horizontal negative three
pixel<00:02:09.479> vertical<00:02:10.009> if<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.129> refresh<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
pixel vertical if we refresh see the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.850 
pixel vertical if we refresh see the
shadows<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.349> upper

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
shadows now to the upper

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340 
shadows now to the upper
of<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.130> text<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:15.450> that's<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.990> all<00:02:16.140> there

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
of the text now that's really all there

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.040 
of the text now that's really all there
is<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> CSS<00:02:17.370> text<00:02:17.670> shadow<00:02:18.000> property<00:02:18.540> it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
is to the CSS text shadow property it's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.440 
is to the CSS text shadow property it's
a<00:02:19.200> fairly<00:02:19.440> simple<00:02:19.770> property<00:02:20.340> let's<00:02:21.060> move<00:02:21.270> on

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
a fairly simple property let's move on

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.710 
a fairly simple property let's move on
to<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> Box<00:02:22.380> shadow<00:02:22.800> property<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.570> we're

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
to the Box shadow property so we're

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.630 
to the Box shadow property so we're
going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.020> add<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> shadow<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.250> our<00:02:26.280> white

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
going to add a shadow to our white

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.710 
going to add a shadow to our white
container<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:29.460> let's<00:02:29.610> head<00:02:29.760> over<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.150> our<00:02:30.180> CSS

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
container so let's head over to our CSS

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.650 
container so let's head over to our CSS
file<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.050> create<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> shadow<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
file and create the shadow this is the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.530 
file and create the shadow this is the
CSS<00:02:34.350> rule<00:02:34.650> for<00:02:35.460> our<00:02:35.550> container<00:02:35.910> element<00:02:36.120> we're

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
CSS rule for our container element we're

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.350 
CSS rule for our container element we're
going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> create<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> new<00:02:37.320> declaration<00:02:38.360> box

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
going to create a new declaration box

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.060 
going to create a new declaration box
shadow<00:02:40.910> will<00:02:41.910> go<00:02:42.030> five<00:02:42.360> pixels<00:02:43.070> horizontal

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
shadow will go five pixels horizontal

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.390 
shadow will go five pixels horizontal
and<00:02:44.220> vertically<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.360> five<00:02:45.570> pixel<00:02:45.990> blur<00:02:46.140> and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
and vertically and a five pixel blur and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.070 
and vertically and a five pixel blur and
for<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> color<00:02:47.760> we'll<00:02:48.450> give<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> same

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
for the color we'll give it the same

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.110 
for the color we'll give it the same
value<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.800> elements<00:02:50.430> border<00:02:52.790> now<00:02:53.790> if<00:02:53.940> we

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
value as the elements border now if we

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.449 
value as the elements border now if we
refresh<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:55.530> see<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.860> shadow<00:02:56.130> was

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
refresh we can see that the shadow was

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.360 
refresh we can see that the shadow was
applied<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.709> think<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.800> looks<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.040> bit<00:02:59.070> off

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
applied I think it looks a bit off

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.860 
applied I think it looks a bit off
though<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.270> would<00:03:00.360> look<00:03:00.390> better<00:03:00.540> if

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
though I think it would look better if

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.870 
though I think it would look better if
the<00:03:01.020> shadow<00:03:01.290> was<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> bit<00:03:01.920> more<00:03:02.070> transparent<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the shadow was a bit more transparent so

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.030 
the shadow was a bit more transparent so
if<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> was<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> little<00:03:03.959> bit<00:03:04.080> lighter<00:03:04.320> than<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
if it was a little bit lighter than the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.699 
if it was a little bit lighter than the
border<00:03:05.630> now<00:03:06.630> there<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> few<00:03:07.260> ways<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.410> can

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
border now there are a few ways we can

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.710 
border now there are a few ways we can
adjust<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.130> color<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:09.090> could<00:03:09.300> go<00:03:09.510> into

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
adjust the color we could go into

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720 
adjust the color we could go into
Photoshop<00:03:10.020> or<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.560> color<00:03:10.950> picker<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.520> this

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
Photoshop or a color picker like this

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.810 
Photoshop or a color picker like this
and<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.360> choose<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.660> color<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.440> or

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
and just choose a color that we like or

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.340 
and just choose a color that we like or
we<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:15.030> use<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.390> existing<00:03:15.870> color<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.290> we

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
we can use the existing color that we

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.720 
we can use the existing color that we
already<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:17.280> lower<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.700> to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
already have and just lower it to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.330 
already have and just lower it to
transparency<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.590> good<00:03:19.769> way<00:03:19.920> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
transparency so this is a good way to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.949 
transparency so this is a good way to
segue<00:03:20.610> into<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.940> final<00:03:21.209> topic<00:03:21.450> before<00:03:21.900> we

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
segue into the final topic before we

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.560 
segue into the final topic before we

the<00:03:36.269> rambling<00:03:36.890> first<00:03:37.890> we<00:03:38.070> need<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.280> find<00:03:38.459> the

RGB value of this border color that we

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.520 
RGB value of this border color that we
were<00:03:41.760> using<00:03:44.510> I'll<00:03:45.510> head<00:03:45.750> over<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.290> online

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.420 
were using I'll head over to this online
color<00:03:46.980> picker<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.489> paste<00:03:48.330> in<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.540> value<00:03:48.900> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
color picker and paste in the value and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.400 
color picker and paste in the value and
it<00:03:50.430> gives<00:03:50.730> us<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.030> RGB<00:03:51.480> value<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.080> R<00:03:52.200> is

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
it gives us the RGB value so the R is

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:01.220 
it gives us the RGB value so the R is
128<00:03:53.360> 170<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:55.350> blue<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.250> 183<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:59.330> in<00:04:00.330> our

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
128 170 and the blue is 183 so in our

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.050 
128 170 and the blue is 183 so in our
style<00:04:01.560> sheet<00:04:01.680> we're<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.730> erase<00:04:03.030> this

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
style sheet we're going to erase this

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.820 
style sheet we're going to erase this
hexadecimal<00:04:04.019> color<00:04:04.230> RGB<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:06.720> parenthesis<00:04:07.620> and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
hexadecimal color RGB a parenthesis and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.830 
hexadecimal color RGB a parenthesis and
now<00:04:08.220> we're<00:04:08.340> going<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.489> simply<00:04:08.820> add<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.600> red

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
now we're going to simply add the red

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.560 
now we're going to simply add the red
green<00:04:10.140> blue<00:04:10.440> values<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:11.940> let's<00:04:12.120> see<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.420> was

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
green blue values so let's see it was

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:24.030 
green blue values so let's see it was
128<00:04:13.320> 170<00:04:14.160> 183

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.500 

now<00:04:25.000> if<00:04:25.390> we<00:04:26.020> refresh<00:04:26.200> our<00:04:26.680> page<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:28.270> see<00:04:28.420> that

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
now if we refresh our page we see that

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.570 
now if we refresh our page we see that
there<00:04:28.690> is<00:04:28.720> no<00:04:28.930> change<00:04:29.200> in<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.560> shadow<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.520> is

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
there is no change in the shadow this is

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.210 
there is no change in the shadow this is
because<00:04:31.030> our<00:04:31.240> final<00:04:31.690> value<00:04:31.990> one<00:04:32.320> controls<00:04:33.130> the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
because our final value one controls the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.880 
because our final value one controls the
transparency<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> opacity<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.410> if<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:35.620> put

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
transparency of the opacity so if I put

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.670 
transparency of the opacity so if I put
0.5<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.510> shadow<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:37.990> only<00:04:38.170> going<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.380> be<00:04:38.500> as

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
0.5 the shadow is only going to be as

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.530 
0.5 the shadow is only going to be as
half<00:04:39.100> as<00:04:39.310> strong<00:04:39.520> as<00:04:39.670> it<00:04:39.760> was<00:04:39.880> before<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:40.450> if

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
half as strong as it was before so if

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.240 
half as strong as it was before so if
your<00:04:40.690> refresh<00:04:41.020> we<00:04:41.770> see<00:04:41.800> that<00:04:42.040> it's<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.220> very

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
your refresh we see that it's a very

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.130 
your refresh we see that it's a very
subtle<00:04:42.820> shadow<00:04:43.180> now<00:04:43.420> and<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.720> think<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.110> looks

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
subtle shadow now and I think this looks

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.070 
subtle shadow now and I think this looks
a<00:04:44.440> lot<00:04:44.590> better<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:46.180> if<00:04:46.570> you're<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:46.840> happy

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
a lot better and if you're not happy

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.770 
a lot better and if you're not happy
with<00:04:47.200> it<00:04:47.470> it's<00:04:47.650> very<00:04:47.980> easy<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.340> adjust<00:04:48.610> so<00:04:49.420> we

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
with it it's very easy to adjust so we

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.840 
with it it's very easy to adjust so we
can<00:04:49.930> always<00:04:50.080> just<00:04:50.260> go<00:04:50.470> in<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.860> bump<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.280> from<00:04:51.490> 5

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
can always just go in and bump it from 5

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.230 
can always just go in and bump it from 5
to<00:04:52.270> point<00:04:52.540> 7<00:04:53.220> if<00:04:54.220> we<00:04:54.370> refresh<00:04:54.640> we<00:04:54.760> see<00:04:55.090> the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
to point 7 if we refresh we see the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.150 
to point 7 if we refresh we see the
shadow<00:04:55.450> gets<00:04:55.690> darker<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.710> really<00:04:56.980> gives

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
shadow gets darker so it really gives

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.980 
shadow gets darker so it really gives
you<00:04:57.280> fine-grained<00:04:57.940> control<00:04:58.420> over<00:04:58.870> your

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
you fine-grained control over your

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.410 
you fine-grained control over your
colors<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.920> especially<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.670> great<00:05:00.940> when

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
colors and it especially is great when

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.410 
colors and it especially is great when
you<00:05:01.510> want<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.750> apply<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:02.320> black<00:05:02.680> shadow<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.420> in

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
you want to apply a black shadow and in

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.170 
you want to apply a black shadow and in
the<00:05:04.510> past<00:05:04.780> before<00:05:05.260> rgba<00:05:05.920> you<00:05:06.640> would<00:05:06.790> have<00:05:06.940> to

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
the past before rgba you would have to

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.450 
the past before rgba you would have to
sort<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:08.020> take<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.530> base<00:05:08.710> color<00:05:09.040> and<00:05:09.130> then

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
sort of take the base color and then

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.090 
sort of take the base color and then
find<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.180> bit<00:05:10.330> darker<00:05:10.780> color<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.200> match<00:05:11.380> it<00:05:11.650> but

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
find a bit darker color and match it but

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.640 
find a bit darker color and match it but
if<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.310> had<00:05:12.490> varying<00:05:13.270> backgrounds<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:14.200> just

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
if you had varying backgrounds it just

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.560 
if you had varying backgrounds it just
resulted<00:05:15.160> in<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.310> lot<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.550> work<00:05:15.730> so<00:05:15.970> rgba<00:05:16.420> is

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
resulted in a lot of work so rgba is

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.320 
resulted in a lot of work so rgba is
great<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.460> one<00:05:18.460> final<00:05:18.730> thing<00:05:18.970> before<00:05:19.030> we

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
great and one final thing before we

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.640 
great and one final thing before we
close<00:05:19.540> out<00:05:19.690> this<00:05:19.810> video<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.290> browser

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
close out this video is browser

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.090 
close out this video is browser
compatibility<00:05:21.490> so<00:05:22.480> rgba<00:05:23.050> is<00:05:23.380> not<00:05:23.710> going<00:05:24.010> to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
compatibility so rgba is not going to

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.360 
compatibility so rgba is not going to
work<00:05:24.250> in<00:05:24.520> older<00:05:24.910> browsers<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:26.010> perhaps<00:05:27.010> even

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
work in older browsers and perhaps even

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.510 
work in older browsers and perhaps even
more<00:05:27.610> relevant<00:05:28.200> CSS<00:05:29.200> shadows<00:05:29.740> are<00:05:29.950> not<00:05:30.010> going

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
more relevant CSS shadows are not going

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.630 
more relevant CSS shadows are not going
to<00:05:30.610> work<00:05:30.790> in<00:05:31.060> older<00:05:31.690> browsers<00:05:32.170> but<00:05:32.980> it's<00:05:33.280> ok

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
to work in older browsers but it's ok

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.280 
to work in older browsers but it's ok
because<00:05:33.760> they're<00:05:34.030> not<00:05:34.150> exactly<00:05:34.510> vital<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.170> the

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
because they're not exactly vital to the

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.310 
because they're not exactly vital to the
layout<00:05:35.910> however<00:05:36.910> there<00:05:37.420> are<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.660> few<00:05:37.930> lines<00:05:38.080> of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
layout however there are a few lines of

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.380 
layout however there are a few lines of
code<00:05:38.380> we<00:05:38.710> can<00:05:38.860> add<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.220> our<00:05:39.250> stylesheet<00:05:39.820> to

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
code we can add to our stylesheet to

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.880 
code we can add to our stylesheet to
ensure<00:05:40.690> that<00:05:40.720> shadows<00:05:41.290> work<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.710> the

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
ensure that shadows work and the

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.040 
ensure that shadows work and the
greatest<00:05:42.280> percentage<00:05:42.880> of<00:05:43.120> browsers<00:05:43.510> possible

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
greatest percentage of browsers possible

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.640 
greatest percentage of browsers possible
so<00:05:45.040> I<00:05:45.310> have<00:05:46.240> an<00:05:46.390> outdated<00:05:46.690> version<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:47.200> Safari

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
so I have an outdated version of Safari

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.790 
so I have an outdated version of Safari
here<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.100> as<00:05:49.030> we<00:05:49.240> can<00:05:49.420> see<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:50.170> text<00:05:50.560> shadow

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
here and as we can see the text shadow

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.270 
here and as we can see the text shadow
is<00:05:51.040> working<00:05:51.400> but<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:51.970> box<00:05:52.300> shadow<00:05:52.660> is<00:05:52.870> not<00:05:53.280> now

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
is working but the box shadow is not now

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.270 
is working but the box shadow is not now
Safari<00:05:54.700> is<00:05:54.970> a<00:05:55.000> is<00:05:55.630> a<00:05:55.690> very<00:05:56.110> modern<00:05:56.440> browser<00:05:56.800> but

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
Safari is a is a very modern browser but

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.010 
Safari is a is a very modern browser but
I'm<00:05:57.400> running<00:05:57.820> behind<00:05:57.940> in<00:05:58.360> my<00:05:58.480> update

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
I'm running behind in my update

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.640 
I'm running behind in my update
so<00:05:59.920> in<00:06:00.310> our<00:06:00.880> stylesheet<00:06:01.570> there's<00:06:02.290> something

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
so in our stylesheet there's something

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
now if we refresh in Safari we can see

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.130 
now if we refresh in Safari we can see
that<00:06:24.040> there<00:06:24.160> is<00:06:24.280> a<00:06:24.310> shadow<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:24.880> it's<00:06:25.810> the<00:06:25.900> same

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
that there is a shadow and it's the same

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.630 
that there is a shadow and it's the same
thing<00:06:26.170> Google<00:06:26.650> Chrome<00:06:27.010> if<00:06:27.220> we<00:06:27.370> have<00:06:27.520> our

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
thing Google Chrome if we have our

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.210 
thing Google Chrome if we have our
Google<00:06:27.910> Chrome<00:06:28.150> it<00:06:28.900> uses<00:06:29.350> the<00:06:29.470> WebKit<00:06:29.860> engine

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
Google Chrome it uses the WebKit engine

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.130 
Google Chrome it uses the WebKit engine
so<00:06:30.670> it's<00:06:30.820> the<00:06:30.910> same<00:06:31.090> thing<00:06:31.150> if<00:06:31.570> someone<00:06:31.780> has<00:06:32.020> an

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
so it's the same thing if someone has an

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.800 
so it's the same thing if someone has an
older<00:06:32.470> version<00:06:32.620> of<00:06:32.890> Chrome<00:06:33.210> this<00:06:34.210> will<00:06:34.630> allow

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
older version of Chrome this will allow

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.420 
older version of Chrome this will allow
them<00:06:35.020> to<00:06:35.110> see<00:06:35.200> text<00:06:35.650> shadows

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
them to see text shadows

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.939 
them to see text shadows

also with Firefox now we were able to

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.560 
also with Firefox now we were able to
see<00:06:39.100> the<00:06:39.190> shadow<00:06:39.430> in<00:06:39.610> Firefox<00:06:40.120> right<00:06:40.330> off<00:06:40.449> the

see the shadow in Firefox right off the
bat<00:06:40.750> because<00:06:41.290> this<00:06:41.590> is<00:06:41.710> the<00:06:41.860> the<00:06:42.400> cutting-edge

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
bat because this is the the cutting-edge

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
this was an older version of Firefox or

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.890 
this was an older version of Firefox or
if<00:06:51.010> you<00:06:51.460> think<00:06:51.940> a<00:06:52.060> large<00:06:52.240> percentage<00:06:52.780> of<00:06:52.840> your

if you think a large percentage of your

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.360 
if you think a large percentage of your
audience<00:06:53.080> might<00:06:53.500> have<00:06:53.530> an<00:06:53.770> older<00:06:54.040> version<00:06:54.160> of

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
audience might have an older version of

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.330 
audience might have an older version of
Firefox<00:06:54.880> we<00:06:55.840> can<00:06:56.020> do<00:06:56.139> the<00:06:56.229> same<00:06:56.410> thing<00:06:56.680> so<00:06:56.919> we

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
Firefox we can do the same thing so we

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.100 
Firefox we can do the same thing so we
can<00:06:57.550> just<00:06:57.669> take<00:06:57.850> the<00:06:57.970> property<00:06:58.360> duplicate<00:06:58.990> it

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
can just take the property duplicate it

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.140 
can just take the property duplicate it
and<00:06:59.139> add<00:06:59.590> a<00:06:59.620> prefix<00:07:00.190> of<00:07:00.430> Mohs<00:07:01.060> and<00:07:03.000> that<00:07:04.000> would

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
and add a prefix of Mohs and that would

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.370 
and add a prefix of Mohs and that would
cover<00:07:04.360> all<00:07:04.449> of<00:07:04.630> your<00:07:04.810> bases

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380
