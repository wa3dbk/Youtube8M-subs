 hi cutters and sweet potatoes 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.280
 today we will learn how to use 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.250
 a Parisian apple spoon or apple 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 Parisian for the intimate for that he 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.179
 you will necessarily need an apple 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.740
 Parisian is a food to torture here 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.580
 the pop 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.039
 be careful not to be confused with a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.570
 ice cream scoop or a chair r 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.859
 let's get your crowd well on the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.539
 spoon and exert pressure 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.580
 continues to have the most life 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.859
 big possible make a rotation 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.359
 what about the wrist and root out the bi fund 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.470
 do not worry it will take a little 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.750
 training to have a result 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.750
 perfect and that's it 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.670
 for those who do not understand and 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.680
 season under another in the same technique 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.239
 exert a slight pressure with the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.890
 finger point out that if you're not 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.780
 Parisian you can still used 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.050
 we are at nice and we did not have any 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.050
 problem 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.890
 and now you know what to do if 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 petanque you no longer have excuses you 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 can even use to play 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.930
 cricket ball or boeing at golf and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.619
 incidentally for cooking let 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.619
 free rein to your imagination 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.410
 way to the same technical potato 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.700
 same principle and as usual in 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.500
 cooking nothing is lost 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.210
 with the remains you can of course 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.340

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.180
 green spinach sofas the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.610
