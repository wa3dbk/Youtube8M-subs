00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.290
 Peanut cleaning for cream 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.780
 we can see here this is the winery 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.670
 after the peanut is chopped 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.860
 in base here in costal is true and what 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.260
 bring to this winery you can see here 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.080
 store can see there in the corner the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060
 large amount of peanuts that 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.299
 they use and then this machine they see 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.920
 here it is a fishing 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.859
 shells true to be removed 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.200
 peel the peanut all that way 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.930
 Fed up is artisanal as you can see no 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.180
 there are great machines here everything is done 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.599
 practically at hand after it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.200
 is peeling the peanut in this 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.810
 machine happens to what is this container 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.739
 that is one of the first step of the process 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.299
 to make peanut butter 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.620
 then practically this is the winery 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.599
 with which the organization counts here 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.989
 We continue with the process and we can 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.909
 see after they do the first 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.560
 that the first clean here comes out the 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.019
 So even with a little bit of peanut 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.079
 shell can later seal it 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.109
 they do everything by hand so that 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.109
 can be completely clean we can 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.959
 see here the last step for the 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.409
 peanut clean is here you can see 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.430
 it is completely clean 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.799
 later they go to what is the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.650
 toaster in the toaster are handled between 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.229
 15 20 minutes so that it is already 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.329
 ready truth to do the process of the 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.340
 Peanut butter roaster is 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.310
 practically similar to the process of 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.350
 coffee counts here with a stopwatch where 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.900
 well, how much is tasted? 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.850
 time it's toasting and you can see 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.100
 here some boxes these people 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.990

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.600

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.060
 facilities where then all the 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.610
 truth process on this side we can see 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.970
 the mills where they ground the peanut 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.919
 to make the cream here is also 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.610
 little machine that you see here is where 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.469
