this<00:01:46.229> purely<00:01:46.709> because<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:46.950> looked<00:01:47.220> calm<00:01:47.490> more

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
this purely because it looked calm more

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.609 
this purely because it looked calm more
than<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.209> fact<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.569> gonna<00:01:48.660> wear<00:01:48.929> it<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.289> have

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
than the fact I'm gonna wear it I have

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.109 
than the fact I'm gonna wear it I have
shied<00:01:49.890> wearing<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.490> few<00:01:50.670> times<00:01:50.880> before

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
shied wearing it a few times before

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.620 
shied wearing it a few times before
doing<00:01:51.569> some<00:01:51.780> CQB<00:01:52.550> got<00:01:53.550> very<00:01:53.940> hot<00:01:54.300> in<00:01:54.450> there

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
doing some CQB got very hot in there

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.839 
doing some CQB got very hot in there
found<00:01:54.959> that<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.289> really<00:01:55.590> did<00:01:55.860> reduce<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:56.610> field

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
found that it really did reduce my field

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.029 
found that it really did reduce my field
of<00:01:57.030> vision<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:57.989> getting<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.380> eye<00:01:58.410> down<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
of vision and getting my eye down the

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.160 
of vision and getting my eye down the
scope<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.580> few<00:01:59.849> times<00:02:00.149> whilst<00:02:00.539> using<00:02:00.959> it<00:02:01.050> was

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
scope a few times whilst using it was

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.440 
scope a few times whilst using it was
very<00:02:01.530> difficult<00:02:01.830> indeed<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:02.819> for<00:02:03.300> me

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
very difficult indeed so for me

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.359 
very difficult indeed so for me
something<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:05.099> if<00:02:05.250> you're

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
something like this and if you're

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
something like this and if you're
looking<00:02:05.489> for<00:02:05.759> practicality<00:02:06.239> probably<00:02:06.989> not

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
looking for practicality probably not

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.440 
looking for practicality probably not
the<00:02:07.830> best<00:02:07.860> thing<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.610> world<00:02:08.640> let's<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the best thing in the world let's go I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.809 
the best thing in the world let's go I
call<00:02:09.690> though<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.440> let's<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.280> plunk<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
call though so let's just plunk that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.240 
call though so let's just plunk that
background<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.590> let's<00:02:13.890> go<00:02:14.010> through

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
background there and let's go through

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.949 
background there and let's go through
some<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.700> other<00:02:14.730> stuff<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.390> initially<00:02:15.720> I

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
some of the other stuff so initially I

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.170 
some of the other stuff so initially I
start<00:02:16.260> wearing<00:02:16.620> these<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.660> these<00:02:19.349> are<00:02:19.590> Bowl

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
start wearing these and these are Bowl

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.270 
start wearing these and these are Bowl
superior<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.829> you<00:02:23.129> can<00:02:23.219> see<00:02:23.430> they're<00:02:23.640> nice

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
superior so as you can see they're nice

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.030 
superior so as you can see they're nice
thick<00:02:24.580> days<00:02:25.420> our<00:02:25.630> impact<00:02:26.110> rated<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.740> think<00:02:26.920> that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
thick days our impact rated I think that

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.270 
thick days our impact rated I think that
impact<00:02:27.490> rated<00:02:27.970> five<00:02:28.360> off<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.410> top<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.800> my<00:02:29.950> head

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
impact rated five off the top of my head

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.190 
impact rated five off the top of my head
but<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.790> know<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.209> these<00:02:31.569> are<00:02:31.810> actually

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
but I do know that these are actually

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
but I do know that these are actually
you<00:02:32.560> know<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.709> impact<00:02:33.400> proof<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.940> glasses

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
you know like impact proof of glasses

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.600 
you know like impact proof of glasses
now<00:02:34.870> they've<00:02:35.050> got<00:02:35.230> nice<00:02:35.470> flexible<00:02:36.100> arm<00:02:36.340> sort

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
now they've got nice flexible arm sort

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.250 
now they've got nice flexible arm sort
of<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> rubber<00:02:36.940> coating<00:02:37.209> which<00:02:37.810> means<00:02:38.140> that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of a rubber coating which means that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.050 
of a rubber coating which means that
they<00:02:38.380> stick<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.770> your<00:02:38.860> head<00:02:39.010> quite<00:02:39.310> nicely<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
they stick to your head quite nicely and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.660 
they stick to your head quite nicely and
just<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.750> put<00:02:40.930> these<00:02:41.110> on<00:02:41.319> they<00:02:41.890> sit<00:02:42.220> really

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
just as I put these on they sit really

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.510 
just as I put these on they sit really
flat<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.330> face<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:43.959> there's<00:02:44.200> next<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.010> no<00:02:45.220> gap

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
flat to face so there's next to no gap

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.550 
flat to face so there's next to no gap
okay<00:02:45.819> just<00:02:46.150> about<00:02:46.420> get<00:02:46.630> my<00:02:46.720> fingertip<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.440> in

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
okay just about get my fingertip in in

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.290 
okay just about get my fingertip in in
some<00:02:47.800> areas<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.880> know<00:02:49.000> we've<00:02:49.180> been

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
some areas but you know we've been

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.910 
some areas but you know we've been
pushed<00:02:49.569> nice<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.080> tight<00:02:50.290> your<00:02:50.470> head<00:02:50.620> you're

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
pushed nice and tight your head you're

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440 
pushed nice and tight your head you're
gonna<00:02:51.010> see<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.610> they<00:02:51.910> fit<00:02:52.239> really

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
gonna see that they fit really

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.180 
gonna see that they fit really
comfortably<00:02:53.020> because<00:02:53.290> there's<00:02:53.680> no<00:02:53.860> frame

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
comfortably because there's no frame

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.520 
comfortably because there's no frame
you've<00:02:54.430> got<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.610> great<00:02:54.819> field<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.330> vision<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.440> I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
you've got a great field of vision and I

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.320 
you've got a great field of vision and I
have<00:02:56.739> actually<00:02:56.920> recently<00:02:57.640> replaced<00:02:57.910> these

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
have actually recently replaced these

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.030 
have actually recently replaced these
and<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.900> reason<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.350> I've<00:02:59.470> replaced<00:02:59.830> them

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
and the reason that I've replaced them

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.410 
and the reason that I've replaced them
is<00:03:00.160> because<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.640> fact<00:03:00.820> I've<00:03:01.030> been<00:03:01.150> playing

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
is because of the fact I've been playing

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.060 
is because of the fact I've been playing
for<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.750> these<00:03:01.959> for<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> buying<00:03:02.440> year<00:03:02.890> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
for with these for a buying year and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.770 
for with these for a buying year and
they're<00:03:03.370> beginning<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.730> get<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.970> bit<00:03:04.180> tatty<00:03:04.480> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
they're beginning to get a bit tatty and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.479 
they're beginning to get a bit tatty and
a<00:03:04.810> bit<00:03:04.959> scratched<00:03:05.410> after<00:03:05.890> going<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.400> out

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
a bit scratched after going in and out

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.570 
a bit scratched after going in and out
of<00:03:06.640> bags<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.239> being<00:03:07.420> dropped<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.840> few<00:03:08.019> times

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
of bags and being dropped a few times

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.059 
of bags and being dropped a few times
you<00:03:09.580> know<00:03:09.700> that's<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.420> only<00:03:10.450> real<00:03:10.840> reason<00:03:11.069> but

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
you know that's the only real reason but

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.350 
you know that's the only real reason but
these<00:03:12.190> are<00:03:12.340> nice<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.519> cheap<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.060> think<00:03:13.269> they

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
these are nice and cheap I think they

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.000 
these are nice and cheap I think they
cost<00:03:13.540> about<00:03:13.690> seven<00:03:14.170> or<00:03:14.230> eight<00:03:14.350> pound<00:03:14.680> and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
cost about seven or eight pound and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.490 
cost about seven or eight pound and
again<00:03:15.370> they<00:03:15.610> are<00:03:15.640> impact<00:03:16.269> but<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.200> know<00:03:17.319> that

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
again they are impact but you know that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.100 
again they are impact but you know that
they're<00:03:17.739> impact<00:03:18.190> rated<00:03:18.670> as<00:03:19.120> they<00:03:19.330> say<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:19.569> you

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
they're impact rated as they say so you

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.990 
they're impact rated as they say so you
know<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.530> can<00:03:20.709> be<00:03:20.800> shot<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.670> actually

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
know you can be shot and I have actually
