00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.590 

because<00:00:28.730> they<00:00:28.850> kind<00:00:29.030> of<00:00:29.060> go<00:00:29.180> hand<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:29.480> hand

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
because they kind of go hand in hand

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.450 
because they kind of go hand in hand
especially<00:00:30.260> with<00:00:30.410> only<00:00:30.650> having<00:00:30.950> three<00:00:31.070> team

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
especially with only having three team

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.880 
especially with only having three team
members<00:00:31.820> this<00:00:32.000> year<00:00:32.059> you<00:00:32.840> know<00:00:32.960> my<00:00:33.410> practice

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
members this year you know my practice

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.010 
members this year you know my practice
really<00:00:34.070> relates<00:00:34.520> into<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.600> work<00:00:35.750> that<00:00:35.780> we're

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
really relates into the work that we're

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.270 
really relates into the work that we're
gonna<00:00:36.110> do<00:00:36.290> as<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.470> team<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:36.740> think<00:00:36.890> correct

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
gonna do as a team I think correct

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.640 
gonna do as a team I think correct
correct<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.210> um<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.079> first<00:00:39.110> thing<00:00:39.470> that<00:00:39.500> I

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
correct so um the first thing that I

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.410 
correct so um the first thing that I
thought<00:00:39.800> was<00:00:39.860> really<00:00:39.980> amazing<00:00:40.910> is<00:00:41.270> this

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
thought was really amazing is this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.240 
thought was really amazing is this
report<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.050> score<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.530> graph<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:43.160> can

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
report the score and graph that you can

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.610 
report the score and graph that you can
get<00:00:43.370> off<00:00:43.489> data<00:00:43.700> director<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.960> have<00:00:45.380> you<00:00:45.470> seen

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
get off data director so have you seen

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.680 
get off data director so have you seen
this<00:00:45.770> before<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:46.340> have<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.090> what<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.450> is<00:00:47.570> is

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
this before I have so what it is is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.880 
this before I have so what it is is
basically<00:00:47.870> it's<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.380> same<00:00:48.560> group<00:00:48.710> of

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
basically it's the same group of

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.139 
basically it's the same group of
students<00:00:49.130> I<00:00:49.220> worked<00:00:49.399> with<00:00:49.520> last<00:00:49.760> year<00:00:50.000> but

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
students I worked with last year but

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.610 
students I worked with last year but
this<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.420> a<00:00:50.450> second<00:00:50.870> third<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.079> fourth<00:00:51.470> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
this is a second third and fourth and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.520 
this is a second third and fourth and
then<00:00:51.770> now<00:00:52.100> fifth<00:00:52.460> grade<00:00:52.700> results<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.720> so<00:00:54.230> it

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
then now fifth grade results and so it

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.049 
then now fifth grade results and so it
was<00:00:54.680> really<00:00:54.920> striking<00:00:55.130> to<00:00:55.399> me<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.610> math<00:00:55.820> of

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
was really striking to me the math of

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.880 
was really striking to me the math of
course<00:00:56.090> I've<00:00:56.510> moved<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.960> lot<00:00:57.140> more<00:00:57.320> students<00:00:57.739> at

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
course I've moved a lot more students at

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.940 
course I've moved a lot more students at
math<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.399> even<00:00:58.820> anticipated<00:00:59.450> I<00:01:00.410> had

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
math and I even anticipated I had

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.319 
math and I even anticipated I had
several<00:01:01.190> students<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.670> were<00:01:01.910> basic

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
several students that were basic

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.490 
several students that were basic
students<00:01:02.750> that<00:01:02.899> actually<00:01:03.020> made<00:01:03.380> it<00:01:03.469> to

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
students that actually made it to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.620 
students that actually made it to
proficient<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.489> was<00:01:04.879> not<00:01:05.059> certain<00:01:05.360> at<00:01:05.540> the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
proficient that I was not certain at the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.850 
proficient that I was not certain at the
end<00:01:05.720> of<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.870> year<00:01:06.020> even<00:01:06.320> though<00:01:06.409> all<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
end of the year even though all the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.170 
end of the year even though all the
environment<00:01:07.190> interventions<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:07.909> put<00:01:08.090> in

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
environment interventions we put in

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.850 
environment interventions we put in
place<00:01:08.210> whether<00:01:09.080> they<00:01:09.350> would<00:01:09.500> make<00:01:09.620> it<00:01:09.740> or<00:01:09.830> not

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
place whether they would make it or not

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.920 
place whether they would make it or not
even<00:01:10.090> anticipate<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.270> fourth<00:01:11.570> graders<00:01:11.840> that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
even anticipate the fourth graders that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.180 
even anticipate the fourth graders that
are<00:01:12.049> coming<00:01:12.260> into<00:01:12.409> fifth<00:01:12.620> grader<00:01:12.830> already

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
are coming into fifth grader already

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.760 
are coming into fifth grader already
gonna<00:01:13.280> be<00:01:13.370> a<00:01:13.430> lot<00:01:13.640> more<00:01:13.670> data<00:01:14.030> savvy<00:01:14.770> just

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
gonna be a lot more data savvy just

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.469 
gonna be a lot more data savvy just
because<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.220> work<00:01:16.400> that<00:01:16.610> I<00:01:16.790> believe<00:01:17.090> was

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
because of the work that I believe was

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.030 
because of the work that I believe was
taken<00:01:17.659> on<00:01:17.930> last<00:01:18.140> year<00:01:18.350> at<00:01:18.409> an<00:01:18.500> individual

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
taken on last year at an individual

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.480 
taken on last year at an individual
level

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
level

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.460 
level
excellent<00:01:20.030> point<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:20.690> think<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.140> video

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
excellent point so I think the video

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.560 
excellent point so I think the video
will<00:01:21.740> look<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.460> kids<00:01:22.729> behaviors<00:01:23.270> will<00:01:23.450> be

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
will look and the kids behaviors will be

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.710 
will look and the kids behaviors will be
different<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.830> drive<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.310> PD<00:01:26.119> basically

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
different to drive that PD basically

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.820 
different to drive that PD basically
excellent<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:27.979> if<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.190> look<00:01:28.340> at<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:28.729> um<00:01:28.909> I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
excellent so so if I look at this um I

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.469 
excellent so so if I look at this um I
some<00:01:30.830> kids<00:01:31.070> picked<00:01:31.310> advanced<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.150> was<00:01:32.299> like

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
some kids picked advanced and I was like

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.179 
some kids picked advanced and I was like
well<00:01:33.140> okay<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.470> let's<00:01:33.740> make<00:01:33.860> your<00:01:34.040> goal

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
well okay so let's make your goal

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.800 
well okay so let's make your goal
advanced<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:34.760> I<00:01:34.909> would<00:01:35.119> really<00:01:35.270> be<00:01:35.510> pleased

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
advanced but I would really be pleased

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.480 
advanced but I would really be pleased
if<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.080> maintained<00:01:36.619> because<00:01:36.890> fifth<00:01:37.310> grade

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
if you maintained because fifth grade

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.580 
if you maintained because fifth grade
standards<00:01:37.970> are<00:01:38.180> more<00:01:38.420> rigorous<00:01:38.479> than<00:01:39.229> fourth

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
standards are more rigorous than fourth

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.750 
standards are more rigorous than fourth
grade<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:40.850> when<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.450> look<00:01:41.659> at<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.760> and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
grade and so when I look at this and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.550 
grade and so when I look at this and
this<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:43.939> my<00:01:44.240> English<00:01:44.689> language<00:01:44.990> arts<00:01:45.409> they

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
this is my English language arts they

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.600 
this is my English language arts they
believe<00:01:46.330> yes<00:01:47.360> if<00:01:48.320> they're<00:01:48.710> in<00:01:48.920> green<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.549> means

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
believe yes if they're in green it means

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.670 
believe yes if they're in green it means
that<00:01:50.060> they<00:01:50.210> met<00:01:50.509> their<00:01:50.750> goal<00:01:50.990> meaning<00:01:51.380> that

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
that they met their goal meaning that

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.830 
that they met their goal meaning that
they<00:01:52.340> maintained<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:53.509> kind<00:01:53.689> of<00:01:53.720> like

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
they maintained so it's kind of like

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.840 
they maintained so it's kind of like
they<00:01:54.409> wanted<00:01:54.799> to<00:01:54.950> be<00:01:55.040> advanced<00:01:55.430> but<00:01:55.580> if<00:01:55.700> they

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
they wanted to be advanced but if they

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.999 
they wanted to be advanced but if they
maintained<00:01:56.509> proficient<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.290> considered<00:01:57.860> them

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
maintained proficient I considered them

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.679 
maintained proficient I considered them
meeting<00:01:58.310> their<00:01:58.460> goal<00:01:58.640> because<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.210> knew<00:01:59.479> what

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
meeting their goal because I knew what

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.080 
meeting their goal because I knew what
was<00:01:59.780> coming<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.259> could<00:02:00.470> anticipate<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.250> so

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
was coming and could anticipate that so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.490 
was coming and could anticipate that so
all<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.299> students<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.780> are<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.049> green<00:02:03.290> and

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
all the students that are in green and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.200 
all the students that are in green and
met<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> goal<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.189> expected<00:02:04.759> them<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:04.939> be

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
met the goal that I expected them to be

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.530 
met the goal that I expected them to be
at<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.200> they<00:02:06.320> have<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.470> plus<00:02:06.770> sign<00:02:07.009> next<00:02:07.040> to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
at and if they have a plus sign next to

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.889 
at and if they have a plus sign next to
it<00:02:07.690> means<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:08.320> they<00:02:08.470> actually<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:10.479> changed

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
it means that they actually they changed

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.910 
it means that they actually they changed
bands<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> Abdullahi<00:02:13.810> his<00:02:14.110> goal<00:02:14.380> was<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.710> be

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
bands so Abdullahi his goal was to be

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.820 
bands so Abdullahi his goal was to be
yeah<00:02:18.210> are<00:02:19.210> maybe<00:02:19.690> two<00:02:20.080> or<00:02:20.260> three<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.710> each

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
yeah are maybe two or three in each

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.040 
yeah are maybe two or three in each
classroom<00:02:21.270> two<00:02:22.270> or<00:02:22.360> three<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.690> students

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
classroom two or three of the students

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.000 
classroom two or three of the students
who<00:02:24.030> had<00:02:25.030> seemed<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.840> be<00:02:25.960> making<00:02:26.380> growth<00:02:26.680> but

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
who had seemed to be making growth but

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.540 
who had seemed to be making growth but
when<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.250> came<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.510> actual<00:02:28.750> CST<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:30.280> didn't

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
when it came to the actual CST we didn't

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.940 
when it came to the actual CST we didn't
have<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.060> shorter<00:02:31.510> cycles<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.290> monitoring

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
have the shorter cycles of monitoring

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.390 
have the shorter cycles of monitoring
yeah<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.360> goes<00:02:34.480> back<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.870> your<00:02:34.990> reflection

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
yeah and it goes back to your reflection

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.250 
yeah and it goes back to your reflection
the<00:02:36.400> day<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.850> exit<00:02:37.330> slips<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.750> make<00:02:37.870> sure<00:02:38.080> we

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the day the exit slips to make sure we

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.050 
the day the exit slips to make sure we
hit<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:39.340> every<00:02:39.970> lesson<00:02:40.300> every<00:02:41.290> day<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.910> make

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
hit it in every lesson every day to make

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.170 
hit it in every lesson every day to make
sure<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.480> these<00:02:43.690> three<00:02:44.050> or<00:02:44.170> four<00:02:44.470> aren't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
sure that these three or four aren't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.580 
sure that these three or four aren't
falling<00:02:46.180> yes<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> Penguin's<00:02:46.840> we're<00:02:46.959> looking<00:02:47.410> at

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
falling yes a Penguin's we're looking at

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.120 
falling yes a Penguin's we're looking at
the<00:02:48.040> intervention<00:02:48.520> efficacy<00:02:49.480> what<00:02:50.140> what<00:02:50.440> was

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
the intervention efficacy what what was

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.710 
the intervention efficacy what what was
effective<00:02:51.640> about<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.060> intervention

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
effective about that intervention

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.480 
effective about that intervention
because<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.140> we<00:02:53.200> have<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> group<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.830> third

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
because now we have a group of third

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.850 
because now we have a group of third
graders<00:02:54.790> before<00:02:55.240> three<00:02:55.480> they're<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:56.020> me<00:02:56.200> they

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
graders before three they're in me they

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.370 
graders before three they're in me they
can<00:02:57.070> replicate<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.550> same<00:02:57.940> process<00:02:58.380> yeah

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
can replicate that same process yeah

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.710 
can replicate that same process yeah
most<00:02:59.709> likely<00:02:59.770> yeah<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.730> would<00:03:01.270> think<00:03:01.420> so

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
most likely yeah I would think so

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.630 
most likely yeah I would think so
looking<00:03:02.500> at<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.709> fourth<00:03:02.950> grade<00:03:03.130> standards

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
looking at the fourth grade standards

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.729 
looking at the fourth grade standards
and<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:03.910> providing<00:03:04.360> them<00:03:04.480> extra<00:03:05.320> writing

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
and just providing them extra writing

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.920 
and just providing them extra writing
targeted<00:03:06.430> intervention<00:03:07.030> parents<00:03:07.720> really

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
targeted intervention parents really

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.150 
targeted intervention parents really
have<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.170> push<00:03:08.380> him<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.709> his<00:03:08.830> homeworks

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
have to push him like his homeworks

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.350 
have to push him like his homeworks
finished<00:03:09.280> because<00:03:09.610> his<00:03:09.730> parents<00:03:09.910> make<00:03:10.209> sure

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
finished because his parents make sure

so the plan we have with its to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.170 
so the plan we have with its to
implement<00:03:38.200> AR<00:03:38.440> okay<00:03:39.340> its<00:03:39.459> first<00:03:39.670> then<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.090> go

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
implement AR okay its first then to go

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.930 
implement AR okay its first then to go
back<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.570> label<00:03:41.200> with<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.950> language<00:03:42.220> so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
back and label with that language so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.910 
back and label with that language so
it'll<00:03:43.239> support<00:03:43.720> your<00:03:44.019> work<00:03:44.440> with<00:03:44.799> these

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
results and looked back at our work we

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.720 
results and looked back at our work we
were<00:04:22.200> really<00:04:22.650> pleased<00:04:22.920> because<00:04:23.310> written

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
were really pleased because written

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.250

conventions<00:04:24.180> we<00:04:24.360> are<00:04:24.420> at<00:04:24.510> seventy<00:04:24.870> nine<00:04:25.050> point

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
conventions we are at seventy nine point

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.350 
conventions we are at seventy nine point
seven<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:26.310> written<00:04:26.550> strategies<00:04:27.000> we<00:04:27.180> are<00:04:27.210> at

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
seven and written strategies we are at

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.770 
seven and written strategies we are at
71<00:04:27.930> percent<00:04:28.380> so<00:04:29.190> we<00:04:29.940> think<00:04:30.120> we're<00:04:30.480> attributing

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
71 percent so we think we're attributing

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.710 
71 percent so we think we're attributing
that<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.010> very<00:04:32.370> focus<00:04:32.910> support<00:04:33.450> and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
that and the very focus support and

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.390 
that and the very focus support and
intervention<00:04:34.200> we<00:04:34.290> got<00:04:34.440> after<00:04:34.650> benchmark<00:04:35.190> one

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
intervention we got after benchmark one

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.340 
intervention we got after benchmark one
with<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.940> reading<00:04:36.270> teachers<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.990> came<00:04:37.170> in

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
with the reading teachers that came in

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.040 
with the reading teachers that came in
and<00:04:37.560> created<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:38.760> know<00:04:38.850> like<00:04:39.090> basically<00:04:39.930> what

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
and created you know like basically what

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.870 
and created you know like basically what
their<00:04:40.290> turn<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.620> do<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.980> recreate<00:04:41.430> writing

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
their turn to do is recreate writing

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.710 
their turn to do is recreate writing
experiences<00:04:42.540> for<00:04:42.930> kids<00:04:43.110> because<00:04:43.530> we<00:04:44.720> what's

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
experiences for kids because we what's

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.950 
experiences for kids because we what's
the<00:04:45.900> role<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.680> principal<00:04:47.420> in<00:04:48.420> your<00:04:48.660> school

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
the role of the principal in your school

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.250 
the role of the principal in your school
with<00:04:49.590> what<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:50.430> do<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.640> teaching<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.480> think

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
with what you do and teaching I think

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.400 
with what you do and teaching I think
it's<00:04:52.590> about<00:04:53.600> making<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.720> numbers<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.320> the

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
it's about making the numbers and the

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.860 
it's about making the numbers and the
data<00:04:55.440> transparent<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.690> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
data transparent and that is the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.260 
data transparent and that is the
rationale<00:04:58.380> then<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.760> this<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.150> the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
rationale then is that this is the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.000 
rationale then is that this is the
reality<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.320> what<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.620> data<00:05:01.860> means

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
reality this is what this data means

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.690 
reality this is what this data means
this<00:05:02.760> is<00:05:02.910> what<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.180> represents<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:05.340> the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
this is what it represents and that the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.120 
this is what it represents and that the
numbers<00:05:06.030> have<00:05:06.060> faces<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:06.960> she<00:05:07.350> is<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:07.650> good<00:05:07.890> at

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
numbers have faces and she is so good at

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.430 
numbers have faces and she is so good at
then<00:05:08.400> translating<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.810> reality<00:05:10.140> and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
then translating that that reality and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.740 
then translating that that reality and
the<00:05:10.560> data<00:05:10.770> into<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:11.669> call<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:12.120> action<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:12.660> a

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
the data into a call to action and a

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.250 
the data into a call to action and a
vision<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:15.030> she<00:05:15.360> doesn't<00:05:15.540> just<00:05:15.810> abandon

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
vision and and she doesn't just abandon

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.320 
vision and and she doesn't just abandon
it<00:05:16.410> like<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.860> have<00:05:17.250> had<00:05:17.520> experiences<00:05:18.120> in<00:05:18.180> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
it like I have had experiences in the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.850 
it like I have had experiences in the
past<00:05:18.480> where<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.900> principal<00:05:19.350> is<00:05:19.410> like<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.710> is

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
past where a principal is like this is

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.350 
past where a principal is like this is
what<00:05:19.980> we're<00:05:20.100> going<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.250> do<00:05:20.430> but<00:05:21.090> then<00:05:21.210> it's

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
what we're going to do but then it's

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.659 
what we're going to do but then it's
never<00:05:21.600> really<00:05:21.990> supported<00:05:22.830> or<00:05:22.950> scaffold<00:05:23.460> for

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
never really supported or scaffold for

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.440 
never really supported or scaffold for
teachers<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.750> make<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.110> accessible
