they<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.939> easily<00:01:09.270> fit<00:01:09.920> into<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.670> phone<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they will easily fit into the phone and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.280 
they will easily fit into the phone and
make<00:01:13.080> good<00:01:13.350> contact<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> charging<00:01:15.290> so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
make good contact for the charging so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.109 
make good contact for the charging so

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
around like crazy on there I would

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.120 
around like crazy on there I would

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
little bit of a rubber backing so that

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.880 
little bit of a rubber backing so that
it<00:03:01.530> doesn't<00:03:02.060> get<00:03:03.060> bumped<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:03.540> easily<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
it doesn't get bumped as easily but it

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.490 
it doesn't get bumped as easily but it
does<00:03:05.100> work<00:03:05.400> fine<00:03:05.760> once<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.660> put<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.200> as

great<00:04:00.239> as<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:01.019> said<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.319> only<00:04:01.500> problem<00:04:01.829> is<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
great as I said the only problem is I

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.530 
great as I said the only problem is I
don't<00:04:02.069> like<00:04:02.370> it's<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.669> slippery<00:04:02.940> feature<00:04:03.299> no

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
don't like it's a slippery feature no

the<00:04:03.660> Nexus<00:04:04.019> 7<00:04:04.199> does<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> rubber<00:04:05.009> backing

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
the Nexus 7 does have a rubber backing

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.010 
the Nexus 7 does have a rubber backing
so<00:04:05.759> it

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
so it

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.640 
so it
doesn't<00:04:06.260> move<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.160> easily<00:04:08.110> but<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.170> would<00:04:09.440> like

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
doesn't move as easily but I would like

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.030 
doesn't move as easily but I would like
to<00:04:10.630> possibly<00:04:11.630> pick<00:04:12.110> up<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.380> plate<00:04:12.620> down<00:04:12.860> the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
to possibly pick up a plate down the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.770 
to possibly pick up a plate down the
road<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.400> has<00:04:13.550> more<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:13.850> a<00:04:13.940> rubberized<00:04:14.450> feel

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
road that has more of a rubberized feel

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.050 
road that has more of a rubberized feel
to<00:04:15.020> it<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.500> phone<00:04:15.740> doesn't<00:04:16.459> slide<00:04:16.700> off<00:04:16.730> as

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
to it so the phone doesn't slide off as

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.140 
to it so the phone doesn't slide off as
easily<00:04:19.959> but<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.140> is<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.350> cool<00:04:21.770> way<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.790> easily

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
easily but this is a cool way to easily

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.170 
easily but this is a cool way to easily
get<00:04:23.600> your<00:04:23.780> phones<00:04:24.020> charged<00:04:24.910> without<00:04:25.910> messing
