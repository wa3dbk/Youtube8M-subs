00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and I can learn how to play with that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
and I can learn how to play with that
and<00:01:41.580> as<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.880> grows<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.690> bit<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> can

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and as it grows out a little bit I can

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
and as it grows out a little bit I can
experiment<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.130> maybe<00:01:44.490> having<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.850> shorter

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
experiment with maybe having it shorter

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.050 
experiment with maybe having it shorter
or<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:46.350> having<00:01:46.619> different<00:01:47.009> lengths<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
or just having different lengths and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.280 
or just having different lengths and
things<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:48.920> definitely<00:01:49.920> my<00:01:50.460> view<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.259> get<00:01:52.259> a
