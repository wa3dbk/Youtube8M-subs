tells really are interesting so we've

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.960 
tells really are interesting so we've
got<00:02:33.769> these<00:02:33.920> different<00:02:34.250> centers<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
got these different centers here and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.430 
got these different centers here and
what<00:02:35.150> happens<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.599> those<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:36.049> when<00:02:36.319> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
what happens with those is when the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.740 
what happens with those is when the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.160 
of every adjacent plot i love the same
color<00:02:43.010> growing<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.580> piece<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.760> bamboo<00:02:44.170> every

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
color growing a piece of bamboo every

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
of bamboo so it's a way to really speed

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.729 
of bamboo so it's a way to really speed
up<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.000> bamboo<00:02:50.329> production<00:02:50.810> we've<00:02:51.230> got<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> new

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
up the bamboo production we've got a new

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.030 
up the bamboo production we've got a new
Poland<00:02:52.400> which<00:02:53.000> can<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:54.260> works<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.829> like<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
Poland which can it works just like the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.500 
Poland which can it works just like the
main<00:02:55.250> pond<00:02:55.489> at<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.670> start<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.120> game<00:02:56.299> you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
main pond at the start of the game you

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.750 
main pond at the start of the game you
can<00:02:56.690> build<00:02:57.380> irrigation<00:02:58.010> channels<00:02:58.340> off<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.640> it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
can build irrigation channels off of it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.670 
can build irrigation channels off of it
and<00:02:58.940> also<00:02:59.299> any<00:02:59.630> tile<00:02:59.959> touching<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.500> is

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
and also any tile touching that is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.979 
and also any tile touching that is
immediately<00:03:00.980> going<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.489> be<00:03:01.579> irrigated<00:03:01.989> we've

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
immediately going to be irrigated we've

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.319 
immediately going to be irrigated we've
got<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.349> now<00:03:03.560> here<00:03:03.890> which<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.519> be<00:03:04.670> all<00:03:04.880> three

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
got this now here which can be all three

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.670 
got this now here which can be all three
of<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.569> different<00:03:05.870> bamboo<00:03:06.140> colors<00:03:06.440> we<00:03:06.560> can

have three stocks on the science of just
one<00:03:09.349> in<00:03:09.590> four<00:03:10.160> your<00:03:10.370> plot<00:03:11.180> tile<00:03:11.389> gold<00:03:11.780> cards<00:03:12.170> it

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
one in four your plot tile gold cards it

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.789 
one in four your plot tile gold cards it
can<00:03:12.950> act<00:03:13.100> as<00:03:13.250> any<00:03:13.519> color<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.269> when<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.139> grows<00:03:15.410> I

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
can act as any color and when it grows I

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.160 
can act as any color and when it grows I
you<00:03:16.489> know<00:03:16.519> you'll<00:03:16.880> choose<00:03:17.239> which<00:03:17.569> one<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.810> grow

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
you know you'll choose which one to grow

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
you know you'll choose which one to grow
and<00:03:18.410> when<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> pain<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:18.889> comes<00:03:19.010> there

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
and when the pain that comes there

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.920 
and when the pain that comes there
you'll<00:03:19.370> choose<00:03:19.609> which<00:03:19.910> bamboo<00:03:20.299> to<00:03:20.480> eat<00:03:20.660> which

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
you'll choose which bamboo to eat which

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.170 
you'll choose which bamboo to eat which
is<00:03:21.049> riled<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.680> every<00:03:21.980> way<00:03:22.130> exactly<00:03:23.000> exactly

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
is riled in every way exactly exactly

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.270 
is riled in every way exactly exactly
and<00:03:23.630> then<00:03:23.720> finally<00:03:24.079> we've<00:03:24.230> got<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.950> Gardner's

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
and then finally we've got the Gardner's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.099 
and then finally we've got the Gardner's
cabin<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.090> very<00:03:26.239> neat<00:03:26.480> when<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
cabin and this is very neat when the

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.020 
cabin and this is very neat when the
gardener<00:03:27.380> ends<00:03:27.680> his<00:03:27.799> turn<00:03:28.040> on<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.430> cabin<00:03:28.790> here

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
gardener ends his turn on the cabin here

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.270 
gardener ends his turn on the cabin here
he's<00:03:29.540> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.989> take<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.620> top<00:03:30.829> part<00:03:31.069> of<00:03:31.160> each

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
he's going to take the top part of each

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.890 
he's going to take the top part of each
of<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.549> different<00:03:31.670> Bowl<00:03:31.970> card<00:03:32.239> files<00:03:32.569> and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
of the different Bowl card files and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.080 
of the different Bowl card files and
look<00:03:33.590> at<00:03:33.739> them<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.100> choose<00:03:34.340> one<00:03:34.639> to<00:03:34.730> keep<00:03:34.880> and

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
look at them and choose one to keep and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.720 
look at them and choose one to keep and
the<00:03:35.150> others<00:03:35.359> get<00:03:35.480> discarded<00:03:35.720> Wow<00:03:36.470> yeah<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.400> a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
the others get discarded Wow yeah so a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.819 
the others get discarded Wow yeah so a
lot<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.510> new<00:03:38.780> things<00:03:38.810> some<00:03:39.230> new<00:03:39.319> bamboo<00:03:39.500> as

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
lot of new things some new bamboo as

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.580 
lot of new things some new bamboo as
well<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.600> nice<00:03:41.600> addition<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.139> doesn't<00:03:42.440> add

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
well so a nice addition it doesn't add

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.440 
well so a nice addition it doesn't add
too<00:03:42.980> much<00:03:43.100> complexity<00:03:43.639> it<00:03:43.850> just<00:03:44.150> gives<00:03:44.269> a

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
too much complexity it just gives a

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.000 
too much complexity it just gives a
little<00:03:44.480> bit<00:03:44.690> more<00:03:44.900> depth<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.590> game<00:03:45.739> that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
little bit more depth to the game that

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.890 
little bit more depth to the game that
like<00:03:46.310> everybody<00:03:46.760> loves<00:03:47.000> when<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.480> think<00:03:47.780> we

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
like everybody loves when I think we

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.090 
like everybody loves when I think we
should<00:03:47.930> probably<00:03:48.230> also<00:03:48.319> highlight<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:48.920> this

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
should probably also highlight that this

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.470 
should probably also highlight that this
is<00:03:49.250> not<00:03:49.400> stand<00:03:49.760> alone<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:50.239> do<00:03:50.329> have

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480
