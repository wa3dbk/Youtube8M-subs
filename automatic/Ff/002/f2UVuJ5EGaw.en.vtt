00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.399 
would probably be easier I mean you
might<00:01:19.590> stab<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.520> there's<00:01:23.670> more

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
might stab one but what if there's more

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
might stab one but what if there's more
generally<00:01:25.409> there's<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.159> frankly<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
generally there's more and frankly I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.999
