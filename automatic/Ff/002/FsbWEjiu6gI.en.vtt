than<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.550> golden<00:00:09.030> specter<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.110> think<00:00:10.410> this

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
than the golden specter so I think this

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.980 
than the golden specter so I think this
is<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> 10th<00:00:11.670> or<00:00:11.940> 11th<00:00:12.389> gold<00:00:12.630> gun<00:00:12.809> that

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
is like the 10th or 11th gold gun that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.660 
is like the 10th or 11th gold gun that
I've<00:00:13.080> bought<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> am<00:00:13.799> 14th<00:00:14.280> prestige

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I've bought now that I am 14th prestige

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.670 
I've bought now that I am 14th prestige
and<00:00:14.969> today<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> thought<00:00:15.990> I'd<00:00:16.170> talk<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.320> little

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
and today I thought I'd talk a little

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.710 
and today I thought I'd talk a little
bit<00:00:16.859> about<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.279> SMGs<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.090> game<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.480> I've

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
bit about the SMGs in this game as I've

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.540 
bit about the SMGs in this game as I've
done<00:00:18.900> before<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> little<00:00:19.920> bit<00:00:20.070> about<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
done before and a little bit about the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.800 
done before and a little bit about the
type<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.760> gameplays<00:00:21.300> I've<00:00:21.510> been<00:00:21.600> thinking

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
type of gameplays I've been thinking

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.900 
type of gameplays I've been thinking
about<00:00:21.900> uploading<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
about uploading so this one is a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.939 
about uploading so this one is a
gameplay<00:00:24.449> where<00:00:24.779> score<00:00:25.289> isn't<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.680> great

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
gameplay where score isn't that great

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
gameplay where score isn't that great
and<00:00:26.180> III<00:00:27.180> didn't<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.080> that

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and III didn't think that you know that

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.570 
and III didn't think that you know that
is<00:00:28.590> something<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.980> would<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.400> be

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
is something that would really be

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.919 
is something that would really be
appealing<00:00:29.939> about<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.240> video<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.570> thought

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
appealing about this video I thought

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.299 
appealing about this video I thought
instead<00:00:31.109> maybe<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.710> guys<00:00:31.830> would<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
instead maybe you guys would like the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.420 
instead maybe you guys would like the
fact<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.969> joined<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.050> video<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:35.040> Roger

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
fact that I joined this video a I Roger

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.709 
fact that I joined this video a I Roger
in<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.730> game<00:00:35.910> excuse<00:00:36.329> me

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
in this game excuse me

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.020 
in this game excuse me
a<00:00:36.750> where<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:38.160> teen<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.489> getting<00:00:38.700> triple

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
a where my teen was getting triple

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.369 
a where my teen was getting triple
capped<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.719> kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> made<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> little

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
capped and we kind of made a little

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
capped and we kind of made a little
comeback<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.219> once<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.489> got<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> team<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
comeback here once I got on the team and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.930 
comeback here once I got on the team and
also<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> wasn't<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.100> lethal<00:00:44.280> kill<00:00:44.610> streaks

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
also I wasn't using lethal kill streaks

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
also I wasn't using lethal kill streaks
so<00:00:45.300> these<00:00:45.539> are<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:45.809> things<00:00:45.840> I've<00:00:46.289> sort<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
so these are two things I've sort of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.869 
so these are two things I've sort of
been<00:00:46.649> thinking<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.760> off

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
been thinking about on and off

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209 
been thinking about on and off
experimenting<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.829> thought

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
experimenting with and I just thought

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
experimenting with and I just thought
I'd<00:00:50.340> ask<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.640> guys<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> videos<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I'd ask you guys what kind of videos you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.689 
I'd ask you guys what kind of videos you
like<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:52.710> listen<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.219> know<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.579> I

know right off the bat that sounds like

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
know right off the bat that sounds like
a<00:00:55.170> terrible<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.520> commentator<00:00:56.940> is

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
a terrible thing when a commentator is

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.119 
a terrible thing when a commentator is
asking<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> videos<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.859> like

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
in a chopper gunner or maybe would you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.070 
in a chopper gunner or maybe would you
rather<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.130> see<00:01:11.340> me<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:11.820> attack<00:01:12.330> dogs<00:01:12.630> so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

that you can see me use my gun the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
that you can see me use my gun the
entire<00:01:15.030> video<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.600> maybe<00:01:16.140> you'd<00:01:16.380> much<00:01:16.619> rather

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
entire video or maybe you'd much rather

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
entire video or maybe you'd much rather
me<00:01:17.100> roll<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.790> kills<00:01:18.030> except<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.540> going

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
me roll with the kills except I'm going

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
me roll with the kills except I'm going
with<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.140> game<00:01:19.229> which<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:20.009> UAV

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
with in this game which is just UAV

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
anyway a little bit about these

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.630 
anyway a little bit about these
submachine<00:01:43.470> guns<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.860> game<00:01:44.070> there's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
submachine guns in this game there's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
submachine guns in this game there's
been<00:01:44.790> debate<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.630> off<00:01:45.750> since<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> game

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
been debate on and off since the game

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.139 
been debate on and off since the game
came<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.670> whether<00:01:47.909> or<00:01:48.060> not

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
came out about you know whether or not

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
came out about you know whether or not
certain<00:01:48.540> guns<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.869> overpowered<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:50.009> whether

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
certain guns are overpowered or whether

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.649 
certain guns are overpowered or whether
or<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.549> certain<00:01:50.880> guns<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.240> underpowered

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
or not certain guns are underpowered

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.999 
or not certain guns are underpowered
because<00:01:51.960> there's<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> pretty

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
because there's actually a pretty

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.670 
because there's actually a pretty
significant<00:01:53.490> difference<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.320> really<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
significant difference and really the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.350 
significant difference and really the
way<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:56.100> sort<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> figure<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.060> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
way you can sort of figure that out is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.010 
way you can sort of figure that out is
where<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> SMG<00:01:58.890> classes<00:01:59.610> line<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.479> against

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
where do the SMG classes line up against

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
where do the SMG classes line up against
or<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> guess<00:02:01.710> stack<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.369> against<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> assault

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
or I guess stack up against the assault

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.420 
or I guess stack up against the assault
rifle<00:02:03.630> classes<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> game<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.219> my

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
rifle classes in the game so in my

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.389 
rifle classes in the game so in my
opinion<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.270> say<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.020> SMGs<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:08.039> an

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
opinion I would say that the SMGs are an

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.339 
opinion I would say that the SMGs are an
underpowered<00:02:08.910> class<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> look<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
underpowered class if you look at the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.550 
underpowered class if you look at the
specter<00:02:11.239> compared

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
specter compared

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.020 
specter compared
I<00:02:12.620> mean<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> specter<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.730> an<00:02:13.819> average

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
I mean the specter is like an average

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.370 
I mean the specter is like an average
snv<00:02:14.780> I'd<00:02:15.020> say<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.770> specter<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.940> mp5k<00:02:17.720> are

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
snv I'd say the specter and the mp5k are

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.750 
snv I'd say the specter and the mp5k are
probably<00:02:18.800> tied<00:02:19.010> for<00:02:19.280> my<00:02:19.340> second-favorite

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
probably tied for my second-favorite

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.390 
probably tied for my second-favorite
SMGs<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.840> if<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.260> had<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.500> say<00:02:21.680> what<00:02:22.040> guns<00:02:22.250> were

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
SMGs and if I had to say what guns were

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.860 
SMGs and if I had to say what guns were
tied<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:22.640> my<00:02:22.940> second<00:02:23.239> favorite<00:02:23.540> assault

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
tied for my second favorite assault

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.620 
tied for my second favorite assault
rifles<00:02:24.230> I'd<00:02:24.530> probably<00:02:24.770> say<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.220> commando<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
rifles I'd probably say the commando the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.699 
rifles I'd probably say the commando the
aughh<00:02:27.790> what<00:02:28.790> else<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.180> Enfield<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.930> those

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
aughh what else the Enfield and those

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.630 
aughh what else the Enfield and those
guns<00:02:31.040> just<00:02:31.580> outplay<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.680> SMGs<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.610> I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
guns just outplay the the SMGs that I

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.000 
guns just outplay the the SMGs that I
listed<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.180> second<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.780> go<00:02:35.900> whenever<00:02:36.739> you've

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
listed a second and go whenever you've

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.380 
listed a second and go whenever you've
got<00:02:37.040> any<00:02:37.370> medium<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.880> long<00:02:38.030> range<00:02:38.239> engagements

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
got any medium to long range engagements

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.750 
got any medium to long range engagements
I<00:02:39.110> mean<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.440> only<00:02:39.590> maps<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.250> really<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
I mean the only maps that really the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.759 
I mean the only maps that really the
SMGs<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.420> stack<00:02:41.660> up<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.050> if<00:02:42.290> you're<00:02:42.410> not<00:02:42.440> using

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
SMGs can stack up on if you're not using

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.729 
SMGs can stack up on if you're not using
an<00:02:42.980> ak-74<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.849> our<00:02:44.180> Maps<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.870> firing<00:02:45.440> range

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
an ak-74 you our Maps like firing range

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.530 
an ak-74 you our Maps like firing range
and<00:02:46.069> summit<00:02:46.610> which<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.970> guys<00:02:47.209> are<00:02:47.360> seeing

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
and summit which you guys are seeing

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.380 
and summit which you guys are seeing
right<00:02:47.720> here<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.230> my<00:02:49.040> opinion<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.910> feel

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
right here so my opinion and you feel

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.050 
right here so my opinion and you feel
free<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.720> disagree<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.290> me<00:02:51.440> um<00:02:51.680> my<00:02:52.160> opinion

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
free to disagree with me um my opinion

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.300 
free to disagree with me um my opinion
is<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.780> other<00:02:53.930> smg's<00:02:54.440> need<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.860> buff<00:02:55.130> now

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
is that the other smg's need a buff now

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.789 
is that the other smg's need a buff now
I<00:02:55.430> think<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.850> spectre<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.540> mp5k<00:02:56.989> can

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
I think the spectre and the mp5k can

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.530 
I think the spectre and the mp5k can
stay<00:02:58.040> where<00:02:58.220> they<00:02:58.310> are<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:58.970> do<00:02:59.090> think<00:02:59.480> that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
stay where they are but I do think that

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.910 
stay where they are but I do think that
the<00:02:59.690> Mac<00:02:59.870> alone<00:03:00.170> should<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.590> 30-round

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
the Mac alone should have a 30-round

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.330 
the Mac alone should have a 30-round
clip

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
clip

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.759 
clip
I<00:03:01.580> think<00:03:02.120> oh<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.480> MPL<00:03:02.930> can<00:03:03.140> also<00:03:03.260> stay<00:03:03.560> where

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
I think oh the MPL can also stay where

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.740 
I think oh the MPL can also stay where

it is it's it's not amazing it's not

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.240 
it is it's it's not amazing it's not
terrible<00:03:06.260> it's<00:03:06.440> got<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.830> middle<00:03:06.920> there

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
terrible it's got in the middle there

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.860 
terrible it's got in the middle there
the<00:03:08.000> Uzi<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.690> kiparis<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:10.209> what<00:03:11.209> else<00:03:11.390> was<00:03:11.720> I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the Uzi the kiparis the what else was I

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.580 
the Uzi the kiparis the what else was I
saying

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
saying

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.170 
saying
there's<00:03:12.920> some<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.160> other<00:03:13.310> guns<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:14.030> Mac

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
there's some of the other guns the Mac

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.940 
there's some of the other guns the Mac
eleven<00:03:14.569> I<00:03:14.630> think<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.200> was<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.470> other<00:03:15.590> one<00:03:15.680> I

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
eleven I think that was the other one I

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.949 
eleven I think that was the other one I
think<00:03:16.670> they<00:03:16.910> need<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.090> little<00:03:17.390> bit<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.750> buff

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
think they need a little bit of a buff

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.270 
think they need a little bit of a buff
to<00:03:17.989> make<00:03:18.500> them<00:03:18.620> stack<00:03:18.829> up<00:03:19.010> with<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.160> other

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
to make them stack up with the other

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.009 
to make them stack up with the other
SMGs<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:19.970> don't<00:03:20.150> want<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.329> dwell<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.840> that

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
SMGs so I don't want to dwell on that

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.449 
SMGs so I don't want to dwell on that
for<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.350> whole<00:03:21.500> video<00:03:21.799> but<00:03:21.950> that's

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
for this whole video but that's

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.670 
for this whole video but that's
something<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.180> know<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:24.109> developer

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
something that you know the developer

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.250 
something that you know the developer
the<00:03:25.400> developers<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.180> Trek<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.840> been<00:03:26.930> talking

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
the developers of Trek have been talking

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.780 
the developers of Trek have been talking
about<00:03:27.380> recently<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.069> thought<00:03:28.340> I'd<00:03:28.459> bring<00:03:28.640> it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
about recently so I thought I'd bring it

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.520 
about recently so I thought I'd bring it
up<00:03:28.880> again<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.959> seems<00:03:30.170> like<00:03:30.350> they're<00:03:30.500> not

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
up again and it seems like they're not

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.009 
up again and it seems like they're not
focusing<00:03:31.130> on<00:03:31.400> SMG<00:03:32.090> balance<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.780> they're

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
focusing on SMG balance and that they're

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.860 
focusing on SMG balance and that they're
gonna<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.560> know<00:03:33.680> possibly<00:03:34.250> tune<00:03:34.609> up<00:03:35.390> any<00:03:35.780> of

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
gonna you know possibly tune up any of

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.900 
gonna you know possibly tune up any of
the<00:03:35.959> other<00:03:35.989> SMGs<00:03:36.650> only<00:03:37.130> tune<00:03:37.370> down<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.819> in

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
the other SMGs only tune down the in

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.309 
the other SMGs only tune down the in
case<00:03:38.060> them<00:03:38.239> for<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.840> thought<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.049> bring

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
case them for you so I thought I bring

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.930 
case them for you so I thought I bring
that<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.530> your<00:03:39.620> attention<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.220> ask<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.850> guys

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
that to your attention and ask you guys

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.150 
that to your attention and ask you guys
what<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.239> think<00:03:41.480> about<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.049> yeah<00:03:42.709> it's

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
what you think about it so yeah it's

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.900 
what you think about it so yeah it's
pretty<00:03:43.280> much<00:03:43.489> more<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.880> less<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.959> on<00:03:45.200> that

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
pretty much more the less it on that

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.650 
pretty much more the less it on that
scavenger<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> perk<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.420> I'm<00:03:47.540> actually

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
scavenger it is a perk that I'm actually

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.420 
scavenger it is a perk that I'm actually
running<00:03:47.870> in<00:03:48.109> this<00:03:48.230> game<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.799> you<00:03:48.829> don't

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
running in this game that you don't

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.640 
running in this game that you don't
really<00:03:49.790> see<00:03:49.910> me<00:03:50.299> run<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.720> often<00:03:51.109> in<00:03:51.230> my<00:03:51.350> older

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
really see me run that often in my older

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.400 
really see me run that often in my older
videos<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.579> thought<00:03:52.700> I'd<00:03:52.850> mentioned<00:03:53.150> that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
videos and I thought I'd mentioned that

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.660 
videos and I thought I'd mentioned that
hardline<00:03:54.410> was<00:03:54.739> pretty<00:03:55.069> much<00:03:55.220> my

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
hardline was pretty much my

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.949 
hardline was pretty much my
bread-and-butter<00:03:55.880> I've<00:03:56.510> talked<00:03:56.750> about<00:03:56.870> that

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
bread-and-butter I've talked about that

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.289 
bread-and-butter I've talked about that
before<00:03:57.370> it<00:03:58.370> was<00:03:58.519> my<00:03:58.609> favorite<00:03:58.940> Park<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.209> the

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
before it was my favorite Park in the

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.180 
before it was my favorite Park in the
game<00:03:59.450> until<00:03:59.840> recently<00:04:00.350> I<00:04:00.470> started<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.889> realize

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
game until recently I started to realize

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.650 
game until recently I started to realize
that<00:04:01.519> if<00:04:01.609> I<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.880> get<00:04:02.030> on<00:04:02.150> those<00:04:02.269> really<00:04:02.510> big

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
that if I can get on those really big

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.569 
that if I can get on those really big
kill<00:04:02.900> streaks<00:04:03.230> of<00:04:03.440> as<00:04:03.769> people<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.250> told<00:04:04.459> me

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
kill streaks of as people have told me

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.059 
kill streaks of as people have told me
many<00:04:05.180> times<00:04:05.329> before<00:04:05.750> especially<00:04:06.109> with<00:04:06.380> SMGs

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
many times before especially with SMGs

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.569 
many times before especially with SMGs

using dual mags running scavenger can be
a<00:04:13.579> huge<00:04:13.880> help<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.359> now<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.930> have

a huge help and now that I have

a huge help and now that I have
scavenger<00:04:15.560> Pro<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:16.039> even<00:04:16.280> more<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.700> help

Pro<00:04:18.560> I'm<00:04:19.370> pretty<00:04:19.579> sure<00:04:19.700> it's<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:19.940> same<00:04:19.970> as<00:04:20.419> it

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
Pro I'm pretty sure it's the same as it

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.230

was<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:21.140> call<00:04:21.979> of<00:04:22.010> duty<00:04:22.130> modern<00:04:22.789> warfare<00:04:22.940> 2

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.690

then<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:26.450> get<00:04:26.599> originally<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.320> also<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:27.919> think

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
then you get originally and also I think

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.760
