the direction right you can just kind of
guide<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.350> through<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.310> mean<00:01:08.700> around<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.990> your

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650

in<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.680> match<00:01:58.860> I've<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.310> had<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.790> many<00:02:00.119> good

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
in this match I've just had so many good

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
in this match I've just had so many good
chances<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.920> Neymar

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
chances and that was one that Neymar

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.609 
chances and that was one that Neymar
kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.270> missed<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.140> basically

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
kind of missed and it was basically

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.639 
kind of missed and it was basically
about<00:02:04.880> Neymar<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.090> Cole<00:02:06.450> who<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:07.170> actually

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
about Neymar or Cole who would actually

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.460 
about Neymar or Cole who would actually
come<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.520> top<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.810> basically<00:02:10.259> help

dummy inside the box to cut inside and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.470 
dummy inside the box to cut inside and
then<00:02:36.840> finesse<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> top<00:02:38.060> top<00:02:39.060> right

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
then finesse it in the top top right

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930 
then finesse it in the top top right
corner<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.740> another<00:02:40.980> surprise<00:02:41.670> was<00:02:41.910> a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
corner and another surprise was a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.550 
corner and another surprise was a
celebration<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.510> has<00:02:43.020> never<00:02:43.320> happened

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
celebration that has never happened

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.070 
celebration that has never happened
before<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.070> we<00:02:44.400> changed<00:02:44.760> Co<00:02:45.300> celebration<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
before but we changed Co celebration to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.750 
before but we changed Co celebration to
the<00:02:46.200> next<00:02:46.500> slide<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.920> guess<00:02:47.190> that's<00:02:47.430> kind<00:02:47.550> of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the next slide so I guess that's kind of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.210 
the next slide so I guess that's kind of
how<00:02:47.880> they<00:02:48.120> are<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:49.170> deal<00:02:49.410> with<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.830> but

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
how they are they deal with that but

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.910 
how they are they deal with that but
it's<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.240> nail<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.720> Cole<00:02:52.080> definitely<00:02:52.680> came

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
it's so to nail it Cole definitely came

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.670 
it's so to nail it Cole definitely came
out<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.460> better<00:02:53.760> man<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.810> duel<00:02:55.350> against

and<00:03:19.800> even<00:03:20.670> though<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.209> would<00:03:21.390> have<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:21.720> two

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930

matches<00:03:22.320> or<00:03:22.410> something<00:03:22.709> left<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:23.490> this

matches or something left but this

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.300 
matches or something left but this
definitely<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:25.050> should<00:03:25.320> be<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> win<00:03:25.830> because<00:03:26.010> we

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
definitely it should be a win because we

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.150 
definitely it should be a win because we
can<00:03:26.459> definitely<00:03:26.820> beat<00:03:27.030> hungry<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.500> cold<00:03:28.860> with

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
Hungary in this game was the keeper I

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.500 
Hungary in this game was the keeper I
wasn't<00:03:53.490> that<00:03:53.700> challenging<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.330> game

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
wasn't that challenging of a game

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.630 
wasn't that challenging of a game
especially<00:03:55.200> compared<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.100> first<00:03:56.370> deal

especially compared to the first deal
where<00:03:57.060> Japan<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.720> Santos<00:03:58.140> were<00:03:58.260> pretty<00:03:58.640> kind

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
where Japan and Santos were pretty kind

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.790 
where Japan and Santos were pretty kind
of<00:03:59.760> holding<00:04:00.240> their<00:04:00.450> own<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.990> Cole<00:04:01.230> getting

nil for England very good the

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.210 
nil for England very good the
performance<00:04:34.020> your<00:04:34.169> goal<00:04:34.590> with<00:04:34.889> the<00:04:35.039> layup

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
performance your goal with the layup

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.879 
performance your goal with the layup
from<00:04:35.639> his<00:04:35.940> teammate<00:04:36.389> and<00:04:36.690> he<00:04:37.349> couldn't<00:04:37.620> put<00:04:37.770> it

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
from his teammate and he couldn't put it

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.760 
from his teammate and he couldn't put it
away<00:04:37.979> but<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:39.270> I'm<00:04:40.199> not<00:04:40.380> sure<00:04:40.470> that's<00:04:40.620> the

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
away but that I'm not sure that's the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.890 
away but that I'm not sure that's the
Walcott<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.430> believe<00:04:41.759> welcomed<00:04:42.539> putting<00:04:42.810> away

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
Walcott I believe welcomed putting away

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.100 
Walcott I believe welcomed putting away
off<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.470> rebound<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:44.220> they<00:04:45.180> show<00:04:45.419> they<00:04:46.080> show

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
off the rebound and they show they show

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.749 
off the rebound and they show they show
calling<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.740> little<00:04:46.889> bit<00:04:47.039> there<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.400> go<00:04:47.580> they

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
calling a little bit there you go they

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.040 
calling a little bit there you go they
show<00:04:47.940> calm<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.419> guess<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:48.870> kind<00:04:49.020> of

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
show calm so I guess it's kind of

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.900 
show calm so I guess it's kind of
interesting<00:04:49.349> because<00:04:49.530> they<00:04:50.009> knew<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.310> it'll

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
interesting because they knew that it'll

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.879 
interesting because they knew that it'll
basically<00:04:51.090> call<00:04:51.569> created<00:04:51.930> that<00:04:52.080> opportunity

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
basically call created that opportunity

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.430 
basically call created that opportunity
so<00:04:53.130> he<00:04:53.639> should<00:04:53.849> deserve<00:04:54.210> at<00:04:54.419> least<00:04:54.449> it's<00:04:55.199> bad

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
so he should deserve at least it's bad

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.059 
so he should deserve at least it's bad
light<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.680> guess<00:04:55.949> we<00:04:56.819> keep<00:04:57.060> going<00:04:57.270> though<00:04:58.069> coal

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
light I guess we keep going though coal

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.680 
light I guess we keep going though coal
with<00:04:59.280> another<00:04:59.520> financial<00:04:59.909> that<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.509> goes

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
with another financial that just goes

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.409 
with another financial that just goes
right<00:05:00.900> though<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:01.710> that's<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:03.000> final

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
right though and that's it the final

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.879 
right though and that's it the final
whistle<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.840> course<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.470> know<00:05:04.650> why<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
whistle of course you know why the

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.339 
whistle of course you know why the
players<00:05:05.460> are<00:05:05.669> celebrating<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.389> because<00:05:06.780> we

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
players are celebrating is because we

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.010 
players are celebrating is because we
have<00:05:07.620> done<00:05:07.919> that<00:05:08.069> we<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:09.240> or<00:05:09.479> me<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.900> may
