00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
general general shape yeah i couldn't've

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.650 
general general shape yeah i couldn't've
got<00:00:49.680> surprisingly<00:00:50.340> difficult<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.420> draw<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
got surprisingly difficult to draw the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.430 
got surprisingly difficult to draw the
shoes<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.780> why<00:00:54.960> but

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
shoes and I really don't know why but

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
shoes and I really don't know why but
they<00:00:55.980> are<00:01:00.289> they<00:01:01.289> perhaps<00:01:02.039> lines<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> get

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
they are they perhaps lines just to get

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.250 
they are they perhaps lines just to get
the<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.939> feel<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.409> shoe<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> basic

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
the the feel of the shoe just as a basic

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
the the feel of the shoe just as a basic
okay<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.619> suppose<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.070> working<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
okay and I suppose actually working on

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.830 
okay and I suppose actually working on
drawing<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.360> give<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:13.040> so

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
drawing a give me so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I'm sure there let's take it up to some

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:48.139 
I'm sure there let's take it up to some
places<00:01:35.540> big<00:01:37.340> -<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> few<00:01:46.259> lines<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
places big - so few lines just to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:57.080 
places big - so few lines just to
indicate<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:49.280> place<00:01:50.479> yes<00:01:55.429> sayidi<00:01:56.429> goes<00:01:56.820> up

or detailed not at all just a sort of
again<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.930> indicate<00:03:11.740> no<00:03:12.740> mainly<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.550> was

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
again just a indicate no mainly I was

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:23.770 
again just a indicate no mainly I was
initially<00:03:14.840> there<00:03:19.840> okay<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.450> shape

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
initially there okay that in that shape

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.650 
initially there okay that in that shape
right<00:03:24.110> now

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
right now

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.800 
right now
it's<00:03:26.660> all<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> little<00:03:27.080> bit<00:03:27.320> thick<00:03:27.590> over<00:03:27.920> some

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
it's all a little bit thick over some

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.670 
it's all a little bit thick over some
wood<00:03:29.810> thick<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.440> back<00:03:31.990> but<00:03:32.990> designing<00:03:33.410> on

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
wood thick of the back but designing on

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.200 
wood thick of the back but designing on
actually<00:03:34.070> it's<00:03:34.220> reversed<00:03:34.700> but<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.910> guess

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
actually it's reversed but I guess

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.170 
actually it's reversed but I guess
really<00:03:35.600> also<00:03:35.810> if<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.230> are<00:03:36.260> creating<00:03:37.180> shape

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
really also if you are creating shape

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.710 
really also if you are creating shape
like<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.140> issue<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.970> can<00:03:41.180> actually<00:03:41.360> put

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
like this the issue you can actually put

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.080 
like this the issue you can actually put
your<00:03:41.870> room<00:03:42.050> whatever<00:03:42.530> design<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.070> like<00:03:43.280> um<00:03:43.700> so

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
your room whatever design you like um so

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.200 
your room whatever design you like um so
start<00:03:44.450> designing<00:03:44.900> around<00:03:45.580> around<00:03:46.580> trainers

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
start designing around around trainers

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.510 
start designing around around trainers
yeah<00:03:48.430> but<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.460> fun<00:03:49.730> thing<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.000> do<00:03:50.270> anything

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
yeah but a fun thing to do anything

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:03.060 
yeah but a fun thing to do anything
there<00:03:52.520> again<00:03:58.240> add<00:03:59.240> a<00:03:59.270> little<00:03:59.750> bit<00:03:59.990> of<00:04:01.420> shading

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
there again add a little bit of shading

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:12.690 
there again add a little bit of shading
yeah<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:06.080> do<00:04:06.260> too<00:04:06.530> much<00:04:06.739> I<00:04:06.950> don't<00:04:07.010> think

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.820 

the<00:04:13.700> design<00:04:14.360> whatever<00:04:14.750> design<00:04:15.530> you're<00:04:15.800> going

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
the design whatever design you're going

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.460 
the design whatever design you're going
to<00:04:16.070> put<00:04:16.280> on<00:04:16.459> there<00:04:16.700> but<00:04:17.860> yeah<00:04:22.300> that's<00:04:23.300> hard<00:04:24.290> to

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470
