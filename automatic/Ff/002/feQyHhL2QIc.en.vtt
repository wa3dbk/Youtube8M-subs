the<00:01:08.229> reason<00:01:08.440> why<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.590> do<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.860> is<00:01:09.040> because<00:01:09.100> I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
the reason why I do this is because I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.460 
the reason why I do this is because I
move<00:01:09.490> extremely<00:01:10.390> fast<00:01:10.690> guys<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.170> you're<00:01:11.290> gonna

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
probably have to pause the video here

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.399 
probably have to pause the video here
and<00:01:12.970> there<00:01:13.210> hit<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.720> no<00:01:13.840> blocks<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.320> then

let's just start doing this thing guys

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.469 
let's just start doing this thing guys
so<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.220> first<00:01:51.250> note<00:01:51.610> block<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:52.030> going<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.299> be

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
so the first note block is going to be

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.840 
so the first note block is going to be
11<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.350> as<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.220> can<00:01:54.340> see<00:01:54.460> on<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.610> left<00:01:54.760> hand

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
11 and as you can see on the left hand

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.790 
11 and as you can see on the left hand
side<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.150> screen<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.420> number<00:01:55.570> popped<00:01:55.900> up

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
side of screen a number popped up

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.140 
side of screen a number popped up
then<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.920> first<00:01:59.100> repeater<00:01:59.370> is<00:01:59.430> gonna<00:01:59.580> be<00:01:59.730> two

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
then the first repeater is gonna be two

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.060 
then the first repeater is gonna be two
ticks<00:02:01.490> eight<00:02:02.930> now<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.230> heads<00:02:04.410> up<00:02:04.530> guys<00:02:04.800> in
