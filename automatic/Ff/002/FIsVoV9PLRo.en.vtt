00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
enemies reacted in the game was a bit

different<00:00:40.940> from<00:00:41.210> your<00:00:41.390> other<00:00:41.450> games<00:00:41.870> that<00:00:42.170> go

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
different from your other games that go

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.830 
different from your other games that go
around<00:00:42.800> in<00:00:42.920> circles<00:00:43.360> it<00:00:44.360> was<00:00:44.480> kind<00:00:44.780> of

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
around in circles it was kind of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.680 
around in circles it was kind of
unpredictable<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:46.879> while<00:00:47.180> it's<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.480> very

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
unpredictable and so while it's a very

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.579 
unpredictable and so while it's a very
challenging<00:00:47.960> game<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:48.769> a<00:00:49.070> lot<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.280> fun<00:00:50.589> it's

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
challenging game it's a lot of fun it's

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.150 
challenging game it's a lot of fun it's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.330 

so<00:01:38.730> there's<00:01:38.910> 32<00:01:39.270> stages<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.410> another

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
so there's 32 stages that's another

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.970 
so there's 32 stages that's another
