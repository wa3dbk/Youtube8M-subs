00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.520 
there you go and if there's certain
roads<00:03:56.579> going<00:03:56.849> into<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.180> customer<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.349> you

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
roads going into that customer that you

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.599 
roads going into that customer that you
don't<00:03:58.769> want<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.549> truck<00:03:59.819> to<00:04:00.060> go<00:04:00.209> on<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:02.340> first

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
don't want the truck to go on the first

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.039 
don't want the truck to go on the first
time<00:04:02.849> you're<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:03.060> there<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.359> can<00:04:03.540> block<00:04:03.840> those

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
time you're in there you can block those

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.039 
time you're in there you can block those
roads<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.970> GPS<00:04:06.329> makes<00:04:06.720> sure<00:04:07.019> that

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
roads so that the GPS makes sure that

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.099 
roads so that the GPS makes sure that
the<00:04:07.319> GPS<00:04:07.680> doesn't<00:04:07.889> go<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.340> way<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:09.359> in<00:04:09.720> that

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
the GPS doesn't go that way so in that

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.409 
the GPS doesn't go that way so in that
sense<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.739> can<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.790> really<00:04:12.239> good

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
sense it can be a really really good

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.449 
sense it can be a really really good
tool<00:04:13.400> but<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.609> is<00:04:14.760> not<00:04:15.060> your<00:04:16.019> main<00:04:16.620> source<00:04:17.070> for

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
tool but it is not your main source for

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.610 
tool but it is not your main source for
mapping<00:04:18.139> okay<00:04:19.139> do<00:04:19.919> not<00:04:20.130> use<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:21.019> like<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.200> mean<00:04:22.440> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
mapping okay do not use it like I mean a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.409 
mapping okay do not use it like I mean a
lot<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.860> times<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.520> see<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.820> mean<00:04:24.120> if<00:04:24.270> it's

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
lot of times you can see I mean if it's

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.000 
lot of times you can see I mean if it's
straight<00:04:24.659> just<00:04:24.930> highway<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.349> highway<00:04:25.740> boom

anyone who's from this area knows that's
not<00:05:50.880> necessarily<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.599> best<00:05:51.719> way<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:51.960> go<00:05:52.169> in

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
not necessarily the best way to go in

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.309 
not necessarily the best way to go in
you<00:05:53.460> know<00:05:53.550> going<00:05:53.789> down<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.240> 20<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.690> up<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.900> 13

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 
you know going down the 20 and up to 13

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.529 
you know going down the 20 and up to 13
is<00:05:55.560> actually<00:05:55.949> a<00:05:55.979> better<00:05:56.130> way<00:05:56.300> but<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.330> lot<00:05:57.419> of

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
is actually a better way but a lot of

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.159 
is actually a better way but a lot of
times<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:58.020> come<00:05:58.469> in<00:05:59.000> coming<00:06:00.000> across<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.539> 138th

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
bridge which is a total different way so

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.980 
bridge which is a total different way so
by<00:06:07.740> going<00:06:08.099> into<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.610> area<00:06:08.969> and<00:06:09.150> looking<00:06:09.840> at

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
the map of where it is it's going you

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.510 
the map of where it is it's going you
can<00:06:11.880> say<00:06:12.750> okay<00:06:13.110> is<00:06:13.259> the<00:06:13.409> GPS<00:06:13.620> way<00:06:14.099> the<00:06:14.340> right
