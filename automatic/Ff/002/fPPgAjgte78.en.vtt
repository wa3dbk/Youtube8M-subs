00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670 

this<00:00:00.570> next<00:00:00.900> knot<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.199> one<00:00:01.410> that<00:00:01.530> many

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
this next knot is the one that many

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.649 
this next knot is the one that many
people<00:00:01.740> consider<00:00:02.280> B<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.730> be<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.000> hardest<00:00:03.360> and

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
people consider B to be the hardest and

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.380 
people consider B to be the hardest and
basically<00:00:04.259> you're<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.310> take<00:00:05.520> your

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
basically you're going to take your

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.540 
basically you're going to take your
backing<00:00:06.660> here<00:00:07.140> which<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.529> pretty<00:00:07.859> small<00:00:08.010> and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
backing here which is pretty small and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.100 
backing here which is pretty small and
you're<00:00:09.030> going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> connect<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.750> your<00:00:09.840> fly

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
you're going to connect it to your fly

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.839 
you're going to connect it to your fly
line<00:00:10.349> which<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.740> relatively<00:00:11.160> large<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
line which is relatively large this is

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.030 
line which is relatively large this is
probably<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:12.389> five<00:00:12.660> weight<00:00:12.870> fly<00:00:13.110> line<00:00:13.349> now

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
probably about five weight fly line now

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.530 
probably about five weight fly line now
if<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.340> made<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:14.639> overhand<00:00:14.969> knot<00:00:15.089> it

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
if you just made an overhand knot it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.609 
if you just made an overhand knot it
wouldn't<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.870> any<00:00:15.990> good<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.410> you're

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
wouldn't do you any good because you're

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.800 
wouldn't do you any good because you're
going<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.770> with<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> really<00:00:17.880> large<00:00:18.090> knot<00:00:18.510> that

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
going up with a really large knot that

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.760 
going up with a really large knot that
wouldn't<00:00:19.080> want<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> slide<00:00:19.470> through<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
wouldn't want to slide through the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.410 
wouldn't want to slide through the
guides<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.279> would<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.490> problematic<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.270> need

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
guides and would be problematic you need

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.790 
guides and would be problematic you need
to<00:00:21.510> make<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.840> that's<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.380> smooth

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
to make one that's going to be smooth

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.890 
to make one that's going to be smooth
and<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.609> best<00:00:23.789> way<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> create

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and the best way to do that is to create

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.870 
and the best way to do that is to create
a<00:00:25.050> nail<00:00:25.320> knot<00:00:25.560> now<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> nail<00:00:26.550> lot<00:00:26.730> you're

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
a nail knot now for a nail lot you're

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
a nail knot now for a nail lot you're
actually<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> make<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> little

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
actually going to need to make a little

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.230 
actually going to need to make a little
tool<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.189> use<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> bobbin<00:00:29.910> threader

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
tool here you can use a bobbin threader

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.820 
tool here you can use a bobbin threader
which<00:00:30.539> comes<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> fly<00:00:31.289> tying<00:00:31.529> kits

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
which comes with a lot of fly tying kits

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.000 
which comes with a lot of fly tying kits
or<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> loop<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.380> relatively

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
or you can just use a loop of relatively

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.950 
or you can just use a loop of relatively
thick<00:00:35.280> monofilament<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.180> find<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
thick monofilament I find this to be a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.880 
thick monofilament I find this to be a
little<00:00:37.140> easier<00:00:37.200> because<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.710> pretty

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
little easier because it's pretty

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
little easier because it's pretty
slippery<00:00:38.340> doesn't<00:00:38.790> tend<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> bind<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.450> much

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
slippery doesn't tend to bind as much

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
slippery doesn't tend to bind as much
now<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.559> order<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.219> you're<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
now in order to do this you're going to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.850 
now in order to do this you're going to
want<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> start<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> fly<00:00:42.989> line<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.559> your

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
want to start with the fly line in your

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.950 
want to start with the fly line in your
left<00:00:44.070> hand<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.460> you're<00:00:44.579> right-handed<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> take

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
left hand if you're right-handed so take

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830 
left hand if you're right-handed so take
your<00:00:46.079> fly<00:00:46.260> line<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.399> left<00:00:47.579> hand<00:00:47.840> take

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
your fly line put in your left hand take

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.049 
your fly line put in your left hand take
your<00:00:48.870> loop<00:00:49.219> place<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.610> left<00:00:50.760> hand<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
your loop place it in your left hand and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
your loop place it in your left hand and
pinch<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.420> together<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.050> both<00:00:52.170> go<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pinch them together so they both go the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
pinch them together so they both go the
same<00:00:52.800> direction<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:54.210> idea<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
same direction the idea here is that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.180 
same direction the idea here is that
you're<00:00:55.140> eventually<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> pull

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you're eventually going to have to pull

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
you're eventually going to have to pull
that<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.030> need<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> loop<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.719> be

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that way so you need the loop to be

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
that way so you need the loop to be
going<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.289> way<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.640> won't<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.820> able<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
going this way or you won't be able to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
going this way or you won't be able to
pull<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.480> direction<00:01:00.859> then<00:01:01.859> take<00:01:02.100> your

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
pull the right direction then take your

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
pull the right direction then take your
backing<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.960> case<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.350> just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
backing and in this case you're just

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
backing and in this case you're just
going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.830> ahead<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.309> pull<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:05.880> about

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
going to go ahead and pull off about

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.600 
going to go ahead and pull off about
four<00:01:06.600> inches<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.650> pinch<00:01:08.340> about

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
four inches or so and pinch about

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.510 
four inches or so and pinch about
halfway<00:01:08.820> back<00:01:09.530> place<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.770> four-inch<00:01:11.220> pinch

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
halfway back place the four-inch pinch

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.980 
halfway back place the four-inch pinch
right<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.270> left<00:01:12.600> hand<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> go

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
right there in your left hand and go

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.090 
right there in your left hand and go
ahead<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.229> pinch<00:01:13.380> them<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.650> together<00:01:13.799> at

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
ahead and pinch them all together at

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.910 
ahead and pinch them all together at
once<00:01:14.960> that's<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> leave<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> tag<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
once that's going to leave a tag of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.039 
once that's going to leave a tag of
backing<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.729> dropping<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
backing here which is dropping down and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:19.789 
backing here which is dropping down and
what<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.680> you're<00:01:19.770> going

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.490 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.040> wrap<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.820> tag<00:01:21.170> over<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> top

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
to actually wrap that tag over the top

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.330 
to actually wrap that tag over the top
one<00:01:23.060> pinch<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:25.850> pinch<00:01:27.920> three<00:01:29.540> four<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.340> five

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
one pinch to pinch three four and five

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
one pinch to pinch three four and five
times<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.210> helps<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> keep<00:01:33.810> these

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
times and it really helps to keep these

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660 
times and it really helps to keep these
things<00:01:34.200> stacked<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.829> correctly<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
things stacked up correctly so if you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
things stacked up correctly so if you
can<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:35.970> I'll<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.299> sure<00:01:36.450> those<00:01:36.659> wraps<00:01:36.990> are

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
can see I'll make sure those wraps are

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.960 
can see I'll make sure those wraps are
actually<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.920> line<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.579> wrapping

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
actually in line and I'm not wrapping

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
actually in line and I'm not wrapping
them<00:01:39.090> over<00:01:39.299> themselves<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.770> fifth<00:01:41.009> time

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
them over themselves now your fifth time

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.149 
them over themselves now your fifth time
and<00:01:41.610> five<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> usually<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> magic<00:01:43.200> number<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and five is usually the magic number you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.499 
and five is usually the magic number you
can<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.369> ahead<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> pull<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.939> tag<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
can go ahead and pull this tag up and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.230 
can go ahead and pull this tag up and
around<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.340> get<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.520> loop<00:01:47.759> where<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.000> can

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
around and get this loop where you can

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
around and get this loop where you can
pass<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.689> tag<00:01:48.930> through<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> loop<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:50.640> order

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
pass the tag through the loop in order

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.039 
pass the tag through the loop in order
to<00:01:50.970> pass<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> tag<00:01:51.509> through<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> loop<00:01:51.930> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to pass the tag through the loop you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.090 
to pass the tag through the loop you
might<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> kind<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.680> tweak<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> little

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
might need to kind of tweak it a little

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
might need to kind of tweak it a little
bit<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.990> where<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
bit here but just get it to where you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.679 
bit here but just get it to where you
can<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> tag<00:01:55.890> through<00:01:56.360> pull<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> tag

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
can get that tag through pull the tag

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.670 
can get that tag through pull the tag
down<00:01:57.899> okay<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.380> you've<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.590> everything

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
down okay now you've got everything

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
down okay now you've got everything
pinched<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.790> you're<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> start<00:02:00.540> to

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
pinched and you're going to start to

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420 
pinched and you're going to start to
work<00:02:00.810> from<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> back<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.890> loop<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.159> may

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
work from the back of this loop you may

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
work from the back of this loop you may
actually<00:02:02.610> want<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.000> transfer<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> pinch<00:02:03.810> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
actually want to transfer the pinch to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.380 
actually want to transfer the pinch to
the<00:02:04.110> right<00:02:04.290> hand<00:02:04.560> at<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.860> point<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:06.119> go<00:02:06.270> back

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the right hand at this point so go back

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
the right hand at this point so go back
here<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.960> loop<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.469> your<00:02:07.619> tag<00:02:07.860> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
here to where your loop or your tag of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.279 
here to where your loop or your tag of
monofilament<00:02:08.459> sticks<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> begin<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
monofilament sticks out and begin to

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.260 
monofilament sticks out and begin to
pull<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.940> do<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
pull now what this is going to do is

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.250 
pull now what this is going to do is
actually<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.840> pull<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
actually going to pull the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.320 
actually going to pull the
tag<00:02:13.439> and<00:02:13.769> through<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.700> loops<00:02:14.879> you<00:02:15.000> made<00:02:15.209> it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
tag and through the loops you made it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.699 
tag and through the loops you made it
out<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.659> other<00:02:15.780> side<00:02:16.049> but<00:02:16.349> as<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.650> see

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
out to the other side but as you can see

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.350 
out to the other side but as you can see
you've<00:02:16.950> got<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.220> little<00:02:17.489> loop<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.030> rear

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you've got this little loop at the rear

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.899 
you've got this little loop at the rear
of<00:02:18.629> what<00:02:19.230> would<00:02:19.349> be<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.620> running<00:02:19.950> line<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.790> it

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
of what would be your running line so it

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.309 
of what would be your running line so it
makes<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.180> little<00:02:21.269> sense<00:02:21.420> sometimes<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.230> go

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
makes a little sense sometimes to go

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.750 
makes a little sense sometimes to go
ahead<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:22.560> tighten<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:22.980> up<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.519> see<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
ahead and tighten that up to see you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
ahead and tighten that up to see you
have<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:23.909> nice<00:02:24.120> even<00:02:24.510> thing<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.049> pull<00:02:25.230> against

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
have a nice even thing to pull against

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.800 
have a nice even thing to pull against
once<00:02:26.489> you've<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:27.030> position<00:02:27.180> still

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
once you've got it in position still

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.809 
once you've got it in position still
maintaining<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.379> pinch<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:29.370> ahead<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.640> pull

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
maintaining the pinch go ahead and pull

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.780 
maintaining the pinch go ahead and pull
with<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> monofilament<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:31.049> slide<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:32.519> tag

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.640 
with the monofilament to slide the tag
all<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.090> way<00:02:33.239> through<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.170> when<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.379> release

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
all the way through and when you release

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.050 
all the way through and when you release
the<00:02:34.680> pinch<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.099> you<00:02:35.190> did<00:02:35.310> everything<00:02:35.519> right<00:02:35.849> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the pinch if you did everything right it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.430 
the pinch if you did everything right it
all<00:02:36.180> ought<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.540> pretty<00:02:36.750> well<00:02:36.870> stacked<00:02:37.200> up

all ought to be pretty well stacked up

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.140

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
if it's just a little bit loose like it

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.330 
if it's just a little bit loose like it
is<00:02:39.269> here<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.659> tighten<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.109> up<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.440> then<00:02:41.159> to

set it just pull tightly on both ends of

bite pull on the line in the backing at

got a nice even straight connection and
all<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.540> need<00:02:54.659> to<00:02:54.750> do<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.170> trim<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.680> very

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
all you need to do is trim up very

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.180 
all you need to do is trim up very
tightly<00:02:56.450> against<00:02:57.450> both<00:02:57.599> knots<00:02:58.129> now<00:02:59.129> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
tightly against both knots now the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.589 
tightly against both knots now the
easiest<00:02:59.459> way<00:02:59.579> obviously<00:02:59.849> to<00:03:00.180> trim<00:03:00.359> these<00:03:00.540> up

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
easiest way obviously to trim these up

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.180 
easiest way obviously to trim these up
is<00:03:00.840> going<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.049> be<00:03:01.109> with<00:03:01.290> tie<00:03:01.500> scissors<00:03:02.010> if

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
is going to be with tie scissors if

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.649 
is going to be with tie scissors if
you've<00:03:02.310> got<00:03:02.519> some<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.849> are<00:03:02.940> fairly<00:03:03.299> sharp

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
you've got some that are fairly sharp

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.140 
you've got some that are fairly sharp
let's<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.650> ahead<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.040> pull<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.489> up<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.819> like<00:03:06.000> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
let's go ahead and pull it up I like to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.629 
let's go ahead and pull it up I like to
tie<00:03:06.359> it<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.470> cut<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> slight<00:03:08.370> bias

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
tie it I like to cut it on a slight bias

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.339 
tie it I like to cut it on a slight bias
here<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.389> as<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.659> slides<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.170> guides

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
here so that as it slides to the guides

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.930 
here so that as it slides to the guides
it'll<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.739> an<00:03:10.859> angle<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.220> pull<00:03:11.400> against<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
it'll have an angle to pull against and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.629 
it'll have an angle to pull against and
then<00:03:13.069> obviously<00:03:14.069> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> want<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.459> do<00:03:14.549> the

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
then obviously going to want to do the

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.430 
then obviously going to want to do the
same<00:03:14.849> thing<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.389> other<00:03:15.420> side<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:16.200> turn

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
same thing on the other side so turn

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.680 
same thing on the other side so turn
that<00:03:16.560> over<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:18.090> one<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.389> be<00:03:18.419> a<00:03:18.510> little

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
that over this one can be a little

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.300 
that over this one can be a little
tricky<00:03:19.049> because<00:03:19.109> backing<00:03:19.620> likes<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:20.040> fray

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
tricky because backing likes to fray

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.789 
tricky because backing likes to fray
especially<00:03:20.849> waxed<00:03:21.299> backing<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.620> might

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
especially waxed backing so it might

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.369 
especially waxed backing so it might
help<00:03:22.949> to<00:03:23.099> go<00:03:23.220> ahead<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:24.540> get<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.959> hold<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
help to go ahead and get a hold of the

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.750 
help to go ahead and get a hold of the
back<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.769> kind<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.040> draw<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.310> over<00:03:26.519> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
back and kind of draw it over the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.009 
back and kind of draw it over the
scissors<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.359> get<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> really<00:03:27.780> nice<00:03:27.959> tight

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
scissors so you get a really nice tight

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.620 
scissors so you get a really nice tight
fit

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.820 

I<00:03:35.720> need<00:03:36.650> some<00:03:36.800> sharper<00:03:37.100> scissors<00:03:37.250> done<00:03:37.580> I<00:03:38.830> okay

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
I need some sharper scissors done I okay

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.070 
I need some sharper scissors done I okay
at<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.520> point<00:03:40.760> you're<00:03:41.240> done<00:03:41.420> this<00:03:41.720> knot<00:03:42.050> is

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
at this point you're done this knot is

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.400 
at this point you're done this knot is
connected<00:03:42.830> it's<00:03:43.790> tight<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:45.230> pretty

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
connected it's tight and it's pretty

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.200 
connected it's tight and it's pretty
strong<00:03:45.710> basically<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.490> knot<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.700> about<00:03:47.060> as

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
strong basically this knot is about as

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.930 
strong basically this knot is about as
strong<00:03:47.540> as<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.500> coating<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.130> line<00:03:49.550> is

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
strong as the coating of the line is

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.150 
strong as the coating of the line is
bonded<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.660> line<00:03:50.870> itself<00:03:51.290> now<00:03:51.560> that's<00:03:51.950> not

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
bonded to the line itself now that's not

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.740 
bonded to the line itself now that's not
as<00:03:52.310> strong<00:03:52.610> as<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.970> break<00:03:53.180> strength<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.660> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
as strong as the break strength of the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.230 
as strong as the break strength of the
line<00:03:53.960> but<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:54.830> mean<00:03:55.130> hey<00:03:55.280> people<00:03:55.670> land<00:03:55.850> tarpon

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
line but I mean hey people land tarpon

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.490 
line but I mean hey people land tarpon
