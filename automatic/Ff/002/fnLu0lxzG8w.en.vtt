night<00:02:00.850> kinda<00:02:02.220> I'll<00:02:03.220> I'll<00:02:03.670> beat<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.270> one

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.590 

beside<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:09.090> place<00:02:10.090> really<00:02:11.370> beautiful<00:02:12.540> as<00:02:13.540> it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
beside the place really beautiful as it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.160 
beside the place really beautiful as it
is<00:02:13.989> big<00:02:14.320> belly<00:02:15.329> so<00:02:16.329> when<00:02:16.480> you're<00:02:16.630> cutting<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
is big belly so when you're cutting it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.850 
is big belly so when you're cutting it

actually every time you cut it goes
deeper<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> frame<00:02:25.180> block<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.810> have

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
deeper this is a frame block I have

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.460 
deeper this is a frame block I have
another<00:02:26.739> one<00:02:27.010> which<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> line<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> log<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.470> like

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
another one which is a line a log I like

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.160 
another one which is a line a log I like
both<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.680> them<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.370> much<00:02:31.380> there<00:02:32.380> are<00:02:32.470> no

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
both of them really much there are no

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.000 
both of them really much there are no
stickiness<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.739> this<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.560> previous

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
stickiness in this one the previous

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.319 
stickiness in this one the previous
owner<00:02:39.670> says<00:02:39.910> though<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.920> not<00:02:42.070> been<00:02:42.220> used<00:02:42.459> but

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
owner says though it's not been used but

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.729 
owner says though it's not been used but
I<00:02:43.390> think<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.049> very<00:02:44.470> very<00:02:45.190> light<00:02:45.489> light<00:02:46.739> used

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
I think it's very very light light used

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.210 
I think it's very very light light used
and<00:02:48.010> carried<00:02:48.400> maybe<00:02:49.299> just<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:50.290> month<00:02:51.040> or

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and carried maybe just for a month or

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.010 
and carried maybe just for a month or
something<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.590> okay<00:02:53.890> with<00:02:54.220> me

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.760 

jumping<00:02:58.020> here<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.410> number<00:02:59.310> aggressive<00:02:59.910> and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
jumping here is a number aggressive and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.890 
jumping here is a number aggressive and
doesn't<00:03:01.770> really<00:03:01.920> grab<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.460> finger<00:03:04.460> but<00:03:05.900> it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
doesn't really grab the finger but it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.230 
doesn't really grab the finger but it
works<00:03:07.670> better<00:03:08.670> than<00:03:08.850> nothing<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.970> knife<00:03:12.210> is

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
works better than nothing this knife is

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.290 
works better than nothing this knife is
probably<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.850> one<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.880> my<00:03:17.120> one<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.150> my

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
probably one of the one of my one of my

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.710 
probably one of the one of my one of my
collections<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.680> has<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.070> better

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
collections that has the better

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.320 
collections that has the better
ergonomics<00:03:22.100> at<00:03:23.100> least<00:03:23.340> for<00:03:23.520> my<00:03:23.670> hand<00:03:23.910> because

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
ergonomics at least for my hand because

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.430 
ergonomics at least for my hand because
it<00:03:24.630> fits<00:03:24.900> perfectly<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:26.720> one<00:03:27.720> finger<00:03:28.050> here

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
it fits perfectly the one finger here

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.350 
it fits perfectly the one finger here
