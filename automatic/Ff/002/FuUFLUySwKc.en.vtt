the heat program i'm pleased to tell you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.860 
the heat program i'm pleased to tell you
that<00:00:14.400> I've<00:00:14.759> actually<00:00:15.059> been<00:00:15.299> familiar<00:00:15.599> with

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
that I've actually been familiar with

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
that I've actually been familiar with
and<00:00:16.230> worked<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.680> heat<00:00:16.859> program<00:00:17.340> since

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
and worked with the heat program since

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.220 
and worked with the heat program since
it<00:00:17.789> began<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.350> 1983<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.730> in<00:00:20.730> my<00:00:21.000> opinion

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
it began in 1983 and in my opinion

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.080 
it began in 1983 and in my opinion
there's<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> better<00:00:22.830> program<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.699> its<00:00:23.850> type

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
there's not a better program of its type

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779 
there's not a better program of its type
out<00:00:24.390> there<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.320> look<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:26.160> things<00:00:26.400> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
out there I like to look for things that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.830 
out there I like to look for things that
give<00:00:27.510> us<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.189> win-win<00:00:29.189> situation<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:30.330> deal<00:00:30.570> with

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
give us a win-win situation to deal with

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.410 
give us a win-win situation to deal with
problems<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.769> challenges<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.669> face<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
problems or challenges that we face and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.229 
problems or challenges that we face and
in<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.140> opinion<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.160> heat<00:00:35.370> program<00:00:35.910> really

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
in my opinion the heat program really

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.500 
in my opinion the heat program really
epitomizes<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.280> we've<00:00:38.280> got<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> program<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
epitomizes that we've got a program that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.340 
epitomizes that we've got a program that
is<00:00:40.040> providing<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.219> public<00:00:41.640> service<00:00:42.350> providing

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
is providing a public service providing

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.160 
is providing a public service providing
a<00:00:43.410> benefit<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> people<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.629> provides

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
a benefit to people in need it provides

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.740 
a benefit to people in need it provides
a<00:00:46.320> mechanism<00:00:46.559> where<00:00:47.280> folks<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:48.239> either

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
a mechanism where folks can make either

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.130 
a mechanism where folks can make either
personal<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:49.739> corporate<00:00:50.309> contributions<00:00:51.140> it

now<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.509> 2008<00:01:19.700> anybody<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> room<00:01:21.150> could

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
now in 2008 anybody in this room could

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.679 
now in 2008 anybody in this room could
be<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.560> situation<00:01:22.799> where<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:24.150> need<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.450> some

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
be in a situation where we need is some

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
be in a situation where we need is some
kind<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.049> help<00:01:25.290> things<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.520> turbulent

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
kind of help things are that turbulent

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.819 
kind of help things are that turbulent
today<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.470> november<00:01:29.400> two<00:01:29.610> thousand<00:01:30.180> eight<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
today in november two thousand eight and

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.120 
today in november two thousand eight and
in<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.150> context<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.350> having<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.680> program

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
in that context I think having a program

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.330 
in that context I think having a program
like<00:01:35.159> heat<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> handout<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
like heat that's not a handout it's a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
like heat that's not a handout it's a
program<00:01:38.790> where<00:01:38.939> we're<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.329> helping

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
program where we're actually helping

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.859 
program where we're actually helping
people<00:01:40.829> providing<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> hand<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.600> will

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
people providing a hand up if you will

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.399 
people providing a hand up if you will
to<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.890> pokes<00:01:44.220> through<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.579> difficult<00:01:44.939> time

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
to get pokes through a difficult time

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
to get pokes through a difficult time
then<00:01:46.409> that's<00:01:47.070> another<00:01:47.340> added<00:01:48.030> benefit<00:01:48.450> for

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
then that's another added benefit for

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.810 
then that's another added benefit for
having<00:01:49.020> something<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.409> our<00:01:49.740> heat<00:01:49.979> program<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
having something like our heat program I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.969 
having something like our heat program I
do<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.250> numbers<00:01:53.250> crunching<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.240> my

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
do a lot of numbers crunching in my

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.760 
do a lot of numbers crunching in my
nine-to-five<00:01:55.979> work<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
nine-to-five work and so I want to to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.149 
nine-to-five work and so I want to to
put<00:01:58.950> some<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.520> perspective<00:02:00.030> an

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
put some of this in perspective an

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.480 
put some of this in perspective an
individual<00:02:02.159> living<00:02:02.880> by<00:02:03.119> his<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.540> herself

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
individual living by his or herself

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.700 
individual living by his or herself
could<00:02:05.490> qualify<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> heat<00:02:06.600> program<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
could qualify for the heat program and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
could qualify for the heat program and
make<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.340> over<00:02:08.640> fifteen<00:02:09.149> thousand<00:02:09.750> dollars

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
