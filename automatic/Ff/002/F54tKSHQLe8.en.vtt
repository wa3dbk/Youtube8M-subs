00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.250
 All Nobody requires Mars to properly train bodybuilding performance 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.529
 you want to get the most out of the body a great friend of it 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.859
 Of course, accepting Cappeln must know when 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.460
 where and which dietary supplements or dietary supplements 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.020
 is used with the optimal success 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.080
 there must be a little system behind the pattern good advice behind 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.970
 stand 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.280
 so that you can get the best results even if now diet supplement 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 Voigt of that, I am a great friend of the year 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.960
 early in the morning 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.830
 first black coffee 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.320
 and 3 liters of mud 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.600
 The corporations are very good preparation that sets the cities free 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 between 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.120
 which are still stored 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.110
 that would have set free in the bloodstream 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710
 as a supplement to this Kanye team 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.840
 if then it would not have been set free it is a very sexy first step 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.800
 done 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.329
 the second step is the 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.460
 that the free fatty acids 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.100
 must be introduced into the cell through the cell membrane and this 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.230
 pretty tight 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.830
 after Cani team in the game I can tell them but the bio carrier 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.050
 the vettel pass through the cell membrane 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.350
 condoling into the cell's power plants in NATO 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.730
 and then always invades so metabolized 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.920
 Coffee so cook for him 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.300
 Leto term 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.230
 Conny team 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.750
 at 18 Remy 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.300
 I always train on an empty stomach 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.670
 because nothing slows down the increase in free fatty acids in the city 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 to the right for just called that 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.170
 there can be no other option there 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.270
 than that the fat gets protected 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.960
 after training, not immediately after training, before showering 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.720
 a high-quality protein concentrate that cools for us that far 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.730
 Rome 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.840
 as I said very quickly 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.790
 in the blood is in the muscle very fast for guidance after about 20 minutes 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.849
 in the first sample you building blocks 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.509
 Tactically present in the blood and went really nicely into the muscle cell 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.869
 Then wait around an hour for oatmeal waffles 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.050
 but over 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.050
 already made what started in Usinger to Ascona yet 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:28.680
 Testers and 2 for me also very good preparation is the past 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.219
 Live a preparation 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.579
 a Tribulus terrestris extract of punching extract for the body's own 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.819
 Hormone levels a judge determines by producing the body's own 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.709
 testosterone production 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.549
 as PÃ¤tzold athlete is just no synthetic testosterone on the plan 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.899
 Come see that you have your own testosterone levels 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.930
 the whole strategy behind it is lifestyle 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.189
 Training us optimized in 1 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.829
 and there it is 5 2 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.749
 Ideally I am a country has two pieces 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.999
 Echings between meals in April found that will work best with me 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.139
 however, there must be groups at mealtimes between meals 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.139
 no free feeling with time also much easier 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.179
 the date 2 and this disproportionate contest 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.569
 just before bed weather still unbearable 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.110
 but it can be made to make patterns by Bastian Kirsch 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.089
 then even with smaller poles 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.859
 - 2009 introduce Amelung 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.189
 under the theme of really good quality protein building blocks confession blood 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.629
 and it saves me so much over the 8 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.509
 What do you have to take for the preparations 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.799
 in the definition phase a build-up phase is different again
