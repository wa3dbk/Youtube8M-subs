00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and I guess it did always exciting when

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.150 
and I guess it did always exciting when
you<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.960> chance<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.380> playing<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> bit<00:00:29.010> more

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you got the chance of playing a bit more

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
you got the chance of playing a bit more
what<00:00:29.340> more<00:00:29.580> likely<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.029> get<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> first<00:00:30.570> team

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
what more likely to get the first team

been<00:00:59.550> working<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.780> PCs<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.410> I'm<00:01:01.739> I

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
been working on it for PCs and I'm I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.439 
been working on it for PCs and I'm I
think<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> first<00:01:02.640> preseason<00:01:03.149> where

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
think this is the first preseason where

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.700 
think this is the first preseason where
I've<00:01:03.510> had<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:04.369> actual<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:07.110> being<00:01:07.380> injured

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
I've had like actual that being injured

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
I've had like actual that being injured
so<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.790> touch<00:01:09.479> wood<00:01:09.689> knocking<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.140> his<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so I think touch wood knocking up his I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
so I think touch wood knocking up his I
can<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.680> learn<00:01:11.040> either<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.090> must<00:01:12.210> get

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
can just learn either and that must get

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.670 
can just learn either and that must get

researched<00:01:47.880> about<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> club<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
researched about the club a little bit I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.219 
researched about the club a little bit I
think<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> wall<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.720> read<00:01:51.960> dance

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
think that's what a wall will read dance

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.840 
think that's what a wall will read dance
I<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.409> researched<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.130> bit<00:01:53.280> about<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> club

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.950 
played in a regular couple of seasons
ago<00:02:26.010> it'd<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.760> good<00:02:26.880> for<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.210> get<00:02:27.330> 30<00:02:27.690> 40

games<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.320> dia<00:02:28.410> beltless<00:02:28.740> yeah<00:02:28.950> yeah<00:02:29.340> yeah

games and dia beltless yeah yeah yeah

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.640 
games and dia beltless yeah yeah yeah
that's<00:02:29.730> what<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.030> think<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:31.170> last<00:02:31.350> time<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.590> did

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that's what I think the last time I did

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.890 
that's what I think the last time I did
that<00:02:31.800> was<00:02:32.100> at<00:02:32.190> Preston<00:02:32.610> sore<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.510> think<00:02:33.720> had

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
that was at Preston sore and I think had

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.720 
that was at Preston sore and I think had
a<00:02:33.930> good<00:02:34.080> season<00:02:34.260> there<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.640> just

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
a good season there so I think it's just

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.600 
a good season there so I think it's just
about<00:02:35.970> getting<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:37.800> good<00:02:38.070> run<00:02:38.250> against

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
about getting that good run against

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.070 
about getting that good run against
might<00:02:38.820> get<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> good<00:02:39.270> run<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.540> games<00:02:39.720> i<00:02:39.870> know<00:02:39.930> i

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
might get a good run of games i know i

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.210 
might get a good run of games i know i
can<00:02:40.200> catch<00:02:41.040> foreman<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.590> obviously<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:44.100> my

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
can catch foreman and obviously do my

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.340 
can catch foreman and obviously do my
best<00:02:44.460> for<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> team<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:44.910> i<00:02:45.360> think<00:02:45.660> that's<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
best for the team so i think that's the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.290 
best for the team so i think that's the
big<00:02:46.770> game<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.130> season<00:02:47.310> yeah<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.850> Anna<00:02:48.120> month

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
big game this season yeah and Anna month

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.699 
big game this season yeah and Anna month
gives<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> good<00:02:48.959> opportunity<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:49.560> your

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
gives you a good opportunity to get your

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.410 
gives you a good opportunity to get your
feet<00:02:49.830> under<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> table<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:50.940> see

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
feet under the table here and then see

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.760 
feet under the table here and then see
how<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.600> goes<00:02:51.720> from<00:02:51.840> there<00:02:51.930> yeah<00:02:52.410> yeah<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> think

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
how it goes from there yeah yeah I think

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.530 
how it goes from there yeah yeah I think
that's<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.130> key<00:02:53.640> thing<00:02:53.670> I've<00:02:54.090> see<00:02:54.300> with

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
that's the key thing I've see with

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.590 
that's the key thing I've see with
Brighton<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.320> well<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:56.670> never<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.209> what<00:02:57.450> can

Brighton as well you never know what can

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.449 
Brighton as well you never know what can
happen<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:58.050> obviously<00:02:58.260> was<00:02:58.650> hard<00:02:59.280> to

happen because obviously was hard to

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.210 
happen because obviously was hard to
push<00:02:59.640> over<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> line<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.740> convince

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
never know what can happen I just me I'm
just<00:03:07.470> focusing<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.100> doing<00:03:08.520> day<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.850> day<00:03:09.030> game

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
just focusing on doing day to day game

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.660 
just focusing on doing day to day game
to<00:03:09.690> game<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.080> see<00:03:11.070> what<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> see<00:03:11.550> what

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
happens from there and I think a lot of

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.600 
happens from there and I think a lot of
reasons<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> be<00:03:13.530> happy<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.280> hear<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.459> because

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
reasons to be happy to hear that because

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.860 
reasons to be happy to hear that because
sometimes<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.269> feeling<00:03:15.450> with<00:03:15.630> loans

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
sometimes you get the feeling with loans

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.420 
sometimes you get the feeling with loans
is<00:03:16.050> kind<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.320> they<00:03:16.470> get<00:03:16.830> sent<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.190> by<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
is kind of they get sent out by the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.740 
is kind of they get sent out by the
clubs<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.790> they're<00:03:17.910> not<00:03:18.030> all<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.330> keen<00:03:18.570> to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
