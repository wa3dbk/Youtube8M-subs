perpetual calendar should do this
automatically<00:00:45.540> my<00:00:46.500> task<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:48.510> develop<00:00:49.470> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

a perpetual calendar it was not easy in
this<00:00:59.190> time<00:00:59.810> beginning<00:01:00.810> the<00:01:01.700> 1980s<00:01:02.700> not<00:01:03.390> easy

it with all tools I had or I had not I
have<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.490> try<00:01:14.820> how<00:01:15.659> could<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
have to try how could I do this in a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.670 
have to try how could I do this in a
race<00:01:19.050> watch<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.890> wanted<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.780> something

production<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.420> perpetual<00:01:57.420> calendar

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
production of this perpetual calendar

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.789 
production of this perpetual calendar
that<00:01:58.560> was<00:01:58.860> never<00:01:59.460> before<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:02.390> got<00:02:03.440> my<00:02:04.440> first

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that was never before so I got my first

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.080 
that was never before so I got my first
ideas<00:02:05.780> how<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.310> change<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.060> date<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.769> of

date hand for the last three days and so

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.240 
date hand for the last three days and so
I<00:02:21.390> had<00:02:21.900> my<00:02:22.140> ideas<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.400> date<00:02:24.090> wheel<00:02:24.590> with<00:02:25.590> surf

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I had my ideas a date wheel with surf

wheel for one step every night and then

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.500 
wheel for one step every night and then
I<00:02:37.860> needed<00:02:38.640> another<00:02:39.540> small<00:02:40.290> level<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:42.150> change

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
I needed another small level to change

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.870 
I needed another small level to change
the<00:02:43.380> date<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.630> from<00:02:45.630> February<00:02:46.730> 28th<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:48.590> 31st

looking<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.580> microscope<00:03:48.170> how<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.380> works

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
looking in the microscope how it works

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.400 
looking in the microscope how it works
and<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:51.060> works<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:52.100> it<00:03:53.100> really<00:03:53.750> changed<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
and it works and it really changed to

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.220 
and it works and it really changed to

1st of March and for me then it was it

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.630 
1st of March and for me then it was it
was<00:04:01.560> one<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:02.360> my<00:04:03.360> happiest<00:04:04.230> days<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:05.300> my<00:04:06.300> life

was one of my happiest days of my life
with<00:04:08.640> this<00:04:08.970> combination<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:11.519> mechanical

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480

movement with a perpetual calendar IWC

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.800 
movement with a perpetual calendar IWC
was<00:04:17.640> able<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.510> give<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.979> wristwatch<00:04:20.810> much

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
was able to give to a wristwatch much

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.570 
was able to give to a wristwatch much
more<00:04:22.340> any<00:04:23.690> quartz<00:04:24.690> watch<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:25.620> give<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.930> so

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
more any quartz watch can give and so

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.010 
more any quartz watch can give and so
the<00:04:30.169> mechanical<00:04:31.169> watch<00:04:31.729> was<00:04:32.729> really<00:04:33.360> the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
the mechanical watch was really the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.620 
the mechanical watch was really the
rhythm<00:04:34.500> in<00:04:34.680> this

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630

possible not to be pushing a lot of

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.080 
possible not to be pushing a lot of
buttons<00:05:24.110> so<00:05:24.320> he<00:05:24.680> just<00:05:24.920> set<00:05:25.190> everything<00:05:25.370> over

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
buttons so he just set everything over

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.880 
buttons so he just set everything over
the<00:05:26.180> crown<00:05:26.420> which<00:05:26.810> means<00:05:27.110> pulling<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.650> stem

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
the crown which means pulling the stem

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.920 
the crown which means pulling the stem
and<00:05:28.100> you<00:05:28.640> can<00:05:28.820> switch<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.360> whole<00:05:29.510> calendar

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
and you can switch the whole calendar

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.350 
and you can switch the whole calendar
and<00:05:30.170> set<00:05:30.350> it<00:05:30.470> over<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.950> crown<00:05:31.330> with<00:05:32.330> the
