00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.879
 Welcome to the mtv channel 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.470
 in this video that won the first video 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.910
 I would like to announce to all 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 the premiere of the channel 's first program 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.960
 what will be called online show that is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.660
 basically a right online talk show in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.100
 that I will call people and I will 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.810
 interview her according to work 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.710
 that they make the debut of this program 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.099
 right 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.400
 the first two interviews I called 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.560
 2,000 tubes that have channels with 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.190
 rare a strategy content of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.829
 Strategy games in Brazil and I 'm going 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.739
 I'm interviewing them and I'm posting the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.770
 interviews on the 15th 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 and July 22, 2015 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.840
 the first is a great club the creix 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 game place he has a great channel 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 I 'm not mistaken one of the biggest 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.320
 Brazil's strategic channels and the second 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.910
 it's not laugh that's a he has a channel 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.460
 new but that it has grown relatively 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 fast with a man with a content of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.170
 quality to debut the video of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.060
 channel debut I'll post one 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.659
 small preview of the interview of the two 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 with the date she's leaving and you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.500
 can watch can watch until the day 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.020
 that it is launched then stick with the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 small preview of the interview of the two 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.520
 and just a few seconds and remember 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.380
 whenever July 15th and July 22nd is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.729
 When will the interview leave? 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.470
 I hope you like the program 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.579
 I hope to see you in the feedback 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.579
 videos and until then 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.960
 Do you have any idea was to have the first 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.790
 contact with pcs even a same contact 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.300
 to catch a fish to fiddle with 13 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.710
 14 years and dies with the internet too 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.500
 it was then 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.180
 before that guy EunÃ­cio sink move on pc 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.270
 Kind of like I've never had contact 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.530
 plague only had a pc actually long ago 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.660
 time ago when I was type was 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.880
 baby although the tac is a danger there 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.910
 inside he burned everything but this is another 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.910
 story 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.190
 I think the Brazilian market for 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.560
 October is very focused on games of 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.800
 first person nÃ© those schutter 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.830
 said koff dante battlefield between 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.590
 other games and some survival is 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.630
 Ranst type this type of game play 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.580
 strategy even though neither I nor we 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.160
 usually do is far more complicated 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.420
 so fewer people appreciate this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.440
 delicacy 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.240
 so remember the 15th and 22nd of July the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.400
 videos will be available from the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.650
 noon I really hope you have 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.940
 I liked the idea of the proposal and has 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.330
 the participation of you 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.330
 until then
