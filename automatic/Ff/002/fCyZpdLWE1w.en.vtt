happened I actually haven't been fishing
since<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.440> last<00:00:07.440> web<00:00:07.740> blog<00:00:07.980> entry<00:00:08.570> so<00:00:09.889> here's

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
since the last web blog entry so here's

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.220 
since the last web blog entry so here's
what<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.490> project<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.420> I'm<00:00:12.660> building<00:00:13.110> this

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
what my project is on I'm building this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.800 
what my project is on I'm building this
rod<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.160> bits<00:00:16.970> to<00:00:17.970> go<00:00:18.090> together<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.690> that

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
rod is the bits to go together and that

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.890 
rod is the bits to go together and that
should<00:00:19.020> eventually<00:00:19.289> make<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:20.210> 9<00:00:21.210> wait<00:00:21.539> fraud

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
should eventually make a 9 wait fraud

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.590 
should eventually make a 9 wait fraud
which<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> bit<00:00:22.890> heavy<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.220> most<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> UK

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
which is a bit heavy for most of the UK

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.109 
which is a bit heavy for most of the UK
fish<00:00:24.840> species<00:00:25.080> maybe<00:00:25.439> pike<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:25.920> something<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
fish species maybe pike or something but

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.009 
fish species maybe pike or something but
I'm<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> use<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.080> sea<00:00:28.890> fishing<00:00:30.019> so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
I'm going to use it for sea fishing so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.250 
I'm going to use it for sea fishing so
the<00:00:31.349> 91<00:00:31.740> should<00:00:32.009> give<00:00:32.219> me<00:00:32.570> hopefully<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.750> little

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the 91 should give me hopefully a little

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.920 
the 91 should give me hopefully a little
bit<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> extra<00:00:35.090> Wingull<00:00:36.090> wangle<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
bit of extra Wingull wangle into the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.229 
bit of extra Wingull wangle into the
wind<00:00:41.660> is<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.930> other<00:00:43.050> bits<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.530> pieces<00:00:44.239> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
wind is the other bits and pieces it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
wind is the other bits and pieces it
seems<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> come<00:00:45.809> fairly<00:00:46.110> complete<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.860> few

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
seems to come fairly complete as a few

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.100 
seems to come fairly complete as a few
odds<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.360> sods<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.870> need<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:50.750> Menem<00:00:51.750> been

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
odds and sods I need to get Menem been

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.660 
odds and sods I need to get Menem been
looking<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> internet<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> find<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.550> how

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
looking on the internet to find out how

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
looking on the internet to find out how
to<00:00:53.730> make<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.390> damn<00:00:54.539> thing<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.050> made<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> rod

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to make the damn thing I made the rod

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
to make the damn thing I made the rod
when<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.250> about<00:00:56.340> um<00:00:59.180> probably<00:01:00.230> 10<00:01:01.230> or

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
when I was about um probably 10 or

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.810 
when I was about um probably 10 or
something<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.640> alone<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:04.580> do<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> little

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
something just alone but do a little

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
something just alone but do a little
better<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.299> time<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.939> document<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
better this time and I just document the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
better this time and I just document the
whole<00:01:10.020> process<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> want<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
whole process so if you want to make a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:25.010 
whole process so if you want to make a
rod<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.750> badly<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.200> me<00:01:13.610> keep<00:01:14.610> watching<00:01:24.020> should

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
rod as badly as me keep watching should

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
rod as badly as me keep watching should
we<00:01:29.240> anyways<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.500> our<00:01:32.490> made<00:01:32.759> little<00:01:33.030> thing

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
we anyways and our made little thing

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
we anyways and our made little thing
attached<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> drill<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.439> dry<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:34.920> he

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
attached to the drill to dry because he

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.039 
attached to the drill to dry because he
would<00:01:35.250> dry<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> rod<00:01:35.820> spinning<00:01:36.299> round<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
would dry the rod spinning round and I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
would dry the rod spinning round and I
think<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.920> been<00:01:38.040> quite<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> lot<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.520> fun<00:01:38.670> also

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
think it's been quite a lot of fun also

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
think it's been quite a lot of fun also
also<00:01:40.320> don't<00:01:41.280> forget<00:01:41.720> I've<00:01:42.720> dug<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> huge<00:01:43.710> pond

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
also don't forget I've dug a huge pond

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.340 
also don't forget I've dug a huge pond

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
should document the rod building i'm

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
should document the rod building i'm
going<00:02:00.479> grayling<00:02:00.899> fishing<00:02:01.259> again<00:02:01.439> hopefully

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
going grayling fishing again hopefully

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.810 
going grayling fishing again hopefully
this<00:02:02.280> time<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.670> more<00:02:02.820> success<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
this time with more success so and and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.429 
this time with more success so and and
i'll<00:02:05.909> show<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> build<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.960> rod<00:02:07.140> really

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
i'll show you how to build a rod really

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.240 
i'll show you how to build a rod really
quite<00:02:07.680> badly<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.830> little<00:02:10.830> white<00:02:10.979> dots

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
quite badly this is a little white dots

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.140 
quite badly this is a little white dots
is<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> spline<00:02:12.060> apparently

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
is a spline apparently

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.089 
is a spline apparently
you<00:02:13.599> put<00:02:13.780> their<00:02:13.930> rings<00:02:14.140> along<00:02:14.470> those<00:02:14.829> that<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
you put their rings along those that you

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.290 
you put their rings along those that you
want<00:02:15.280> dot<00:02:15.689> 12<00:02:16.689> much<00:02:16.870> as<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.110> know
