the size of shadows of evil and he said
that<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.780> bigger<00:01:13.680> than<00:01:14.310> green<00:01:14.729> run<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that it is bigger than green run and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.840 
that it is bigger than green run and
greater<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.140> guys<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> horrible<00:01:17.400> map

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
greater on guys it was a horrible map

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.929 
greater on guys it was a horrible map
right<00:01:18.180> transit<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> horrible<00:01:20.100> horrible

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
right transit it was a horrible horrible

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.890 
right transit it was a horrible horrible
map<00:01:21.590> but<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.950> think<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.759> reason<00:01:23.939> why<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.420> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
map but I think the reason why it was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.310 
map but I think the reason why it was
horrible<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> he<00:01:25.740> talks<00:01:26.009> about<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.520> too<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
horrible and he talks about this too is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
horrible and he talks about this too is
the<00:01:28.320> hardware<00:01:28.979> limitations<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:29.939> had

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the hardware limitations that they had

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
the hardware limitations that they had
with<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> PlayStation<00:01:31.049> 3<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.710> xbox<00:01:32.189> 360

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
with the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
with the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360
it<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.540> wouldn't<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.900> able<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> handle<00:01:34.520> such

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it just wouldn't be able to handle such

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
it just wouldn't be able to handle such
a<00:01:35.549> big<00:01:35.820> map<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.240> why<00:01:36.390> half<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> map<00:01:36.960> has

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
a big map that's why half the map has

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.069 
a big map that's why half the map has
fog<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:39.240> covers<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.689> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
fog on it just because it covers up so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.649 
fog on it just because it covers up so
much<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.590> things<00:01:41.280> left<00:01:41.729> undone<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
crappy so too big of a map and it just

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.370

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
big as green run if not bigger or it's

things everything is playable and that
is<00:02:16.909> absolutely<00:02:17.689> amazing<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.650> really<00:02:18.819> like<00:02:19.819> that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
is absolutely amazing I really like that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.619 
is absolutely amazing I really like that
idea<00:02:20.299> because<00:02:21.170> instead<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.099> having<00:02:22.489> like<00:02:22.879> 75

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
idea because instead of having like 75

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.800 
idea because instead of having like 75
percent<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.140> map<00:02:24.379> just<00:02:24.680> bus<00:02:25.010> routes<00:02:25.370> and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
percent of the map just bus routes and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.059 
percent of the map just bus routes and
lava<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:27.019> can<00:02:27.170> run<00:02:27.319> into<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.739> die<00:02:27.859> in

lava you can run into and die in

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.789 
lava you can run into and die in
denizens<00:02:28.489> attacking<00:02:28.939> you<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.329> have<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.049> zombie

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
denizens attacking you you have a zombie

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.039 
denizens attacking you you have a zombie
map<00:02:31.040> like<00:02:31.579> a<00:02:31.609> zombie<00:02:32.329> map<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.900> can

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
map like a zombie map that you can

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.399 
map like a zombie map that you can
actually<00:02:33.400> explore<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.760> it's<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.510> size<00:02:35.900> or

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
actually explore and it's the size or

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.640 
actually explore and it's the size or
it's<00:02:36.680> bigger<00:02:37.310> than<00:02:37.489> green<00:02:38.060> run<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.620> a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
it's bigger than green run and that is a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.369 
it's bigger than green run and that is a
good<00:02:39.859> idea<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.700> right<00:02:40.970> there<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:41.540> think<00:02:42.230> is

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
good idea that right there I think is

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.399 
good idea that right there I think is
going<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.889> be<00:02:43.010> awesome<00:02:43.219> you<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.170> map<00:02:45.379> is

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
going to be awesome you if the map is

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.679 
going to be awesome you if the map is
that<00:02:45.950> big<00:02:46.310> no<00:02:46.549> wonder<00:02:46.879> we<00:02:47.030> didn't<00:02:47.269> see<00:02:47.450> any

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 
that big no wonder we didn't see any

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.800 
that big no wonder we didn't see any
perks<00:02:48.139> and<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.709> zombies<00:02:49.040> trailer<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.939> map<00:02:50.780> that

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
perks and the zombies trailer a map that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.920 
perks and the zombies trailer a map that
size<00:02:51.530> things<00:02:52.459> can<00:02:52.760> really<00:02:52.790> be<00:02:53.480> spread<00:02:53.900> out

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
size things can really be spread out

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.619 
size things can really be spread out
each<00:02:54.290> section<00:02:55.040> being<00:02:55.250> its<00:02:55.400> own<00:02:55.669> unique<00:02:56.060> thing

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
each section being its own unique thing

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.770 
each section being its own unique thing
and<00:02:57.010> I'm<00:02:58.010> really<00:02:58.609> excited<00:02:59.030> about<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.569> map

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
and I'm really excited about this map

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.080 
and I'm really excited about this map
just<00:03:00.079> because<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:00.950> bigger<00:03:01.250> than<00:03:01.669> Korean

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
just because it is bigger than Korean

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.030 
just because it is bigger than Korean
are<00:03:02.239> now<00:03:02.359> you're<00:03:02.510> thinking<00:03:02.930> well<00:03:03.079> if<00:03:03.260> green

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
are now you're thinking well if green

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.490 
are now you're thinking well if green
run<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.579> you<00:03:05.269> know<00:03:05.329> green<00:03:05.569> ones<00:03:05.780> pretty<00:03:06.109> huge

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
run is you know green ones pretty huge

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.920 
run is you know green ones pretty huge
we<00:03:06.680> don't<00:03:06.829> want<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.099> map<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.730> big<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.269> if<00:03:08.450> you

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
we don't want to map that big and if you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.170 
we don't want to map that big and if you
actually<00:03:09.169> think<00:03:09.650> about<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.159> guys<00:03:10.310> green<00:03:10.970> run

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
actually think about it guys green run

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.229 
actually think about it guys green run
really<00:03:11.659> wasn't<00:03:12.079> that<00:03:12.200> big<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.680> had<00:03:12.889> the<00:03:13.700> diner

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
really wasn't that big you had the diner

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.740 
really wasn't that big you had the diner
you<00:03:14.989> had<00:03:15.260> town<00:03:15.739> farm<00:03:16.340> bus<00:03:16.819> depot<00:03:17.269> he<00:03:17.540> had<00:03:17.659> that

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
you had town farm bus depot he had that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.879 
you had town farm bus depot he had that
m16<00:03:18.560> area<00:03:18.979> and<00:03:19.310> other<00:03:20.150> than<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
m16 area and other than that that the

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.000 
m16 area and other than that that the
rest<00:03:22.159> of<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> map<00:03:22.609> was<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.419> bus<00:03:24.379> route<00:03:24.739> and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
rest of the map was just bus route and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.430 
rest of the map was just bus route and
it<00:03:25.190> was<00:03:25.340> just<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.879> was<00:03:25.909> very<00:03:26.209> linear<00:03:26.690> linear<00:03:27.079> it

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
it was just it was very linear linear it

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.990 
it was just it was very linear linear it
wasn't<00:03:27.799> like<00:03:27.919> you<00:03:28.040> go<00:03:28.220> left<00:03:28.489> he<00:03:28.729> could<00:03:28.879> go

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
wasn't like you go left he could go

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.449 
wasn't like you go left he could go
right<00:03:29.269> no<00:03:29.750> not<00:03:30.319> really<00:03:30.620> except<00:03:31.040> for<00:03:31.220> like<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
right no not really except for like the

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.360 
right no not really except for like the
cornfield<00:03:31.970> where<00:03:32.180> notch<00:03:32.419> was<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:34.010> other<00:03:34.159> than

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
cornfield where notch was and other than

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.969 
cornfield where notch was and other than
that<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.760> was<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.879> pretty<00:03:35.209> linear<00:03:35.540> map<00:03:35.989> walk

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:36.979 
that it was a pretty linear map walk

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:38.379 
that it was a pretty linear map walk
with<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.220> best<00:03:37.400> routes<00:03:37.639> and<00:03:37.790> everything<00:03:38.150> so

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
with the best routes and everything so

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.439 
with the best routes and everything so
if<00:03:39.109> you<00:03:39.260> got<00:03:39.379> to<00:03:39.500> put<00:03:39.739> that<00:03:39.829> all<00:03:40.010> together

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
if you got to put that all together

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.439 
if you got to put that all together
really<00:03:41.449> it's<00:03:41.720> not<00:03:42.229> that<00:03:42.590> big<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.790> map<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.030> I'm

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
really it's not that big of a map so I'm

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.729 
really it's not that big of a map so I'm
not<00:03:44.659> really<00:03:44.720> worried<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.290> it's<00:03:45.470> going<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.680> be

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
not really worried that it's going to be

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.920 
not really worried that it's going to be
too<00:03:46.040> big<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.549> think<00:03:47.419> it's<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.690> going<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.840> be

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
too big I think it's just going to be

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.800 
too big I think it's just going to be
the<00:03:48.199> perfect<00:03:48.530> size<00:03:49.010> for<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.489> zombie<00:03:49.940> map<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.479> I
