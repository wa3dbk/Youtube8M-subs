get involved in the weight yeah if
you're<00:02:00.340> trying<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.759> that's<00:02:01.060> what<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.869> want

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
you're trying to that's what you want

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.540 
you're trying to that's what you want
they<00:02:02.320> I'm<00:02:02.440> trying<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:02.890> was<00:02:03.100> like<00:02:03.280> being<00:02:03.460> a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
they I'm trying this was like being a

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.190 
they I'm trying this was like being a
lineman<00:02:03.759> than<00:02:04.060> football<00:02:04.270> exactly<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.080> that's

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
lineman than football exactly and that's

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.050 
lineman than football exactly and that's
why<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.680> is<00:02:05.920> that's<00:02:06.250> why<00:02:06.399> those<00:02:06.580> guys<00:02:06.790> can

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
why that is that's why those guys can

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.240 
why that is that's why those guys can
move<00:02:07.270> credible<00:02:08.229> among<00:02:08.470> ways<00:02:08.739> because<00:02:09.100> they're

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
move credible among ways because they're

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.240 
move credible among ways because they're
getting<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.780> bigger<00:02:11.110> muscles<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.100> body

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
getting the bigger muscles of the body

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.760 
getting the bigger muscles of the body
involved<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.239> getting<00:02:13.870> applying<00:02:14.590> it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
involved in it and getting applying it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.559 
involved in it and getting applying it
to<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.980> bar<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.520> let's<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.150> clear<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.510> not

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
to the bar so let's be clear it's not

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.270 
to the bar so let's be clear it's not

question on so now that's a bodybuilder

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.380 
question on so now that's a bodybuilder
training<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.280> competition<00:02:33.850> how<00:02:34.000> much<00:02:34.180> would

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
training for competition how much would

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.449 
training for competition how much would
you<00:02:34.420> use<00:02:34.660> relatively<00:02:35.260> speaking<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:35.890> rents<00:02:36.160> I

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
you use relatively speaking for rents I

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.259 
you use relatively speaking for rents I
were<00:02:37.239> able<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.510> go<00:02:37.720> over<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.950> plates<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.880> n<00:02:39.970> to

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
were able to go over to plates to n to

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.360 
were able to go over to plates to n to
25<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:40.989> there<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.230> go<00:02:41.410> yeah<00:02:41.800> for<00:02:42.069> maybe<00:02:42.250> like

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
25 so there you go yeah for maybe like

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.430 
25 so there you go yeah for maybe like
the<00:02:42.670> hint<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.000> heavy<00:02:43.269> assets<00:02:43.630> maybe<00:02:43.989> beat<00:02:44.260> you

the hint is heavy assets maybe beat you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.500 
the hint is heavy assets maybe beat you
in<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.620> corner<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.850> used<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.120> do<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.450> for

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
in the corner and I used to do that for

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.199 
in the corner and I used to do that for

remember again the whole point of what

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.150 
remember again the whole point of what
we're<00:02:51.940> doing<00:02:52.329> on<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.930> able<00:02:53.470> body<00:02:53.650> experts

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
we're doing on the able body experts

body or affecting the muscles so the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.910 
body or affecting the muscles so the
innervation<00:02:58.150> training<00:02:58.810> methodology<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.860> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
innervation training methodology is a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.530 
innervation training methodology is a
different<00:03:00.400> mode<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.549> thinking<00:03:00.880> you're<00:03:01.510> not

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
different mode of thinking you're not

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.900 
different mode of thinking you're not
swatting<00:03:02.260> or<00:03:02.440> mentioned<00:03:02.890> because<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
swatting or mentioned because of the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.240 
swatting or mentioned because of the
lift<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:05.049> should<00:03:05.230> want<00:03:05.410> intervention<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
lift you should want intervention to

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.880 
lift you should want intervention to
work<00:03:06.549> target<00:03:07.360> train<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> muscle<00:03:08.170> group<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.650> in

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
work target train a muscle group and in

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.770 
work target train a muscle group and in
this<00:03:09.040> case<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.700> legs<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.329> we<00:03:10.480> want<00:03:10.690> to

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
this case it's the legs so we want to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.569 
this case it's the legs so we want to
remove<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.320> hips<00:03:11.560> from<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:11.980> movement<00:03:12.430> so

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
remove the hips from that movement so

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.069 
remove the hips from that movement so
you're<00:03:13.150> going<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.360> train<00:03:13.570> with<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.810> lot<00:03:14.049> less

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
you're going to train with a lot less

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.349 
you're going to train with a lot less
weight<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.560> get<00:03:14.859> a<00:03:14.890> lot<00:03:15.100> more<00:03:15.130> out<00:03:15.340> of<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
weight and get a lot more out of it and

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.049 
weight and get a lot more out of it and
just<00:03:16.540> has<00:03:16.690> been<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> coach
