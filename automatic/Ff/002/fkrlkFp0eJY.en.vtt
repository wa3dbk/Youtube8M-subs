this<00:00:12.860> video<00:00:13.160> is<00:00:13.280> going<00:00:13.430> to<00:00:13.520> be<00:00:13.580> addressing

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
this video is going to be addressing

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.300 
this video is going to be addressing
polystrate<00:00:14.510> fossils<00:00:15.050> and<00:00:15.380> moon<00:00:15.740> dust<00:00:15.980> which

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
polystrate fossils and moon dust which

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.490 
polystrate fossils and moon dust which
are<00:00:16.460> two<00:00:16.580> popular<00:00:17.000> creationist<00:00:17.510> claims<00:00:17.750> now

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
are two popular creationist claims now

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.830 
are two popular creationist claims now
polystrate<00:00:18.950> fossils<00:00:19.490> are<00:00:19.790> trees<00:00:20.360> that<00:00:20.390> are

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
polystrate fossils are trees that are

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.030 
polystrate fossils are trees that are
found<00:00:21.110> going<00:00:21.560> through<00:00:21.770> several

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040

fossil record there completely

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.640 
fossil record there completely
fossilized<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:26.900> they<00:00:26.989> are<00:00:27.050> vertical<00:00:27.259> in

fossilized and they are vertical in

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.560 
fossilized and they are vertical in
creationists<00:00:28.130> claim<00:00:28.160> well<00:00:28.550> if<00:00:28.669> these<00:00:28.820> layers

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
creationists claim well if these layers

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.050 
creationists claim well if these layers
are<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:30.079> different<00:00:30.829> dates<00:00:31.099> millions<00:00:31.640> of<00:00:31.790> years

are of different dates millions of years

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.580 
are of different dates millions of years
then<00:00:32.540> that<00:00:32.570> would<00:00:32.810> require<00:00:32.930> these<00:00:33.320> trees

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
then that would require these trees

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.319 
then that would require these trees
being<00:00:33.829> exposed<00:00:34.220> upright<00:00:34.790> for<00:00:34.970> millions<00:00:35.270> of

the<00:00:48.170> same<00:00:48.440> date<00:00:49.329> this<00:00:50.329> is<00:00:50.480> a<00:00:50.510> distinction<00:00:51.019> that

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
the same date this is a distinction that

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.380 
the same date this is a distinction that
is<00:00:51.440> best<00:00:51.679> illustrated<00:00:52.190> by<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:52.519> image<00:00:53.149> right

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
is best illustrated by this image right

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.529 
is best illustrated by this image right
here<00:00:53.620> on<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.739> left<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.070> can<00:00:55.280> see<00:00:55.550> what

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
here on the left you can see what

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.880 
here on the left you can see what
creationists<00:00:56.809> are<00:00:57.170> claiming<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.679> what<00:00:57.769> they

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
creationists are claiming and what they

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.500 
creationists are claiming and what they
believe<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.519> is<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.910> on<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.059> right<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.420> can

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
believe it is and on the right you can

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.560 
believe it is and on the right you can
see<00:00:59.719> exactly<00:01:00.050> what<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.530> is

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
see exactly what it is

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.910 
see exactly what it is
basically<00:01:02.570> what<00:01:02.780> happens<00:01:03.079> is<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.289> tree<00:01:03.649> and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
basically what happens is a tree and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.590 
basically what happens is a tree and
some<00:01:04.280> sort<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.519> depression<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.150> valley<00:01:05.330> for

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
some sort of depression in a valley for

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.110 
some sort of depression in a valley for
example<00:01:06.050> there's<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.710> flood<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.580> gets<00:01:07.790> covered

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
example there's a flood it gets covered

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.060 
example there's a flood it gets covered
in<00:01:08.210> debris<00:01:08.330> like<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.900> mudslide<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.860> tree

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
in debris like in a mudslide the tree

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.190 
in debris like in a mudslide the tree
fossilizes<00:01:10.580> now<00:01:11.240> all<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.600> mud<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:11.990> not<00:01:12.170> a

dealing with constant rates such as
let's<00:01:21.800> say<00:01:21.950> there<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.160> moon<00:01:22.610> dust<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.210> known

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
let's say there that moon dust is known

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.330 
let's say there that moon dust is known
to<00:01:23.510> accumulate<00:01:23.990> on<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.230> moon<00:01:24.380> at<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:25.100> rate<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
to accumulate on the moon at a rate of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.470 
to accumulate on the moon at a rate of
10<00:01:26.240> feet<00:01:26.510> per<00:01:26.990> X<00:01:27.350> years<00:01:27.710> there<00:01:28.400> are<00:01:28.580> only<00:01:28.730> 200

10 feet per X years there are only 200

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.120 
10 feet per X years there are only 200
feet<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.810> moon<00:01:30.020> dust<00:01:30.050> on<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.530> surface<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:30.980> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.190 
sense of it could have just started
depositing<00:01:49.790> within<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.060> past<00:01:50.240> 50<00:01:50.630> years<00:01:50.660> or

it could have also changed in the past
it<00:01:54.350> could've<00:01:54.500> been<00:01:54.530> much<00:01:54.740> less<00:01:54.980> in<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.190> past

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
it could've been much less in the past

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.310 
it could've been much less in the past
or<00:01:56.000> something<00:01:56.330> else<00:01:56.600> could<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.870> happened<00:01:57.200> to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
or something else could have happened to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.770 
or something else could have happened to
have<00:01:57.500> solidified<00:01:57.980> it<00:01:58.370> blown<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.790> away<00:01:58.880> etc

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
have solidified it blown it away etc

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.170 
have solidified it blown it away etc
basically<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:00.740> assuming<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:02.000> at<00:02:02.120> a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
basically it's assuming that it is at a

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.930 
basically it's assuming that it is at a
constant<00:02:02.450> rate<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> fundamental

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
constant rate and that is a fundamental

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.250 
constant rate and that is a fundamental
problem<00:02:04.940> with<00:02:05.060> all<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.480> these<00:02:05.630> arguments<00:02:05.960> in

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
problem with all of these arguments in

problem with all of these arguments in
all<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.500> their<00:02:06.650> variations<00:02:07.840> thanks<00:02:08.840> for

all of their variations thanks for
watching<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.440> here<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.739> your<00:02:10.129> moment<00:02:10.190> of
