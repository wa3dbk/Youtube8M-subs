00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.949
 welcome to water skateing lab 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:26.509
 today a new tutorial on moore seri e 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.470
 on the care and management of fry 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.929
 speaking of a nursery a premise 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.230
 the choice of having one is fundamental 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.780
 nursery or not because some of us 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.170
 they prefer not to spin their own 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 dedicated nursery fish but keep the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 mother and then the vanotti who succeed in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.999
 survive directly in the aquarium 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.980
 now this is possible only if you have 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.559
 very well planted aquariums where 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 there are many more places where the vanotti 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.909
 they can be hidden 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.460
 often this method gives good results 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.589
 and in any case a natural method that is the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.420
 nature takes its course and vanotti 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.579
 those stronger and smarter manage to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.210
 survive others not for how much 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:14.369
 concerns serious news in the technical sense 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 of the word we go different 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.079
 types 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.780
 the first is in plastic with a separator 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.790
 which allows the mother to stay 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 separated once it has given birth to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.689
 children who go down by force 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.810
 of gravity 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.650
 another is the nursery in very knitwear 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.750
 fitte supported by a 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.910
 the dark plastic standard that yes 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.850
 hooks directly to the burgundy 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.800
 aquarium and it is very good because 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.350
 the water filters very well otherwise moore 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.350
 external series ie nursery completely 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.150
 detached from our aquarium where 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.990
 we can have our fish reproduced 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.810
 in a completely autonomous manner 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.590
 this is a floating nursery with 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.190
 separator is useful in the case of fish 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.500
 live even because it allows you to separate the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.720
 mom giving birth to live freaks from 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 precisely his children who by force of 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.530
 gravity go down 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.280
 as you can see, insert the separator e 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.280
 then the cap 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.080
 This is a nursery in a mesh 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.510
 very thick and plastic armor yes 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.030
 hooks directly to our aquarium 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.610
 at the edge of our aquarium and serves 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.540
 especially for fish reproduction 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.540
 oviparous 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.900
 then we will go thanks to a screen a 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.659
 fine meshes to take night lever 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.409
 just closed by the place and to place them in 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:50.739
 this small tub mesh tub 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.049
 very thick that will not therefore contain 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.340
 that can escape 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.769
 reminding us that this kind of nursery 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.290
 it is very practical because it has a very good quality 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.200
 oxygenation 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.540
 if instead you need not to keep 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.769
 you are not inside your aquarium but 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.500
 to have external support 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.049
 we recommend using a tub of 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.039
 small size like our water 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.750
 skating club tank this one 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:26.260
 sizes are small we recommend 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.479
 not to set this up particularly 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.340
 tub just a light layer of 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.099
 very fine sand 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.690
 but remember a heater a 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:40.060
 filter is a lamp from this moment 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.070
 when you entered into the night in the 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.320
 your luzzeri will be your task 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.419
 feed them water feed 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.729
 specific you find of yours from 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.620
 your water trusted list or with 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.229
 of the simple eat puts of fish more 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.000
 large but pulverized 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.699
 obviously our solutions are only 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.860
 provisional according to common sense 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.380
 when your hands have grown 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.960
 after a month a month and a half is now not 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.610
 they are more an easy prey for yours 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.889
 bigger fish 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.260
 you take care of transferring them from 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.669
 nursery at your aquarium for how much 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.590
 concerns the childhood of our fish 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.080
 we have exhausted the topic 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.449
 obviously for all the features 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.789
 more fish cures and specifications 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.669
 great I refer you to this video thanks 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.950
 for having been with us on some clubs 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.440
 put me like subscribe to ours 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.800
 channel and thanks to all of us at some 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.800
 more lab 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.069
