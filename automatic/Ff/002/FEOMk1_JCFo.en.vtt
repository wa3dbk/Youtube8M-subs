me to earth it's basically a 3d map of
the<00:00:15.839> earth<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.349> you<00:00:16.950> can<00:00:17.099> navigate<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.790> simply

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the earth and you can navigate it simply

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.850 
the earth and you can navigate it simply
by<00:00:18.450> touching<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> screen<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.380> your<00:00:19.470> finger

hurricane which is crossing the Gulf we
can<00:01:02.120> zoom<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> little<00:01:03.479> further<00:01:03.860> we<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.010> add

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
can zoom in a little further we can add

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.500 
can zoom in a little further we can add
further<00:01:06.030> information<00:01:06.780> such<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.050> radar<00:01:07.620> data

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
zoom in a little bit more to get the big

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.390 
zoom in a little bit more to get the big
picture<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.380> point<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.040> time<00:01:14.220> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
picture and at this point in time you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.300 
picture and at this point in time you
might<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.730> to<00:01:14.910> stop<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> animation<00:01:16.310> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
might like to stop the animation in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
might like to stop the animation in
order<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.910> focus<00:01:18.120> on<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> particular<00:01:18.840> point<00:01:19.380> in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
order to focus on a particular point in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.390 
order to focus on a particular point in
time<00:01:20.450> which<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.960> simply<00:01:22.320> by<00:01:22.500> moving

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
time which you can do simply by moving

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.630 
time which you can do simply by moving
this<00:01:23.670> slider<00:01:23.730> at<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.570> bottom<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> screen

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
this slider at the bottom of the screen

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
this slider at the bottom of the screen
so<00:01:26.640> perhaps<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> point<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.410> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so perhaps this is the point that you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.880 
so perhaps this is the point that you
would<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:28.830> show<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.580> detail<00:01:30.890> we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
would like to show in more detail we

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.400 
would like to show in more detail we
have<00:01:32.190> a<00:01:32.670> drawing<00:01:33.150> tool<00:01:33.480> within<00:01:33.750> meteor<00:01:34.200> earth

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
have a drawing tool within meteor earth

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.680 
have a drawing tool within meteor earth
which<00:01:34.830> allows<00:01:35.160> us<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.700> highlight<00:01:36.180> particular

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
which allows us to highlight particular

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.780 
which allows us to highlight particular
meteorological<00:01:37.620> elements<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.370> case<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
meteorological elements in this case the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.270 
meteorological elements in this case the
hurricane<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:40.140> could<00:01:40.350> draw<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.620> circle<00:01:41.160> around

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
hurricane we could draw a circle around

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
hurricane we could draw a circle around
it<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:44.270> then<00:01:45.270> coming<00:01:46.080> back<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.230> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it like this and then coming back to the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
it like this and then coming back to the
navigation<00:01:47.010> we<00:01:47.160> can<00:01:47.340> move<00:01:47.550> that<00:01:47.820> circle<00:01:48.270> right

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
navigation we can move that circle right

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.940 
navigation we can move that circle right
across<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.990> Europe<00:01:50.780> place<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.050> over<00:01:52.260> the
