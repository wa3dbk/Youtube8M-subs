the customer service industry take
Disney<00:04:12.750> for<00:04:12.930> example<00:04:13.669> you<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:15.090> employees<00:04:15.750> are

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
Disney for example you the employees are

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.949 
Disney for example you the employees are
empowered<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.889> handle<00:04:17.519> situations<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.720> in

empowered to handle situations and in

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.509 
empowered to handle situations and in

this case in a salon we kind of

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.339 
this case in a salon we kind of
transferred<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.479> system<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.109> salon

transferred the system to the salon

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.100 
transferred the system to the salon
industry<00:04:22.529> so<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.820> client<00:04:24.300> recovery<00:04:24.719> system
