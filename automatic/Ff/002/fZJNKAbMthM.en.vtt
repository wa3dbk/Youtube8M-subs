00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.910
 the microphone has no normal appearance and 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.590
 plus more with studying for a couple how can it be 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.300

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.570
 I want it just to go to sleep on the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.630

 about this game or what falls on those 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.430
 or other sites yes that is, but I think 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.610
 that probably random to people for 20 rubles 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.380

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.899

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 200 rubles deed promise us that will fall out 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.730

 cheers on the dollar rising 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.060
 let's start steam rand account 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.490
 By the way, plus I still have some 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.320
 the sponsor who offered me a 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.140
 he initially wanted me to 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.080
 played all the keys of us and on the stream 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.209
 i'm streaming we buy these random 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.570
 the keys and I enter who is first here 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.640
 will get that will get the game but still i 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.310
 decided to scatter it a little bit 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.890
 have him be a sponsor to some 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.990
 here's a contest of such here I am there 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.160
 I will catch a glimpse of PR, that is, new ones there 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.050
 not at the beginning of the video where the thread in 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.430
 comments group so on by the way on 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.700
 groups too subscribe link in 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.510
 description but in general let's start and here 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.600
 key for 24 rubles is really only one 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.060
 once I bought a random key, as if by myself 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.070
 she does not buy the most man with the contest 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.350
 as if the winner distributes them himself 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.930
 chooses the results of the competition in the group by the way 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.310
 you have a promotional code means you can 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.290
 I don't have to buy goods cheaper 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.290
 promo code continue 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.400
 and doing the last time I bought by 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.959
 my on the same site I am in these sites 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.870
 I did not disassemble I just sang in Yandex 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.000
 such as a random keys well to me this one 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.910
 fell out 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.450
 so for the guy I bought clavicle 15 rubles 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.440
 and I fell mortal kombat collection 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.870
 but in my opinion for 15 rubles not bad so 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.239
 Now I'm probably the screen is darker 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.099
 because I still don't want the police. 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.040
 I think it turned out the only one 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.120
 minus 3 is not something for some reason this time 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.480
 buying this key and fucking is very difficult 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.370
 just unrealistic stsuko river steps 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.680
 fucked up and fell 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.959
 I finally finished dear friends all 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.419
 The problem with this scheme is that it is creepy 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.310
 not automated that is a lot 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.320
 extra action last time was all 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.300
 much easier for some reason the game immediately 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.770
 I was in the incentive now me 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.669
 had to restart 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.270
 and through some person you want to 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.800
 mail is very difficult and for 24 rubles to me 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.289
 a pile fell out 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.440
 Ultimate my m and lizard did not play it and 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.740
 late see the approximate gameplay of this 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.130
 games
