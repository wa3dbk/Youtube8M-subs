pistons<00:02:59.569> you'll<00:03:00.569> need<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.260> sticky<00:03:01.769> pistons

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.339 

one<00:03:07.170> more<00:03:10.069> so<00:03:11.069> if<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.459> use<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.730> one<00:03:12.510> sub<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
one more so if you use the one sub and

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.729 
one more so if you use the one sub and
for<00:03:14.040> sticky<00:03:14.340> pistons<00:03:14.819> you'll<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.420> for

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
for sticky pistons you'll get for

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.960 
for sticky pistons you'll get for
regular<00:03:16.739> Pistons<00:03:17.190> back<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:19.579> also<00:03:20.579> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
regular Pistons back and also the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.629 
regular Pistons back and also the
composite<00:03:21.870> bow<00:03:22.019> now<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.220> drawback

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
composite bow now have the drawback

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.339 
composite bow now have the drawback
effect<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.750> Miami<00:03:25.319> profitable<00:03:25.950> heads

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
effect that the Miami profitable heads

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.119 
effect that the Miami profitable heads
so<00:03:28.349> it's<00:03:28.440> walking<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.949> same<00:03:29.160> way<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.709> it's

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
so it's walking the same way and it's

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.039 
so it's walking the same way and it's
still<00:03:32.430> more<00:03:32.940> powerful<00:03:34.819> anyway<00:03:35.819> I'll<00:03:36.510> make<00:03:37.019> a

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
still more powerful anyway I'll make a

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.740 
still more powerful anyway I'll make a
more<00:03:37.440> in-depth<00:03:37.829> video<00:03:38.160> about<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.699> very<00:03:39.510> block

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
more in-depth video about the very block

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.849 
more in-depth video about the very block
later<00:03:40.199> and<00:03:41.660> until<00:03:42.660> then<00:03:42.870> hope<00:03:43.349> you<00:03:43.530> enjoyed

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
later and until then hope you enjoyed

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.329 
later and until then hope you enjoyed
the<00:03:44.010> video<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.549> I'll<00:03:44.819> see<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.090> soon
