 banana at a time we're also going to 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.140
 use the oats that they see is a 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.720
 cereal that is also very good and of 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.910
 for the oven it can be by the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.520
 microwave that greased the animal 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.840
 to do is to first place a portion 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.560
 banana 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.859
 because as you can see they are not going to put the money 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.869
 the first thing as you go after putting the 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:59.979
 banana to apply a few pieces of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.979
 pear bits 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.320
 and as you see 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:16.450
 and finally you are going to add others 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.129
 and even then 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.620
 you have an oatmeal that can be 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.510
 an oatmeal 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.209
