by a lot or with their riders like I
said<00:02:46.360> without<00:02:46.450> him<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.810> thought<00:02:46.930> they're<00:02:47.140> still

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
said without him I thought they're still

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.080 
said without him I thought they're still
gonna<00:02:47.470> win<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:48.310> they<00:02:48.400> played<00:02:48.670> tough<00:02:48.910> they

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
gonna win but they played tough they

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.089 
gonna win but they played tough they
showed<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.599> without<00:02:49.959> them<00:02:50.170> they<00:02:50.590> might<00:02:50.739> lost

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
showed that without them they might lost

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.059 
showed that without them they might lost
but<00:02:52.060> they<00:02:52.450> came<00:02:52.810> out<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.079> wire<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.950> was

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
but they came out of the wire and it was

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.259 
but they came out of the wire and it was
a<00:02:54.130> good<00:02:54.250> season<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> Bears<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.120> other

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
a good season for the Bears the other

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.300 
a good season for the Bears the other
defense<00:02:55.569> wasn't<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:55.900> great<00:02:56.049> but<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:56.860> still

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
defense wasn't so great but I still

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.380 
defense wasn't so great but I still
think<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.610> good<00:02:57.760> season<00:02:57.940> but<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.269> know

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
think it's a good season but I know

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.569 
think it's a good season but I know
Bears<00:02:58.629> fans<00:02:58.900> won't<00:02:59.049> think<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.349> but<00:02:59.799> I<00:03:00.010> still

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
Bears fans won't think so but I still

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.369 
Bears fans won't think so but I still
think<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.910> good<00:03:01.060> team<00:03:01.329> and<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.930> came<00:03:02.110> down<00:03:02.260> to

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
think a good team and it came down to

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.559 
think a good team and it came down to
that's<00:03:02.709> why<00:03:02.860> football<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.760> best<00:03:04.060> sport<00:03:04.360> in

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
that's why football is the best sport in

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.949 
that's why football is the best sport in
America<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:06.370> like<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.700> said<00:03:06.849> Jay<00:03:07.390> Cutler<00:03:07.750> had<00:03:07.930> a

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
America but like I said Jay Cutler had a

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.479
