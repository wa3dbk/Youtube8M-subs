00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.210
 Good morning, people. I'm him. 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.150
 I'm here doing a cooler box 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.799
 master running right is a power that already 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.160
 not new in the alcohol market 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.800
 summit launched in 2011 already has a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990
 Time has gone by now but you can 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.230
 one of them was to make the exchange 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 My grandson currently uses this one. 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.260
 Also from codemasters ta is a 3 x 3 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.320
 It is a good simple course for those who do not 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.640
 want to overclock is a good option 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 Okay, he's got a 90mm fan. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.420
 so it 's a good fan I can not say 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.840
 I can claim it okay 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.449
 he is an excellent keeper 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.870
 I use it is not mt is 65 and it has gone up 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.420
 the need is good, right? 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.439
 my region is very hot and it is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.030
 that he has managed to do what he is 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.360
 he must maintain the temperature of the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 stable processor body is good now 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.790
 with the acquisition of this new one I hope to have 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.970
 the possibility who knows how to try 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.479
 an obvious nÃ© my processor since 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.909
 bet also old mt is not so 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.250
 so the processor is a phenom 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.259
 ii x4 965 but it is well recognized 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.570
 because he can do good vers 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.650
 and here we will make the opening a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.220
 This new box is taking care of my body. 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.290
 processor, let's see what you have to have 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.810
 The box you see is a box 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.450
 cardboard, there is nothing 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 novelty in it is normal common material 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.470
 with the side processor features 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.830
 is also behind some data 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.930
 and then we'll know 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.430
 that the right product 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.430
 Let's get out of the box. 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.319
 well here it is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.269
 see if he had a sink 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.260
 heat of 120 mm 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:36.260
 so it's pretty big and pretty powerful 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.340
 get here for you if you see 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.849
 the basic difference of a roll for the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:49.669
 other is to see the size of them is quite 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:52.579
 great we have here the best my old 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:55.760
 that proportionally 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.699
 it has a difference size 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.449
 the main difference that for me is 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:05.629
 The essential non-heat sink is the 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:07.340
 surface that have direct contact 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.709
 with processor 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.680
 see here that the surface is 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.549
 all-copper with no 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 indentation of different metal zinha 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.060
 that these three of land in trance of 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.729
 metal 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.919
 the contact of which will be totally in 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:27.439
 the top of the processor thus improving 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.409
 then the heat dissipation says see 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.209
 he is with 47 pipiens who have connection 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.329
 directly with the processor all 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.150
 four aspects processor the heatsink 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.810
 it's a reasonable size, right? 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.019
 see he's really big he's got a 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.150
 excellent choose a funk servant goes 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.159
 venting this processor from this 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.519
 sink it is an interesting format 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:58.370
 different reason they are 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.729
 they are tony adams to do with 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.199
 the better population inside the processor 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:05.479
 and now in the box and we'll see what's coming 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.370
 with the box on a piece of paper here 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.980
 I do not know who it is 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.720
 Here are the escalation adapters 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:19.530
 it on the basis of computer screws 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.400
 in x everything here so you can make the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.630
 installation 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.600
 ok every side of the box we have one 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.060
 how are you with your 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:38.010
 close attack facility 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:41.460
 explaining how you're going to do it here 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.729
 behind the box provides an adapter that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.870
 you go to cross the motherboard and do 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.940
 his installation 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.139
 ok, quite simple, nothing much 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.880
 it has a special surface for 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.400
 you can make contact with the motherboard 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.680
 so it will not spoil 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:05.720
 check opening the small package where they come 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.720
 the screws and species 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:22.139
 let's get inside screws 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:27.870
 fix the plate damage on x for you 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:35.400
 be able to lock your processor or your 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:38.340
 Sink here the rock bases here with 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.630
 a tube of thermal paste glue is 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.300
 own dough spoon 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.430
 I already used this thermal paste 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.320
 excellent very good 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.080
 it's worth you to buy separately 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.470
 you also find this kind of 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.470
 hobby 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.940
 here is a rubber tree for you to fix 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.000
 she processor that it will 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.560
 help you when 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.530
 do not damage your motherboard 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:16.150
 Okay, so what's our processor? 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:24.780
 Our Processor Heat Sink 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:29.410
 is our lula is eating master hyper 212 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.770
 excellent game more I'll show you how 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:36.810
 is that if the interaction is made it's simple 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.810
 and practice ok thanks
