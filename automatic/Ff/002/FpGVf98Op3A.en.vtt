like I'm i think that the application
was<00:02:16.819> really<00:02:17.090> worked<00:02:17.569> really<00:02:17.870> well<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.379> they

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
was really worked really well and they

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.179 
was really worked really well and they
last<00:02:19.370> longer<00:02:19.849> than<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.180> expected<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.349> can't

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
last longer than I expected like I can't

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.399 
last longer than I expected like I can't
keep<00:02:22.459> nail<00:02:22.700> polish<00:02:22.969> on<00:02:23.090> my<00:02:23.150> fingers<00:02:23.629> anyway

but what I love about all of these

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.629 
but what I love about all of these
natural<00:02:47.450> nail<00:02:47.599> polishes<00:02:48.049> versus<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.099> stuff

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
natural nail polishes versus the stuff

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.849 
natural nail polishes versus the stuff
that<00:02:49.760> we<00:02:49.849> used<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.239> use<00:02:50.389> it<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.079> never<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:51.620> I

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
that we used to use it I never it now I

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.289 
that we used to use it I never it now I
kind<00:02:52.129> of<00:02:52.220> got<00:02:52.370> away<00:02:52.489> from<00:02:52.609> nail<00:02:53.000> polish

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
kind of got away from nail polish

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.080 
kind of got away from nail polish
actually<00:02:53.750> several<00:02:54.379> years<00:02:54.590> before<00:02:54.769> we<00:02:55.489> became

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
actually several years before we became

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.800 
actually several years before we became
natural<00:02:56.629> but<00:02:57.379> I<00:02:57.829> actually<00:02:58.609> couldn't<00:02:59.269> wear<00:02:59.659> it

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
natural but I actually couldn't wear it

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.970 
natural but I actually couldn't wear it
because<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.169> would<00:03:00.290> always<00:03:00.409> make<00:03:00.650> my<00:03:00.769> nails

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
because it would always make my nails

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.770 
because it would always make my nails
really<00:03:01.219> brittle<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.730> break<00:03:01.969> and<00:03:02.299> like<00:03:02.419> every

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
really brittle and break and like every

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.379 
really brittle and break and like every
time<00:03:03.019> I<00:03:03.290> would<00:03:03.709> put<00:03:03.919> it<00:03:04.010> on<00:03:04.129> and<00:03:04.609> I<00:03:04.909> finally

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
time I would put it on and I finally

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.509 
time I would put it on and I finally
grow<00:03:05.629> up<00:03:05.719> decent<00:03:06.139> nails<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:06.709> I'd<00:03:06.799> put<00:03:07.010> on<00:03:07.040> any

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
grow up decent nails and I'd put on any

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.129 
grow up decent nails and I'd put on any
kind<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.849> nail<00:03:07.969> polish<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.450> was<00:03:08.569> not<00:03:08.900> taught
