simple<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.570> let's<00:02:25.750> add<00:02:25.930> some<00:02:25.990> mechanics<00:02:26.710> to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
simple so let's add some mechanics to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.600 
simple so let's add some mechanics to
keep<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.280> interesting<00:02:28.110> ok<00:02:29.110> first<00:02:29.470> all<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.520> you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
keep it interesting ok first all of you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
if you are fighting around flags once

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
if you are fighting around flags once
you<00:02:36.040> kill<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.340> player<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.970> still<00:02:37.240> there<00:02:37.450> flag

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
you kill a player you still there flag

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.880 
you kill a player you still there flag
and<00:02:39.540> I'll<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:40.720> fucking<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.320> so

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
and I'll just fucking with you so

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.800 
and I'll just fucking with you so
