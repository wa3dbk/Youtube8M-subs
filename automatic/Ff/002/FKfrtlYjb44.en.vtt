00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
I haven't sat down and thought a whole

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.140 
I haven't sat down and thought a whole
lot<00:00:10.559> about<00:00:10.740> what<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.099> wanted<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.460> say<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.910> had

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
lot about what I wanted to say but I had

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.400 
lot about what I wanted to say but I had
I<00:00:12.179> think<00:00:12.300> three<00:00:13.130> requests<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:15.000> UM<00:00:15.509> at<00:00:16.170> least

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
I think three requests to UM at least

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.529 
I think three requests to UM at least
elaborate<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.250> these<00:00:17.640> two<00:00:17.880> products<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.480> how

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
elaborate on these two products and how

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.029 
elaborate on these two products and how
they<00:00:18.690> compare<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> figured<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.890> would

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
they compare and so I figured I would

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.550 
they compare and so I figured I would
just<00:00:20.070> go<00:00:20.279> ahead<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.330> video<00:00:21.570> about<00:00:21.960> them

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
if you saw my review of this product I

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.929 
if you saw my review of this product I
told<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.199> that<00:03:45.409> you<00:03:45.500> really<00:03:45.889> can't<00:03:46.250> overdo<00:03:46.909> it

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 
told you that you really can't overdo it

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.509 
told you that you really can't overdo it
and<00:03:47.269> now<00:03:47.479> you<00:03:47.509> can<00:03:48.019> see<00:03:48.229> why<00:03:48.379> because<00:03:48.799> that's

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
and now you can see why because that's

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.789 
and now you can see why because that's
without<00:03:49.759> the<00:03:49.939> pink<00:03:50.359> if<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.689> swirl<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.229> pink<00:03:51.530> in

without the pink if I swirl the pink in

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.069 
without the pink if I swirl the pink in
with<00:03:52.009> the<00:03:52.159> other<00:03:52.340> Browns<00:03:53.889> then<00:03:54.889> you<00:03:55.340> get<00:03:55.549> that

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
with the other Browns then you get that

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.509 
with the other Browns then you get that
and<00:03:57.079> that's<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.409> one<00:03:57.769> time<00:03:58.069> through<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.459> you

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
and that's just one time through and you

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.159 
and that's just one time through and you
can<00:03:58.669> see<00:03:58.819> how<00:03:58.849> much<00:03:59.120> more<00:03:59.329> pink<00:03:59.659> that<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:01.629> so<00:04:02.629> um

the shades as eyeshadow and it also

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.010 
the shades as eyeshadow and it also
works<00:07:24.920> as<00:07:25.160> a<00:07:25.190> bronzer<00:07:25.730> and<00:07:25.910> it<00:07:26.060> also<00:07:26.210> has<00:07:26.390> a

works as a bronzer and it also has a

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.470 
works as a bronzer and it also has a
blush<00:07:27.290> in<00:07:27.500> it<00:07:27.620> so<00:07:27.770> it's<00:07:27.920> really<00:07:28.130> nice<00:07:28.430> in<00:07:28.790> that

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:29.480 
blush in it so it's really nice in that

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.230 
blush in it so it's really nice in that
it's<00:07:29.690> several<00:07:30.080> different<00:07:30.380> products<00:07:30.770> in<00:07:30.920> one<00:07:31.340> I

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
it's several different products in one I

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.240 
it's several different products in one I
don't<00:07:32.810> think<00:07:32.870> one<00:07:33.230> is<00:07:33.260> necessarily<00:07:33.890> better

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.250 
don't think one is necessarily better

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.550 
don't think one is necessarily better
than<00:07:34.550> the<00:07:34.670> other<00:07:34.880> I<00:07:35.330> think<00:07:36.200> if<00:07:36.290> you're<00:07:36.440> going

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 
than the other I think if you're going

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.020 
than the other I think if you're going
to<00:07:36.650> spend<00:07:36.860> the<00:07:36.980> money<00:07:37.190> and<00:07:37.340> you<00:07:37.400> can<00:07:37.580> only<00:07:37.730> get

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.030 
to spend the money and you can only get

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.960 
to spend the money and you can only get
one<00:07:38.240> I<00:07:38.270> say<00:07:38.600> get<00:07:38.720> both<00:07:38.930> but<00:07:39.230> if<00:07:39.320> you<00:07:39.440> can't<00:07:39.680> or

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:39.970 
one I say get both but if you can't or

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.660 
one I say get both but if you can't or
if<00:07:40.970> you<00:07:41.060> just<00:07:41.090> choose<00:07:41.480> not<00:07:41.510> to<00:07:42.220> if<00:07:43.220> you're

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:43.670 
if you just choose not to if you're

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
if you just choose not to if you're
looking<00:07:43.970> for<00:07:44.000> something<00:07:44.300> that's<00:07:44.420> more

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:44.690 
looking for something that's more

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.780 
looking for something that's more
functional<00:07:45.200> than<00:07:45.230> get<00:07:45.650> the<00:07:45.980> powder<00:07:46.430> because

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:46.790 
functional than get the powder because

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.730

you know as I said you can do three
things<00:07:48.920> with<00:07:49.220> it<00:07:49.250> whereas<00:07:50.090> this<00:07:50.360> one<00:07:50.420> it

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870 
things with it whereas this one it

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.880 
things with it whereas this one it
really<00:07:50.990> is<00:07:51.260> just<00:07:51.620> a<00:07:51.920> cream<00:07:52.250> bronzer<00:07:53.380> so<00:07:54.380> I

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:54.890 
really is just a cream bronzer so I

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.200 
really is just a cream bronzer so I
really<00:07:55.220> don't<00:07:55.400> feel<00:07:55.550> like<00:07:55.730> I<00:07:55.850> told<00:07:56.090> you
