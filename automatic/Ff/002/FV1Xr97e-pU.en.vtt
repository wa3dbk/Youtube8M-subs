our<00:00:00.750> third<00:00:01.020> example<00:00:01.439> of<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.890> find<00:00:02.220> the

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
our third example of how to find the

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.820 
our third example of how to find the
efficiency<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.090> heat<00:00:03.240> engine<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.259> slightly

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
efficiency of heat engine is a slightly

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.579 
efficiency of heat engine is a slightly
different<00:00:04.980> approach<00:00:05.790> here<00:00:06.240> here<00:00:06.899> we're<00:00:07.140> given

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
different approach here here we're given

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.160 
different approach here here we're given
the<00:00:07.740> power<00:00:08.099> output<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.090> engine<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
the power output of this engine and the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.930 
the power output of this engine and the
efficiency<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.070> they're<00:00:11.429> asking<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.910> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
efficiency and they're asking you to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900 
efficiency and they're asking you to
find<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> rate<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:13.110> which<00:00:13.170> heat<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.280> extracted

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
find the rate at which heat is extracted

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.390 
find the rate at which heat is extracted
from<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> hot<00:00:15.750> reservoir<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.949> rate<00:00:17.130> at

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
from the hot reservoir and the rate at

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.849 
from the hot reservoir and the rate at
which<00:00:17.430> heat<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:18.270> dumped<00:00:18.690> into<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.260> cold

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
which heat is dumped into the cold

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.700 
which heat is dumped into the cold
reservoir<00:00:20.359> so<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.539> way<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.500> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
reservoir so the way to do that is to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.849 
reservoir so the way to do that is to
simply<00:00:22.890> divide<00:00:23.699> each<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> these<00:00:25.019> three<00:00:25.439> here

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
simply divide each of these three here

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.769 
simply divide each of these three here
by<00:00:26.039> time<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.750> go<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.529> change<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
by time because if we go the change of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.889 
by time because if we go the change of
the<00:00:30.779> hot<00:00:31.140> reservoir<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.910> rate<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.870> which

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the hot reservoir or the rate at which

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.100 
the hot reservoir or the rate at which
the<00:00:34.350> temperature<00:00:35.010> oh<00:00:35.399> let<00:00:36.059> me<00:00:36.180> say<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.690> again

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the temperature oh let me say that again

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
the temperature oh let me say that again
the<00:00:37.440> rate<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:37.980> heat<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.850> extracted<00:00:39.090> from

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the rate at which heat is extracted from

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.350 
the rate at which heat is extracted from
the<00:00:39.690> hot<00:00:39.960> reservoir<00:00:40.170> per<00:00:40.620> unit<00:00:40.890> time<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.360> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the hot reservoir per unit time and you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.380 
the hot reservoir per unit time and you
make<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.290> DW<00:00:44.129> DT<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.969> rate<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.360> which

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
make this the DW DT the rate at which

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
make this the DW DT the rate at which
work<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> done<00:00:46.140> per<00:00:46.620> unit<00:00:46.649> time<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
work is done per unit time and you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
work is done per unit time and you
divide<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.030> by<00:00:48.090> time<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> say<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> rate<00:00:49.410> at

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
divide this by time and say the rate at

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.760 
divide this by time and say the rate at
which<00:00:49.680> energy<00:00:50.180> or<00:00:51.180> heat<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.570> dumped<00:00:52.170> into<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
which energy or heat is dumped into the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.950 
which energy or heat is dumped into the
cold<00:00:53.039> reservoir<00:00:53.280> per<00:00:53.850> unit<00:00:54.120> time<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
cold reservoir per unit time so all I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
cold reservoir per unit time so all I
did<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.469> simply<00:00:55.710> divide<00:00:56.160> each<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> these

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
did was simply divide each of these

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
did was simply divide each of these
three<00:00:57.270> quantities<00:00:57.480> by<00:00:58.020> time<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
three quantities by time then you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.130 
three quantities by time then you
realize<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.149> equal<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> power

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
realize that this is equal to power

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
realize that this is equal to power
power<00:01:01.649> simply<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.340> rate<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.699> doing<00:01:02.850> work<00:01:03.030> work

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
power simply the rate of doing work work

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
power simply the rate of doing work work
for<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.090> sir<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:06.960> put

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
for time and so if we then sir then put

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
for time and so if we then sir then put
this<00:01:08.130> quantity<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.600> should<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.840> able

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this quantity in here we should be able

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
this quantity in here we should be able
to<00:01:10.110> figure<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.470> these<00:01:11.010> quantities<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> same

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to figure out these quantities the same

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.539 
to figure out these quantities the same
way<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.659> did<00:01:12.900> before<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.189> didn't<00:01:14.460> have

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
way we did before when we didn't have

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
way we did before when we didn't have
everything<00:01:14.850> divided<00:01:15.210> by<00:01:15.360> time<00:01:15.659> however<00:01:16.409> units

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
everything divided by time however units

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.010 
everything divided by time however units
of<00:01:17.310> horsepower<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.119> standard<00:01:18.600> units<00:01:18.900> so

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
of horsepower not standard units so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.149 
of horsepower not standard units so
let's<00:01:19.200> convert<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.920> into<00:01:20.640> watts<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.920> we

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
let's convert that into watts and if we

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
let's convert that into watts and if we
convert<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.299> use<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> conversion

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
convert that we have to use a conversion

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.310 
convert that we have to use a conversion
factor<00:01:25.560> what's<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.390> horsepower<00:01:28.229> on

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
factor what's the top on horsepower on

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.569 
factor what's the top on horsepower on
the<00:01:28.409> bottom<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:29.220> horsepower<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:31.369> 746<00:01:32.369> watts

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the bottom one horsepower is 746 watts

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
the bottom one horsepower is 746 watts
so<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.810> first<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so the first thing we want to do is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
so the first thing we want to do is
convert<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.340> into<00:01:35.880> watts<00:01:37.490> 240<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:38.640> be

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
convert that into watts 240 now be

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
convert that into watts 240 now be
careful<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.659> confuse<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.409> unit<00:01:40.770> watts

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
careful don't confuse the unit watts

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.030 
careful don't confuse the unit watts
with<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.090> W<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.930> work<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.540> 240<00:01:45.540> times<00:01:46.079> 746

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
with the W for work so for 240 times 746

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.399 
with the W for work so for 240 times 746
is<00:01:47.280> equal<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.570> hundred<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.840> seventy<00:01:49.200> nine

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
is equal to one hundred and seventy nine

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
is equal to one hundred and seventy nine
thousand<00:01:50.369> hundred<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.970> seventy<00:01:51.360> nine

forty<00:01:58.110> joules<00:01:58.770> per<00:01:59.100> second<00:01:59.820> alright<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.250> now

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
forty joules per second alright so now

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.190 
forty joules per second alright so now
that<00:02:02.399> we've<00:02:02.729> converted<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.020> come<00:02:04.170> up

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that we've converted that we can come up

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.740 
that we've converted that we can come up
with<00:02:04.469> our<00:02:04.649> efficiency<00:02:05.340> equation<00:02:05.820> efficiency

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
with our efficiency equation efficiency

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.850 
with our efficiency equation efficiency
is<00:02:06.960> equal<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.530> work<00:02:08.129> over<00:02:08.729> Q<00:02:09.450> hot<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.649> what

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
is equal to work over Q hot and so what

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.430 
is equal to work over Q hot and so what
this<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.280> means<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.510> say<00:02:12.690> Q

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this then means is we can say Q

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.240 
this then means is we can say Q
but<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:14.340> equal<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.030> work<00:02:15.510> /<00:02:16.200> efficiency<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
but is equal to work / efficiency and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.390 
but is equal to work / efficiency and
then<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:17.940> divide<00:02:18.210> everything<00:02:18.240> by<00:02:18.630> time<00:02:19.400> we

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
then if we divide everything by time we

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.130 
then if we divide everything by time we
can<00:02:20.580> divide<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> left<00:02:21.270> side<00:02:21.360> by<00:02:21.510> time<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.050> we

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
can divide the left side by time so we

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.350 
can divide the left side by time so we
can<00:02:22.260> say<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> rate<00:02:22.830> at<00:02:23.160> which<00:02:23.460> heat<00:02:24.330> is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
can say the rate at which heat is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.210 
can say the rate at which heat is
extracted<00:02:24.750> from<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.320> hot<00:02:25.530> reservoir<00:02:25.740> per

extracted from the hot reservoir per
unit<00:02:26.520> time<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.360> equal<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.080> rate<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.560> which

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
unit time is equal to the rate at which

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.390 
unit time is equal to the rate at which
we<00:02:29.010> do<00:02:29.190> work<00:02:29.490> per<00:02:30.240> unit<00:02:30.480> time<00:02:31.220> divided<00:02:32.220> by<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
we do work per unit time divided by the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.570 
we do work per unit time divided by the
efficiency<00:02:33.080> now<00:02:34.080> we<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.500> go<00:02:34.650> ahead<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.400> say

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
efficiency now we can go ahead and say

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.010 
efficiency now we can go ahead and say
this<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.910> equal<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.210> one<00:02:36.420> hundred<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.750> seventy

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
this is equal to one hundred and seventy

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.040 
this is equal to one hundred and seventy
nine<00:02:37.050> thousand<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.210> forty<00:02:39.210> joules<00:02:39.840> per

nine thousand and forty joules per

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.380 
nine thousand and forty joules per
second<00:02:40.770> divided<00:02:41.490> by<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.730> efficiency<00:02:42.210> of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
second divided by the efficiency of

twenty<00:02:42.780> eight<00:02:42.870> percent<00:02:43.020> which<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.590> zero<00:02:43.800> point

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
twenty eight percent which is zero point

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.740 
twenty eight percent which is zero point
two<00:02:44.340> eight<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.690> divide<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.260> by<00:02:46.550> 0.28<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.940> we

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
two eight so divide this by 0.28 and we

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.580 
two eight so divide this by 0.28 and we
get<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:50.130> heat<00:02:50.730> extracted<00:02:51.720> per<00:02:52.020> unit<00:02:52.320> time

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
get the heat extracted per unit time

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.560 
get the heat extracted per unit time
from<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.010> hot<00:02:53.160> reservoir<00:02:53.270> it's<00:02:54.270> therefore

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
from the hot reservoir it's therefore

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.530 
from the hot reservoir it's therefore
equal<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.350> six<00:02:55.590> hundred<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.070> thirty-nine

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
equal to six hundred and thirty-nine

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.820 
equal to six hundred and thirty-nine
thousand<00:02:57.950> four<00:02:58.950> hundred<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.430> twenty<00:02:59.790> nine

thousand four hundred and twenty nine
joules<00:03:01.830> per<00:03:02.130> second<00:03:02.760> obviously<00:03:03.270> we<00:03:04.080> don't

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
joules per second obviously we don't

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.930 
joules per second obviously we don't
need<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.530> many<00:03:04.740> significant<00:03:05.370> figures<00:03:05.400> so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
need that many significant figures so

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.780 
need that many significant figures so
but<00:03:06.630> let's<00:03:07.050> not<00:03:07.170> worry<00:03:07.230> about<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.790> second

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
but let's not worry about that second

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.220 
but let's not worry about that second
part<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.090> we<00:03:09.300> want<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.570> know<00:03:09.660> how<00:03:09.810> much<00:03:09.930> heat

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
part is we want to know how much heat

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.950 
part is we want to know how much heat
would<00:03:10.410> dumped<00:03:10.680> into<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.520> hot<00:03:12.210> reservoir<00:03:12.510> and

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
would dumped into the hot reservoir and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.570 
would dumped into the hot reservoir and
of<00:03:13.050> course<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.590> mean<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.250> cold<00:03:14.430> reservoir

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
of course I mean in the cold reservoir

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.100 
of course I mean in the cold reservoir
and<00:03:15.120> we<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:15.570> say<00:03:15.720> well<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.110> Delta<00:03:16.590> Q<00:03:16.950> delta<00:03:17.400> T

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
and we can say well the Delta Q delta T

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.600 
and we can say well the Delta Q delta T
to<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.230> Cole<00:03:19.440> reservoir<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.160> equal<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
to the Cole reservoir is equal to the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.840 
to the Cole reservoir is equal to the
amount<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:20.940> heat<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.450> extract<00:03:21.930> from<00:03:22.850> the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
amount of heat that we extract from the

amount of heat that we extract from the
hot<00:03:24.030> reservoir<00:03:24.620> minus<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.130> amount<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.459> work

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
hot reservoir minus the amount of work

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.010 
hot reservoir minus the amount of work
that<00:03:27.120> we<00:03:27.239> do<00:03:27.390> per<00:03:27.600> unit<00:03:27.900> I'd<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.780> what<00:03:30.930> we

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
that we do per unit I'd and so what we

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.870 
that we do per unit I'd and so what we
can<00:03:31.140> do<00:03:31.260> there<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.709> we<00:03:31.890> say<00:03:32.100> okay<00:03:32.130> that's<00:03:32.580> equal

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
can do there is we say okay that's equal

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.430 
can do there is we say okay that's equal
to<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.239> six<00:03:33.510> hundred<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.930> thirty<00:03:34.170> nine

seventy nine thousand and forty joules
per<00:03:45.690> second<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.220> difference<00:03:47.610> between

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
per second and so the difference between

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.009 
per second and so the difference between
those<00:03:48.090> two<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.750> minus<00:03:49.140> one<00:03:49.730> 7904<00:03:50.730> zero<00:03:51.420> equals

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
those two so minus one 7904 zero equals

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.520 
those two so minus one 7904 zero equals
and<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:53.070> rounded<00:03:53.970> off<00:03:54.140> well<00:03:55.140> first<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.500> all

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
and so rounded off well first of all

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.350 
and so rounded off well first of all

hundred and eighty nine joules per

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.890 
hundred and eighty nine joules per
second<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.060> course<00:04:00.239> we<00:04:00.450> want<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.750> round

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
second so of course we want to round

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.660 
second so of course we want to round
that<00:04:01.080> off<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.620> maybe<00:04:01.860> three<00:04:02.190> significant

that off to maybe three significant

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.870 
that off to maybe three significant
figures<00:04:02.870> because<00:04:03.870> three<00:04:04.680> or<00:04:04.769> two<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.640> can

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
figures because three or two so this can

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.080 
figures because three or two so this can
be<00:04:05.910> written<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.470> six<00:04:07.470> point<00:04:07.860> four<00:04:08.220> times<00:04:08.610> ten

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
be written as six point four times ten

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.810 
be written as six point four times ten
to<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.360> fifth<00:04:09.450> joules<00:04:10.440> per<00:04:10.560> second<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.310> this

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
to the fifth joules per second and this

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.729 
to the fifth joules per second and this
can<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.120> written<00:04:12.269> as<00:04:12.540> four<00:04:12.870> point<00:04:13.200> six<00:04:13.470> times

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
can be written as four point six times

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.240 
can be written as four point six times
ten<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.430> fifth<00:04:14.850> joules<00:04:15.720> per<00:04:16.130> second

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
ten to the fifth joules per second

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.830 
ten to the fifth joules per second
and<00:04:17.489> that's<00:04:17.730> probably<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.150> more<00:04:18.299> appropriate

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
and that's probably a more appropriate

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.270 
and that's probably a more appropriate
way<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:18.989> writing<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.799> answers<00:04:20.100> with<00:04:20.250> the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
way of writing the answers with the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.250 
way of writing the answers with the
correct<00:04:20.609> number<00:04:20.669> significant<00:04:21.419> figures<00:04:21.720> but

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
correct number significant figures but

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.810 
correct number significant figures but
notice<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.729> we<00:04:23.850> had<00:04:24.050> QW<00:04:25.050> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
notice just like we had QW and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.580 
notice just like we had QW and
we<00:04:26.090> can<00:04:26.240> have<00:04:26.450> Delta<00:04:27.350> Q<00:04:27.620> DT<00:04:27.770> Delta<00:04:28.700> W<00:04:29.300> D<00:04:30.110> T<00:04:30.320> and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
we can have Delta Q DT Delta W D T and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.100 
we can have Delta Q DT Delta W D T and
Delta<00:04:31.010> Q<00:04:31.220> DT<00:04:31.520> here<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.450> work<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.780> problem

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
Delta Q DT here and you work the problem

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.310 
Delta Q DT here and you work the problem
out<00:04:33.200> exactly<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.040> same<00:04:34.340> way<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:35.320> example

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
out exactly the same way so example

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.140 
out exactly the same way so example
three<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:37.160> think<00:04:37.430> now<00:04:37.550> you're<00:04:37.730> ready<00:04:37.940> to

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
three and I think now you're ready to

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
three and I think now you're ready to
solve<00:04:38.390> all<00:04:38.540> those<00:04:38.740> efficiency<00:04:39.740> problems
