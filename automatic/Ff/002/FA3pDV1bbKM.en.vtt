this<00:00:22.260> technique<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> surgeon's<00:00:23.369> throw<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
this technique is a surgeon's throw and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.189 
this technique is a surgeon's throw and
can<00:00:23.970> oftentimes<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.920> all<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.310> necessary

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
can oftentimes be all that is necessary

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.990 
can oftentimes be all that is necessary
however<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.560> occasion<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.580> various

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
however on occasion and with various

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.620 
however on occasion and with various
types<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.449> suture<00:00:30.779> material<00:00:32.149> this<00:00:33.149> surgeon's

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
types of suture material this surgeon's

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.350 
types of suture material this surgeon's
throw<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.020> good<00:00:34.739> enough<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.329> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
throw is not good enough so what I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.319 
throw is not good enough so what I
recommend<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:37.230> tying<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.250> perfect<00:00:38.760> square<00:00:39.090> knot

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
recommend is tying a perfect square knot

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.369 
recommend is tying a perfect square knot
as<00:00:39.540> seen<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:41.059> pulling<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
as seen here pulling up on one or the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.760 
as seen here pulling up on one or the
other

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
other

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.410 
other
ends<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.239> perfect<00:00:45.989> square<00:00:46.710> knot<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.420> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
ends of that perfect square knot and it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.130 
ends of that perfect square knot and it
immediately<00:00:49.200> turns<00:00:49.710> into<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> slip<00:00:50.250> knot<00:00:51.140> what

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
immediately turns into a slip knot what

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.350 
immediately turns into a slip knot what
that<00:00:52.289> Slipknot<00:00:52.800> does<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> increases<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that Slipknot does is it increases the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.400 
that Slipknot does is it increases the
amount<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.719> friction<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> contact<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.309> suture

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
amount of friction and contact of suture

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
amount of friction and contact of suture
around<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> piece<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.120> suture<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.840> between

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
around the piece of suture going between

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.210 
around the piece of suture going between
or<00:01:01.680> through<00:01:02.160> each<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.820> those<00:01:02.969> slips<00:01:04.220> because

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
or through each of those slips because

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.969 
or through each of those slips because
that<00:01:05.640> amount<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.180> friction<00:01:06.689> increases<00:01:06.979> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that amount of friction increases you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.570 
that amount of friction increases you
actually<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> stickier<00:01:09.420> knot<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.490> as<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
actually get a stickier knot and as you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
actually get a stickier knot and as you
can<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.540> knot<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.990> holding<00:01:13.439> under

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
can see here this knot is holding under

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.109 
can see here this knot is holding under
a<00:01:13.770> tension<00:01:14.159> situation<00:01:15.619> without<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:17.119> effort

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
a tension situation without any effort

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.749 
a tension situation without any effort
on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.750> surgeon's<00:01:19.170> part<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.950> keep<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.549> knot

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
on the surgeon's part to keep the knot

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.530 
on the surgeon's part to keep the knot
tight<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:23.070> knot<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.310> used<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.210> highly

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
tight if this knot is used it is highly

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.020 
tight if this knot is used it is highly
recommended<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:26.000> place<00:01:27.000> four<00:01:27.689> throws<00:01:29.030> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
recommended to place four throws that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.300 
recommended to place four throws that
would<00:01:30.180> equal<00:01:30.420> two<00:01:30.630> square<00:01:30.930> knots<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:32.009> finish

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
would equal two square knots to finish

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
would equal two square knots to finish

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
secure the knot again this works

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
secure the knot again this works
beautifully<00:03:45.470> with<00:03:45.920> any<00:03:46.570> monofilament

stroking it to show you that it is a
multi<00:04:08.300> filament<00:04:08.840> it's<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.050> little<00:04:09.290> hard<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.680> see

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
multi filament it's a little hard to see

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.260 
multi filament it's a little hard to see
these<00:04:11.390> are<00:04:11.660> very<00:04:11.989> frustrating<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:13.730> work<00:04:14.000> with

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
these are very frustrating to work with

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.659 
these are very frustrating to work with
when<00:04:14.630> you're<00:04:14.780> working<00:04:15.260> under<00:04:15.530> tissue<00:04:16.400> that's

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
when you're working under tissue that's

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.900 
when you're working under tissue that's
under<00:04:16.910> tension<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:19.190> fact<00:04:19.430> what<00:04:19.640> we'll<00:04:19.790> do

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
under tension and in fact what we'll do

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.620 
under tension and in fact what we'll do
is<00:04:20.090> we'll<00:04:20.239> put<00:04:20.450> a<00:04:20.480> single<00:04:20.810> throw<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:23.330> show<00:04:23.570> you

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
is we'll put a single throw to show you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.520 
is we'll put a single throw to show you
how<00:04:24.500> slippery<00:04:25.280> this<00:04:25.790> material<00:04:26.390> can<00:04:26.600> be<00:04:27.910> and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
how slippery this material can be and

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.220 
how slippery this material can be and
that<00:04:30.530> just<00:04:30.770> pops<00:04:31.220> apart<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.870> then<00:04:32.870> we'll<00:04:33.020> do<00:04:33.200> a

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
that just pops apart and then we'll do a

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.620 
that just pops apart and then we'll do a
surgeon's<00:04:33.890> throw<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.910> let's<00:04:35.120> do<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.330> double

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
surgeon's throw so let's do a double

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.630 
surgeon's throw so let's do a double
throw<00:04:36.140> now<00:04:36.350> this<00:04:36.530> will<00:04:36.740> generally<00:04:37.070> work<00:04:37.370> for

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
throw now this will generally work for

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.960 
throw now this will generally work for
most<00:04:37.850> suture<00:04:38.330> materials<00:04:38.810> but<00:04:39.020> not<00:04:39.730> for<00:04:40.730> these

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
most suture materials but not for these

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.560 
most suture materials but not for these
very<00:04:41.419> slippery<00:04:42.790> multifilament<00:04:43.790> absorbable

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
very slippery multifilament absorbable

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.879 
very slippery multifilament absorbable
so<00:04:47.570> very<00:04:47.900> slippery

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.219 

so<00:04:52.889> let's<00:04:53.129> go<00:04:53.339> ahead<00:04:53.459> and<00:04:53.969> do<00:04:54.269> our<00:04:54.299> sticky

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
so let's go ahead and do our sticky

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.239 
so let's go ahead and do our sticky
Slipknot<00:04:55.859> technique<00:04:57.229> where<00:04:58.229> we<00:04:58.259> tie<00:04:58.949> a

00:04:59.239 --> 00:04:59.249 
Slipknot technique where we tie a

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.889 
Slipknot technique where we tie a

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:03.899 
perfect square knot keep it a little

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:09.309 
perfect square knot keep it a little
loose<00:05:06.019> pull<00:05:07.019> up<00:05:07.229> on<00:05:07.379> one<00:05:07.679> end<00:05:08.009> of<00:05:08.549> the<00:05:08.969> suture

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
loose pull up on one end of the suture

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.789 
loose pull up on one end of the suture
to<00:05:10.319> turn<00:05:10.619> that<00:05:10.949> into<00:05:11.339> a<00:05:11.959> slip<00:05:12.959> knot<00:05:12.989> that

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:13.799 
to turn that into a slip knot that

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:17.359 
to turn that into a slip knot that
increases<00:05:14.549> the<00:05:14.729> friction<00:05:15.679> around<00:05:16.679> the<00:05:16.949> strand

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:17.369 
increases the friction around the strand

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:21.769 
increases the friction around the strand
of<00:05:17.549> suture<00:05:18.799> it<00:05:19.799> enables<00:05:20.309> the<00:05:20.669> surgeon<00:05:21.119> to<00:05:21.269> slip

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
of suture it enables the surgeon to slip
