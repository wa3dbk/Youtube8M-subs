there who have been wanting to get an 85
but<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.250> held<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.640> because<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.719> 1.4<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
but have held off because the 1.4 is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.639 
but have held off because the 1.4 is
expensive<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.579> 1.8<00:00:45.210> D<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.530> bit

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
expensive and the 1.8 D was a little bit

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.700 
expensive and the 1.8 D was a little bit
clunky<00:00:47.180> they<00:00:48.180> did<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> 50<00:00:49.260> mil<00:00:49.469> now

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
clunky they did this with the 50 mil now

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.240 
clunky they did this with the 50 mil now
you've<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> 1.4<00:00:50.879> G<00:00:51.120> 1.8<00:00:51.809> G<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> 1.8<00:00:52.739> D<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you've got a 1.4 G 1.8 G and a 1.8 D and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.139 
you've got a 1.4 G 1.8 G and a 1.8 D and
the<00:00:53.789> 50<00:00:54.120> ml<00:00:54.300> 1.8<00:00:54.989> G<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> latest<00:00:56.820> one

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the 50 ml 1.8 G that's the latest one

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
the 50 ml 1.8 G that's the latest one
that's<00:00:57.300> been<00:00:57.449> released<00:00:57.629> has<00:00:58.050> been<00:00:58.350> really

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that's been released has been really

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
that's been released has been really
really<00:00:59.250> well<00:00:59.430> received<00:00:59.960> beautiful<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> sharp

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
really well received beautiful and sharp

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.210 
really well received beautiful and sharp
and<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.489> big<00:01:02.730> compromise<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> 1.4<00:01:04.500> but

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and not a big compromise on the 1.4 but

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
and not a big compromise on the 1.4 but
at<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.700> better<00:01:06.030> price<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.140> lighter

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
at a much better price and lighter

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.440 
at a much better price and lighter
weight<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.939> 85<00:01:09.590> 1.8<00:01:10.590> G<00:01:11.340> could<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
weight so this 85 1.8 G could be the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
weight so this 85 1.8 G could be the
money<00:01:12.659> looking<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> looks<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
money looking at it looks just like a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390 
money looking at it looks just like a
smaller<00:01:14.939> version<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> 1.4<00:01:16.590> G<00:01:16.890> it'll<00:01:17.189> just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
smaller version of the 1.4 G it'll just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.280 
smaller version of the 1.4 G it'll just
have<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.909> switch<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.659> manual<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
have the one switch from manual to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.219 
have the one switch from manual to
manual<00:01:19.860> autofocus<00:01:20.729> there's<00:01:21.030> no<00:01:21.240> VR<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
manual autofocus there's no VR on this

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.940 
manual autofocus there's no VR on this
lens<00:01:22.970> let's<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.240> compare<00:01:24.540> some<00:01:24.780> stats<00:01:25.110> okay

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
lens let's just compare some stats okay

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
lens let's just compare some stats okay
so<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.369> 1.8<00:01:26.850> G<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> less<00:01:28.049> sophisticated

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so the 1.8 G is a less sophisticated

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.120 
so the 1.8 G is a less sophisticated
lens<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.400> terms<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.909> its<00:01:30.119> engineering<00:01:31.130> it's

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
lens in terms of its engineering it's

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
lens in terms of its engineering it's
got<00:01:32.310> nine<00:01:32.579> elements<00:01:33.740> whereas<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> 1.4<00:01:35.700> has<00:01:36.060> 10

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
got nine elements whereas the 1.4 has 10

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.380 
got nine elements whereas the 1.4 has 10
I<00:01:36.810> compare<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> 1.8<00:01:38.549> D<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.180> only

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
I compare that to the 1.8 D which only

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
I compare that to the 1.8 D which only
has<00:01:39.600> 6<00:01:39.900> elements<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.369> it's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
has 6 elements and you can see it's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
has 6 elements and you can see it's
certainly<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> new<00:01:42.750> range<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
certainly up in the new range and it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.399 
certainly up in the new range and it
does<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> S<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.479> new<00:01:45.689> auto

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
does have you know the S the new auto

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.950 
does have you know the S the new auto
focus<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.270> codings

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
focus and the codings

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480 
focus and the codings
one<00:01:49.470> thing<00:01:49.680> we're<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> wait

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
one thing we're going to have to wait

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.039 
one thing we're going to have to wait
and<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.850> though<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.329> how<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> bokeh

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and see though is how the bokeh

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.109 
and see though is how the bokeh
performance<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.909> new

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
performance is going to be on this new

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.219 
performance is going to be on this new
lens<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:55.020> has<00:01:55.229> 7<00:01:55.860> rounded<00:01:56.719> blades<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:58.079> the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.010 
9 blades and the 1.8 D also has 9 blades
so<00:02:05.729> we'll<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.299> see<00:02:06.450> how<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> works

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so we'll have to see how that works

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.380
