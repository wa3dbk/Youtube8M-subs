00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
only going to be taking a quick second
now<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.960> might<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.290> look<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.589> good<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
now this might not look as good as the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
now this might not look as good as the
actual<00:01:05.339> image<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.850> done<00:01:06.030> beforehand<00:01:06.600> because

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
actual image I done beforehand because

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.560 
actual image I done beforehand because
I'm<00:01:07.560> trying<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.890> quicker<00:01:08.130> however<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.030 
I'm trying to be quicker however you
should<00:01:09.600> spend<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.409> bit<00:01:10.590> more<00:01:10.770> time

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
should spend a little bit more time

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
should spend a little bit more time
selecting<00:01:11.549> around<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> hair<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.960> see

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
selecting around the hair do you see

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.240 
selecting around the hair do you see
know<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.439> you're<00:01:13.530> getting<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> hair

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.539 
know that you're getting all the hair
parts<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> over

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
parts so you don't have to do this over

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240 
parts so you don't have to do this over
and<00:01:17.610> over<00:01:17.670> again<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> hair<00:01:20.009> looks

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.980 
this is done you need to actually just
go<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> select<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.820> path<00:01:30.119> if

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
go in to select and then from path if

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
go in to select and then from path if
you<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.350> select<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:31.979> path<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.790> do

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you don't select a from path it will do

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
you don't select a from path it will do
the<00:01:33.180> whole<00:01:33.390> image<00:01:33.750> rather<00:01:34.380> than<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.799> your

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the whole image rather than just your

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
the whole image rather than just your
hair<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.840> need<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> whole<00:01:37.350> image

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and as I said before hand take more time

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.390 
and as I said before hand take more time
than<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.810> did<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.350> around<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> hair<00:01:40.860> because

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

I didn't take that long going around the
image<00:02:25.960> get<00:02:26.960> into<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.380> see<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.370> gone

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
therefore looks better we're with this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.120 
therefore looks better we're with this
one<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.420> didn't<00:02:32.960> take<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.140> much<00:02:33.410> time<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:34.010> go

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
one I didn't take that much time to go

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.290 
one I didn't take that much time to go
around<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> hair<00:02:34.520> lines<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.120> real

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
around the hair lines because one real

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
quick as possible and that's why it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.400 
quick as possible and that's why it
doesn't<00:02:37.400> look<00:02:37.460> as<00:02:37.580> good<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.360> as<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.540> say<00:02:38.720> take<00:02:39.050> as

doesn't look as good so as I say take as

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.140 
doesn't look as good so as I say take as
