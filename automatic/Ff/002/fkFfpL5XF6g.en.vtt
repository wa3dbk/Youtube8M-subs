00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.319
 and that's when the girl I 'm going to show 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.160
 for you new things this software 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.160
 new moment recently that the function 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 smart click changes in the trade and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.420
 marketing 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.970
 the smart click 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.880
 he is very interesting not only 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.699
 I hurt because they allowed the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.510
 people to modify all the functions of the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.720
 Mouse 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.800
 here also the left button for example 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 you can walk 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.489
 that's how I can figure it out 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.820
 to open things look at objects 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.040
 or so much if context message 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.829
 or even the martin himself that I can 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.350
 vote here in the smart click 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 the smart click it makes the option more 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 obvious 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.340
 after defeating the smart click on the button 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.520
 that it comes configured right but I'm going 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.780
 to vote on the left 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:09.930
 Okay, there she had this stone that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.409
 also has a little eye there is because the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.880
 The most obvious thing to do is look at the stone. 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.009
 there I wanted with another left 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.220
 he looks I can not climb the stone 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.650
 after a stone on the floor the most 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.549
 Obviously I walk are legs moving 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.909
 in the cat the most obvious thing to attack him 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.860
 appears a spy in the inpc is thing 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.640
 more obvious is talking to him 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.189
 so has the ball has a bite here 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.140
 So tell me, I can call when you want. 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.869
 so pleaded the rai will speak is a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.250
 thing that is in my bp is a little bar 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.130
 shelter 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:01.930
 I did not open please April here a sword to 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 Hand is and use to use any inha 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.740
 place and for example 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.230
 here you go or here in my baby 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.670
 It's his job to look at it, but if he 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.870
 I'm on the floor, I'm walking on it. 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.010
 This is very good because at the time of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.800
 boot will have a lot of things on the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.100
 face on the floor not only encourage or more 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.680
 also items to put colleagues here he 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.890
 will walk up to Alex but if she 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.900
 You're in my body, I just wanted to do it. 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.540
 look it is not very important that the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.010
 difference from when you tried to ask me 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.770
 food on the floor is crucial to show 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.440
 So, how does this work? 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:55.239
 creatures killed him 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.600
 the doll when sneezing in the face beauty that 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.600
 the black 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.420
 so far he appears chopstick here 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:12.500
 There is also this here to use madness. 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.819
 of luck year shift right fight button 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.030
 direct 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:24.920
 everything you can change here for 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:30.670
 also open a soap open look on the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.670
 chelsea the team to use but you can not give 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.519
 this software has become more agile and 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:42.260
 click to attack the animals in friendship is more 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:46.120
 accurate did not work so well and 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.069
 if attacking by clicking not only smart beijing 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.560
 but in the old mind when it did not have and 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.790
 Come on, let's talk about the changes. 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.000
 So 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.569
 then this change happened in the trade 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.760
 ipc s 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.370
 when will buy several rights by 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.079
 example the stallone I want to buy 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.859
 always the exceptional purchase so when 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:17.449
 I bought without it it returned from scratch 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:19.310
 Are you ready now, not now, continuing? 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.940
 without it it continues on the option I chose 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.930
 purchase 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.930
 if I buy 71 it will continue after 71 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.210
 and it is more practical and china is better and more 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.520
 a change that was condemned in the 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.210
 marketing 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.810
 When are you going to buy several items? 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.080
 buy the brawn but good panel 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.650
 it shows the total I'm going to pay 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.349
 showed that it works several 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.820
 items if they do not show total then who 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.460
 do not know how much to release the 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.800
 calculated on the head, right? 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.139
 but now it shows that it was not only had 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.490
 a flash client was condemned in c ++ 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:07.990
 also that it is a novelty people in a then 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.419
 This is it, people, we play video games. 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.860
 40 and still celebrated the old play this 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.630
 bagasse 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.610
 and I was forced to prostitute myself 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.110
 you want to comment on something else 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.390
 make yourself comfortable 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:26.280
 If you liked it, check it out. 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.440
 I created the channel on facebook 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.440
 Thank you so much for this and see you soon.
