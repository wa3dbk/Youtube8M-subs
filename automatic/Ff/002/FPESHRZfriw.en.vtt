450<00:00:05.779> xcw<00:00:06.649> as<00:00:07.099> you<00:00:08.029> can<00:00:08.240> see<00:00:08.510> it<00:00:08.660> looks<00:00:08.840> quite<00:00:09.019> a

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
450 xcw as you can see it looks quite a

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.140 
450 xcw as you can see it looks quite a
bit<00:00:09.260> different<00:00:09.410> from<00:00:09.740> stock<00:00:10.190> that<00:00:10.519> is<00:00:10.730> because

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
bit different from stock that is because

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.339 
bit different from stock that is because
we<00:00:11.629> are<00:00:11.660> deep<00:00:12.080> in<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:12.349> middle<00:00:12.620> of<00:00:13.059> rally

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
we are deep in the middle of rally

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.410 
we are deep in the middle of rally
preparations<00:00:15.349> I<00:00:15.679> actually<00:00:16.670> got<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:17.030> ton<00:00:17.390> of

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
preparations I actually got a ton of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.390 
preparations I actually got a ton of
work<00:00:17.720> and<00:00:18.050> time<00:00:18.349> just<00:00:18.740> kind<00:00:18.890> of<00:00:18.980> figuring<00:00:19.310> out

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
work and time just kind of figuring out

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.269 
work and time just kind of figuring out
what<00:00:20.300> I<00:00:20.330> need<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:20.960> where<00:00:21.470> everything<00:00:22.010> is

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
what I need and where everything is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.669 
what I need and where everything is
going<00:00:22.429> to<00:00:22.670> go<00:00:22.849> when<00:00:23.689> it<00:00:23.810> comes<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.380> rally

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
going to go when it comes to the rally

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.849 
going to go when it comes to the rally
gear<00:00:25.250> it's<00:00:25.970> not<00:00:26.330> that<00:00:26.599> any<00:00:26.779> single<00:00:27.349> part<00:00:27.740> of

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
gear it's not that any single part of

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.160 
gear it's not that any single part of
it's<00:00:28.039> very<00:00:28.189> complicated<00:00:28.730> it's<00:00:29.720> trying<00:00:30.109> to

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
it's very complicated it's trying to

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.140 
it's very complicated it's trying to
figure<00:00:30.380> out<00:00:30.470> how<00:00:30.589> to<00:00:30.619> make<00:00:30.859> all<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.669> parts<00:00:32.000> and

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
figure out how to make all the parts and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.110 
figure out how to make all the parts and
pieces<00:00:32.300> work<00:00:32.810> out<00:00:33.110> well<00:00:33.550> in<00:00:34.550> a<00:00:34.640> way<00:00:34.790> that<00:00:35.000> they

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
pieces work out well in a way that they

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.490 
pieces work out well in a way that they
don't<00:00:35.330> interfere<00:00:35.510> with<00:00:35.930> each<00:00:35.960> other

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
don't interfere with each other

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.670 
don't interfere with each other
that<00:00:37.160> they'll<00:00:37.400> be<00:00:37.550> durable<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:39.410> if<00:00:39.530> we

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
that they'll be durable and that if we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.620 
that they'll be durable and that if we
have<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.070> problem<00:00:40.520> we<00:00:40.850> can<00:00:41.030> get<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.540> and

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
have a problem we can get to it and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.560 
have a problem we can get to it and
diagnose<00:00:42.170> it<00:00:42.350> really<00:00:42.620> quick<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.570> definitely

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
diagnose it really quick so definitely

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.390 
diagnose it really quick so definitely
don't<00:00:44.690> want<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.050> jumble<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.620> wires<00:00:45.800> sitting

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
don't want a jumble of wires sitting

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.710 
don't want a jumble of wires sitting
under<00:00:46.580> the<00:00:46.670> seat<00:00:46.910> looking<00:00:47.300> at<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.570> going

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
let's go do a quick walk around this is

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.520 
let's go do a quick walk around this is
rally<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.840> overall<00:00:54.560> race<00:00:54.830> prep<00:00:56.380> one<00:00:57.380> of<00:00:57.440> the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
rally and overall race prep one of the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.300 
rally and overall race prep one of the
things<00:00:57.680> right<00:00:57.920> here

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
things right here

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.640 
things right here
I<00:00:58.340> really<00:00:59.270> thought<00:00:59.480> when<00:00:59.870> we<00:00:59.930> first<00:01:00.230> got<00:01:00.410> this

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
I really thought when we first got this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.250 
I really thought when we first got this
bike<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.700> maybe<00:01:02.150> I<00:01:02.420> would<00:01:02.780> think<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.140> was<00:01:03.200> a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
bike that maybe I would think it was a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.370 
bike that maybe I would think it was a
little<00:01:03.650> bit<00:01:03.860> down<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.339> power<00:01:04.869> for<00:01:05.869> doing<00:01:06.109> real

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
little bit down on power for doing real

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.980 
little bit down on power for doing real
open<00:01:06.890> road<00:01:07.100> rally<00:01:07.429> rally<00:01:08.060> racing<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:08.960> I

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
open road rally rally racing so I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.330 
open road rally rally racing so I
thought<00:01:09.350> well<00:01:09.500> we'll<00:01:09.710> probably<00:01:09.950> put<00:01:10.219> an

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
thought well we'll probably put an

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.800 
thought well we'll probably put an
exhaust<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.969> just<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.329> get<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.509> little<00:01:11.630> more

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
exhaust on just to get a little more

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.029 
exhaust on just to get a little more
top-end<00:01:12.109> a<00:01:12.500> bit<00:01:12.820> after<00:01:13.820> testing<00:01:14.329> I<00:01:14.920> love<00:01:15.920> it

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
top-end a bit after testing I love it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.859 
top-end a bit after testing I love it
just<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.460> way<00:01:16.579> it<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.789> and<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.299> see<00:01:17.509> absolutely

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
just the way it is and I see absolutely

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.959 
just the way it is and I see absolutely
no<00:01:18.049> reason<00:01:18.079> to<00:01:18.439> put<00:01:18.770> an<00:01:19.009> exhaust<00:01:19.310> on<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.670> it's

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
no reason to put an exhaust on it it's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.690 
no reason to put an exhaust on it it's
just<00:01:20.270> perfect<00:01:20.749> if<00:01:20.929> we<00:01:21.170> had<00:01:21.350> more<00:01:21.649> power<00:01:22.009> it

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
just perfect if we had more power it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.819 
just perfect if we had more power it
would<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:23.149> be<00:01:23.270> tearing<00:01:23.600> up<00:01:23.659> tires<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.380> I'm

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
would just be tearing up tires and I'm

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.830 
would just be tearing up tires and I'm
really<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.640> know<00:01:25.729> tire<00:01:26.149> life<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.630> definitely

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
really you know tire life is definitely

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.529 
really you know tire life is definitely
gonna<00:01:27.109> be<00:01:27.259> something<00:01:27.499> we're<00:01:27.770> concerned<00:01:28.100> about

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
gonna be something we're concerned about

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:35.020 
gonna be something we're concerned about
so<00:01:30.429> here<00:01:31.429> we<00:01:31.520> go<00:01:33.100> discard<00:01:34.100> SRT<00:01:34.729> that's<00:01:34.939> the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
so here we go discard SRT that's the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.880 
so here we go discard SRT that's the
first<00:01:35.210> time<00:01:35.390> we've<00:01:35.509> run<00:01:35.719> that<00:01:35.929> mounts<00:01:36.439> on<00:01:36.560> real

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
first time we've run that mounts on real

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.219 
first time we've run that mounts on real
slick<00:01:37.249> nice<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.819> clean<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:38.929> got<00:01:39.079> some

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
slick nice and clean it's got some

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.630 
slick nice and clean it's got some
crappy<00:01:39.469> tires<00:01:39.829> on<00:01:40.100> here<00:01:40.340> we're<00:01:40.490> actually

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.719 
what I wanted four pegs here fast way
now<00:01:55.880> has<00:01:56.270> bigger<00:01:56.810> versions<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.560> these<00:01:57.740> but

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
now has bigger versions of these but

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.629 
now has bigger versions of these but
honestly<00:01:59.689> I<00:01:59.749> really<00:02:00.139> like<00:02:00.530> these<00:02:00.799> one<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
honestly I really like these one of the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.449 
honestly I really like these one of the
problems<00:02:02.179> that<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.479> can<00:02:03.049> run<00:02:03.409> into<00:02:03.619> it

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
problems that you can run into it

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:05.919 
problems that you can run into it
wouldn't<00:02:04.729> be<00:02:04.789> so<00:02:04.969> much<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.329> rally<00:02:05.569> but<00:02:05.810> with

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
wouldn't be so much for a rally but with

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.370 
wouldn't be so much for a rally but with
the<00:02:06.049> longer<00:02:06.469> peg<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:08.080> when<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.200> make<00:02:09.350> contact

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
the longer peg it when you make contact

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.470 
the longer peg it when you make contact
this<00:02:10.100> way<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.430> doesn't<00:02:10.460> fold<00:02:11.450> quite<00:02:11.990> as<00:02:12.170> easy

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
this way it doesn't fold quite as easy

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.280 
this way it doesn't fold quite as easy
so<00:02:14.480> I'm

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
so I'm

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.140 
so I'm
with<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.769> steel<00:02:16.040> peg<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.640> know<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.939> would<00:02:17.030> be

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
with the steel peg I know it would be

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.059 
with the steel peg I know it would be
super<00:02:17.540> durable<00:02:17.750> if<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.170> go<00:02:18.349> sliding<00:02:18.769> down<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
super durable if I go sliding down the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.979 
super durable if I go sliding down the
road<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.519> thing's<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.939> gonna<00:02:20.120> get<00:02:20.450> bent<00:02:20.810> or

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
road that thing's not gonna get bent or

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.800 
road that thing's not gonna get bent or
beat<00:02:21.170> up<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:22.519> also<00:02:22.640> brings<00:02:22.970> me<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.420> our

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
beat up at all it also brings me to our

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.929 
beat up at all it also brings me to our
little<00:02:24.019> break<00:02:24.260> snake<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:24.860> now<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.730> would

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
little break snake here now you would

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.789 
little break snake here now you would
think<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.299> open<00:02:26.540> terrain<00:02:26.720> racing<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:27.439> just

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
think for open terrain racing like just

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.800 
think for open terrain racing like just
going<00:02:28.040> down<00:02:28.189> roads<00:02:28.549> breaks<00:02:29.299> think<00:02:29.540> wouldn't

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
going down roads breaks think wouldn't

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.750 
going down roads breaks think wouldn't
really<00:02:29.930> be<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> big<00:02:30.409> deal<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:30.799> its<00:02:31.129> reason<00:02:31.730> for

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
really be a big deal but its reason for

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.080 
really be a big deal but its reason for
it<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:33.049> if<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.829> low-side<00:02:34.489> going<00:02:34.819> down<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
it is is if you low-side going down the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.270 
it is is if you low-side going down the
road<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.599> drag<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.470> brake<00:02:36.680> pedal<00:02:37.040> against

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
road and drag the brake pedal against

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.399 
road and drag the brake pedal against
the<00:02:37.430> ground<00:02:37.579> it<00:02:37.849> will<00:02:38.120> break<00:02:39.370> right<00:02:40.370> here<00:02:41.409> see

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
the ground it will break right here see

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.399 
the ground it will break right here see
that<00:02:43.359> done<00:02:44.359> that<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.569> couple<00:02:44.599> of<00:02:44.930> times<00:02:45.140> in

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
that done that a couple of times in

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.800 
that done that a couple of times in
races<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.159> so<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.879> brake<00:02:47.060> snake<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.450> actually

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
races and so the brake snake is actually

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.110 
races and so the brake snake is actually
to<00:02:47.900> help<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.319> keep<00:02:48.650> from<00:02:48.680> moving<00:02:49.459> if<00:02:49.879> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
to help it to keep from moving if it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.460 
to help it to keep from moving if it
gets<00:02:50.269> hit<00:02:50.450> against<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> road<00:02:50.959> hey<00:02:51.140> me<00:02:51.290> show

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
gets hit against the road hey me show

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.449 
gets hit against the road hey me show

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.339 
see I've got the 19 litre tank mounted
that<00:03:06.440> thing<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.889> jumbo<00:03:07.750> one<00:03:08.750> day<00:03:08.989> it's<00:03:09.200> gonna

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
that thing is jumbo one day it's gonna

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.770 
that thing is jumbo one day it's gonna
be<00:03:09.440> absolutely<00:03:09.829> necessary<00:03:10.639> I<00:03:10.849> think<00:03:11.420> for<00:03:11.690> the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
be absolutely necessary I think for the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.589 
be absolutely necessary I think for the
other<00:03:11.930> days<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.530> also<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.340> 13<00:03:13.700> litre<00:03:13.909> it's

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
other days I also have a 13 litre it's

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.289 
other days I also have a 13 litre it's
got<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.780> fuel<00:03:15.079> pump<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.470> already<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:17.030> will<00:03:17.150> be

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
got a fuel pump and already that will be

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.119 
got a fuel pump and already that will be
our<00:03:17.420> backup<00:03:17.629> tank<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.260> think<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.590> can<00:03:18.739> run<00:03:18.950> it

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
our backup tank and I think I can run it

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.159 
our backup tank and I think I can run it
for<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.910> other<00:03:20.060> days<00:03:20.329> which<00:03:20.599> would<00:03:20.690> be<00:03:20.810> much

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
for the other days which would be much

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.509 
for the other days which would be much
much<00:03:21.530> better<00:03:22.629> SRT<00:03:23.629> fork<00:03:23.930> radiator<00:03:24.889> braces<00:03:25.099> in

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
much better SRT fork radiator braces in

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.689 
much better SRT fork radiator braces in
there<00:03:25.669> on<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:27.049> suspension<00:03:27.500> normally<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.459> run

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
there on the suspension normally I run

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.930 
there on the suspension normally I run
for<00:03:29.000> six<00:03:29.359> Forks<00:03:29.780> for<00:03:30.079> race<00:03:30.379> use<00:03:30.769> for<00:03:31.310> forest

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
for six Forks for race use for forest

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.479 
for six Forks for race use for forest
stock<00:03:32.410> for<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.500> extra<00:03:33.769> weight<00:03:33.919> we've<00:03:34.129> put<00:03:34.340> on

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
stock for the extra weight we've put on

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.189 
stock for the extra weight we've put on
a<00:03:34.519> gun<00:03:34.849> to<00:03:34.970> four<00:03:35.269> eights<00:03:35.449> I<00:03:35.690> think<00:03:35.900> they'll<00:03:36.049> be

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
a gun to four eights I think they'll be

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.360 
a gun to four eights I think they'll be
just<00:03:36.440> about<00:03:36.620> right

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
just about right

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.580 
just about right
I'm<00:03:37.940> actually<00:03:38.239> really<00:03:38.629> trying<00:03:39.169> to<00:03:39.260> keep<00:03:39.379> it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
I'm actually really trying to keep it

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.369 
I'm actually really trying to keep it
pretty<00:03:40.120> soft<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.449> don't<00:03:41.629> want<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.959> bike<00:03:42.109> to<00:03:42.139> be

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
pretty soft I don't want the bike to be

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.479 
pretty soft I don't want the bike to be
too<00:03:42.590> stiff<00:03:44.470> all<00:03:45.470> right<00:03:45.620> let's<00:03:45.829> get<00:03:46.010> up<00:03:46.069> front

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
too stiff all right let's get up front

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.110 
too stiff all right let's get up front
headlight<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:48.220> think<00:03:49.220> they<00:03:49.370> may<00:03:49.549> send<00:03:49.849> us<00:03:49.970> down

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
headlight I think they may send us down

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.360 
headlight I think they may send us down
the<00:03:50.299> road<00:03:50.449> in<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.780> morning<00:03:51.019> in<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.680> dark<00:03:52.040> one

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
the road in the morning in the dark one

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.390 
the road in the morning in the dark one
day<00:03:52.609> so<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.269> put<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.900> Baja<00:03:54.199> designs<00:03:54.620> s2<00:03:55.220> on

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
day so I put the Baja designs s2 on

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.759 
day so I put the Baja designs s2 on
there<00:03:55.639> a<00:03:55.760> couple<00:03:56.599> of<00:03:56.690> reasons<00:03:56.870> specifically

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
there a couple of reasons specifically

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.670 
there a couple of reasons specifically
I've<00:03:57.889> done<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:58.250> one<00:03:58.549> is<00:03:58.760> I've<00:03:59.540> got<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.019> in<00:04:00.379> the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
I've done this one is I've got it in the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.129 
I've done this one is I've got it in the
poly<00:04:01.099> sport<00:04:01.430> headlight<00:04:01.730> shell<00:04:02.030> which<00:04:02.810> sits

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
poly sport headlight shell which sits

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.460 
poly sport headlight shell which sits
lower<00:04:03.560> than<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.699> stock<00:04:05.060> headlight<00:04:05.569> doesn't

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
lower than the stock headlight doesn't

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.289 
lower than the stock headlight doesn't
set<00:04:06.590> up<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:06.919> air<00:04:07.010> as<00:04:07.129> much<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:07.970> sits

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
set up in the air as much and it sits

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.110 
set up in the air as much and it sits
out<00:04:08.449> pretty<00:04:09.409> good<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.949> still<00:04:10.609> had<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.849> cut<00:04:11.000> the

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
out pretty good I still had to cut the

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.420 
out pretty good I still had to cut the
top<00:04:11.329> off<00:04:11.510> just<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.959> little<00:04:12.290> bit<00:04:12.500> but<00:04:13.220> that

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
top off just a little bit but that

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.610 
top off just a little bit but that
actually<00:04:13.819> makes<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:14.269> really<00:04:14.540> nice<00:04:14.780> setup<00:04:15.199> with

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
actually makes a really nice setup with

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.830 
actually makes a really nice setup with
the<00:04:16.519> rally<00:04:16.729> gear<00:04:17.090> also<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.430> back<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:20.120> s2

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
the rally gear also in the back the s2

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.589 
the rally gear also in the back the s2
is<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.169> little<00:04:21.829> tiny<00:04:22.159> setup<00:04:22.940> back<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:23.510> it

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
is a little tiny setup back there so it

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.330 
is a little tiny setup back there so it
takes<00:04:23.780> up<00:04:23.930> almost<00:04:24.139> no<00:04:24.500> room<00:04:24.830> inside<00:04:25.280> the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
takes up almost no room inside the

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.250 
takes up almost no room inside the
headlight<00:04:25.610> shell<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.810> way<00:04:26.960> it's<00:04:27.110> not

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
headlight shell that way it's not

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.059 
headlight shell that way it's not
pushing<00:04:27.680> against<00:04:27.889> a<00:04:27.979> of<00:04:28.039> our<00:04:28.219> other<00:04:28.400> wire

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
pushing against a of our other wire

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.070 
pushing against a of our other wire
any<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:29.789> that<00:04:29.940> should<00:04:30.449> be<00:04:30.479> perfect<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.990> think

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
any of that should be perfect I think

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.559 
any of that should be perfect I think
puts<00:04:31.470> out<00:04:31.759> plenty<00:04:32.759> of<00:04:32.849> white<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.270> haven't

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
puts out plenty of white I haven't

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.089 
puts out plenty of white I haven't
actually<00:04:33.720> got<00:04:33.930> hooked<00:04:34.259> up<00:04:34.379> yet<00:04:34.620> but<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.830> think

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
actually got hooked up yet but I think

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.390 
actually got hooked up yet but I think
it'll<00:04:35.220> be<00:04:35.310> just<00:04:35.340> fine<00:04:36.650> up<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.860> top<00:04:38.039> of<00:04:38.220> course

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
it'll be just fine up on top of course

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.270 
it'll be just fine up on top of course
we've<00:04:38.550> got<00:04:38.759> all<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.060> our<00:04:39.650> rally<00:04:40.650> management

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
we've got all of our rally management

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.820 
we've got all of our rally management
package<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.569> we<00:04:42.690> used<00:04:42.930> last<00:04:43.199> year<00:04:43.409> so<00:04:43.710> we've

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
package that we used last year so we've

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.990 
package that we used last year so we've
got<00:04:43.949> Roebuck<00:04:44.430> holder

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
got Roebuck holder

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.129 
got Roebuck holder
we've<00:04:45.509> got<00:04:45.840> our<00:04:46.190> rally<00:04:47.190> Pro<00:04:47.639> I've<00:04:48.360> got<00:04:48.509> my<00:04:48.629> GPS

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
we've got our rally Pro I've got my GPS

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.070 
we've got our rally Pro I've got my GPS
set<00:04:49.440> up<00:04:49.590> we<00:04:50.190> may<00:04:50.550> be<00:04:50.610> using<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.360> new<00:04:51.389> ICO<00:04:52.050> and

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
set up we may be using the new ICO and

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.559 
set up we may be using the new ICO and
mount<00:04:52.379> it<00:04:52.470> right<00:04:52.530> here<00:04:53.069> that<00:04:53.310> is<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.550> GPS<00:04:54.060> cap

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
mount it right here that is the GPS cap

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.290 
mount it right here that is the GPS cap
heading<00:04:54.960> also<00:04:55.710> works<00:04:55.919> as<00:04:56.069> a<00:04:56.099> backup<00:04:56.430> odometer

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
heading also works as a backup odometer

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.520 
heading also works as a backup odometer
without<00:04:57.900> having<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.560> run<00:04:58.830> a<00:05:00.020> wheel<00:05:01.020> sensor

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
without having to run a wheel sensor

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.920 
without having to run a wheel sensor
because<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:01.979> GPS<00:05:02.490> base<00:05:02.759> that<00:05:03.449> will<00:05:03.569> allow<00:05:03.780> me

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
because it's GPS base that will allow me

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.020 
because it's GPS base that will allow me
to<00:05:03.960> actually<00:05:04.289> take<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.620> GPS<00:05:05.069> off<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.759> dash

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
to actually take the GPS off of the dash

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.839 
to actually take the GPS off of the dash
here<00:05:07.849> array<00:05:08.849> your<00:05:09.030> ICO<00:05:09.360> thumb<00:05:09.990> switch<00:05:10.199> and

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
here array your ICO thumb switch and

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.740 
here array your ICO thumb switch and
then<00:05:11.849> our<00:05:12.000> Road<00:05:12.240> book<00:05:14.150> motorised<00:05:15.150> Road<00:05:15.479> books

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.959 
then our Road book motorised Road books
so<00:05:15.990> takes<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.190> little<00:05:17.340> bit<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.639> kind<00:05:17.819> of<00:05:17.849> figure

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
so takes a little bit to kind of figure

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.520 
so takes a little bit to kind of figure
out<00:05:18.150> how<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.330> get<00:05:18.539> all<00:05:18.599> that<00:05:18.719> set<00:05:18.960> up<00:05:19.110> just<00:05:19.379> the

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
out how to get all that set up just the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.559 
out how to get all that set up just the
way<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:19.680> want<00:05:20.009> it<00:05:20.129> but<00:05:20.310> I'm<00:05:20.430> pretty<00:05:20.669> close<00:05:21.240> there

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
way I want it but I'm pretty close there

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.779 
way I want it but I'm pretty close there
as<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:22.560> can<00:05:22.590> see<00:05:22.740> with<00:05:23.069> all<00:05:23.250> this<00:05:23.430> stuff

just<00:05:48.690> testing<00:05:48.900> those<00:05:49.319> the<00:05:50.130> leverage<00:05:50.639> seems<00:05:50.909> to

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
just testing those the leverage seems to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.339 
just testing those the leverage seems to
be<00:05:51.090> a<00:05:51.120> little<00:05:51.300> bit<00:05:51.449> different<00:05:51.779> on<00:05:51.840> them<00:05:52.020> so

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
be a little bit different on them so

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.350 
be a little bit different on them so
we're<00:05:52.560> running<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.979> Blues<00:05:53.460> instead<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.210> the

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
we're running the Blues instead of the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.589 
we're running the Blues instead of the
traditional<00:05:54.569> reds<00:05:55.409> or<00:05:55.680> yellows<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:57.360> just

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
traditional reds or yellows that just

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.089 
traditional reds or yellows that just
seems<00:05:57.779> to<00:05:57.840> be<00:05:58.020> what<00:05:58.199> they<00:05:58.349> want<00:05:58.379> I've<00:05:58.919> got<00:05:58.949> a

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
seems to be what they want I've got a

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.439 
seems to be what they want I've got a
little<00:05:59.340> more<00:05:59.430> testing<00:05:59.669> to<00:05:59.969> do<00:06:00.090> to<00:06:00.210> get<00:06:00.330> that

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
little more testing to do to get that

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.110 
little more testing to do to get that
all<00:06:00.599> figured<00:06:00.629> out<00:06:01.069> but<00:06:02.069> all<00:06:02.279> of<00:06:02.520> those<00:06:02.699> parts

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
all figured out but all of those parts

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.110 
all figured out but all of those parts
make<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.330> pretty<00:06:04.080> clean<00:06:04.680> set<00:06:05.159> up<00:06:05.340> across<00:06:05.819> the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
make a pretty clean set up across the

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:14.480 
make a pretty clean set up across the
bars<00:06:06.590> pretty<00:06:07.590> happy<00:06:08.550> with<00:06:08.669> that

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.580 

again<00:06:15.490> because<00:06:15.820> I<00:06:15.970> I<00:06:16.150> think<00:06:16.690> they<00:06:16.900> may<00:06:17.199> run<00:06:17.410> us

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
again because I I think they may run us

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.770 
again because I I think they may run us
in<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:17.860> dark<00:06:18.130> I<00:06:18.400> have<00:06:18.759> gone<00:06:19.180> ahead<00:06:19.330> and<00:06:19.509> hooked

in the dark I have gone ahead and hooked

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.590 
in the dark I have gone ahead and hooked
up<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.169> light<00:06:20.530> in<00:06:20.800> the<00:06:21.220> road<00:06:21.400> book<00:06:21.699> and<00:06:22.030> I've

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
up the light in the road book and I've

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.150 
up the light in the road book and I've
also<00:06:22.780> hooked<00:06:23.169> up<00:06:23.289> so<00:06:23.320> that<00:06:23.650> we're<00:06:23.800> now<00:06:23.919> running

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
also hooked up so that we're now running

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.290

that's<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:30.820> only<00:06:31.030> way<00:06:31.150> to<00:06:31.210> get<00:06:31.449> a<00:06:31.479> backlight

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
that's the only way to get a backlight
