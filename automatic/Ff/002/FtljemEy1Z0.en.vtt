00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
are from the Chinese rainforest so they

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
are from the Chinese rainforest so they
need<00:00:40.290> high<00:00:40.530> humidity<00:00:40.890> levels<00:00:41.489> seventy

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
need high humidity levels seventy

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
need high humidity levels seventy
percent<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:43.050> precise<00:00:43.940> anything<00:00:44.940> above

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
percent be precise anything above

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
percent be precise anything above
seventy<00:00:45.510> percent<00:00:45.600> does<00:00:46.079> mimic<00:00:46.289> breeding

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
seventy percent does mimic breeding

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.029 
seventy percent does mimic breeding
seasons<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.879> won't<00:00:48.030> talk<00:00:48.149> about<00:00:48.329> that

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
seasons but we won't talk about that

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.400 
seasons but we won't talk about that
basically<00:00:50.039> there's<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:50.550> ways<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.910> reach

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
basically there's two ways you can reach

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.869 
basically there's two ways you can reach
the<00:00:52.410> humidity<00:00:52.829> levels<00:00:53.100> firstly<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.820> can

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the humidity levels firstly you can

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.459 
the humidity levels firstly you can
spray<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> pressured<00:00:54.930> bottle<00:00:55.260> which

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
spray it with a pressured bottle which

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
spray it with a pressured bottle which
you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:55.949> any<00:00:56.329> garden<00:00:57.329> center<00:00:57.719> or

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you can get from any garden center or

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.920 
you can get from any garden center or
fish<00:00:58.199> store<00:00:58.469> or<00:00:58.620> anything<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> B&amp;Q<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
fish store or anything like that B&amp;Q the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.599 
fish store or anything like that B&amp;Q the
battle<00:01:01.140> fiber<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.739> they're<00:01:02.129> worth<00:01:02.280> every

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
battle fiber and they're worth every

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.070 
battle fiber and they're worth every
penny<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.270> spray<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.449> three<00:01:03.750> times<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> day

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
penny just spray it three times a day

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.929 
penny just spray it three times a day
one<00:01:04.439> more<00:01:04.710> than<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.040> afternoon<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.790> one
