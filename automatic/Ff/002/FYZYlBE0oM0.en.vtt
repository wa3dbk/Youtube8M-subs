last 100 parts any point of interest we

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.920 
last 100 parts any point of interest we
can<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.520> take<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> look<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> figure

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
can actually take a look at and figure

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830 
can actually take a look at and figure
out<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:44.309> particular<00:00:45.000> characteristic

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
out that this particular characteristic

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
out that this particular characteristic
was<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.350> Tolerance<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.670> can

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
was out of Tolerance and then we can

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.940 
was out of Tolerance and then we can
point<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.450> what<00:00:48.780> incremental<00:00:49.710> part

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
point and see what incremental part

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.470 
point and see what incremental part
number<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.399> serial<00:00:50.850> number<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
number or serial number this is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.319 
number or serial number this is
represented<00:00:52.170> by<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.149> do

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
represented by and then what we can do

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.770 
represented by and then what we can do
is<00:00:54.570> further<00:00:55.110> select<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.039> information<00:00:56.780> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
is further select this information to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.380 
is further select this information to
view<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> flatness<00:00:58.559> plot<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.039> that

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
view the flatness plot of that

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
view the flatness plot of that
particular<00:01:00.390> serial<00:01:00.750> number<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
particular serial number so in this

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
particular serial number so in this
particular<00:01:02.399> example<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> be

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
particular example we're going to be

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
particular example we're going to be
looking<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> serial<00:01:04.409> number<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
looking up the serial number and the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.630 
looking up the serial number and the
serial<00:01:05.760> number<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.420> three<00:01:06.630> five<00:01:06.960> two<00:01:07.460> then<00:01:08.460> we

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
serial number was three five two then we

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.210 
serial number was three five two then we
will<00:01:08.760> hit<00:01:08.970> update<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.830> then<00:01:10.830> we'll<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
will hit update and then we'll get the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.670 
will hit update and then we'll get the
new<00:01:11.369> flatness<00:01:11.909> plot<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.680> represented

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
new flatness plot that was represented

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
new flatness plot that was represented
by<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> particular<00:01:14.490> serial<00:01:14.790> number<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> all

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
by that particular serial number and all

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
by that particular serial number and all
of<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.200> information<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.950> also<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> be

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
of this information is also going to be

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.840 
of this information is also going to be
available<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.659> being<00:01:19.280> manipulated<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.430> our

available to being manipulated in our
flatness<00:01:21.509> plot<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.770> simply<00:01:23.130> click<00:01:23.400> on

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
flatness plot so we can simply click on

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
flatness plot so we can simply click on
a<00:01:23.580> point<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> figure<00:01:25.049> out<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
a point and figure out what the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
a point and figure out what the
deviation<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.820> particular<00:01:27.390> part

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
deviation was for that particular part

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
deviation was for that particular part
at<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.049> particular<00:01:28.259> point<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.890> time<00:01:31.009> what<00:01:32.009> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
at that particular point in time what we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.160 
at that particular point in time what we
can<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> graphical

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
can also do is get a graphical

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
can also do is get a graphical
representation<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:35.040> different<00:01:35.640> information

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
representation of different information

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.539 
representation of different information
such<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.869> perpendicularity<00:01:37.829> call-out<00:01:38.400> in

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
such as a perpendicularity call-out in

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.929 
such as a perpendicularity call-out in
this<00:01:38.729> case<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> would<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.579> look<00:01:41.729> at

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
this case so if I would like to look at

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
this case so if I would like to look at
a<00:01:41.970> different<00:01:42.240> amount<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.720> runs<00:01:42.990> let's<00:01:43.380> say<00:01:43.590> for

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
a different amount of runs let's say for

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.840 
a different amount of runs let's say for
example<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> last<00:01:44.460> 250<00:01:46.189> hour<00:01:47.189> trend<00:01:47.549> chart

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
example the last 250 hour trend chart

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.600 
example the last 250 hour trend chart
will<00:01:48.030> show<00:01:48.270> us<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.990> last<00:01:49.170> 250<00:01:49.710> runs<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> then

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
will show us the last 250 runs and then

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
will show us the last 250 runs and then
I<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.149> had<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.799> actual<00:01:52.799> result

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
I can see that I had one actual result

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880 
I can see that I had one actual result
that<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.850> Tolerance<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.740> click

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that was out of Tolerance so I can click

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
that was out of Tolerance so I can click
on<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.189> result<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.820> again<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.810> figure

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
on this result and again I can figure

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.590 
on this result and again I can figure
out<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.979> actual<00:01:59.700> part<00:01:59.969> number<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> was

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
out which actual part number this was

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.389 
out which actual part number this was
and<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.649> ahead<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.920> view<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and that we can go ahead and view this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.889 
and that we can go ahead and view this
information<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.149> see<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> picture

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
information to see what the picture

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.780 
information to see what the picture
actually<00:02:04.020> looked<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.469> at<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.340> point<00:02:05.399> in

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
actually looked like at that point in

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.680 
actually looked like at that point in
time<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:07.849> we'll<00:02:08.849> select<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.270> incremental

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
time so we'll select the incremental

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
time so we'll select the incremental
part<00:02:09.959> number<00:02:10.259> we'll<00:02:10.619> update<00:02:10.890> our<00:02:11.099> results<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
part number we'll update our results and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910 
part number we'll update our results and
then<00:02:12.959> we'll<00:02:13.110> get<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> view<00:02:13.590> or

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
then we'll get a view or

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
then we'll get a view or
picture<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:15.000> particular<00:02:15.540> production

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
picture of that particular production

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.589 
picture of that particular production
information<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.620> point<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.099> time<00:02:17.599> part

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
information at that point in time part

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.330 
information at that point in time part
stories<00:02:18.930> are<00:02:19.050> also<00:02:19.410> great<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:19.890> process

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
stories are also great for process

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
stories are also great for process
analysis<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.599> this<00:02:21.810> example<00:02:22.230> we're<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:23.040> to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
analysis in this example we're going to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.930 
analysis in this example we're going to
open<00:02:23.250> up<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.580> report<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:25.760> dedicated<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
open up a report that is dedicated to a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.050 
open up a report that is dedicated to a
particular<00:02:27.420> production<00:02:28.080> part<00:02:28.940> we're<00:02:29.940> going

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
particular production part we're going

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.280 
particular production part we're going
to<00:02:30.120> update<00:02:30.330> our<00:02:30.510> results<00:02:31.020> for<00:02:31.200> this

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
to update our results for this

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.340 
to update our results for this
particular<00:02:31.830> report<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.690> we'll<00:02:33.690> see<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> few

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
particular report and we'll see a few

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.690 
particular report and we'll see a few
different<00:02:34.440> views<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.250> take<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> look

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
different views that we can take a look

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.080 
different views that we can take a look
at<00:02:35.880> first<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.930> our<00:02:37.080> summary<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.680> our<00:02:37.830> last<00:02:38.090> last

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
at first is our summary of our last last

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.860 
at first is our summary of our last last
measurement<00:02:39.510> run<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.850> then<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:42.269> can<00:02:42.420> also<00:02:42.540> see

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
measurement run and then we can also see

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.600 
measurement run and then we can also see
the<00:02:43.080> results<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.800> two<00:02:43.950> positions<00:02:44.459> from

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the results of the two positions from

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.210 
the results of the two positions from
our<00:02:44.790> last<00:02:44.940> particular<00:02:45.360> run<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.810> well

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
our last particular run as well

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.080 
our last particular run as well
specifically<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.370> see<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.000> our

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
specifically we can see that one of our

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.699 
specifically we can see that one of our
troop<00:02:48.300> positions<00:02:48.450> results<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.319> out<00:02:49.560> of

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
troop positions results is out of

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.240 
troop positions results is out of
Tolerance

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
Tolerance

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250 
Tolerance
so<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:50.940> we'd<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.360> further<00:02:51.600> investigate

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
so if we'd like to further investigate

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.559 
so if we'd like to further investigate
this<00:02:52.440> particular<00:02:52.950> data<00:02:53.130> point<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.239> go<00:02:54.269> and

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
this particular data point we can go and

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.809 
this particular data point we can go and
click<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.900> process<00:02:55.140> analysis<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.130> see<00:02:56.700> that

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
click on process analysis and see that

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.309 
click on process analysis and see that
we<00:02:56.940> actually<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.420> quite<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.720> few<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.140> last

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
we actually have quite a few of the last

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.449 
we actually have quite a few of the last
results<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.980> are<00:02:59.069> actually<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.400> of

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
results that are actually out of

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.870 
results that are actually out of
Tolerance<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> what<00:03:00.989> we<00:03:01.080> can<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.500> use<00:03:01.530> our

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
Tolerance so what we can do is use our

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.850 
Tolerance so what we can do is use our
variable<00:03:02.880> information<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.600> sort<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.530> figure

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
variable information to sort and figure

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.100 
variable information to sort and figure
out<00:03:04.950> why<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:06.110> particularly

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
out why this actually is particularly

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.750 
out why this actually is particularly
what<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.739> do<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.610> were

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
what we can do is we can we were

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.400 
what we can do is we can we were
recording<00:03:09.090> at<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.390> time<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.690> production<00:03:10.140> what

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
recording at the time of production what

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.840 
recording at the time of production what
machining<00:03:10.799> center<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.190> parts<00:03:11.459> were<00:03:11.580> coming

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
machining center these parts were coming

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.890 
machining center these parts were coming
off<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.989> if<00:03:13.080> we<00:03:13.230> select<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:14.190> by<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.610> and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
off of so if we select one by one and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.650 
off of so if we select one by one and
then<00:03:15.900> update<00:03:16.319> our<00:03:16.440> results<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.760> further

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
then update our results we can further

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.740 
then update our results we can further
investigate<00:03:19.489> which<00:03:20.489> results<00:03:21.180> were<00:03:21.420> coming

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
investigate which results were coming

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.300 
investigate which results were coming
off<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.140> particular<00:03:22.650> machining<00:03:23.010> Center

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
off of this particular machining Center

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.009 
off of this particular machining Center
and<00:03:23.400> we<00:03:23.459> can<00:03:23.609> see<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.060> last<00:03:24.239> out<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
and we can see that the last out of the

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.860 
and we can see that the last out of the
last<00:03:25.200> 50<00:03:25.709> parts<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.549> were<00:03:26.670> ran<00:03:26.880> none<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
last 50 parts that were ran none of the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.210 
last 50 parts that were ran none of the
results<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.350> were<00:03:28.530> out<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.799> Tolerance<00:03:28.950> were

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
results that were out of Tolerance were

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.699 
results that were out of Tolerance were
due<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.519> this<00:03:29.640> machining<00:03:30.120> Center<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.500> can

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
due to this machining Center so we can

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.140 
due to this machining Center so we can
also<00:03:31.829> sort<00:03:32.130> by<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> different<00:03:32.760> one<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:33.000> this

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
also sort by a different one in this

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.440 
also sort by a different one in this
case<00:03:34.070> we'll<00:03:35.070> update<00:03:35.250> our<00:03:35.400> results<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.120> we<00:03:36.299> can

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
case we'll update our results and we can

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.819 
case we'll update our results and we can
see<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> trend<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.350> due<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.680> this

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829
