00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.980 

hey<00:00:05.160> it's<00:00:05.310> Allison<00:00:05.759> from<00:00:05.910> Mahalo<00:00:06.270> comm<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
hey it's Allison from Mahalo comm and

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.810 
hey it's Allison from Mahalo comm and
today<00:00:07.319> we're<00:00:07.470> going<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.740> talk<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:07.919> subsets

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
today we're going to talk about subsets

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.330 
today we're going to talk about subsets
and<00:00:09.030> proper<00:00:09.510> subsets<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.650> let's<00:00:10.950> look<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.219> our

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
and proper subsets so let's look at our

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.120 
and proper subsets so let's look at our
set<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.870> set<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.349> contains<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
set a here the set a contains the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.269 
set a here the set a contains the
elements<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.790> B<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.450> C<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.100> just

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
elements a B and C now what if I just

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.189 
elements a B and C now what if I just
take<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.520> couple<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.029> those<00:00:18.180> elements<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.810> B

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
take a couple of those elements like B

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.349 
take a couple of those elements like B
and<00:00:19.350> C<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.890> set<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.460> contains<00:00:24.119> B

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and C so the set that just contains B

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.330 
and C so the set that just contains B
and<00:00:24.510> C<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.830> subset<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.480> set<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.980> because<00:00:28.980> B

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and C is a subset of the set a because B

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.139 
and C is a subset of the set a because B
and<00:00:29.490> C<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.369> part<00:00:32.700> seems<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and C are in a now this part seems a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.000 
and C are in a now this part seems a
little<00:00:33.239> confusing<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.950> set<00:00:35.250> ABC<00:00:37.010> which

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
little confusing but the set ABC which

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
little confusing but the set ABC which
is<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> elements<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.719> set<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
is all of the elements that are in set a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.850 
is all of the elements that are in set a
that's<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> subset<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.059> set<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that's also a subset of set a so a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.700 
that's also a subset of set a so a
subset<00:00:44.640> means<00:00:44.940> either<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> elements

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
subset means either all of the elements

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 
subset means either all of the elements
that<00:00:46.860> exist<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> original<00:00:47.670> set<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.450> in

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that exist in the original set are in

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.439 
that exist in the original set are in
the<00:00:48.899> subset<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.149> elements

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the subset or just some of the elements

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.150 
the subset or just some of the elements
that<00:00:51.600> exist<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> original<00:00:52.320> set<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:53.039> in

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that exist in the original set are in

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.569 
that exist in the original set are in
the<00:00:53.250> subset<00:00:53.730> now<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.719> proper<00:00:55.140> subset<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.890> one

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the subset now a proper subset is one

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
the subset now a proper subset is one
that<00:00:57.059> only<00:00:57.329> contains<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> elements

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that only contains some of the elements

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.859 
that only contains some of the elements
of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> original<00:00:59.699> set<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.960> B<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> C<00:01:03.619> are<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
of the original set so B and C are a

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.140 
of the original set so B and C are a
proper<00:01:06.869> subset<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.799> set<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.250> without<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> line

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
proper subset of set a without the line

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.960 
proper subset of set a without the line
under<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.810> means<00:01:09.960> proper<00:01:10.229> subset<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.070> B

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
under it that means proper subset a B

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270 
under it that means proper subset a B
and<00:01:12.119> C<00:01:12.330> are<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.840> proper<00:01:13.409> subset<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.920> set<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and C are not a proper subset of set a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
and C are not a proper subset of set a
because<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.119> everything<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
because that's everything we have in a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.219 
because that's everything we have in a
for<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> proper<00:01:17.909> subset<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
for it to be a proper subset we have to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.260 
for it to be a proper subset we have to
have<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.470> least<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:20.100> extra<00:01:20.520> element<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
have at least one extra element in the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.260 
have at least one extra element in the
original<00:01:21.659> set<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.439> isn't<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.830> subset<00:01:23.400> so

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
original set that isn't in the subset so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
original set that isn't in the subset so
that's<00:01:24.479> an<00:01:24.659> example<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.320> subsets<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> proper

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
that's an example of subsets and proper

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.719 
that's an example of subsets and proper
subsets<00:01:28.040> thanks<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.220> learning<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.579> me
