00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 but we will see we will see not 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.700
 I understand people who say that four 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.099
 people 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.650
 If there are six legs, it is not 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.599
 physically possible this is going to be the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.599
 typical par games 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.720
 that neither culÃ© 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.050
 it may be that the black pattern and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.550
 beheaded is that it looks or is another 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.550
 person who is inside the shirt 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.219
 why 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.600
 the rap 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.949
 peter a 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.120
 left then what was it that you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 led to kill all those innocents 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.720
 people the elbows was for all 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.720
 parts 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.620
 Who will ride me on horseback? 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620
 shit 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.910
 with comments comments 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.470
 you have to coordinate to hang the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.470
 vanity 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.010
 We do not have anything 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.380
 the important thing is to know 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.140
 the tensions 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.780
 that I put your face like a steak 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.780
 champion 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.430
 great that has been a hallmark of the house 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.430
 Is hard to learn 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 yes 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.970
 Of course, you do not charter 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.330
 the franc of the movie coming soon 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.330
 the best like none 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.590
 for the media version 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.630
 I have needed you to believe all 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.970
 this layer of certain receipt did not expect 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.990
 it's all a platinum I do not like it to hurt 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.990
 has done to the cole 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.590
 I've been thinking that you do not trust me 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.629
 men of little faith suspicious 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.590
 to see has been hiding I do not go out 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.590
 throughout the game
