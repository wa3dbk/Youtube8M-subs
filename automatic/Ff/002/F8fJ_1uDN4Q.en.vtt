about<00:00:49.649> these<00:00:49.800> wheels<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.930> they're<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
about these wheels is that they're a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.830 
about these wheels is that they're a
little<00:00:52.590> bit<00:00:52.800> grittier<00:00:53.190> than<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> previous

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
little bit grittier than the previous

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.639 
little bit grittier than the previous
wheel<00:00:55.129> also<00:00:56.570> they're<00:00:57.570> way<00:00:57.840> more<00:00:57.870> controls<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
wheel also they're way more controls in

you just slide forever it just feels it
feels<00:01:15.240> awesome<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.530> wheel<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.740> 70

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
feels awesome the wheel is 70

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.120 
feels awesome the wheel is 70
millimeters<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> start<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.130> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
millimeters at the at the start and I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
millimeters at the at the start and I
skated<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.880> whole<00:01:21.150> session<00:01:21.390> today<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:22.470> full

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
skated a whole session today at full

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.980 
skated a whole session today at full
session<00:01:22.920> yesterday<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:24.869> they

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
session yesterday and I don't think they

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.430 
session yesterday and I don't think they
lost<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.500> millimeter<00:01:25.860> again<00:01:26.610> I'm<00:01:27.000> 215<00:01:27.930> pounds

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
lost a millimeter again I'm 215 pounds

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.980 
lost a millimeter again I'm 215 pounds
so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.399> they<00:01:29.670> would<00:01:29.789> wear<00:01:30.060> like

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so you think that they would wear like

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.340 
so you think that they would wear like
crazy<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.649> they<00:01:32.130> don't<00:01:32.450> another<00:01:33.450> thing<00:01:33.720> from

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
crazy but they don't another thing from

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.050 
crazy but they don't another thing from
the<00:01:34.500> previous<00:01:34.890> wheel<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> was<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.399> problem<00:01:35.729> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the previous wheel that was a problem is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.730 
the previous wheel that was a problem is
the<00:01:36.330> chunking<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.170> happened<00:01:37.500> along<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the chunking that happened along the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.180 
the chunking that happened along the
rims<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.259> hasn't<00:01:40.259> happened<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.619> yet<00:01:40.710> I

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
rims and hasn't happened to me yet I

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.040 
rims and hasn't happened to me yet I
really<00:01:41.880> hope<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.149> doesn't<00:01:42.390> happen<00:01:42.509> because<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
really hope it doesn't happen because it

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.969 
really hope it doesn't happen because it
sucks<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:45.200> think<00:01:46.200> these<00:01:46.380> did<00:01:46.679> a<00:01:46.740> great<00:01:46.950> job

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

sucks and I think these did a great job
on<00:01:47.429> this<00:01:47.819> new<00:01:48.030> wheel<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:49.020> people<00:01:49.140> are

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
on this new wheel I think people are

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.290 
on this new wheel I think people are
going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.830> lot<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.300> definitely

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
going to like it a lot and definitely

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
worth seventy dollars the new formula is

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:05.250 
worth seventy dollars the new formula is
great<00:01:53.940> for<00:01:54.890> long<00:01:55.890> stand<00:01:56.250> ups
