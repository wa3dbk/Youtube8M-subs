I'm going to be talking about the next

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.580 
I'm going to be talking about the next
possible<00:00:11.150> black<00:00:11.389> ops<00:00:11.539> 2<00:00:11.719> zombies<00:00:11.750> map<00:00:12.260> called

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
possible black ops 2 zombies map called

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.150 
possible black ops 2 zombies map called
bridging<00:00:12.830> the<00:00:13.129> gap<00:00:13.309> or<00:00:13.520> the<00:00:14.119> henge<00:00:14.709> now<00:00:15.709> there

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
bridging the gap or the henge now there

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.439 
bridging the gap or the henge now there
are<00:00:16.190> a<00:00:16.280> couple<00:00:16.400> things<00:00:16.670> that<00:00:16.789> make<00:00:17.000> this<00:00:17.150> real

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
are a couple things that make this real

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.810 
are a couple things that make this real
and<00:00:17.690> fake<00:00:17.900> there<00:00:18.410> are<00:00:18.529> more<00:00:18.769> real<00:00:19.009> details<00:00:19.519> and

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
and fake there are more real details and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.519 
and fake there are more real details and
fake<00:00:20.060> details<00:00:20.539> which<00:00:20.960> is<00:00:21.080> why<00:00:21.230> I'm<00:00:21.259> actually

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
fake details which is why I'm actually

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.929 
fake details which is why I'm actually
leading<00:00:21.920> towards<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:22.429> this<00:00:22.580> is<00:00:22.699> actually

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
leading towards that this is actually

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.109 
leading towards that this is actually
real<00:00:23.449> now<00:00:24.199> number<00:00:24.650> one<00:00:24.800> thing<00:00:25.070> this<00:00:25.550> was<00:00:25.730> this

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
real now number one thing this was this

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.929 
real now number one thing this was this
was<00:00:26.179> released<00:00:26.660> on<00:00:26.779> Charlie<00:00:27.109> intel<00:00:27.470> on<00:00:27.939> Charlie

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
was released on Charlie intel on Charlie

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.009 
was released on Charlie intel on Charlie
Intel<00:00:29.150> is<00:00:29.240> usually<00:00:29.509> a<00:00:29.570> really<00:00:29.779> reliable

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
Intel is usually a really reliable

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.670 
Intel is usually a really reliable
source<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:30.710> mean<00:00:30.859> they<00:00:31.009> usually<00:00:31.640> only<00:00:31.669> put<00:00:32.210> out

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
source I mean they usually only put out

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.500 
source I mean they usually only put out
real<00:00:33.680> stuff<00:00:33.890> on<00:00:34.010> our<00:00:34.040> way<00:00:34.190> on<00:00:34.310> their<00:00:34.460> site<00:00:34.700> but

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
real stuff on our way on their site but

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.090 
real stuff on our way on their site but
they<00:00:35.750> did<00:00:35.930> they<00:00:36.290> put<00:00:36.470> out<00:00:36.560> orientation

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
they did they put out orientation

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.750 
they did they put out orientation
induction<00:00:37.400> which<00:00:37.670> were<00:00:37.790> two<00:00:37.970> fake<00:00:38.210> map<00:00:38.420> eggs

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
induction which were two fake map eggs

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.310 
induction which were two fake map eggs
so<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:41.060> means<00:00:41.240> that<00:00:41.480> they<00:00:41.870> don't<00:00:42.020> do<00:00:42.110> all

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
so that means that they don't do all

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.840 
so that means that they don't do all
real<00:00:42.530> stuff<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:42.950> I<00:00:42.980> can't<00:00:43.310> really<00:00:43.400> prove<00:00:43.670> it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
real stuff so I can't really prove it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.000 
real stuff so I can't really prove it
but<00:00:44.660> another<00:00:44.780> thing<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:45.470> watch<00:00:45.680> what<00:00:45.950> you

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
but another thing you watch what you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.860 
but another thing you watch what you
watch<00:00:46.250> before<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.730> started<00:00:47.090> talking<00:00:47.270> was

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
watch before I started talking was

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.420 
watch before I started talking was
actually<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.410> loading<00:00:48.740> screen<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.220> how<00:00:49.340> it

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
actually the loading screen and how it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.160 
actually the loading screen and how it
actually<00:00:49.580> loaded<00:00:50.060> and<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.540> one<00:00:50.870> thing<00:00:51.020> you

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
actually loaded and the one thing you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.810 
actually loaded and the one thing you
might<00:00:51.320> have<00:00:51.470> noticed<00:00:51.500> in<00:00:51.980> there<00:00:52.130> is<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.610> eerie

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
might have noticed in there is the eerie

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.940 
might have noticed in there is the eerie
starting<00:00:53.360> sound<00:00:53.570> which<00:00:54.140> exact<00:00:54.560> same<00:00:54.740> thing

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
starting sound which exact same thing

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.560 
starting sound which exact same thing
that<00:00:55.070> die<00:00:55.250> rise<00:00:55.520> had<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:55.970> had<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.360> weird

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
that die rise had it had that weird

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.840 
that die rise had it had that weird
starting<00:00:57.200> sound<00:00:57.410> exactly<00:00:58.160> what<00:00:58.430> bridging<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
starting sound exactly what bridging the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.460 
starting sound exactly what bridging the
gap<00:00:59.000> head<00:00:59.270> head<00:00:59.690> or<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.680> henge<00:01:01.900> also<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:03.290> looks

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
gap head head or the henge also it looks

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.380 
gap head head or the henge also it looks
really<00:01:03.770> real<00:01:03.980> because<00:01:04.159> of<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.519> RIP<00:01:04.729> pages<00:01:05.210> and

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
really real because of the RIP pages and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.620 
really real because of the RIP pages and
one<00:01:06.380> thing<00:01:06.620> that<00:01:06.800> seems<00:01:07.490> very<00:01:07.610> interesting<00:01:08.540> to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
one thing that seems very interesting to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.800 
one thing that seems very interesting to
me<00:01:08.780> is<00:01:09.520> how<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.550> shows<00:01:10.970> die<00:01:11.360> rise<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.750> the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
me is how it shows die rise in the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.170 
me is how it shows die rise in the
background<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.190> can<00:01:13.310> see<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.700> back

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
background that is you can see the back

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.350 
background that is you can see the back
page<00:01:14.660> of<00:01:14.870> it<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.170> shows<00:01:15.740> die<00:01:15.920> rise<00:01:16.190> which<00:01:17.150> means

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
page of it it shows die rise which means

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.790 
page of it it shows die rise which means
that<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.840> next<00:01:17.990> map<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.620> shows

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
that this is the next map and it shows

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.130 
that this is the next map and it shows
that<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:19.100> rise<00:01:19.310> was<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> one<00:01:19.790> before<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.210> now

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
that I rise was the one before it now

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.560 
that I rise was the one before it now
another<00:01:21.980> thing<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.460> that<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.909> really<00:01:23.090> does<00:01:23.390> not

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
another thing is that it really does not

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.930 
another thing is that it really does not
show<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.020> next<00:01:24.170> map<00:01:24.409> except<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.159> just<00:01:25.520> noticed

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
show the next map except I just noticed

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.690 
show the next map except I just noticed
that<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.780> top<00:01:27.050> right<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.100> see<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.460> white

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
that in the top right you see that white

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.280 
that in the top right you see that white
part<00:01:28.940> I<00:01:29.120> actually<00:01:29.360> think<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:29.990> next

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
part I actually think that is the next

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.140 
part I actually think that is the next
map<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:30.830> looks<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.670> looks<00:01:31.790> kind<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.060> like

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
map and that looks it looks kind of like

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.030 
map and that looks it looks kind of like
an<00:01:32.330> ice<00:01:32.479> map<00:01:32.810> sort<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:33.470> don't<00:01:33.710> really<00:01:33.830> know

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
an ice map sort of I don't really know

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.950 
an ice map sort of I don't really know
but<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.640> think<00:01:34.850> that's<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.300> next<00:01:35.479> map<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.840> can

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
but I think that's the next map you can

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.600 
but I think that's the next map you can
see<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:36.380> kind<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.590> caught<00:01:36.800> there<00:01:37.010> I<00:01:37.190> really

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
see I was kind of caught there I really

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.880 
see I was kind of caught there I really
didn't<00:01:37.790> notice<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:38.060> before<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.409> just

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
didn't notice that before but I just

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.550 
didn't notice that before but I just
noticed<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.220> right<00:01:40.430> now<00:01:40.580> um<00:01:41.260> also<00:01:42.260> another

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
noticed that right now um also another

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.350 
noticed that right now um also another
thing<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.950> makes<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.159> real<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.940> bottom

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
thing that makes it real is the bottom

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.330 
thing that makes it real is the bottom
right<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.720> screen<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:45.799> see<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> little

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
right of the screen you can see a little

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.880 
right of the screen you can see a little
secure<00:01:47.060> circular<00:01:47.600> object<00:01:48.110> if<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.560> go<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.710> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
secure circular object if you go to the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.980 
secure circular object if you go to the
die<00:01:49.159> rise<00:01:49.430> loading<00:01:49.880> screen<00:01:50.240> which<00:01:50.840> I'm

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
die rise loading screen which I'm

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.539 
die rise loading screen which I'm
showing<00:01:51.110> on<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.380> screen<00:01:51.409> right<00:01:51.650> now<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.280> see

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
showing on the screen right now you see

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.010 
showing on the screen right now you see
how<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.790> page<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.240> ripped<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.750> bottom

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
how the page is ripped in the bottom

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.870 
how the page is ripped in the bottom
right<00:01:54.170> too<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:54.979> see<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.280> same<00:01:55.520> circular

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
right too and you see the same circular

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.780 
right too and you see the same circular
object<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:57.440> its<00:01:58.190> indicating<00:01:58.700> that

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
object and that in its indicating that

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.280 
object and that in its indicating that
the<00:01:58.909> page<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> right<00:01:59.690> which<00:01:59.900> means<00:01:59.930> it

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the page is to the right which means it

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.380 
the page is to the right which means it
is<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.530> next<00:02:00.860> map<00:02:01.070> which<00:02:01.700> as<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.150> can<00:02:02.180> see

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
is the next map which as you can see

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.030 
is the next map which as you can see
there<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:02.690> looks<00:02:02.840> how<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.049> look<00:02:03.140> up<00:02:03.229> film<00:02:03.770> a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
there it looks how to look up film a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.270 
there it looks how to look up film a
film<00:02:04.460> reel<00:02:04.760> or<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.119> little<00:02:05.720> kind<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.280> thing

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
film reel or a little kind of thing

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.699 
film reel or a little kind of thing
laying<00:02:07.610> on<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.850> ground<00:02:08.090> which<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:09.409> shown

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
laying on the ground which it's shown

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.860 
laying on the ground which it's shown
here<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.249> the<00:02:10.429> henge<00:02:10.670> which<00:02:11.269> means<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.629> it's

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
here in the henge which means that it's

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.080 
here in the henge which means that it's
actually<00:02:12.079> this<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.129> actually<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.579> real<00:02:13.760> next

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
actually this is actually the real next

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.460 
actually this is actually the real next
map<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.510> mean<00:02:14.749> that's<00:02:14.900> one

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
map I mean that's one

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.430 
map I mean that's one
%<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.820> there<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.390> mean<00:02:17.690> they<00:02:17.900> wouldn't<00:02:18.230> be

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
% it's there I mean they wouldn't be

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.380 
% it's there I mean they wouldn't be
showing<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.130> unless<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.610> was<00:02:19.730> photoshopped

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
showing that unless it was photoshopped

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.790 
showing that unless it was photoshopped
in<00:02:20.750> there<00:02:20.840> by<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:20.990> guy<00:02:21.200> who<00:02:21.290> copied<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.770> image

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
in there by a guy who copied the image

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.280 
in there by a guy who copied the image
but<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:22.910> looks<00:02:23.060> really<00:02:23.330> real<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.960> don't

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
but this looks really real and I don't

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.190 
but this looks really real and I don't
think<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.010> fake<00:02:25.190> at<00:02:25.340> all<00:02:25.460> anymore

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
think that this is fake at all anymore

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.600 
think that this is fake at all anymore
but<00:02:27.200> there<00:02:27.800> are<00:02:27.890> some<00:02:28.010> things<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.340> people

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
but there are some things that people

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.520 
but there are some things that people
will<00:02:28.700> still<00:02:29.000> won't<00:02:29.180> believe<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.660> believe

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
will still won't believe it believe

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.740 
will still won't believe it believe
that's<00:02:30.740> real<00:02:31.120> number<00:02:32.120> one<00:02:32.270> there<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.570> no

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
that's real number one there is no

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.660 
that's real number one there is no
gameplay<00:02:33.020> of<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.470> actual<00:02:33.770> map<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.190> stops

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
gameplay of the actual map it stops

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.670 
gameplay of the actual map it stops
right<00:02:34.790> when<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.150> map<00:02:35.330> loads<00:02:35.720> which<00:02:36.350> makes

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
right when the map loads which makes

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.200 
right when the map loads which makes
people<00:02:36.950> think<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.340> there<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.670> no<00:02:37.940> gameplay

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
people think that there is no gameplay

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.300 
people think that there is no gameplay
and<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.690> someone<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.140> photoshopped<00:02:39.710> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and that someone just photoshopped the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.590 
and that someone just photoshopped the
entire<00:02:40.640> thing<00:02:41.030> um<00:02:43.090> another<00:02:44.090> thing<00:02:44.210> that<00:02:44.420> makes

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
entire thing um another thing that makes

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.540 
entire thing um another thing that makes
it<00:02:44.840> fake<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:46.720> that's<00:02:47.720> really<00:02:47.990> good<00:02:48.140> um<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:49.220> guess

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
it fake is that's really good um I guess

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.390 
it fake is that's really good um I guess
the<00:02:50.030> how<00:02:50.240> fast<00:02:50.780> map<00:02:51.260> loaded<00:02:51.709> which<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.220> really

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the how fast map loaded which I really

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.030 
the how fast map loaded which I really
don't<00:02:52.550> think<00:02:52.610> is<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.260> actual<00:02:54.260> reason<00:02:54.680> for<00:02:54.980> it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
don't think is a actual reason for it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.310 
don't think is a actual reason for it
being<00:02:55.070> fake<00:02:55.550> I've<00:02:55.850> never<00:02:56.390> seen<00:02:56.540> maps<00:02:56.959> maps

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
being fake I've never seen maps maps

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.290 
being fake I've never seen maps maps
load<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.860> quickly<00:02:58.070> but<00:02:58.760> i<00:02:58.790> don't<00:02:59.030> know<00:02:59.060> maybe

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
load that quickly but i don't know maybe

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.690 
load that quickly but i don't know maybe
they<00:02:59.480> did<00:02:59.630> like<00:02:59.780> a<00:03:00.130> super-fast<00:03:01.130> system<00:03:01.580> or

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
they did like a super-fast system or

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.760 
they did like a super-fast system or
something<00:03:02.030> i<00:03:02.180> don't<00:03:02.240> know<00:03:02.420> because<00:03:02.990> my<00:03:03.200> xbox

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
something i don't know because my xbox

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.830 
something i don't know because my xbox
cannot<00:03:04.250> load<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.520> map<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.790> quickly<00:03:05.120> even<00:03:05.630> if<00:03:05.750> i

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
cannot load a map that quickly even if i

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.110 
cannot load a map that quickly even if i
download<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.470> game<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.860> my<00:03:07.040> hard<00:03:07.250> drive<00:03:07.310> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
download the game on my hard drive it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.820 
download the game on my hard drive it
doesn't<00:03:08.450> load<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.750> quickly<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.530> that's<00:03:09.680> not

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
doesn't load that quickly but that's not

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.470 
doesn't load that quickly but that's not
really<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.100> reason<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.400> could<00:03:10.520> be<00:03:10.580> fake<00:03:10.820> so

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
really a reason it could be fake so

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.150 
really a reason it could be fake so
right<00:03:11.690> now<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.110> believe<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.740> one<00:03:13.040> hundred

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
right now I believe this is one hundred

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.710 
right now I believe this is one hundred
percent<00:03:13.340> real<00:03:13.850> with<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.120> next<00:03:14.390> map<00:03:14.510> pack

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
percent real with the next map pack

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.520 
percent real with the next map pack
bridging<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.260> gap<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.680> henge<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:17.530> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
bridging the gap the henge and and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.949 
bridging the gap the henge and and
really<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.310> reason<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.180> real<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.600> because

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
really the reason it's real is because

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.860 
really the reason it's real is because
it<00:03:21.500> shows<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.640> circular<00:03:23.420> thing<00:03:23.690> in<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
it shows that circular thing in the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.940 
it shows that circular thing in the
bottom<00:03:24.170> because<00:03:24.350> when<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.530> write<00:03:24.709> when<00:03:24.860> I've

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
bottom because when I write when I've

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.340 
bottom because when I write when I've
looked<00:03:25.100> at<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.340> um<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:26.330> was<00:03:26.480> just<00:03:26.540> like<00:03:26.900> well

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
looked at this um I was just like well

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.380 
looked at this um I was just like well
this<00:03:27.560> could<00:03:27.800> be<00:03:27.950> real<00:03:28.130> because<00:03:28.820> once<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.269> get

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
this could be real because once you get

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.240 
this could be real because once you get
a<00:03:29.420> loading<00:03:29.780> screen<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.500> real<00:03:30.680> way<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.890> show<00:03:31.130> if

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
a loading screen the real way to show if

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.860 
a loading screen the real way to show if
it's<00:03:31.370> real<00:03:31.519> or<00:03:31.610> not<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.940> go<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.330> previous

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
it's real or not is go to the previous

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.949 
it's real or not is go to the previous
map<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.350> see<00:03:33.709> if<00:03:33.950> they<00:03:34.730> show<00:03:34.760> any<00:03:35.360> part<00:03:35.870> of

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
map and see if they show any part of

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.570 
map and see if they show any part of
this<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.140> matches<00:03:36.709> up<00:03:36.860> which<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.400> what<00:03:37.550> I

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
this that matches up which is what I

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.009 
this that matches up which is what I
looked<00:03:37.790> at<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.269> bottom<00:03:38.630> right<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.930> screen

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
looked at the bottom right of the screen

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.560 
looked at the bottom right of the screen
the<00:03:39.500> circular<00:03:39.980> object<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.550> there<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:40.970> now<00:03:41.420> on

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
the circular object is there and now on

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.240 
the circular object is there and now on
the<00:03:41.660> loading<00:03:41.870> screen<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.440> circular<00:03:42.860> object

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
the loading screen the circular object

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.610 
the loading screen the circular object
is<00:03:43.400> there<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.900> means<00:03:45.230> it's<00:03:45.380> one<00:03:45.560> hundred

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
is there and that means it's one hundred

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.470 
is there and that means it's one hundred
percent<00:03:45.799> real<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.790> shows<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.030> look<00:03:47.239> back<00:03:47.450> at

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
percent real and it shows a look back at

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.970 
percent real and it shows a look back at
the<00:03:47.690> previous<00:03:47.870> map<00:03:48.200> which<00:03:48.350> which<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.590> rise<00:03:48.799> it

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
the previous map which which I rise it

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.030 
the previous map which which I rise it
looks<00:03:49.130> exactly<00:03:49.250> like<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.440> up<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.860> top

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
looks exactly like it and up in the top

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.560 
looks exactly like it and up in the top
right<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.400> shows<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.760> next<00:03:53.000> map<00:03:53.150> which<00:03:53.360> looks

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
right it shows the next map which looks

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.840 
right it shows the next map which looks
like<00:03:53.660> an<00:03:53.959> ice<00:03:54.140> map<00:03:54.410> or<00:03:54.590> some<00:03:54.799> sort<00:03:55.040> which<00:03:55.730> is

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
like an ice map or some sort which is

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.160 
like an ice map or some sort which is
actually<00:03:55.970> cool<00:03:56.330> because<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.720> always<00:03:56.840> want<00:03:57.080> a

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
actually cool because I always want a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.199 
actually cool because I always want a
nice<00:03:57.320> map<00:03:57.560> which<00:03:57.830> is<00:03:58.670> going<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:58.910> be<00:03:58.970> awesome

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
nice map which is going to be awesome

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.259 
nice map which is going to be awesome
and<00:03:59.720> it<00:04:00.709> shows<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.430> top<00:04:01.670> left<00:04:01.880> picture<00:04:01.970> it

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
and it shows the top left picture it

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.610 
and it shows the top left picture it
looks<00:04:02.450> like<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.780> picture<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.380> people

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
looks like the picture of the people

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.750 
looks like the picture of the people
teleporting<00:04:04.250> inside<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:05.030> kind<00:04:05.959> of<00:04:06.760> looks

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
teleporting inside of a kind of looks

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.000 
teleporting inside of a kind of looks
like<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.940> crater<00:04:08.239> in<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.480> ground<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.830> rest

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
like a crater in the ground and the rest

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.140 
like a crater in the ground and the rest
of<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.130> pictures<00:04:10.280> are<00:04:10.489> hard<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.820> tell<00:04:11.000> because

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
of the pictures are hard to tell because

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.580 
of the pictures are hard to tell because
a<00:04:11.330> little<00:04:11.570> dark<00:04:11.750> command<00:04:12.140> because<00:04:12.320> it<00:04:12.500> was

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
a little dark command because it was

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.640 
a little dark command because it was
recorded<00:04:12.890> with<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.160> camera<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:14.410> at<00:04:15.410> certain

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
recorded with a camera and at certain

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.580 
recorded with a camera and at certain
times<00:04:16.370> like<00:04:16.580> this<00:04:16.760> cameras<00:04:17.630> actually<00:04:17.930> make<00:04:18.410> it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
times like this cameras actually make it

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.830 
times like this cameras actually make it
more<00:04:18.919> reliable<00:04:19.489> than<00:04:19.549> anything<00:04:20.090> else<00:04:20.269> because

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
more reliable than anything else because

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.719 
more reliable than anything else because
then<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.530> can't<00:04:21.739> be<00:04:21.890> like<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.190> screen<00:04:22.490> capture

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
then it can't be like a screen capture

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.370 
then it can't be like a screen capture
will<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.180> photoshop<00:04:23.660> date<00:04:23.840> you're<00:04:24.140> actually

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
will you photoshop date you're actually

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.940 
will you photoshop date you're actually
watching<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:25.280> load<00:04:25.880> on<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.210> TV<00:04:26.570> or<00:04:26.960> computer<00:04:27.440> or

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
watching it load on a TV or computer or

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.950 
watching it load on a TV or computer or
anything

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
anything

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.330 
anything
because<00:04:29.080> you're<00:04:29.229> actually<00:04:29.440> you<00:04:30.009> can<00:04:30.190> actually

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
because you're actually you can actually

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.309 
because you're actually you can actually
tell<00:04:30.729> because<00:04:31.000> it's<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.419> camera<00:04:31.780> enough<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.289> a

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
tell because it's a camera enough like a

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.189 
tell because it's a camera enough like a
captured<00:04:32.889> screen<00:04:33.280> or<00:04:33.930> software<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
captured screen or software on the

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.110 
captured screen or software on the
computer<00:04:35.590> which<00:04:35.740> make<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.100> look<00:04:36.220> more<00:04:36.400> fake<00:04:36.789> or

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
computer which make it look more fake or

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.659 
computer which make it look more fake or
make<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.419> seem<00:04:37.630> more<00:04:37.660> fake<00:04:38.069> but<00:04:39.069> yeah<00:04:39.250> guys<00:04:39.400> I

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669

the next map pack based on this
information<00:04:42.699> I<00:04:43.479> mean<00:04:43.840> there's<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.080> lot<00:04:44.229> of<00:04:44.259> real
