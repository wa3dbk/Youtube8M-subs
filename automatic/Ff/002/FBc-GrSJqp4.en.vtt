00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:15.109
 the good was kind is victor be well 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.720
 coming to another fall day 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.210
 I'm going to make a video today. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.769
 very cool thesis and touched the hymn of the cock 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.750
 came and I leave the link to the video 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.670
 him here on the screen and down in boxing 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 description of europe until the five 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.539
 books in English was very simple the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 five categories and I have to choose 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.000
 five English books for each 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.920
 from them 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.230
 the bride books in english long ago 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 I started the English kind I felt more 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.149
 insurance in 2013 so make some 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 two years and only this year even though I 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.579
 I felt 100% sure to buy more books 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.739
 in English or downloaded usually he would 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 always with the help of the translator of the body 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 but from that year I decided I already 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.620
 I felt safe enough to read 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.079
 English books do not even have a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.000
 repertoire of reading in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.980
 another language and but I think until very 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.960
 cool and I'll talk you over and the first 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.280
 question is what was the first book that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.869
 Did you read English? 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 the first book I read English because it is 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.549
 important partner stone and I have not even arrived 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.470
 him in this cute little edition that I know 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.030
 I bought recently I read here 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.100
 in my body so I bought the people there 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.439
 in 2013 I wanted to test the dictionary 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.549
 English and I thought it would be easy to read 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.170
 a book I had already read in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.490
 Portuguese before and this helped me 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.080
 I rather think this is a tip 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.820
 important for those who want to start 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.650
 English is you picking up a book that you already 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 read in Portuguese so you already have the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.710
 story more or less in your head but 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 that's it harry potter and the stone 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 philosopher was the first book he is 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.170
 English 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 question number 2 the most difficult reading 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.979
 I decided to show a book that was so 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.740
 I could not even finish. I'm talking. 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.450
 of you that the green stripe of the li 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.369
 book that was published in Brazil as the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.140
 sun is for everyone is a classic of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.800
 American literature I have a movie and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.630
 everything else did not have much desire 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.820
 this book but find this book here 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.010
 in the Brazilian edition it 's very very 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.750
 Difficult then when I could find 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.310
 in English put in that paranoia that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.340
 I need this book soon I'm done. 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.750
 buying only that I found a little 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.490
 complicated so I started to read and I 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.350
 I tried to decide this reading more 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.360
 then I realized that sometimes I had a 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.430
 to make sure the day I did not understand 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.980
 nothing of that paragraph so I decided 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.560
 I do not know if I will 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
 I'll try but in Portuguese or wait. 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.070
 one more time and try again lexon 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.380
 English but I found this book here a 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.790
 It's a little tricky not to get 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.740
 reading unfortunately but I still have 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.320
 very eager to read this book 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.450
 question number 3 is a reading 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.230
 Special, I'm going to make a book that I've already said. 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.270
 from him here 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.770
 I have already told him many times that 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.200
 I said but you'll have to ask 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.240
 Why I'm talking about rain iscsi 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.430
 the time to read this book here people 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.080
 he has scored in many ways he is a 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120
 book that thrilled me a lot did me 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.430
 crying made me smile made me think 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.230
 respect of life when I read English it 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.720
 I read in the body because I did not have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.180
 found the physical version of it 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.860
 English to buy 5 easy I just go 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.750
 buy after I had read it myself 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.820
 I already showed this book in a video of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.800
 readings already made a stop reverence 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.750
 for him and I also showed a book hall 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.160
 then this is the fourth time that this book 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.810
 is appearing here on the channel and 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.030
 four videos were not enough to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.800
 to convince alex woods if I do not know 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.500
 maybe it appears four more bands 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.570
 number 4 the book I still want to read 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.160
 and for this category I chose one of the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.470
 last books in English that I bought 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.620
 to my collection that was it here 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.480
 yesterday after elop 'door generate income 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.489
 I found this home here pretty much it 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.040
 draws much attention in the bookstore despite 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.900
 not to be too fan of ipad case 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.480
 I do not like people, but it's what 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.220
 I thought well, and the note from their jury 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.260
 won I know he talks about a 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.880
 girl she writes several letters from 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.100
 love for all the guys she's ever loved 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.750
 in her life but she should not be there 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.819
 day she discovers that these letters were 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.349
 sent 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.629
 It was she who violates and she has to deal 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.430
 with this situation super agreement of you 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.290
 It has to be your cats has already been 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.090
 delivered to people who should not 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.950
 be alert with the marginal cards 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.010
 people who have a fifth and last situation 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.139
 ask a book that taught you a lot and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.609
 seems kind was a little difficult it is 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.040
 find a book the night of my 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.230
 bookshelf that had taught me a lot. 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.420
 I ended up choosing a book that is not so 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.969
 so obvious and let me talk to you and 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.040
 I chose Ana and the kiss I do not know is not for 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.780
 that if you have life because the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.729
 that I taught you I'll talk 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.829
 this book here it's in paris 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.019
 Because it's a girl, I already told him about it. 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.490
 video readers of this girl Ana that she 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.349
 going to study outside will help a relative 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.300
 then as she gets to know the 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.639
 town she goes giving several mini 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.860
 interesting facts about paris and the coolest 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.780
 that I discovered in this book was that 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.090
 there was a time in Paris where they 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.780
 they wanted to demolish the cathedral of notre 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.940
 give me 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.860
 hence the victor Hugo who is the author of a 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.750
 goal against giving and decided to write the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.430
 book for the memory of the cathedral 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.169
 to live forever 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.970
 It's just that the book made so much success 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.070
 world liked it so much that the cathedral 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.509
 was demolished because of the book I found 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.310
 This is a very interesting curiosity. 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.630
 if you did not know now you know and who 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.750
 I would say that I would learn it from here 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.159
 landu year and french and projection I hope 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.720
 Did you like the video today? 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.639

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.229
 flash book you've read and if you're new 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.060
