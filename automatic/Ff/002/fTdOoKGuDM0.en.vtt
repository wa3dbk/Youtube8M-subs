your story or your entertainment so in a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
your story or your entertainment so in a
platform<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> reasons<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
platform I think one of the reasons it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.930 
platform I think one of the reasons it
confuses<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.969> many<00:00:54.180> people<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.940> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
confuses so many people is because it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.840 
confuses so many people is because it
looks<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.840> different<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:59.219> each<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> every

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
looks so different for each and every

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.270 
looks so different for each and every
author<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:01.699> platforms<00:01:02.699> are<00:01:02.850> very<00:01:03.120> unique<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
author and platforms are very unique and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
author and platforms are very unique and
no<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.460> develops<00:01:05.909> them<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.420> grows<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
no one develops them or grows them in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.710 
no one develops them or grows them in
exactly<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.920> same<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.360> usually<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
exactly the same way but it's usually a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
exactly the same way but it's usually a
combination<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> publish<00:01:11.150> if<00:01:12.150> you

it<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:02.040> doesn't<00:02:02.310> work<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.700> way<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.060> kind

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it just doesn't work that way it's kind

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.910 
it just doesn't work that way it's kind
of<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.560> terms<00:02:04.590> of

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of like I think about it in terms of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
of like I think about it in terms of
your<00:02:05.100> career<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:05.969> career<00:02:06.479> grows

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
your career and how your career grows

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.740 
your career and how your career grows
and<00:02:07.320> changes<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.580> develops<00:02:08.970> along<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.539> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and changes and develops along with you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.910 
and changes and develops along with you
as<00:02:09.869> everything

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
as everything

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.680 
as everything
your<00:02:11.069> platform<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.760> really<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.209> same<00:02:12.420> type<00:02:12.660> of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
your platform is really the same type of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.290 
your platform is really the same type of
thing<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.380> can<00:02:13.980> even<00:02:14.220> change<00:02:14.400> direction<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.180> can

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
thing I can even change direction it can

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.270 
thing I can even change direction it can
take<00:02:15.510> different<00:02:15.690> shapes<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.319> size<00:02:16.890> different

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
take different shapes and size different

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.570 
take different shapes and size different
aspects<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> lot<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.280> under

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
aspects of it so a lot of this is under

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.670 
aspects of it so a lot of this is under
your<00:02:20.610> control<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.840> don't<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.440> develop

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
your control you don't have to develop

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.010 
your control you don't have to develop
your<00:02:22.950> platform<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.030> certain<00:02:24.660> kind<00:02:24.900> of

your platform and one certain kind of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.380 
your platform and one certain kind of
way<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.739> way<00:02:25.860> another<00:02:26.310> author<00:02:26.580> did<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.180> do

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
way or the way another author did you do

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.290 
way or the way another author did you do
it<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:28.500> suit<00:02:28.709> your<00:02:28.860> own<00:02:28.920> goals<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.120> suit

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
platform grows or where you emphasize

your<00:02:58.489> activity<00:02:59.489> that's<00:03:00.390> not<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.840> platform<00:03:01.500> I'm

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
your activity that's not a platform I'm

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.750 
your activity that's not a platform I'm
just<00:03:02.130> because<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.459> have<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.580> lot<00:03:02.730> of

just because you have a lot of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.340 
just because you have a lot of
experience<00:03:03.390> doesn't<00:03:03.660> necessarily<00:03:04.230> mean

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
experience doesn't necessarily mean

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.210 
experience doesn't necessarily mean
you're<00:03:04.470> visible<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.459> anyone<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:08.040> also

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you're visible to anyone and it's also

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 
you're visible to anyone and it's also
not<00:03:08.519> really<00:03:09.150> necessarily<00:03:09.720> about

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
not really necessarily about

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.780 
not really necessarily about
self-promotion<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:11.010> lot<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.400> people<00:03:11.640> think

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
self-promotion a lot of people think

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.570 
self-promotion a lot of people think
that<00:03:11.880> platform<00:03:12.180> means<00:03:12.900> or<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:14.010> synonymous

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
that platform means or in synonymous

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.490 
that platform means or in synonymous
with<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:15.239> online<00:03:15.480> marketing<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.290> that's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
with just online marketing and that's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.949 
with just online marketing and that's
platform<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.310> something<00:03:17.579> much<00:03:17.760> bigger<00:03:18.630> it's

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
platform is something much bigger it's

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.770 
platform is something much bigger it's
much<00:03:19.140> broader<00:03:19.530> concept<00:03:20.370> than<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> lot

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
much broader concept than that so a lot

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.849 
much broader concept than that so a lot
of<00:03:21.810> people<00:03:21.989> say<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.230> don't<00:03:22.470> want<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> build

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
of people say they don't want to build

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.920 
of people say they don't want to build
their<00:03:23.010> platform<00:03:23.130> because<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.570> know<00:03:24.690> they

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
their platform because you know they

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.560 
their platform because you know they
don't<00:03:25.140> want<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.380> annoy<00:03:25.620> people<00:03:26.420> because<00:03:27.420> they

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
don't want to annoy people because they

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.319 
don't want to annoy people because they
think<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.930> somehow<00:03:28.700> dirty<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.209> they

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
think it's somehow dirty or like they

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.949 
think it's somehow dirty or like they
don't<00:03:30.510> want<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.750> market<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.320> promote<00:03:31.470> and

visit<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.470> not<00:03:34.739> really<00:03:35.040> what<00:03:35.160> platform

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
visit this is not really what platform

visit this is not really what platform
is<00:03:36.060> about<00:03:36.450> certainly<00:03:36.900> there<00:03:37.049> are<00:03:37.079> components

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470

of marketing and promotion in it but
it's<00:03:40.799> me<00:03:40.980> think<00:03:41.400> about<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.640> more<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.000> terms<00:03:42.269> of

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
it's me think about it more in terms of

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.699 
it's me think about it more in terms of
visibility<00:03:43.640> about<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> literal<00:03:45.410> platform<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
visibility about a literal platform the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.259 
visibility about a literal platform the
