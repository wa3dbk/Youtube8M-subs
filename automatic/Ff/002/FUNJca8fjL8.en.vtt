I'm<00:00:11.519> going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.790> go<00:00:11.879> over<00:00:11.910> water<00:00:12.330> ejection

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
I'm going to go over water ejection

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.700 
I'm going to go over water ejection
period

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.980 

I<00:00:16.740> had<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> lot<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:19.190> questions<00:00:20.190> about<00:00:20.780> how<00:00:21.780> this

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
I had a lot of questions about how this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.070 
I had a lot of questions about how this
can't<00:00:22.290> work<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.060> lot<00:00:24.270> of<00:00:24.450> people<00:00:24.900> don't

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
can't work and a lot of people don't

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.660 
can't work and a lot of people don't
understand<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.880> theory<00:00:27.270> behind<00:00:28.670> water

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
understand the theory behind water

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.960 
understand the theory behind water
injection<00:00:30.650> and<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.830> may<00:00:31.980> not<00:00:32.160> work<00:00:32.220> on<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
injection and it may not work on this

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:41.150 
injection and it may not work on this
model<00:00:34.430> due<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.670> little<00:00:35.970> fact

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.510 

that<00:00:41.700> we're<00:00:41.850> dealing<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.239> revolves

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.220 

right<00:00:47.150> here<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:50.330> water<00:00:50.570> injection<00:00:50.900> house

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
right here the water injection house

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.480 
right here the water injection house
coming<00:00:51.620> through<00:00:51.890> here<00:00:52.330> or<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:54.980> got<00:00:55.130> a<00:00:55.160> carb

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
coming through here or so I got a carb

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.080 
coming through here or so I got a carb
it<00:00:55.820> would<00:00:56.000> come<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.360> through<00:00:56.600> here<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.850> go

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
it would come in through here and go

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:07.360 
it would come in through here and go
down<00:00:59.330> to<00:00:59.720> the<00:01:00.470> Reed<00:01:00.710> valve<00:01:05.770> now<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.800> theory<00:01:07.280> of

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
down to the Reed valve now a theory of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.440 
down to the Reed valve now a theory of
water<00:01:07.550> injection<00:01:08.030> states<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.880> if<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.150> air

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
water injection states that if the air

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.740 
water injection states that if the air
is<00:01:11.750> cooler<00:01:12.110> or<00:01:12.710> if<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.980> air<00:01:13.220> charge<00:01:13.750> that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
is cooler or if the air charge that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.830 
is cooler or if the air charge that
enters<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:16.220> carburetor<00:01:16.730> and<00:01:17.390> enters<00:01:17.810> the

engine is cooler more cool air can be in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.950 
engine is cooler more cool air can be in
the<00:01:23.900> Psalter<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.530> create<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.830> bigger<00:01:25.010> bang<00:01:25.960> if

the Psalter and create a bigger bang if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.640 
the Psalter and create a bigger bang if
the<00:01:27.110> air<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:27.260> hot<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:27.979> dry<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:30.320> will<00:01:31.210> have<00:01:32.650> it

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
the air is hot and dry it will have it

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
volume or less dense and then created a

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.710

smaller<00:01:42.590> explosion<00:01:43.310> which<00:01:44.030> creates<00:01:44.420> more

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
smaller explosion which creates more

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.330 
smaller explosion which creates more
power<00:01:45.760> since<00:01:46.760> basically<00:01:47.330> these<00:01:47.570> engines<00:01:47.930> are

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
power since basically these engines are

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.760 
power since basically these engines are
just<00:01:49.340> an<00:01:49.460> air<00:01:49.610> pump<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> more<00:01:51.320> air<00:01:51.500> that

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
just an air pump so the more air that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.749 
just an air pump so the more air that
you<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.039> force<00:01:52.340> through<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.940> engine<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.759> out

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
you can force through the engine and out

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.160 
you can force through the engine and out
the<00:01:56.000> exhaust<00:01:56.210> will<00:01:56.810> give<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:57.050> more

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the exhaust will give you more

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.950 
the exhaust will give you more
horsepower<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> theory<00:01:59.450> behind<00:01:59.630> water

alcohol is added to the water so it

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:50.460

and they have to go down and they have
to<00:03:56.230> hit<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.470> reed<00:03:56.620> valves<00:03:56.980> but<00:03:57.700> remember<00:03:58.060> a

regular car does not have read valves it
has<00:04:00.100> regular<00:04:00.640> valves<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:02.350> what<00:04:02.500> happens<00:04:02.920> is

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
has regular valves so what happens is

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.750 
has regular valves so what happens is
the<00:04:05.019> charge<00:04:05.350> stops<00:04:05.950> at<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.400> Reed<00:04:06.549> valve

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
the charge stops at the Reed valve

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.180 
the charge stops at the Reed valve
