good<00:00:01.319> morning<00:00:02.000> yesterday<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.030> did<00:00:03.419> a

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
good morning yesterday I did a

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.089 
good morning yesterday I did a
demonstration<00:00:03.929> flight<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.430> L<00:00:05.819> 60<00:00:06.359> 52

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:07.099 
demonstration flight of the L 60 52

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.950 
demonstration flight of the L 60 52
alias<00:00:08.099> clone<00:00:08.400> but<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.269> didn't<00:00:09.570> really<00:00:09.809> get<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
alias clone but I didn't really get a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.589 
alias clone but I didn't really get a
chance<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.440> demonstrate<00:00:11.000> other<00:00:12.000> features<00:00:12.420> of

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
chance to demonstrate other features of

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.320 
chance to demonstrate other features of
it<00:00:12.719> such<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:12.929> flipping<00:00:13.580> also<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> wanted<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.150> do

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
it such as flipping also I wanted to do

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.570 
it such as flipping also I wanted to do
a<00:00:15.360> little<00:00:15.660> more<00:00:15.780> demonstration<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.650> flying<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
a little more demonstration of flying it

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.330 
a little more demonstration of flying it
in<00:00:17.730> low<00:00:18.060> rate<00:00:18.300> mode<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.779> beginners<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:20.130> that's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
in low rate mode for beginners so that's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.820 
in low rate mode for beginners so that's
the<00:00:20.580> objective<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.270> today's<00:00:21.330> flight<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.199> I'm

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the objective of today's flight and I'm

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.080 
the objective of today's flight and I'm
just<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.130> fly<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.340> around<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.670> grassy

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
just going to fly it around this grassy

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.710 
just going to fly it around this grassy
field<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:25.010> demonstrating<00:00:26.010> low<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.849> also

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
field here demonstrating low and also

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.259 
field here demonstrating low and also
high<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.199> also<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> full<00:00:29.310> fleet<00:00:29.550> features<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
high and also the full fleet features of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
high and also the full fleet features of
the<00:00:30.359> quadcopter<00:00:30.949> yesterday<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> tried<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the quadcopter yesterday when I tried to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.790 
the quadcopter yesterday when I tried to
do<00:00:32.790> flipping<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.630> battery<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.230> almost<00:00:34.559> dead

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
do flipping the battery was almost dead

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040 
do flipping the battery was almost dead
this<00:00:35.070> quadcopter<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.090> flip<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this quadcopter will not flip when the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
this quadcopter will not flip when the
battery<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.469> almost<00:00:37.770> dead<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.730> resists

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
battery is almost dead it just resists

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.030 
battery is almost dead it just resists
trying<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> do<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.469> reason<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> does

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
trying to do that and the reason it does

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
trying to do that and the reason it does
that<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.430> noticed<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.809> flying<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> last

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that is I noticed I was flying it last

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.369 
that is I noticed I was flying it last
night<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> dark<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.940> by<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.110> does

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
night in the dark and by the way it does

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
night in the dark and by the way it does
have<00:00:46.590> very<00:00:46.800> bright<00:00:47.160> lights<00:00:47.520> yellow<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.660> white

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
have very bright lights yellow and white

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.049 
have very bright lights yellow and white
for<00:00:49.530> flying<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> dark<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.640> last<00:00:50.820> night<00:00:51.030> I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
for flying in a dark but last night I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.430 
for flying in a dark but last night I
was<00:00:51.149> trying<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.660> flips<00:00:51.899> out<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.260> front

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
was trying to do flips out in my front

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
was trying to do flips out in my front
yard<00:00:52.590> err<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> dark<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> when<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> does

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
yard err in the dark and when it does

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560 
yard err in the dark and when it does
flips<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.800> lifts<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.399> work<00:00:56.640> before<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> flip

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
flips it lifts up work before the flip

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.540 
flips it lifts up work before the flip
so<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.559> tries<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> maintain<00:00:59.129> altitude

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so that it tries to maintain altitude

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.060 
so that it tries to maintain altitude
through<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> flip<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.410> doesn't<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
through the flip if it doesn't have the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
through the flip if it doesn't have the
battery<00:01:02.430> power<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.390> initial<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.650> work

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
battery power to do that initial up work

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.760 
battery power to do that initial up work
it<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.460> doesn't<00:01:05.729> flip<00:01:06.180> okay<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.409> let's<00:01:07.590> go

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it just doesn't flip okay so let's go

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.830 
it just doesn't flip okay so let's go
and<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> demonstration<00:01:08.670> flight<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.689> L

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and do a demonstration flight of the L

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.550 
and do a demonstration flight of the L
60<00:01:10.380> 52<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.100> hope<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> enjoy<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.380> okay<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
60 52 I hope you enjoy it okay the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
60 52 I hope you enjoy it okay the
quadcopter<00:01:13.770> has<00:01:14.189> been<00:01:14.340> bound<00:01:14.580> I'm<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810 
quadcopter has been bound I'm going to
do<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> hand<00:01:16.380> toss<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.799> show<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> be

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
do a hand toss to show that this can be

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.280 
do a hand toss to show that this can be
hand<00:01:18.060> toss<00:01:18.270> too<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.740> six<00:01:20.580> axis<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.290> six

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
axis quad copters can okay I'm in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:34.969 
axis quad copters can okay I'm in
low-rate<00:01:25.290> mode<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:29.060> let's<00:01:30.060> see

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.550 

and<00:01:35.390> there's<00:01:36.390> forward<00:01:37.170> there's<00:01:37.469> back<00:01:39.229> see<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and there's forward there's back see in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.810 
and there's forward there's back see in
low-rate<00:01:41.189> mode<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.909> very<00:01:42.360> docile<00:01:43.820> very

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
low-rate mode it's very docile very

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.639 
low-rate mode it's very docile very
docile<00:01:45.000> flyer<00:01:45.450> good<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.990> beginners<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.500> guess

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
docile flyer good for beginners I guess

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.200 
docile flyer good for beginners I guess
not<00:01:49.649> very<00:01:49.860> exciting<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> fly<00:01:50.549> though<00:01:53.179> but<00:01:54.179> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
not very exciting to fly though but I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.730 
not very exciting to fly though but I
guess<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.780> excellent<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.319> beginners<00:01:55.619> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
guess it's excellent for beginners to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.530 
guess it's excellent for beginners to
try<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> learn<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.369> fly

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.360 

and<00:02:06.530> I'll<00:02:06.620> just<00:02:06.680> do<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> little<00:02:06.980> bit<00:02:07.160> of<00:02:07.310> a

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
and I'll just do a little bit of a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.969 
and I'll just do a little bit of a
little<00:02:07.550> reg<00:02:07.670> flying<00:02:07.970> here<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.650> show<00:02:09.680> how

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
little reg flying here just to show how

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.450 
little reg flying here just to show how
it<00:02:10.130> works

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
it works

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.810 
it works
a<00:02:14.320> very<00:02:15.320> docile<00:02:15.500> flier<00:02:18.520> very<00:02:19.520> good<00:02:19.670> for

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
a very docile flier very good for

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:28.000 
a very docile flier very good for
beginners<00:02:24.130> now<00:02:25.130> let's<00:02:25.310> see<00:02:25.430> how<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.670> flips<00:02:27.010> I'm

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
beginners now let's see how it flips I'm

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.790 
beginners now let's see how it flips I'm
gonna<00:02:28.130> press<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.520> automatic<00:02:29.120> flip<00:02:29.330> button

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
gonna press the automatic flip button

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.010 
gonna press the automatic flip button
see<00:02:30.800> how<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.010> lifts<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.480> let's<00:02:32.480> bring<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.900> a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
see how it lifts up let's bring it in a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.500 
see how it lifts up let's bring it in a
little<00:02:33.200> closer<00:02:33.410> just<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.280> see<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
little closer just so you see that it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.580 
little closer just so you see that it
does<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.810> upwards<00:02:36.800> well<00:02:38.140> that's<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.230> best<00:02:39.410> word

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
does a upwards well that's the best word

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.130 
does a upwards well that's the best word
I<00:02:39.740> can<00:02:39.920> describe<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.760> before<00:02:41.600> doing<00:02:41.960> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
I can describe for it before doing the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.210 
I can describe for it before doing the
flip<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.380> that's<00:02:42.680> trying<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.010> maintain

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
flip and that's trying to maintain

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.460 
flip and that's trying to maintain
altitude<00:02:43.640> on<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.390> tries<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.960> maintain<00:02:45.380> an

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
altitude on it tries to maintain an

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.830 
altitude on it tries to maintain an
altitude<00:02:45.740> through<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> flip<00:02:46.840> let's

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
altitude through the flip let's

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.070 
altitude through the flip let's
demonstrate<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.470> again<00:02:49.480> okay<00:02:50.480> now<00:02:50.780> let's<00:02:50.960> do

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
demonstrate that again okay now let's do

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.930 
demonstrate that again okay now let's do
manual<00:02:51.470> flips<00:02:52.090> forward<00:02:53.290> back<00:02:54.850> it'll<00:02:55.850> do

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
manual flips forward back it'll do

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.370 
manual flips forward back it'll do
multiple<00:02:56.330> flips<00:02:56.570> by<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.780> way<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.140> give<00:02:57.260> it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
multiple flips by the way if you give it

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.190 
multiple flips by the way if you give it
some<00:02:57.410> altitude<00:02:57.920> here<00:02:59.500> look<00:03:00.500> at<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:02.200> be

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
some altitude here look at that be

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.699 
some altitude here look at that be
careful<00:03:03.590> doing<00:03:03.830> multiple<00:03:04.190> flips<00:03:05.500> they<00:03:06.500> could

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
careful doing multiple flips they could

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:16.740 
careful doing multiple flips they could
be<00:03:06.800> dangerous

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.690 

okay<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:18.470> only<00:03:18.709> gonna<00:03:18.890> do<00:03:19.070> two<00:03:19.100> multiple

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
okay I'm only gonna do two multiple

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.740 
okay I'm only gonna do two multiple
flips<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.060> time<00:03:22.030> but<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.180> automatically

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
flips this time but it automatically

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.360 
flips this time but it automatically
does<00:03:24.019> multiple<00:03:24.530> flips<00:03:26.769> don't<00:03:27.769> do<00:03:27.980> multiple

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
does multiple flips don't do multiple

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.970 
does multiple flips don't do multiple
flips<00:03:28.580> I<00:03:32.080> set<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.200> up<00:03:33.260> real<00:03:33.500> high<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.739> do

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
flips I set it up real high to do

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.770 
flips I set it up real high to do
multiple<00:03:34.340> flips<00:03:36.820> yeah<00:03:37.820> if<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.540> can<00:03:38.660> do

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
multiple flips yeah if you can do

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.630 
multiple flips yeah if you can do
multiple<00:03:38.959> flips<00:03:39.380> ending<00:03:39.709> up<00:03:39.800> real<00:03:40.070> high

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.550 

otherwise<00:03:43.640> you're<00:03:43.850> gonna<00:03:43.910> have<00:03:44.150> problems

otherwise you're gonna have problems
it's<00:03:45.560> specially<00:03:46.100> tuned<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.430> ground<00:03:46.670> if

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
it's specially tuned to the ground if

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.750 
it's specially tuned to the ground if
you<00:03:47.660> do<00:03:47.840> multiple<00:03:47.959> flips<00:03:48.440> always<00:03:48.920> do<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.610> on<00:03:49.730> a

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
you do multiple flips always do it on a

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.940 
you do multiple flips always do it on a
grassy<00:03:50.209> field<00:03:50.450> okay<00:03:51.350> let's<00:03:51.530> go<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.709> high

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
grassy field okay let's go to high

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.930 
grassy field okay let's go to high
that's<00:03:52.370> enough<00:03:52.640> of<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:54.310> flying<00:03:55.310> kick<00:03:55.730> gum

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
that's enough of this flying kick gum

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.830 
that's enough of this flying kick gum
flying<00:03:56.860> again<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.820> big<00:03:59.030> feature<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.420> this<00:03:59.600> the

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
flying again the big feature of this the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.320 
flying again the big feature of this the
big<00:04:00.500> selling<00:04:00.800> feature<00:04:00.830> this<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.970> a

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
big selling feature this is it's a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:19.560 
big selling feature this is it's a
maneuverable<00:04:03.260> flyer<00:04:04.209> maneuverable<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.360> fast

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.900 

and<00:04:20.570> by<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.900> way<00:04:21.160> yesterday<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:22.190> was<00:04:22.430> flying

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
and by the way yesterday I was flying

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.590 
and by the way yesterday I was flying
with<00:04:23.090> very<00:04:23.570> weak<00:04:23.750> batteries<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:25.520> that's<00:04:26.000> was

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
with very weak batteries and that's was

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.570 
with very weak batteries and that's was
the<00:04:26.720> cause<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:26.930> those<00:04:27.140> drop<00:04:27.440> pots<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:28.010> charged

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
the cause of those drop pots I charged

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.580 
the cause of those drop pots I charged
my<00:04:28.700> batteries<00:04:29.210> overnight<00:04:29.660> for<00:04:30.560> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
my batteries overnight for the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.160 
my batteries overnight for the
transmitter<00:04:31.100> make<00:04:31.970> sure<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.480> good

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
transmitter make sure you have good

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.620 
transmitter make sure you have good
power<00:04:33.380> batteries<00:04:33.890> in<00:04:34.040> your<00:04:34.160> transmitter<00:04:34.670> I

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
power batteries in your transmitter I

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.650 
power batteries in your transmitter I
guess<00:04:36.080> that's<00:04:36.260> kind<00:04:36.350> of<00:04:36.560> obvious<00:04:37.480> for<00:04:38.480> most

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
guess that's kind of obvious for most

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.760 
guess that's kind of obvious for most
fliers<00:04:39.190> fly<00:04:40.190> with<00:04:40.370> good<00:04:40.520> power<00:04:40.760> batteries

I<00:05:25.630> guess<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.780> batteries<00:05:27.050> getting<00:05:27.290> weak<00:05:27.550> it

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
I guess the batteries getting weak it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.020 
I guess the batteries getting weak it
doesn't<00:05:28.850> want<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.000> flip<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:29.510> that's<00:05:30.320> a<00:05:30.440> hint<00:05:31.030> if

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
doesn't want to flip so that's a hint if

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.310 
doesn't want to flip so that's a hint if
it<00:05:32.180> doesn't<00:05:32.420> want<00:05:32.510> to<00:05:32.600> flip<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:32.930> batteries

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
it doesn't want to flip that batteries

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.630 
it doesn't want to flip that batteries
to<00:05:33.470> get<00:05:33.560> in<00:05:33.680> week<00:05:34.810> yeah<00:05:35.810> it's<00:05:36.560> been<00:05:36.860> becoming

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
to get in week yeah it's been becoming

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.290 
to get in week yeah it's been becoming
sluggish<00:05:37.910> all<00:05:38.540> that<00:05:38.840> flipping<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:40.820> were<00:05:41.030> not

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
sluggish all that flipping is were not

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.240 
sluggish all that flipping is were not
I'm<00:05:41.540> gonna<00:05:41.660> run<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.050> though<00:05:42.200> until<00:05:43.070> the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
I'm gonna run it though until the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:51.540 
I'm gonna run it though until the
battery<00:05:43.550> dies

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.850 

but<00:05:52.550> when<00:05:52.669> it's<00:05:52.819> about<00:05:52.909> I<00:05:53.119> guess<00:05:53.860> two-thirds

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
but when it's about I guess two-thirds

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.639 
but when it's about I guess two-thirds
of<00:05:54.979> the<00:05:55.039> way<00:05:55.159> through<00:05:55.189> its<00:05:55.489> power<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:57.289> doesn't

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:57.649 
of the way through its power it doesn't

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.290 
of the way through its power it doesn't
have<00:05:57.739> the<00:05:57.860> old<00:05:57.979> Fenny<00:05:58.219> more<00:05:58.399> to<00:05:58.519> flip<00:05:58.759> there<00:05:59.149> it

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
have the old Fenny more to flip there it

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.469 
have the old Fenny more to flip there it
doesn't<00:05:59.479> allow<00:05:59.779> at<00:05:59.989> the<00:06:00.080> flip<00:06:00.319> I<00:06:01.300> guess<00:06:02.300> it's

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
doesn't allow at the flip I guess it's

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.059 
doesn't allow at the flip I guess it's
trying<00:06:02.719> to<00:06:02.809> prevent<00:06:03.080> crashes<00:06:03.499> into<00:06:03.949> the

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
trying to prevent crashes into the

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.409 
trying to prevent crashes into the
ground<00:06:04.279> like<00:06:04.399> I<00:06:04.550> was<00:06:04.699> doing<00:06:04.969> there<00:06:05.179> with<00:06:05.330> the
