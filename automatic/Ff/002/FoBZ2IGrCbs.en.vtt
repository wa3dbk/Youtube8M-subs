I'm<00:06:09.369> introducing<00:06:09.939> some<00:06:10.119> differential

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:10.719 
I'm introducing some differential

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.469 
I'm introducing some differential
reinforcement<00:06:10.929> for<00:06:11.559> Truman<00:06:11.769> I'm<00:06:12.699> doing<00:06:13.059> is<00:06:13.209> he

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
reinforcement for Truman I'm doing is he

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.329 
reinforcement for Truman I'm doing is he
likes<00:06:13.689> to<00:06:13.809> play<00:06:13.929> with<00:06:14.139> the<00:06:14.229> ball<00:06:14.379> but<00:06:15.069> he<00:06:15.129> likes

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:15.339 
likes to play with the ball but he likes

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.519 
likes to play with the ball but he likes
to<00:06:15.399> chew<00:06:15.669> a<00:06:15.699> walnut<00:06:16.059> shell<00:06:16.239> even<00:06:16.689> more<00:06:16.899> so<00:06:17.469> what

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
to chew a walnut shell even more so what

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.139 
to chew a walnut shell even more so what
I'm<00:06:17.649> doing<00:06:17.679> is<00:06:18.069> I'm<00:06:18.219> tempting<00:06:18.639> him<00:06:18.729> to<00:06:18.879> drop

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.149 
I'm doing is I'm tempting him to drop

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.149 
I'm doing is I'm tempting him to drop
the<00:06:19.300> ball<00:06:19.479> and<00:06:19.869> give<00:06:20.050> up<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.529> fun<00:06:20.889> of<00:06:21.039> playing

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
the ball and give up the fun of playing

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.399 
the ball and give up the fun of playing
with<00:06:21.489> it<00:06:21.639> into<00:06:21.909> the<00:06:21.999> bowl<00:06:22.179> and<00:06:22.479> return<00:06:23.139> for<00:06:23.349> a

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
with it into the bowl and return for a

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.869 
with it into the bowl and return for a
walnut<00:06:23.800> shell<00:06:23.979> which<00:06:24.129> is<00:06:24.159> even<00:06:24.399> more<00:06:24.429> fun<00:06:24.729> to

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
walnut shell which is even more fun to

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.999 
walnut shell which is even more fun to
play<00:06:25.029> with<00:06:25.209> so<00:06:25.839> I'm<00:06:26.050> using<00:06:26.259> his<00:06:26.529> differential

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
play with so I'm using his differential

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.069 
play with so I'm using his differential
reinforcement<00:06:27.159> to<00:06:27.699> have<00:06:27.819> give<00:06:28.119> up<00:06:28.269> the<00:06:28.899> toy

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:29.079 
reinforcement to have give up the toy

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:31.109 
reinforcement to have give up the toy
that<00:06:29.110> he<00:06:29.349> already<00:06:29.469> enjoys<00:06:29.919> for<00:06:30.819> an<00:06:30.909> even

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:31.119 
that he already enjoys for an even

that he already enjoys for an even
better<00:06:31.300> -<00:06:31.569> way

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.190

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
very good did a bit of a change of

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.450 
very good did a bit of a change of
direction<00:06:43.330> there<00:06:43.780> but<00:06:44.050> he<00:06:44.260> still<00:06:44.560> over<00:06:45.220> gained

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
direction there but he still over gained

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.100 
direction there but he still over gained
that<00:06:45.670> and<00:06:45.940> followed<00:06:46.330> the<00:06:46.420> bowl<00:06:46.600> and<00:06:46.840> dropped

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
that and followed the bowl and dropped

that and followed the bowl and dropped
the<00:06:47.230> coin<00:06:47.380> specifically<00:06:47.950> in<00:06:48.040> the<00:06:48.130> bowl
