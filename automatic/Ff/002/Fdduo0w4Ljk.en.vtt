00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.860
 here is one of the shows home of that is this 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.650
 apartment furnished for display for 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.019
 because buyers builder specifically 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.739
 leaves several apartments 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:22.689
 typical so let's say two bedroom 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:26.859
 such a layout with two 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:30.310
 bedrooms with a different layout 1 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:33.940
 detailed one-bedroom apartment for me 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.250
 fail to show because in 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.170
 this house all apartments are already inhabited and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.280
 our apartment layout and set aside 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:51.219
 the office is now under the offices of builders where 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.010
 There are clearance sale purchases in 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.780
 In general, this one is this apartment to me. 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.269
 I like it very much but for the money 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.089
 of course 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.900
 expensive and we decided all the same on 1 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.630
 bedroom on a smaller area but in general 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.580
 here I really liked this one 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.920
 open concept that is, you go in the hall and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.920
 left and right in the bedroom 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.399
 and immediately to the right are the cars 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.789
 washing like a pantry type storage room 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.789
 something 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:41.340
 district self washing and drying 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:45.329
 the camera here here is the second bedroom well if 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 count something not filmed I'm looking for 1 in general 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:55.349
 then they make out one of the fields 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:02:01.619
 great god forbid to issue it when 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:04.319
 move here is the cabinet but cabinets 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.679
 here, as it were, they are as simple as they are 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:19.519
 and recover we open itself torn very 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:22.870
 here is the second of the bedrooms so 10 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.519
 closet there's there's cabinet 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.329
 they are naturally furniture 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:36.920
 although there is no built-in wardrobe, and now I have 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:37.430
 he'll even show him 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:46.220
 in 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:50.079
 that is, you. You can enter here but all 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.569
 it is located near the bathroom 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.519
 at first it seemed unusual to us 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.379
 when the cabinet is located even in the 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.019
 bathroom 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.510
 but here we bought the house ourselves where 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.489
 the closet is located in the bathroom itself 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.840
 the room is very comfortable washed 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.840
 got off what's called 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:24.890
 2 I stand with my back to the bathroom but then there 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.730
 going beyond 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.730
 no again kitchen
