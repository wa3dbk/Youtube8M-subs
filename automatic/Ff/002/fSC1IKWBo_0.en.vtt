techniques and some of my steps that I
like<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> take<00:00:24.449> when<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.109> approaching<00:00:25.679> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
like to take when I'm approaching a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.470 
like to take when I'm approaching a
drawing<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.329> more

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
drawing and there are just more

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
drawing and there are just more
principles<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.589> will<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.070> some<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.310> my

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
principles and I will go for some of my

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.060 
principles and I will go for some of my
materials<00:00:29.939> too<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.079> best<00:00:31.349> ways<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> think

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
materials too and the best ways to think

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.040 
materials too and the best ways to think
about<00:00:32.250> using<00:00:32.400> those<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.059> let's<00:00:33.629> get<00:00:33.719> started

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
about using those so let's get started

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.920 
about using those so let's get started
okay<00:00:34.260> step<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.460> course<00:00:35.789> is<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.239> start<00:00:36.840> with

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
okay step one of course is to start with

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
okay step one of course is to start with
an<00:00:37.020> idea<00:00:37.340> you<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.579> start<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> good

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
an idea you have to start with a good

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.849 
an idea you have to start with a good
idea<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.809> you'll<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.140> drawing<00:00:40.440> if

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
idea for what you'll be drawing if

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.200 
idea for what you'll be drawing if
you're<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.640> planning<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:41.969> doing<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you're just planning on doing a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.670 
you're just planning on doing a
caricature<00:00:42.660> without<00:00:42.899> any<00:00:43.079> other<00:00:43.260> creative

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
caricature without any other creative

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.130 
caricature without any other creative
ideas<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.640> start<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
ideas then just start with that

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.240 
ideas then just start with that
caricatures<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.320> pretty<00:00:46.530> complex<00:00:46.859> to<00:00:47.039> begin

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
caricatures are pretty complex to begin

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.560 
caricatures are pretty complex to begin
with<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.640> tend<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.359> go<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> little

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
with but I tend to want to go a little

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.150 
with but I tend to want to go a little
further<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.289> come<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.129> know

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
further and to come up with a you know

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
further and to come up with a you know
funny<00:00:50.519> or<00:00:51.180> creative<00:00:51.629> idea<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.199> along<00:00:52.410> with

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
funny or creative idea to go along with

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.319 
funny or creative idea to go along with
it<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.309> you've<00:00:53.579> come<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.090> good<00:00:54.269> idea

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
it so if you've come up with a good idea

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900 
it so if you've come up with a good idea
do<00:00:55.109> a<00:00:55.140> rough<00:00:55.440> sketch<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.399> idea<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
do a rough sketch of the idea on a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
do a rough sketch of the idea on a
smaller<00:00:57.300> sheet<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> paper<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.800> sign<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
smaller sheet of paper and a sign on the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.189 
smaller sheet of paper and a sign on the
layout<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.670> sometimes<00:01:00.300> call<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.780> step<00:01:01.019> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
layout I sometimes call this step the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
layout I sometimes call this step the
rough<00:01:01.500> sketch<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> concept<00:01:02.699> sketch<00:01:02.910> no

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
rough sketch or the concept sketch no

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
rough sketch or the concept sketch no
way<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.899> drawing<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.620> end<00:01:04.740> up

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
way is this drawing going to end up

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
way is this drawing going to end up
becoming<00:01:05.070> finalized<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
becoming finalized it's just to get a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
becoming finalized it's just to get a
good<00:01:06.660> idea<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:07.320> direction<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.730> go

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
good idea what direction you want to go

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.380 
good idea what direction you want to go
step<00:01:10.470> two<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.160> important<00:01:11.490> step<00:01:11.760> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
step two is a really important step in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.530 
step two is a really important step in
its<00:01:12.600> reference<00:01:13.520> reference<00:01:14.520> photos<00:01:15.090> reference

its reference reference photos reference
pictures<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.980> step<00:01:17.160> is<00:01:17.280> extremely

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
pictures this step is extremely

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.310 
pictures this step is extremely
important<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.450> you're<00:01:18.630> creating<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.110> great

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
rough sketch I did earlier where I take

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.390 
rough sketch I did earlier where I take
the<00:02:02.790> layout<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.960> idea<00:02:04.230> that<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.160> had<00:02:05.280> from

the layout of the idea that I had from
this<00:02:05.520> concept<00:02:06.060> sketch<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.510> then<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.660> do<00:02:06.720> a

this concept sketch and then I do a

this concept sketch and then I do a

this<00:02:09.709> step<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.129> most<00:02:10.310> important<00:02:10.789> step<00:02:10.970> in

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
this step is the most important step in

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.300 
this step is the most important step in
the<00:02:11.150> process<00:02:11.409> since<00:02:12.409> it's<00:02:12.530> where<00:02:12.680> you'll<00:02:12.860> make

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the process since it's where you'll make

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.610 
the process since it's where you'll make
or<00:02:13.549> break<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.939> finish<00:02:14.180> illustration<00:02:14.870> you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
or break the finish illustration you

should feel free to experiment and get

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.910 
should feel free to experiment and get

the right exact exaggeration that you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.170 
the right exact exaggeration that you
want<00:02:19.129> to<00:02:19.220> get<00:02:19.340> everything<00:02:19.610> right<00:02:19.909> because

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
want to get everything right because

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
want to get everything right because
once<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.450> go<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:20.599> ink<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.049> you're<00:02:21.590> set

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
once you go to ink it you're set

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.580 
once you go to ink it you're set
and<00:02:22.909> remember<00:02:23.299> no<00:02:23.420> amount<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.780> good<00:02:23.959> inking<00:02:24.439> or

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
coloring will save a bad drawing so if

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.720 
coloring will save a bad drawing so if

on<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> ink<00:03:09.079> okay<00:03:09.769> step<00:03:10.010> four<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.340> ink<00:03:10.609> this

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
on to the ink okay step four is ink this

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.819 
on to the ink okay step four is ink this
is<00:03:11.510> my<00:03:11.629> favorite<00:03:11.989> part<00:03:12.139> of<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.349> process<00:03:12.709> I

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
is my favorite part of the process I

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.349 
is my favorite part of the process I
love<00:03:13.010> adding<00:03:13.400> ink<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.639> the<00:03:13.730> cartoons<00:03:14.090> because

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
love adding ink to the cartoons because

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.119 
love adding ink to the cartoons because
it<00:03:14.480> has<00:03:14.629> multiple<00:03:15.079> layers<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.410> life<00:03:15.799> and

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
it has multiple layers of life and

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.680 
it has multiple layers of life and
detail<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.269> drawing

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
detail to the drawing

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.030 
detail to the drawing
the<00:03:17.870> thing<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.049> keep<00:03:18.199> in<00:03:18.290> mind<00:03:18.530> about<00:03:18.620> inking

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
the thing to keep in mind about inking

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.830 
the thing to keep in mind about inking
is<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.699> whatever<00:03:19.970> state<00:03:20.239> your<00:03:20.389> drawing<00:03:20.629> is

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
is that whatever state your drawing is

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.140 
is that whatever state your drawing is
in<00:03:21.049> before<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.620> ink<00:03:21.799> it<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.879> will<00:03:23.000> become

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
in before you ink it it will become

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.420 
in before you ink it it will become
amplified<00:03:23.480> with<00:03:24.019> ink<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.919> means<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:25.310> your

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
amplified with ink so that means if your

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.099 
amplified with ink so that means if your
drawing<00:03:25.549> is<00:03:25.760> solid<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.540> ink<00:03:26.720> will<00:03:26.840> make<00:03:26.989> it

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
drawing is solid the ink will make it

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.869 
drawing is solid the ink will make it
look<00:03:27.260> even<00:03:27.410> better<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.489> if<00:03:28.549> your<00:03:28.669> drawing

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
look even better and if your drawing

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.449 
look even better and if your drawing
sucks<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.540> ink<00:03:29.989> will<00:03:30.109> make<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.349> worse<00:03:30.470> but<00:03:31.340> if

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
sucks the ink will make it worse but if

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.400 
sucks the ink will make it worse but if
it's<00:03:31.609> good<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:32.150> can<00:03:32.599> feel<00:03:32.780> free<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:32.989> take<00:03:33.199> it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
it's good you can feel free to take it

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.289 
it's good you can feel free to take it
and<00:03:33.560> just<00:03:33.620> add<00:03:34.129> as<00:03:34.250> much<00:03:34.370> detail<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:34.849> it<00:03:35.180> as<00:03:35.269> you

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
and just add as much detail to it as you

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.330 
and just add as much detail to it as you
want<00:03:35.569> with<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> Pens<00:03:36.169> use<00:03:36.739> different<00:03:37.069> weights

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
want with the Pens use different weights

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.740 
want with the Pens use different weights
and<00:03:37.699> different<00:03:37.790> thicknesses<00:03:38.389> of<00:03:38.540> ink<00:03:38.690> pens

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
and different thicknesses of ink pens

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.520 
and different thicknesses of ink pens
and<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:39.829> go<00:03:39.949> nuts<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:41.060> Pens<00:03:41.269> i<00:03:41.449> use<00:03:41.720> for

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
and just go nuts the Pens i use for

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.849 
and just go nuts the Pens i use for
inking<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.430> micron<00:03:44.030> pens<00:03:44.470> I've<00:03:45.470> dealt<00:03:45.769> with

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
inking is micron pens I've dealt with

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.949 
inking is micron pens I've dealt with
the<00:03:46.040> prismacolor<00:03:46.459> ink<00:03:46.879> pens<00:03:47.150> before<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.870> I

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
the prismacolor ink pens before and I

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.300 
the prismacolor ink pens before and I
don't<00:03:48.019> think<00:03:48.169> they<00:03:48.349> last<00:03:48.560> quite<00:03:48.769> as<00:03:48.919> long<00:03:48.949> and

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
don't think they last quite as long and

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.520 
don't think they last quite as long and
I<00:03:49.340> don't<00:03:49.400> think<00:03:49.639> there's<00:03:49.790> strong<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.780> also<00:03:51.230> like

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
I don't think there's strong I also like

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.460 
I don't think there's strong I also like
the<00:03:51.650> faber<00:03:51.889> faber<00:03:52.459> castell<00:03:53.290> weighted<00:03:54.290> ink

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
the faber faber castell weighted ink

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.319 
the faber faber castell weighted ink
pens<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:55.099> think<00:03:55.250> they're<00:03:55.370> called<00:03:55.549> Pitt<00:03:55.879> artist

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
pens I think they're called Pitt artist

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.210 
pens I think they're called Pitt artist
pens<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:57.169> you<00:03:57.290> can<00:03:57.379> really<00:03:57.560> find<00:03:57.799> those<00:03:58.010> as

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
pens and you can really find those as

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.250 
pens and you can really find those as
sets<00:03:58.639> in<00:03:58.940> any<00:03:59.150> art<00:03:59.419> supply<00:03:59.569> store<00:04:00.109> or<00:04:00.139> even

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
for the money in value you really can't

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.339 
for the money in value you really can't
go<00:04:04.669> wrong<00:04:04.699> with<00:04:04.970> micron<00:04:05.449> and<00:04:05.810> once<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.139> figure

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
go wrong with micron and once you figure

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.509 
go wrong with micron and once you figure
out<00:04:06.409> the<00:04:06.560> weight<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:06.919> you<00:04:07.040> tend<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.310> draw

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
out the weight that you tend to draw

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.800 
out the weight that you tend to draw
most<00:04:07.760> with<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.180> can<00:04:08.329> buy<00:04:08.479> them<00:04:08.659> individually

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
most with you can buy them individually

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.710 
most with you can buy them individually
instead<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.769> getting<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.040> whole<00:04:10.159> set<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.720> you

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
instead of getting a whole set and you

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.240 
instead of getting a whole set and you
know<00:04:11.810> never<00:04:12.079> using<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.590> point<00:04:12.829> zero<00:04:13.159> zero

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
know never using the point zero zero

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.620 
know never using the point zero zero
five<00:04:13.699> or<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.060> point<00:04:14.299> zero

eight<00:04:14.780> or<00:04:15.080> whatever<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.650> tend<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.459> draw<00:04:16.670> with

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
point zero one I guess for finer details

point zero one I guess for finer details
okay<00:04:23.480> step<00:04:23.780> five<00:04:24.020> is<00:04:24.050> color<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.890> is<00:04:25.040> a

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
okay step five is color this is a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.550 
okay step five is color this is a
difficult<00:04:26.270> step<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.540> master<00:04:26.990> especially<00:04:27.500> if

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
difficult step to master especially if

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.740 
difficult step to master especially if
you're<00:04:27.680> using<00:04:27.890> markers<00:04:28.340> like<00:04:28.520> what<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.730> do<00:04:28.970> but

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
you're using markers like what I do but

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.450 
you're using markers like what I do but
I'll<00:04:29.900> give<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.410> my<00:04:30.530> best<00:04:30.680> idea<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.280> good

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
I'll give you my best idea of a good

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.130 
I'll give you my best idea of a good
approach<00:04:31.850> if<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.180> just<00:04:32.330> want<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.570> try<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.810> i

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
approach if you just want to try it i

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.900 
approach if you just want to try it i
use<00:04:33.560> prismacolor<00:04:34.100> markers

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
use prismacolor markers

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.940 
use prismacolor markers
of<00:04:35.180> which<00:04:35.420> I've<00:04:35.750> cultivated<00:04:36.020> over<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.860> know

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
of which I've cultivated over you know

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.280 
of which I've cultivated over you know
150<00:04:37.640> or<00:04:37.790> so<00:04:37.970> over<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.390> past<00:04:38.540> few<00:04:38.780> years<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.230> I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
150 or so over the past few years and I

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.990 
150 or so over the past few years and I
just<00:04:39.320> replace<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.980> ones<00:04:40.160> that<00:04:40.640> I<00:04:40.700> use<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
just replace the ones that I use the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.850 
just replace the ones that I use the
most<00:04:41.060> with<00:04:41.540> individuals<00:04:42.110> when<00:04:42.320> they<00:04:42.410> go<00:04:42.530> dry

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
most with individuals when they go dry

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.590 
most with individuals when they go dry
so<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:43.610> instance<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:43.940> use<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> lot<00:04:44.330> of<00:04:44.420> light

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
so for instance I use a lot of light

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.180 
so for instance I use a lot of light
peach<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:45.560> use<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.010> lot<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.870> 30%<00:04:47.870> gray<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.980> just

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
peach I use a lot of 30% gray and I just

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.640 
peach I use a lot of 30% gray and I just
I<00:04:49.340> just<00:04:49.370> replaced<00:04:49.970> those<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.630> know<00:04:50.720> blue<00:04:51.200> calm

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
I just replaced those you know blue calm

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.370 
I just replaced those you know blue calm
whenever<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.370> run<00:04:52.550> out<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.780> key<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.050> coloring

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
whenever I run out the key to coloring

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.440 
whenever I run out the key to coloring
with<00:04:54.500> markers<00:04:54.890> is<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.430> build<00:04:55.640> up<00:04:55.880> from<00:04:56.090> the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
with markers is to build up from the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.900 
with markers is to build up from the
lightest<00:04:56.840> colors<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.560> darkest<00:04:57.980> colors<00:04:58.250> if

lightest colors to the darkest colors if

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.420 
lightest colors to the darkest colors if
you<00:04:59.090> go<00:04:59.270> too<00:04:59.330> dark<00:04:59.870> too<00:05:00.290> quick<00:05:00.650> there's<00:05:01.280> no

going back you can't erase what you've
put<00:05:03.650> down<00:05:03.740> with<00:05:04.070> markers<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:05.300> take<00:05:05.540> your<00:05:05.630> time

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
put down with markers so take your time

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.900 
put down with markers so take your time
start<00:05:06.800> with<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:06.980> lightest<00:05:07.310> markers<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.670> can

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
start with the lightest markers you can

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.580 
start with the lightest markers you can
and<00:05:08.330> work<00:05:08.510> your<00:05:08.660> way<00:05:08.720> deeper<00:05:09.170> and<00:05:09.320> deeper

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
and work your way deeper and deeper

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.530 
and work your way deeper and deeper
until<00:05:09.710> you've<00:05:09.980> got<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.340> good<00:05:10.580> range<00:05:10.850> of<00:05:11.270> light

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
until you've got a good range of light

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.230 
until you've got a good range of light
to<00:05:11.930> dark<00:05:12.310> this<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:13.370> where<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.640> good<00:05:13.820> color

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
to dark this is where a good color

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.720 
to dark this is where a good color
reference<00:05:14.660> comes<00:05:14.870> in<00:05:15.080> handy<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:16.580> just

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
reference comes in handy you can just

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.700 
reference comes in handy you can just
look<00:05:16.910> at<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.570> deep<00:05:17.750> colors<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.590> the

look at the the deep colors and the
light<00:05:18.860> colors<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.460> just<00:05:19.850> know<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.960> know<00:05:21.080> this

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
light colors and just know you know this

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.350 
light colors and just know you know this
is<00:05:21.410> gonna<00:05:21.560> be<00:05:21.710> too<00:05:21.890> dark<00:05:22.070> or<00:05:22.370> this<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.940> isn't

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
is gonna be too dark or this this isn't

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.350 
is gonna be too dark or this this isn't
light<00:05:23.570> enough<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:25.340> but<00:05:25.610> always<00:05:25.760> start<00:05:26.150> lighter

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
light enough so but always start lighter

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.320 
light enough so but always start lighter
and<00:05:26.660> go<00:05:27.290> darker<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.400> here's<00:05:28.640> here's<00:05:29.090> a<00:05:29.180> good

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
and go darker and here's here's a good

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.810 
and go darker and here's here's a good
technique<00:05:29.630> for<00:05:29.990> building<00:05:30.350> up<00:05:30.740> color<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.730> just

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
technique for building up color and just

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.130 
technique for building up color and just
make<00:05:32.060> sure<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.270> have<00:05:32.390> plenty<00:05:32.630> of<00:05:32.690> shades<00:05:33.020> of

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
make sure you have plenty of shades of

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.620 
make sure you have plenty of shades of
grey<00:05:33.410> nearby<00:05:33.980> this<00:05:34.850> is<00:05:34.910> one<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.270> best<00:05:35.450> ways

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
grey nearby this is one of the best ways

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.350 
grey nearby this is one of the best ways
of<00:05:35.780> darken<00:05:36.140> your<00:05:36.170> drawing<00:05:36.590> little<00:05:36.830> by<00:05:37.040> little

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
of darken your drawing little by little

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.760 
of darken your drawing little by little
say<00:05:38.360> for<00:05:38.570> instance<00:05:38.690> I<00:05:38.990> begin<00:05:39.380> with<00:05:39.530> a<00:05:39.560> light

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
say for instance I begin with a light

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.730 
say for instance I begin with a light
peach<00:05:40.040> for<00:05:40.370> someone's<00:05:40.670> face<00:05:41.350> but<00:05:42.350> the<00:05:42.440> next

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
peach for someone's face but the next

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.040 
peach for someone's face but the next
darker<00:05:43.160> tone<00:05:43.370> is<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.550> really<00:05:43.820> like<00:05:44.360> tan<00:05:44.690> color

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
darker tone is a really like tan color

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.130 
darker tone is a really like tan color
and<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:46.190> just<00:05:46.700> think<00:05:46.880> that's<00:05:46.970> just<00:05:47.120> too<00:05:47.420> dark<00:05:47.750> to

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
and I just think that's just too dark to

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.310 
and I just think that's just too dark to
lay<00:05:48.320> on<00:05:48.500> directly<00:05:49.400> next<00:05:49.960> so<00:05:50.960> I'll<00:05:51.110> start

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
lay on directly next so I'll start

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.020 
lay on directly next so I'll start
blending<00:05:51.530> some<00:05:51.830> light<00:05:52.010> Gray's<00:05:52.340> into<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:52.790> face

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
blending some light Gray's into the face

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.270 
blending some light Gray's into the face
and<00:05:53.390> then<00:05:54.260> I'll<00:05:54.350> add<00:05:54.500> some<00:05:54.680> blush<00:05:54.890> pinks<00:05:55.220> and

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
and then I'll add some blush pinks and

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.680 
and then I'll add some blush pinks and
then<00:05:55.430> I'll<00:05:55.520> have<00:05:55.670> a<00:05:55.700> good<00:05:55.910> kind<00:05:56.300> of<00:05:56.360> medium

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
then I'll have a good kind of medium

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.680 
then I'll have a good kind of medium
color<00:05:56.960> to<00:05:57.320> blend<00:05:57.680> into<00:05:58.040> a<00:05:58.220> light<00:05:58.460> tan<00:05:58.730> so<00:05:59.480> it's

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
color to blend into a light tan so it's

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.760 
color to blend into a light tan so it's
just<00:05:59.870> things<00:06:00.050> like<00:06:00.110> that<00:06:00.350> you<00:06:00.440> just<00:06:00.590> want<00:06:00.740> to

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
just things like that you just want to

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.280 
just things like that you just want to
experiment<00:06:01.190> with<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.490> color<00:06:01.700> and<00:06:02.690> and<00:06:03.050> see

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
experiment with the color and and see

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.050 
experiment with the color and and see
what<00:06:03.410> builds<00:06:03.710> up<00:06:03.860> better

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
what builds up better

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.820 
what builds up better
let's<00:06:05.600> go<00:06:05.750> according<00:06:06.140> definitely<00:06:06.530> according

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
let's go according definitely according

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.920 
let's go according definitely according
to<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:06.980> reference<00:06:07.310> you're<00:06:07.430> using<00:06:07.780> if<00:06:08.780> you're

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
not sure how light or dark a color is

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.880 
not sure how light or dark a color is
going<00:06:11.180> to<00:06:11.270> be<00:06:11.360> or<00:06:11.930> what<00:06:11.990> it's<00:06:12.500> going<00:06:12.680> to<00:06:12.740> look

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
going to be or what it's going to look

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.040 
going to be or what it's going to look
like<00:06:12.950> over<00:06:13.340> another<00:06:13.760> color<00:06:14.060> just<00:06:14.600> have<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.810> big

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
like over another color just have a big

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.290 
like over another color just have a big
