00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.660 
sure what was going on in your mind
being<00:00:11.910> at<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> bottom<00:00:12.269> two<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.610> pretty<00:00:14.610> much

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
being at the bottom two and pretty much

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.480 
being at the bottom two and pretty much
for<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.260> thought<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.279> had<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
for just thought that we just had to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.250 
for just thought that we just had to
bounce<00:00:17.640> back<00:00:17.940> from<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:18.990> had<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> be

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
bounce back from it and which had to be

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.960 
bounce back from it and which had to be
really<00:00:19.500> positive<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.250> guess<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.580> used<00:00:20.760> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
really positive and I guess we used it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.300 
really positive and I guess we used it
as<00:00:21.150> hunger<00:00:21.810> instead<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.130> just

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
as hunger instead and just for we just

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
great by the way do you feel that being

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.830 
great by the way do you feel that being
from<00:00:34.290> New<00:00:34.410> Zealand<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
from New Zealand is kind of the the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.229 
from New Zealand is kind of the the
factor<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> why<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.489> guys<00:00:38.670> didn't<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
factor of why you guys didn't have that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.979 
factor of why you guys didn't have that
many<00:00:39.329> votes<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:41.120> think<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
many votes I think so and it's kind of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.590 
many votes I think so and it's kind of
all<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.120> may<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.300> from

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
all we can think of is that may be from

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
all we can think of is that may be from
another<00:00:45.809> country<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.500> people<00:00:46.920> don't<00:00:47.039> really

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
another country so people don't really

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
another country so people don't really
want<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> vote<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.700> us<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.660> okay

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
want to vote for us but that's okay

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.690 
want to vote for us but that's okay
because<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
because like you know we really like to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
because like you know we really like to
be<00:00:50.820> challenged<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> guess<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
be challenged so I guess we just have to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.840 
be challenged so I guess we just have to
keep<00:00:52.379> proving<00:00:52.680> ourselves<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.370> America<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
keep proving ourselves to America and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.360 
keep proving ourselves to America and
show<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.690> why<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.199> need<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> stay<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
show them why we need to stay on the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
like in a New Zealand it's

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.890 
like in a New Zealand it's
it's<00:02:12.930> small<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.420> best<00:02:15.600> way<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> could

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's small but the best way I could

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.440 
it's small but the best way I could
describe<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.620> would<00:02:16.860> probably<00:02:17.190> be<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.820> raw

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
