00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.330
 it's the resourceful then the advice 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.890
 for this month it concerns the experience the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 dance droplets higher than 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.370
 you find in your magazine the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.080
 resourceful people to experience 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.260
 needed a lot of material 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.210
 first of all mineral oil a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.510
 little glass of water with pencils 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 foil his scissors a little 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.869
 stick or spoon could well 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.970
 to make a grand ball vinegar 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.309
 and baking soda and for you 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.550
 help you can also use 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.110
 reminds a uv light resist then 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.730
 I show you how to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.590
 remove the angle of his pencils if all 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.660
 first I choose a color by 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.789
 example I chose the legs and I 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.200
 will have to remove the inside of my 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.820
 pencil for this I'm going to use 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:02.520
 a pair of tongs and I'm going to go 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:04.920
 look inside if this with 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.720
 which I will be able to extract the old 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 all I have to do is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.200
 to cut it the indre of plastic 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.939
 like these along the wall 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.740
 if you hold it with your Vaudois fingers 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.369
 will not be attached it's the inside in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.610
 felt that is filled with colors 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.280
 languages 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.280
 we want to use it to do something 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 thing of foil would be cuts and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.840
 it like this and I'm going to get soaked 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.920
 in my little glass of water and I loved 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 obviously the felt to go 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.820
 look for any liping corn are at 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 inside to get a nice 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.430
 color solution I put that aside and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.640
 continues now that we are preparing it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.439
 and our very colorful angle here is what 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.299
 do you to do our dance of 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.219
 fluorescent droplets first of all 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.280
 we add a little baking soda 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.020
 in the bottom of a glass like these 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.289
 nothing to have a good background 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.519
 two biarrots on it 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.259
 buy mineral oil 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.150
 I advise you to use their edge 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.129
 from your glass to pour it all 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.489
 to prevent its shape from small 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.640
 droplets that would be less pretty when 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.730
 from the experience that oil is added 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.120
 mineral like this if you ever have 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.010
 mineral product you can use from 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.390
 vegetable oil 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.900
 if just less beautiful because the plant 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.730
 as we all know it's more like newspaper 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.010
 will then be at that moment we will be able to 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.540
 get with some mineral oil 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.849
 much more transparent thing you 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.799
 go see air bubbles coming out 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.739
 inside your voice it's normal 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.569
 once you did that then 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.950
 we add our vinegar and what is 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.519
 important is to combine our 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.049
 vinegar with colorful suction but 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.120
 why but not directly in to 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.150
 that's a good question it's because 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.890
 that vinegar tends to destroy the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.370
 fluorescent which is inside of 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.220
 glass 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.730
 so we have to add our vinegar to 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.500
 mixed 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.049
 and when started to see reactions 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.970
 at but we add our pigments 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.280
 fleury so he's going to have a fluorescence 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.530
 that will happen because vinegar 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.510
 and bicarbonate of this fund a reaction 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.000
 chemical that produces water and salt 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.370
 so water does not tend to destroy those 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.760
 but if you help them even more 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.060
 but just add a UV light 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.420
 next door and we'll see what's up 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.920
 give 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.970
 so we will approach the camera for 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:40.010
 see more and now we add 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.010
 vinegar inside 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.540
 and we will take a few solutions 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.620
 color 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.710
 and now it's enclosing the light 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.130
 by the way if you want you can 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.350
 add a few drops of dye 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.830
 food inside to see this 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.830
 what will happen 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.060
 so it was yanick shepherd who would you 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.390
 wish good and happy experiences 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.390
