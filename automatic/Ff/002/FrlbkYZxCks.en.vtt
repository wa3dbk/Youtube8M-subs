00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.740
 that we have the mini instead of the Monday with ball head I will always 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.700
 Give a short introduction They look very compact so it is up to them 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.949
 a lot of packaging 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.980
 and the whole thing here consists of those 3 1 feet where you then also the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.410
 Examiner can ask that is rounds for the smallest greetings 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.539
 to expand 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.269
 Just take off the whole here then will happen with this little coup 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.539
 fixed if you want to do it again you have to wait fix against 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.179
 to press 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.980
 but really solid should not be so if then just the tips 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.850
 take a shower 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.460
 So just for a short time against is the whole press again 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.510
 and you just have to fire the next stage here 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.130
 the screws up to the program under them then you can see the foot as well 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.630
 extend 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.650
 Of course, of course, do not forget to fix in the followers 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.370
 and then of course there is the possibility 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.740
 Uppsala has the chamber but only with game for something like that 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.270
 in this the also the possibility that one can say now Nokia would like 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.120
 forgive the big one I just want to put my foot down or employers 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.050
 makes the whole trumped then 3 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.820
 just against 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.680
 Furthermore, the Roma can still take a little care one can move out 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.490
 the whole thing is fixed here with this screw 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 whatever that has been solved then of course you can also here again 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.750
 which took out a bit as you finally got the Gugge finds and that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.850
 quite simply here again as with the big tripod usually yes then too 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.670
 attached again 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.270
 And then of course we have the ball head on top 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.330
 except again 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 I should be natural and again that when retracting so 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.970
 then there were tears 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.030
 Tim is a bit difficult for some camera but Stegner they are tall 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.780
 there million the ball head 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.300
 So there will be here 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.430
 The cuboid fixes so often over this beam 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.730
 variable use is therefore to the total vertical and then of course here 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.870
 fix with this screw 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.650
 and you can not move anyway 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.990
 and of course very important 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.850
 that the winds for which it covers the tests the counterpart of winning the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 Camera and fix the camera is still important up here 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.700
 Surface is working so you do not have to worry about that 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.559
 a biotope has come to his comrades 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.379
 Everything is therefore set for school-related 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.729
 in the second part signs for how the whole looks built up 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:22.089
 which can achieve what the great relationship to the SZR 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.219
 represents 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.419
 what drew he had that now percent built up the tripod 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.179
 who in the highest altitude 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.569
 I would like to say that we have different offers 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.269
 should sexy Cora Schumacher tripods differ Aldi now the information 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.149
 the abstract size 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.429
 but everything else is forgiven 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.139
 almost everything identical 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.499
 Canada is that I now attached here on the tripod the rounds easy 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.920
 screwed in here at the side then fixed with the ball head i can do that 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.729
 Of course, now I also turned that would not want so that 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.939
 whole city the four animals live that is so then the above freely movable 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.829
 and the feet undressed Keitel I now also India and various 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.379
 still big 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.149
 I think I have to stay that way 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.149
 BZ explains Prof 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.239
 open up there 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.439
 but that's what you do 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.079
 around 1000 meters 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.609
 fix and of course this can also be adjusted to the individual 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.360
 then want 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.619
 the hosts of the area had to take pictures 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:20.649
 and 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.379
 the whole is a construction yes she is young and still on the hands around the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.379
 Feet has that means it is also rough 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.790
 Bucher St advised the ministers and several of the surface 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.439
 that really makes me stop it 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.159
 Of course I can go there too, the big part again 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
 as arbitrary as I need it 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.139
 So this is Karl May the city deep or the two family 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.039
 Tripods subject the most diverse outlet Russian once again the hint 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.669
 This movie is an example if you have something bigger a little smaller tripod 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.539
 that's the bigger version 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.799
 if I do that in my head 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.829
 that's that no I'm the deep and math
