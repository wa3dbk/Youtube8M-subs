that it's still a very awkward and very
in-between<00:02:19.160> 2-week<00:02:20.160> mustache<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.060> hope<00:02:21.239> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
in-between 2-week mustache but I hope a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.059 
in-between 2-week mustache but I hope a
good<00:02:21.480> deal<00:02:21.630> more<00:02:21.900> presentable<00:02:22.319> at<00:02:22.890> least

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069
