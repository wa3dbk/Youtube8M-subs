00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.260
 basic signs of its editorial editor and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.530

 twitter etcetera and we are one of the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.340
 few companies that absolutely all 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.460
 the queries that are made are always 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.989
 Answered 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 quite accurately and technically 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.340
 we consider with the keys of the signs 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.739
 as it says of identity and is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.230
 just the proximity of the reader and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.710
 try to always be very in line with 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.809
 what a fan of manga or comics in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 general may want what requirements 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.160
 you need a cartoonist to be able 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.140
 publish your editorial at this time 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.770
 be Japanese because we are publishing 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.129
 very very little by Western authors 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 we have tried in previous years to open 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.630
 lines of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.340
 local authors but have not had support 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 of the public or sales have been 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.610
 always relatively low then in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.550
 this moment we are publishing a little 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.410
 nothing of local artists to 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.390
 contact us if someone wants to edit 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.610
 something there is a mail on the web that says how 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.460
 send a comic sample in general 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.970
 drawing six pages requested and have 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.190
 finished with that is evaluated if the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.710
 project is interesting and if in case 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.300
 to be alone of the editorial team 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 contact the person who sent the 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.860
 shows and talks more deeply 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 about the project then we could 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.280
 say that iberia is currently a 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.710
 japanese comic editorial in this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.440
 moment mainly if it is oriented more 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.450
 towards the soho or towards the young 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.830
 we have practically the same amount 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.380
 of eyes for girls as they are for boys 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.850
 we also publish shine on what would be 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.020
 for more adult men and also 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.420
 we published 86 that is for girls let's say 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.620
 after 20 years old 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.210
 You recently introduced yourself if you 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.250
 What's new for 2014? Which one do you want? 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.440
 be the most interesting title or that is 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.210
 rather welcomed by the public of what 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.280
 that we have announced in this room of the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.830
 manga we will publish in 2014 the most 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.950
 expected everything will be doing button da that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.860
 it is a sign in very popular in japan east 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.420
 moment in other countries of europe 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.060
 survival species on the Ticos that 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.890
 they have to survive fighting in a way 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.040
 violence on an island may have some 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.370
 similarity to a classic of this genre 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.770
 called battle royal is and well this 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.300
 series all Spanish publishers 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.810
 they were behind them we had the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.880
 lucky that the Japanese editor 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.310
 finally or choose our proposal 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.540
 and we hope to start it out of shape 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.579
 monthly in January 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.349
 we can also see that the ivrea stand 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.629
 It is one of the largest in the 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.450
 barcelona sleeve as being viewed as 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.989
 editorial this event 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.239
 I see it problematic because there is so much 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.690
 people who want to enter that it seems that 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.540
 is the organization of the adopted fira 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.239
 by dosing the entry then there is 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.819
 few people coming in with regard to the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.400
 what is really doing the queue this 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.050
 makes good we are today Saturday 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.019
 example of historically always the day 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.390
 of more sale we are with very sales 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.700
 modest more than anything because really 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.080
 in the pavilion that we are not traveling 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.720
 people 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.230
 out of that the truth the lounge that goes 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.490
 year more may not have been finally 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.490
 in the fira de montjuïc 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.980
 I see it as a very positive event and what 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.390
 what else is selling on your stand 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.670
 is currently in the manga room 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.650
 what is the audience asking the most? 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.870
 truth is that it is very distributed the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.450
 sale I would not know what to tell you 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.250
 exactly is working a lot 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.049
 We are selling a lot of the new volume 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.400

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.900
 number 34 the strongest release 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.150
