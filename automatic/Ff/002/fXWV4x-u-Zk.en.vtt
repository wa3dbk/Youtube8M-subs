00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
just gonna embrace it and accept it for

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.330

the<00:01:19.370> way<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.270> sounds<00:01:21.230> so<00:01:21.380> cliche

the way it is sounds so cliche

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
the way it is sounds so cliche
but<00:01:23.300> really<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:24.760> didn't<00:01:25.760> want<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.970> go<00:01:26.090> down<00:01:26.120> that

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
but really I didn't want to go down that

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.350 
but really I didn't want to go down that
path<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:27.080> hating<00:01:27.590> my<00:01:27.770> hair<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.430> feeling<00:01:29.270> like

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
path of hating my hair and feeling like

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.750 
path of hating my hair and feeling like
I<00:01:29.600> need<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:31.550> wig<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:32.090> feel<00:01:33.940> okay<00:01:36.160> it's<00:01:37.160> taking

I need the wig to feel okay it's taking
so<00:01:37.970> long<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:42.250> think<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.370> might<00:01:43.640> cut<00:01:44.090> some<00:01:46.240> more

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
so long I think I might cut some more

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.880 
so long I think I might cut some more
off<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.690> bottom

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890

don't like the way that ends are looking
I<00:02:45.190> gave<00:02:46.000> myself<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.540> trim<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.140> end<00:02:47.350> still

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
I gave myself a trim but the end still

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.060 
I gave myself a trim but the end still
look<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:50.640> they're<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.820> dry<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:53.070> I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
look like this they're just dry and I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.130 
look like this they're just dry and I
don't<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.430> if<00:02:54.580> it's<00:02:54.700> something<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:56.080> be

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
don't know if it's something that can be

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.920 
don't know if it's something that can be
fixed<00:02:56.950> with<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.760> deep<00:02:58.090> conditioning

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
fixed with just deep conditioning

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.990 
fixed with just deep conditioning
I<00:02:58.960> might<00:02:59.739> have<00:02:59.920> crossed<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.430> point<00:03:00.850> of

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
I might have crossed that point of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720 
I might have crossed that point of
no-return<00:03:01.239> already<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.250> just<00:03:03.430> doesn't

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
no-return already like it just doesn't

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.360 
no-return already like it just doesn't
look<00:03:04.920> nice<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.430> there's<00:03:06.760> no<00:03:06.970> point<00:03:07.300> having

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
look nice and there's no point having

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.540 
look nice and there's no point having
this<00:03:09.370> length<00:03:09.850> if<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.420> can't<00:03:10.720> even<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:12.220> health

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
this length if I can't even have health

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.530 
this length if I can't even have health
as<00:03:12.820> well<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.570> I'm<00:03:14.380> considering<00:03:15.130> if<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:16.090> doesn't

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
as well so I'm considering if it doesn't

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.130 
as well so I'm considering if it doesn't
get<00:03:16.690> better<00:03:16.900> by<00:03:17.550> my<00:03:18.550> 5-year<00:03:19.180> anniversary<00:03:19.330> I'm

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
get better by my 5-year anniversary I'm

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.070 
get better by my 5-year anniversary I'm
just<00:03:21.040> gonna<00:03:21.220> cut<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.730> all<00:03:21.880> off<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.450> really<00:03:22.900> don't

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
just gonna cut it all off I really don't

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.930 
just gonna cut it all off I really don't
care<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:23.950> not<00:03:24.100> really<00:03:24.250> an<00:03:24.430> emotional

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
care and it's not really an emotional

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.490 
care and it's not really an emotional
decision<00:03:25.330> I've<00:03:25.660> been<00:03:25.900> thinking<00:03:26.200> about<00:03:26.320> this

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
decision I've been thinking about this

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.400 
decision I've been thinking about this
for<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.769> long<00:03:26.950> time<00:03:27.220> because<00:03:27.519> my<00:03:27.730> hair<00:03:27.970> looks

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
for a long time because my hair looks

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.650 
for a long time because my hair looks
healthier<00:03:29.410> when<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:30.190> shorter<00:03:30.670> if<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.090> look

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
healthier when it's shorter if you look

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.920 
healthier when it's shorter if you look
at<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.170> roots<00:03:32.820> nice<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.120> full<00:03:34.330> but<00:03:34.600> then<00:03:34.750> when

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
at the roots nice and full but then when

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.259 
at the roots nice and full but then when
you<00:03:35.080> go<00:03:35.260> out<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.830> ends<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:38.560> can<00:03:38.739> see

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.050 
you go out on the ends it's you can see
you<00:03:40.269> can<00:03:40.450> see<00:03:40.690> through<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.700> my<00:03:42.700> hair<00:03:42.940> is

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
already fine as it is so it looks even

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.370 
already fine as it is so it looks even
more<00:03:45.489> fine

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
unless I put it in an updo it looks even

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.790 
unless I put it in an updo it looks even
more<00:03:50.860> fine<00:03:51.459> when<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:52.030> out<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:53.380> want<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.709> be

February
to<00:03:58.510> shape<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.290> looked<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.560> little

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
to shape it and it looked a little

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.400 
to shape it and it looked a little
better<00:04:00.010> maybe<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.709> get<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.769> profession

cut that I'm just over it to be honest

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.510 
cut that I'm just over it to be honest
the<00:04:09.050> reason<00:04:09.200> why<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.440> don't<00:04:09.590> want<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.070> cut<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.430> is

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
the reason why I don't want to cut it is

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.850 
the reason why I don't want to cut it is
because<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.880> can<00:04:11.300> do<00:04:11.600> those<00:04:11.870> five<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.620> ten

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
because I can do those five to ten

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.440 
because I can do those five to ten
minute<00:04:13.190> up<00:04:13.340> dudes<00:04:13.610> without<00:04:14.000> thinking<00:04:14.390> about

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
minute up dudes without thinking about

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.479 
minute up dudes without thinking about
it<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:15.020> I<00:04:15.980> can<00:04:16.340> put<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.209> in<00:04:17.330> cornrows<00:04:17.959> and<00:04:18.489> wear

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
it and I can put it in cornrows and wear

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.600 
it and I can put it in cornrows and wear
wigs<00:04:19.760> so<00:04:20.750> that's<00:04:21.110> why<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.650> haven't<00:04:22.040> cut<00:04:22.460> it

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610

full<00:04:56.150> at<00:04:56.300> all<00:04:57.340> see<00:04:58.570> just<00:04:59.570> took<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.960> twists<00:05:00.290> out

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.430 

I'm<00:05:05.960> trying<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.410> come<00:05:06.650> with<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.860> plan<00:05:07.190> now<00:05:07.460> I

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
I'm trying to come with a plan now I

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.560 
I'm trying to come with a plan now I
still<00:05:09.440> don't<00:05:09.620> think<00:05:09.680> it's<00:05:10.240> possible<00:05:11.240> for<00:05:11.300> me

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
still don't think it's possible for me

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.020 
still don't think it's possible for me
to<00:05:11.600> wash<00:05:11.900> my<00:05:12.170> hair<00:05:12.500> every<00:05:12.820> week<00:05:13.820> or<00:05:14.000> every

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
to wash my hair every week or every

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.250 
to wash my hair every week or every
couple<00:05:14.510> weeks

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
couple weeks

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.030 
couple weeks
I<00:05:15.290> think<00:05:16.180> I'll<00:05:17.180> still<00:05:17.570> do<00:05:17.840> once<00:05:18.290> a<00:05:18.500> month<00:05:18.710> and

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
I think I'll still do once a month and

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.040 
I think I'll still do once a month and
try<00:05:19.520> not<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.570> stretch<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.260> out

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
try not to stretch it out

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.570 
try not to stretch it out
try<00:05:24.050> not<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.290> stretch<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.860> out<00:05:24.950> longer<00:05:25.280> than<00:05:25.430> a

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
try not to stretch it out longer than a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.910 
try not to stretch it out longer than a
month<00:05:25.880> because<00:05:26.750> maybe<00:05:27.260> that's<00:05:27.590> what's

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
month because maybe that's what's

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.059 
I used to do the medium sized twist and
just<00:06:25.169> leaving<00:06:25.680> those<00:06:25.860> alone<00:06:26.509> spraying<00:06:27.509> them

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
every other day or so

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.950 
every other day or so
just<00:06:30.870> keeping<00:06:31.699> the<00:06:32.699> hair<00:06:32.939> moisturize<00:06:33.509> instead

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
just keeping the hair moisturize instead

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.100 
just keeping the hair moisturize instead
of<00:06:34.610> completely<00:06:35.610> forgetting<00:06:36.479> about<00:06:36.599> it<00:06:36.960> which

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
of completely forgetting about it which

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.739 
of completely forgetting about it which
is<00:06:37.259> what<00:06:37.439> I've<00:06:37.589> been<00:06:37.620> doing<00:06:38.120> for<00:06:39.120> at<00:06:39.330> least<00:06:39.509> a

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:39.749 
is what I've been doing for at least a

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:44.119 
is what I've been doing for at least a
year<00:06:39.779> I<00:06:40.199> think<00:06:40.680> I'm<00:06:41.189> just<00:06:41.399> gonna<00:06:41.569> be<00:06:42.569> very<00:06:43.129> not

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
year I think I'm just gonna be very not

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:46.159 
year I think I'm just gonna be very not
very<00:06:44.460> disciplined<00:06:44.879> but<00:06:45.149> keep<00:06:45.360> my<00:06:45.509> hair<00:06:45.779> in<00:06:45.990> the

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
very disciplined but keep my hair in the

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.649 
very disciplined but keep my hair in the
wigs<00:06:46.469> and<00:06:47.210> leave<00:06:48.210> it<00:06:48.419> alone<00:06:48.960> but<00:06:49.349> spray<00:06:49.830> it<00:06:50.039> I

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
wigs and leave it alone but spray it I

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.179 
wigs and leave it alone but spray it I
think<00:06:51.659> that's<00:06:51.839> the<00:06:52.050> most<00:06:52.229> that<00:06:52.499> I<00:06:52.620> can<00:06:52.649> do<00:06:52.979> and

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:53.189 
think that's the most that I can do and

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.850 
think that's the most that I can do and
then<00:06:53.629> instead<00:06:54.629> of<00:06:54.689> wash<00:06:54.930> my<00:06:55.110> hair<00:06:55.379> I<00:06:55.740> was

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
then instead of wash my hair I was

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.429 
then instead of wash my hair I was
trying<00:06:56.249> to<00:06:56.339> stretch<00:06:56.639> my<00:06:57.059> washes<00:06:57.569> to<00:06:57.810> like<00:06:57.990> six

00:06:58.429 --> 00:06:58.439 
trying to stretch my washes to like six

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:03.290 
trying to stretch my washes to like six
weeks<00:06:59.389> eight<00:07:00.389> weeks<00:07:00.419> I<00:07:01.259> think<00:07:01.459> it's<00:07:02.459> time<00:07:02.789> to

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
weeks eight weeks I think it's time to

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.600 
weeks eight weeks I think it's time to
get<00:07:03.509> back<00:07:03.779> to<00:07:04.050> the<00:07:04.199> three<00:07:04.830> to<00:07:05.009> four<00:07:05.279> weeks

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610
