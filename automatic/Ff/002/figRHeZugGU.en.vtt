00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
and moving the mixer out of the way get

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.890 
and moving the mixer out of the way get
back<00:01:13.330> back<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.230> few<00:01:14.260> seconds<00:01:15.900> this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
back back to that in a few seconds this

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.120 
back back to that in a few seconds this
little<00:01:17.170> white<00:01:17.290> box<00:01:17.590> right<00:01:17.800> here<00:01:18.010> it's

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
little white box right here it's

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.250 
little white box right here it's
actually<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.640> power<00:01:18.820> supply<00:01:19.240> unit<00:01:19.270> which<00:01:19.900> is

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
actually the power supply unit which is

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.630 
actually the power supply unit which is
very<00:01:20.560> different<00:01:20.920> because<00:01:21.010> it<00:01:21.280> has<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.430> little

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
very different because it has a little

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.360 
very different because it has a little
s-video<00:01:22.180> type<00:01:22.630> input<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.830> plugs<00:01:24.070> into<00:01:24.220> the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
s-video type input that plugs into the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.940 
s-video type input that plugs into the
top<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.730> mixer<00:01:25.230> as<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.440> see<00:01:26.620> here<00:01:26.860> and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
top of the mixer as you can see here and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.920 
top of the mixer as you can see here and
on<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.130> other<00:01:27.160> side<00:01:27.550> there<00:01:28.330> is<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.510> power

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
on the other side there is a power

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.530 
on the other side there is a power
outlet<00:01:29.170> plug<00:01:29.940> so<00:01:30.940> let's<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.210> put<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.420> down

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
outlet plug so let's just put that down

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.290 
outlet plug so let's just put that down
and<00:01:31.870> get<00:01:31.960> right<00:01:32.230> back<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.680> mixer<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:34.180> I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
and get right back to the mixer if I

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.290 
and get right back to the mixer if I
didn't<00:01:34.510> mention<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.870> before<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.940> said<00:01:37.180> that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
didn't mention it before it said that

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.730 
didn't mention it before it said that
becomes<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.690> phantom<00:01:38.050> power<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.410> phantom

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
becomes a phantom power and phantom

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.900 
becomes a phantom power and phantom
power<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.040> actually<00:01:39.250> made<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.730> power

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
power is actually made to power

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.120 
power is actually made to power
condenser<00:01:40.390> microphones<00:01:40.780> there's<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.800> lot<00:01:41.980> of
