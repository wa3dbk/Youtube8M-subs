over<00:03:19.310> where<00:03:19.460> I<00:03:19.490> wanted<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.320> go<00:03:21.500> ahead<00:03:21.650> and

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
over where I wanted it so I go ahead and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.920 
over where I wanted it so I go ahead and
cut<00:03:21.890> into<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.700> let<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.480> see<00:03:26.720> what<00:03:26.870> it

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
looks like it's literally just falling

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.250 
looks like it's literally just falling
apart<00:03:31.250> it'd<00:03:32.150> be<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.390> little<00:03:32.570> more<00:03:32.780> pleasing<00:03:33.110> to

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
apart it'd be a little more pleasing to

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.050 
apart it'd be a little more pleasing to
the<00:03:33.440> eye<00:03:33.470> if<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.340> would<00:03:34.490> have<00:03:34.550> taken<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.910> time
