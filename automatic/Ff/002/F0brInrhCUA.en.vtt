 the release of secrets and easter eggs again 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.360
 lighthouse rockstar games love to make mystic 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.910

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 degradantov their games and so how 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.859
 being discussed on the internet added a mansion 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.320
 charlie manson himself is a famous usa 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.230
 phreak killed innocent people in principle 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.170
 in addition, they created a family family 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.750
 but not the family that ordinary people have 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.119
 normal people and the family is the same 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.340
 fucking the same fucking psychos 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.649
 in short something like a group of people 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 which are a little bit of that youtube but they 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.660
 also loved by mana and a little and here is the house 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.149
 gta 5 which is the prototype of the house 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.219
 in which manson was by the way 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 very close to the second dwelling of franklin 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.110
 not far from this apartment 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.809
 notice the red inscription in 1807 and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 left arrow in time for that house as 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.760
 vanguet people that number 18 number 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.239
 family members of charlie manson the very 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.550
 families are not real a07 is the number 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.689
 victims well and the arrow points to this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.150
 house in maniacs house not found 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.270
 although there are servants that the game goes 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.560
 character looks like charlie manson 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 rockstar certainly didn't confirm that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.659
 so most likely this is just nonsense 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.270
 we all know how many myths have been made up 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.220
 around gta by the way charlie manson can 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.979
 see in one of the series of south park 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 before there was a parody of him she painted 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.710
 marilyn manson took the surname just in 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.750
 Charlie's honor and he himself sang 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.579
 used to type he even wanted to become 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.740
 singer but also listened to the beatles and 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.270
 once in the song beatles he heard 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.950
 call to kill 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.950
 one word went 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.440

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.910
 Contests are constantly held with 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.400
 great gifts in steam and origin of 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.990
 generally recommend to read 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.210
 really interesting materials and what 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.930
 not least competent author of reference in 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.770
 description 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.660
 here you can see the reference to 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.670
 terminators shop with plants 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.400
 firstly a plant logo in 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.250
 glasses but extremely reminiscent of the terminator 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.440
 secondly the name of the store and frazochka 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.960
 about the plant, too, as it sends 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.320
 the crown phrase of the terminator was ile bi 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.920
 back here ile bi back mayor translated 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.920
 like a corr 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.740
 Hello! 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.180
 superman 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.300
 here it is the building on these coordinates 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.220
 has a globe on its roof on the side of the planet 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.620
 midi or glow is somehow not strange all this 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.989
 it looks like a building from comic disi 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.480
 called the Daily Planet 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:14.000
 and immediately another similar easter egg 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.860
 water support tower richard majestic sleep 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.900
 studios richard majestic if we see 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.300
 At this studio, there are a lot of similarities with 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.430
 studio warner brothers literally 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.040
 all some details of course yes there is not 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.230
 depicted some hero there buck baths 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.120
 and so on there are none they are not this again but 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.850
 there is a water tower which 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.070
 almost identical to the real tower 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.200
 warner brothers which stands in real 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.950
 world and which can be seen congress in 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.739
 USA 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.930
 well, and perhaps the freshest easter eggs 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.610
 more precisely the continuation of this easter egg which 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.100
 many did not notice I showed her how 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.019
 just before the robbery is Michelle 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.850
 in gta 5 yes she lit up in one of 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.920
 missions when tormented man and wanted 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.290
 shove him a flashlight this time 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.750
 robberies we see it a little more often and 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.970
 no doubt there is no Michelle 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.920
 first girl Niko bellika in liberty 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.440
 the city that can say it 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.150
 she used dads 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.980
 as it stirs up all sorts of shady dealings and 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.660
 no wonder because robbery is 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.330
 kinda like gta 5 prequel 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.190
 let us know the story of Michelle just 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.380
 still just such time interval 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.790
 before gta 5 and here it is already possible and 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.370
 consider from all sides from all 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.220
 angles she has here what speech 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.500
 there is no doubt this is michel on this 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.060
 me all easter eggs gta 5 everything remains 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.700
 less i find some nuggets 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.410
 literally already remnants of a whole if you 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.970
 missed something i have playlists 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.910
