00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.900
 good attention to this filtration because 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.720
 more than one will be interested in 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.300
 software a saga more than important in 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.269
 the last generation in xbox 360 in 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.250
 concrete could appear on xbox one 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.110
 years of war by marcus phoenix 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.170
 collection that's what this is called 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.320
 compilation a collection that 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.270
 Microsoft would have interest in carrying 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.800
 xbox one would have several news 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.020
 to his credit 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.390
 the fact is that phil spencer made a 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.550
 retweet a request for a collection 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.580
 of this saga in the new generation of 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.470
 consoles and attentive because later what 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.780
 deleted good because attentive because game 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.880
 poor has filtered all kinds of details 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.220
 In this respect, this is practically a 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.140
 reality aside from hanging a picture of 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.790
 the trilogy where you can read the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.910
 name very similar to the one they chose 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.650
 for the halo compilation it is explained 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.630
 that the game will come with several 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.270
 news the two newest features 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.210
 important would be the 1080p resolution 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.910
 natives and cooperative mode for four 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.130
 players in the three games of gears of 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.840
 war not only in the third installment 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.390
 how could you enjoy 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.939
 xbox 360 of course all this are 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.890
 rumors is a leak we do not know if 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.569
 that in real or we will not be behind 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.579
 the information to be able to confirm it 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.740
 during the next hours it is important 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.990
 say that according to this game filtration 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.060
 poor the game would come with all the dlc 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 and map packs appeared until the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.829
 we would also have access to 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.709
 the beta of gears of war 4 for spring 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.229
 next year 2016 this and I think that 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:37.209
 is to overtake too much but good is a 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.890
 filtration, let's not forget it and also 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.020
 says that users would receive a 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.069
 digital copy of the soundtrack and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.500
 we'll see if this is true or not but 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.599
 certainly since the catalog of 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.849
 Playstation 4 also receives so many 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.619
 remasters of different nature 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.020
 because he was not going to do it 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.060
 xbox one catalog in this case with 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.770
 exclusive titles of his previous 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.689
 desktop console a saga so 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.909
 important how software can attract 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.909
 many users to xbox one
