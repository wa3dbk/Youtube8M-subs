00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.710 

so<00:00:51.040> speaking<00:00:52.040> of<00:00:52.190> Michelangelo<00:00:52.880> my<00:00:53.210> probably

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
so speaking of Michelangelo my probably

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.910 
so speaking of Michelangelo my probably
all-time<00:00:54.170> favorite<00:00:54.590> warm<00:00:54.770> up<00:00:54.950> I<00:00:56.770> learned<00:00:57.770> from

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
all-time favorite warm up I learned from

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.590 
all-time favorite warm up I learned from
my<00:00:58.070> clan<00:00:58.340> Zillow<00:00:58.640> through<00:00:58.940> other<00:00:59.180> people<00:00:59.540> I

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
my clan Zillow through other people I

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.979 
my clan Zillow through other people I
learned<00:00:59.809> from<00:00:59.960> Paul<00:01:00.110> Gilbert<00:01:00.410> first<00:01:00.800> but

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
learned from Paul Gilbert first but

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.910 
learned from Paul Gilbert first but
Michelangelo<00:01:02.989> was<00:01:03.379> probably<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.739> first

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
Michelangelo was probably the first

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:19.060 
Michelangelo was probably the first
person<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:04.369> put<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.699> on<00:01:04.820> any<00:01:05.180> kind<00:01:05.449> of

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.100 

so<00:01:19.550> whenever<00:01:19.850> you're<00:01:20.390> playing<00:01:20.510> runs<00:01:20.930> up

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
so whenever you're playing runs up

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.540 
so whenever you're playing runs up
snails<00:01:21.410> you<00:01:21.530> can<00:01:21.680> really<00:01:21.920> get<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.100> upstroke

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
snails you can really get that upstroke

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.920 
snails you can really get that upstroke
going<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:22.940> them<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.180> exaggerate<00:01:23.780> that

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
going and them to exaggerate that

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:32.140 
going and them to exaggerate that
upstroke

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.370 

and<00:01:32.570> then<00:01:32.720> want<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.290> get<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.780> know<00:01:35.810> started

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and then want to get you know started

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:49.180 
and then want to get you know started
collaborating<00:01:37.010> on

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:58.960 

ah

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.090 

this<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.120> this<00:02:00.510> is<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.660> straight<00:02:01.110> straight

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this is this is a straight straight

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.790 
this is this is a straight straight
example<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:02.820> an<00:02:02.910> old<00:02:03.030> Paul<00:02:03.300> Gilbert

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
example from an old Paul Gilbert

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.110 
example from an old Paul Gilbert
exercise<00:02:04.800> I<00:02:04.830> used<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.190> do<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.520> since<00:02:05.910> it's

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
exercise I used to do but since it's

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.730 
exercise I used to do but since it's
something<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.630> use<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.110> warm<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.560> guess

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
something that I use to warm up I guess

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.060 
something that I use to warm up I guess
I'm<00:02:07.890> using<00:02:08.100> mine<00:02:08.929> he<00:02:09.929> likes<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> take<00:02:10.500> down<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
I'm using mine he likes to take down and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.620 
I'm using mine he likes to take down and
I<00:02:11.190> only<00:02:11.370> vote<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.000> double<00:02:12.300> stop<00:02:12.510> in

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
I only vote it do that double stop in

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.330 
I only vote it do that double stop in
the<00:02:12.690> middle<00:02:12.930> which<00:02:13.050> really<00:02:13.290> makes<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.250> more

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the middle which really makes it more

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.040 
the middle which really makes it more
interesting<00:02:14.640> than<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.180> going<00:02:15.780> straight<00:02:15.870> up

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
interesting than just going straight up

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:30.290 
interesting than just going straight up
the<00:02:16.110> scale

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.810 

warming<00:02:31.300> up<00:02:31.390> solve<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:33.220> do<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.400> deal<00:02:33.640> one

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
warming up solve that we do a deal one

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:46.320 
warming up solve that we do a deal one
little<00:02:34.090> slow

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.730 

that's<00:02:47.330> all<00:02:47.540> right<00:02:47.630> now<00:02:47.990> they<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.350> gotta<00:02:48.560> put

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
that's all right now they just gotta put

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.920 
that's all right now they just gotta put
it<00:02:48.800> at<00:02:48.890> Mach<00:02:49.100> 10<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.580> really<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.690> sound

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
it at Mach 10 and really make it sound

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:59.920 
it at Mach 10 and really make it sound
like<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.170> butterfly<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:58.790> my<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.270> gotta<00:02:59.600> warn

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
like a butterfly to get my I gotta warn

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:14.430 
like a butterfly to get my I gotta warn
others<00:03:00.350> take<00:03:00.709> like<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.280> mixolydian<00:03:01.819> shape

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.380 

like<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:14.980> savers<00:03:15.400> because<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:15.790> uses<00:03:16.180> all

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
like that savers because it uses all

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.920 
like that savers because it uses all
your<00:03:16.570> fingers<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:17.050> know<00:03:17.080> it's<00:03:17.470> like<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.710> only

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
your fingers you know it's like the only

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.540 
your fingers you know it's like the only
easy<00:03:19.930> mode<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.320> can<00:03:20.680> think<00:03:20.830> of<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.130> uses<00:03:21.430> all

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
easy mode I can think of that uses all

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.550 
easy mode I can think of that uses all
your<00:03:21.700> fingers<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.240> doesn't<00:03:22.480> trip<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.500> up

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
your fingers and it doesn't trip you up

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.330 
your fingers and it doesn't trip you up
you<00:03:23.830> know<00:03:25.260> might<00:03:26.260> show<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.440> movies<00:03:26.920> lovers

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
you know might show that movies lovers

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:47.119 
you know might show that movies lovers
yeah<00:03:27.670> yeah

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:57.080 

going<00:03:48.129> down<00:03:48.280> sir

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.050 

you

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
you

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:09.220 
you
I<00:04:05.350> think<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.440> most<00:04:07.690> economical<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.870> easiest

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
I think the most economical the easiest

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.070 
I think the most economical the easiest
sweep<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.680> ever<00:04:09.830> do<00:04:10.100> I<00:04:10.430> guess<00:04:10.730> if<00:04:11.000> you're<00:04:11.600> a

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
sweep to ever do I guess if you're a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.870 
sweep to ever do I guess if you're a
beginner<00:04:12.920> are<00:04:13.130> you're<00:04:13.310> trying<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.760> learn

beginner are you're trying to learn

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:24.990 
beginner are you're trying to learn
sweeps<00:04:14.270> try<00:04:14.739> those

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.150 

down<00:04:26.000> with<00:04:26.210> sweet<00:04:26.479> yeah<00:04:26.720> yeah<00:04:26.930> just<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:27.320> other

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.100 

that's<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.310> easiest<00:04:31.669> shape<00:04:31.970> of<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.270> sweet

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.400 

to<00:04:38.860> get<00:04:38.980> used<00:04:39.160> for<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.970> know<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.410> now

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
to get used for that you know that now

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.840 
to get used for that you know that now
syncing<00:04:41.860> up<00:04:41.950> your<00:04:42.130> left<00:04:42.280> for<00:04:42.370> our<00:04:42.460> hands<00:04:42.670> but

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
syncing up your left for our hands but

00:04:42.850 --> 00:05:02.110 
syncing up your left for our hands but
then<00:04:43.030> if<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.300> are<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.920> guess<00:04:44.920> move<00:04:45.250> on<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.640> six

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.119 

and<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.479> always<00:05:03.629> helps<00:05:03.870> me<00:05:04.139> to<00:05:04.259> go<00:05:04.410> real<00:05:04.740> slow

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
and it always helps me to go real slow

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.089 
and it always helps me to go real slow
when<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.520> start<00:05:05.879> my<00:05:06.030> sweeps<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.599> then<00:05:06.949> like<00:05:07.949> I

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
when I start my sweeps and then like I

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.430 
when I start my sweeps and then like I
don't<00:05:08.759> really<00:05:09.030> use<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.750> lot<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:09.990> sweeps<00:05:10.259> of<00:05:10.349> my

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
don't really use a lot of sweeps of my

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.990 
don't really use a lot of sweeps of my
plane<00:05:10.710> because<00:05:11.069> I<00:05:11.190> get<00:05:11.430> when<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:11.729> get<00:05:11.789> on<00:05:11.970> stage

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
plane because I get when I get on stage
