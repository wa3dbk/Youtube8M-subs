00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.690
 of course 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
 here

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:31.309
 possible ways this is another 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.199
 the creation of the Chinese industry 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.559
 phone 70p 930 are made according to the standard 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.030
 ip68 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.659
 This means that it can withstand 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.510
 all sorts of falls falling dives on 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.550
 the depth of the characters that we do with it 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.409
 shake it out of the cryogenic stage 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.030
 frosts in which he came to us and 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:54.890
 let's see what happens to him after that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.890

 I see you as a maleka microphone 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.880
 In this case, go further because 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.000
 these phones hold dust and dirt 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.500
 we call them again and in 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.230
 anyway i can hear myself 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.960
 and he calls back the paths 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.060
 on the protective film but for the very 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.450
 monitor is not scary check how he 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 jumps 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.400
 no visible damage 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.890
 dust small scratches and heard again 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.500
 the thought that we had when 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.020
 The first time the phone fell into the hands of the nut 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.020
 it means we try to crack nuts 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.240

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.670
 The following situation is very dangerous for 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.030
