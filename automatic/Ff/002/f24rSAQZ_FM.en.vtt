00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
a pretty good review of it I said that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.529 
a pretty good review of it I said that
it<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.280> pretty<00:00:50.730> good<00:00:50.910> mic<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.270> read<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it was like a pretty good mic I read to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
it was like a pretty good mic I read to
recommend<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> people<00:00:52.280> but<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> more

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
recommend it to people but then the more

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.479 
recommend it to people but then the more
that<00:00:53.879> I've<00:00:54.000> used<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:56.039> more<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> I've

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that I've used it the more that I've

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.869 
that I've used it the more that I've
realized<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.879> good

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
realized that it's really not good

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.170 
realized that it's really not good
quality<00:01:00.059> at<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:02.609> only<00:01:02.760> thing<00:01:03.030> that's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
quality at all the only thing that's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
quality at all the only thing that's
like<00:01:03.629> decent<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> sound

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
like decent about it is the sound

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.250 
like decent about it is the sound
quality<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> pretty<00:01:06.510> good<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.780> still

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
quality which is pretty good and still

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410 
quality which is pretty good and still
but<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.189> again<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.430> most<00:01:08.729> sound<00:01:09.000> quality's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
but then again like most sound quality's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.100 
but then again like most sound quality's
the<00:01:09.630> same<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.159> mic<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:12.140> god-awful

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110

overall if you're them there for like
more<00:01:36.540> than<00:01:36.750> two<00:01:37.259> seconds<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
more than two seconds then you just it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
more than two seconds then you just it
just<00:01:39.259> gets<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.530> annoying<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.680> other

just gets really annoying the other

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
just gets really annoying the other
thing<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.380> its<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
thing I don't like about it is its I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.190 
thing I don't like about it is its I
mean<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.579> setups<00:01:47.909> easy<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.299> guess<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:49.079> pretty

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
mean the setups easy I guess it's pretty

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
mean the setups easy I guess it's pretty
easy<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.590> setup<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.159> mean<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.360> has

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
easy to setup I mean but if it has

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.760 
easy to setup I mean but if it has
terrible<00:01:51.869> quality<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.350> probably<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.740> even

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
terrible quality you probably don't even

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
terrible quality you probably don't even
want<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> anyways<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:55.200> can't

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
want to get it anyways but you can't

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
want to get it anyways but you can't
like<00:01:55.710> use<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.490> listen<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.820> music<00:01:57.000> or

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
like use it to like listen to music or

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
like use it to like listen to music or
anything<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.549> sucks<00:02:01.340> it's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
anything so that kind of sucks it's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
anything so that kind of sucks it's
pretty<00:02:02.640> much<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.119> got<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.469> like

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
pretty much I got it because it was like

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.960 
pretty much I got it because it was like
the<00:02:05.399> same<00:02:05.640> price<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.509> was<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.840> sale<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.910> think<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the same price it was on sale I think it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.630 
the same price it was on sale I think it
was<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.149> $30<00:02:09.720> off<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.250> was<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> same

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
was like $30 off but it was the same

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.680 
was like $30 off but it was the same
price<00:02:11.879> as<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.270> Triton's<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.050> got<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
price as my Triton's that I got so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.540

because I kind of wanted like the same
type<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.790> thing<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.210> wanted<00:02:16.390> like<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.600> surround

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
type of thing I wanted like the surround

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.040 
type of thing I wanted like the surround
sound<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.910> what's<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.030> called<00:02:19.210> like<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.720> mic

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
sound and what's it called like the mic

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.680 
sound and what's it called like the mic
and<00:02:20.320> everything<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.830> know<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:22.270> whole<00:02:22.450> big

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
and everything you know the whole big

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.260 
and everything you know the whole big
deal<00:02:22.930> because<00:02:23.580> statistically<00:02:24.580> it's<00:02:25.000> pretty

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
deal because statistically it's pretty

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.880 
deal because statistically it's pretty
much<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.570> same<00:02:25.720> exact<00:02:26.080> thing<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.410> Tritons

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
much the same exact thing as the Tritons

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.740 
much the same exact thing as the Tritons
except<00:02:27.190> different<00:02:27.520> brand<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.330> thought<00:02:28.540> well

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
except different brand so I thought well

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.270 
except different brand so I thought well
this<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.140> probably<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.590> cause<00:02:29.800> didn't<00:02:30.190> like

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
this is probably good cause didn't like

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.920 
this is probably good cause didn't like
the<00:02:30.370> Tritons<00:02:30.730> brand<00:02:31.060> but<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:33.300> not<00:02:34.300> not

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
the Tritons brand but it was not not

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.240
