00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
for this but I just kind of figured I

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.270 
for this but I just kind of figured I
would<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.740> so<00:00:10.790> you<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:12.049> key<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.290> g<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.070> g

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
would do it so you know key of g and g

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.000 
would do it so you know key of g and g
cards<00:00:16.820> so<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.690> i<00:00:18.779> showed<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.380> lot<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.710> east

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
cards so and i showed you a lot of east

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.300 
cards so and i showed you a lot of east
stuff<00:00:20.430> i<00:00:21.270> guess<00:00:22.050> some<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
stuff i guess some of the some of the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.279 
stuff i guess some of the some of the
things<00:00:23.340> i<00:00:24.199> might<00:00:25.199> know<00:00:25.740> how<00:00:25.859> showed<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
things i might know how showed you

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.640 
things i might know how showed you
because<00:00:28.289> usually<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.689> B<00:00:30.689> c-sharp

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
because usually it's like a B c-sharp

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.670 
because usually it's like a B c-sharp
minor'<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.489> then<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.260> well<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> showed<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
minor' and then a well I showed you that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.049 
minor' and then a well I showed you that
you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.950> play<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.399> here

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
you can play up here

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.100 
you can play up here
and<00:00:37.390> that's<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:39.239> seventh<00:00:40.239> fret<00:00:40.420> 9th<00:00:40.809> fret

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
and that's this seventh fret 9th fret

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.630 
and that's this seventh fret 9th fret
and<00:00:42.010> then<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.460> can<00:00:42.610> play<00:00:42.789> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and then you can play this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.569 
and then you can play this
that's<00:00:45.059> kind<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.390> variation<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> e<00:00:46.290> or<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that's kind of a variation of e or I

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.600 
that's kind of a variation of e or I
guess<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.199> play<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.680> B<00:00:50.010> over<00:00:50.579> D

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
guess you you can play that as B over D

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
guess you you can play that as B over D
sharp<00:00:51.059> sometimes<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.050> play<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.320> as

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
sharp sometimes and you can play this as

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.990 
sharp sometimes and you can play this as
a

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.180 

which<00:01:01.750> I<00:01:01.899> showed<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:02.289> and<00:01:02.530> then<00:01:02.829> sometimes

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
which I showed you and then sometimes

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.160 
which I showed you and then sometimes
people<00:01:03.250> play<00:01:04.119> it<00:01:04.239> like<00:01:04.390> this<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:04.839> get<00:01:05.019> the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
people play it like this so you get the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.340 
people play it like this so you get the
bass<00:01:05.430> no<00:01:06.430> on<00:01:06.670> five<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:08.190> then<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:10.210> can<00:01:10.360> play<00:01:10.540> be

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
bass no on five and then you can play be

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.810 
bass no on five and then you can play be
up<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.720> that's<00:01:13.840> B<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.560> saw<00:01:15.490> someone<00:01:15.759> playing

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
up to so that's B I saw someone playing

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.020 
up to so that's B I saw someone playing
guitar<00:01:16.420> yesterday<00:01:16.869> he<00:01:17.409> know<00:01:18.250> if<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:18.820> chord

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
guitar yesterday he know if the I chord

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.340 
guitar yesterday he know if the I chord
progression<00:01:19.450> was<00:01:19.600> EBA<00:01:20.200> he<00:01:20.950> played<00:01:21.130> this

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.800 

so<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.440> can<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.800> that<00:01:28.950> too

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
so you can do that too

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.190 
so you can do that too
yeah<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> show<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> see

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
yeah then I was going to show you see

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.120 
yeah then I was going to show you see
once<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.830> down<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.010> lot

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
once you get this see down it's a lot

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.540 
once you get this see down it's a lot
easier<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:39.680> usually<00:01:40.680> C<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.640> C<00:01:42.540> G<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
easier because usually C is C G and you

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.700 
easier because usually C is C G and you
can<00:01:44.700> play<00:01:44.850> G<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.479> sometimes<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
can play G like this sometimes it's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.370 
can play G like this sometimes it's
easier<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.190> then<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.910> can<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.050> G

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
easier because then you can also do a G

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.260 
easier because then you can also do a G
sauce

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.810 

which<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:53.020> first<00:01:53.590> fret<00:01:53.829> of<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.689> B<00:01:55.689> string<00:01:56.520> yeah

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.649 

so<00:02:00.820> usually<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.570> C<00:02:01.930> G<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:03.100> minor<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.210> an<00:02:04.420> F

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
so usually it's C G a minor and an F

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.900 
so usually it's C G a minor and an F
which<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:06.490> might<00:02:06.640> play<00:02:06.789> for<00:02:07.329> guard<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:08.910> you

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
which you might play for guard but you

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.170 
which you might play for guard but you
can<00:02:10.030> also<00:02:10.179> play<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.569> like<00:02:10.720> C<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.410> then<00:02:12.180> drop

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
can also play that like C and then drop

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.080 
can also play that like C and then drop
drop<00:02:13.569> these<00:02:13.780> two<00:02:14.019> fingers<00:02:14.319> one<00:02:14.950> string<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
drop these two fingers one string and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.860 
drop these two fingers one string and
then<00:02:16.300> hit<00:02:16.780> get<00:02:17.500> get<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.250> B<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.519> E<00:02:18.640> string<00:02:18.940> both

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
then hit get get the B and E string both

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.839 
then hit get get the B and E string both
on<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> first<00:02:20.349> fret<00:02:20.590> with<00:02:20.800> your<00:02:21.040> pointer

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
on the first fret with your pointer

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.880 
on the first fret with your pointer
finger<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.410> can<00:02:26.530> say<00:02:26.739> in

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
finger so if you just you can say in

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.440 
finger so if you just you can say in
this<00:02:27.100> kind<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.150> finger<00:02:29.130> fingering<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.549> cg<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
this kind of a finger fingering for cg a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:45.600 
this kind of a finger fingering for cg a
minor<00:02:31.660> half<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.709> i<00:02:32.769> see<00:02:34.410> using<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.560> pinky

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.259 

but<00:02:46.610> also<00:02:46.819> since<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.440> notes<00:02:48.709> G<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:50.239> can

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
but also since this is notes G you can

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.490 
but also since this is notes G you can
just<00:02:50.569> keep<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.870> down<00:02:51.049> pretty<00:02:51.290> much<00:02:51.409> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
just keep that down pretty much the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:04.460 
just keep that down pretty much the
whole<00:02:51.620> time

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.630 

and<00:03:04.920> that's<00:03:05.070> technically<00:03:05.430> an<00:03:05.580> f2<00:03:06.740> f2<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.370> then

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and that's technically an f2 f2 and then

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.570 
and that's technically an f2 f2 and then
this<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.510> technically<00:03:10.170> if<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.800> don't<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.280> you

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
this is technically if you don't if you
