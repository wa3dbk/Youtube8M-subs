00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 so 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:21.000
 rework 3 tons and a jack under 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:24.689
 hydraulic for origins too 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.869
 dynamic but it is not intended for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:33.450
 their Turks and this one already converted for 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:41.059
 straightening what to do here 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:46.020
 bunny that's what it will be about here on 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:52.739
 such depth is not included in the inner 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:59.190
 cylinder need to unscrew the nut you're not 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:07.280
 pieces unscrew this part here and remove 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.280
 ue we no longer need the bottom of the stock 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:17.090
 there is such a jumper in the middle that is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.869
 This part passes through here. 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.899
 not through 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.810
 and we need a through hole in 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.380
 mid stock 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:35.000
 it is necessary to cut the rod drill a hole 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:38.229
 bottom 10 so that the oil 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.569
 is the outer part here 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:50.090
 external part of the jack during injection 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:57.590
 got into the inner and went out here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:02.270
 here in this place after we 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.979
 Drill this hole insert so 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:17.120
 back tighten the nut and here in this 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:24.410
 part here contact with aiki 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:28.430
 rod you need to make a cool seam powerful 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:35.420
 so as not to pass the oil so that you can 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:39.769
 push by 2 centimeter now 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.769
 this is the case 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.549
 high pressure hose which can 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:51.829
 buy in stores having saved nicks and or 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.750
 at the farmer's market 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:03:00.230
 he needs to buy two of these 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:06.090
 the adapter need not of course have 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.609
 hydraulic cylinder waters one now 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.519
 adapter 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:19.470
 screw it in here instead of this part and 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:25.859
 twist the hose here and the other 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:29.040
 adapter weld aiming no matter 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:36.629
 what is welded there what is the adapter 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:42.720
 we weld ours there are of course cylinders 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:45.720
 but they have such hydraulic two 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.450
 Entry is forward and back two things 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.540
 will be one on one side the other with 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:58.730
 the other side is even better everything 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:04.109
 spoke there this adapter 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:12.449
 spun think end hose kidd graph 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:15.780
 ready given as powerful as budget 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:21.419
 option is a great thing 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:27.289
 checked for years it is not known that you 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.289
 buy in the store such sets I know 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.180
 for example his friends who bought 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.580
 set and 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:41.190
 and there are no spare parts for them 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:46.490
 the cheapest is 100 bucks can one 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.490
 This is Chinese to such an option 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:57.180
 such things four whales converted 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:01.229
 there is still well this is a factory such were us 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:10.490
 on the basis its main advantage is 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:10.490
 you need to swing you can swing your foot and 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:24.530
 free to install hydraulic cylinder 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:29.510
 right place and more pressure cuff 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:34.550
 rubber oil resistant rubber 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.550
 suited to him of this jack 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.900
 these are the works here all good luck
