00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.320
 So what could you say to the players 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.579

 customize the fighting style and adjust it 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.489
 as I said then just passed through the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.899
 solar system and what is left of it 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.280
 has remained 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.819

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.019

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.590

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.930
 There will be so many gamer that so many 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.000
 give game decisions that I just 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.680
 the story changed as I said you can 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.480
 adjust your character and so on 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.250
 As I said, there are so many public ones 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 So fight in any case 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.849
 pay a really big money that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.200
 I 'll pull something to the morass 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.069
 could choose between 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.170
 People 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.269
 open access and then should actually 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.650
 also an animal species came to audi on 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.599
 take care away again I know too 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.190
 not why the animal played skandia 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.720
 certainly already from sky on as well 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.760
 tiger's head and so on 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.560
 he can talk'll see no one 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.599
 the bank has written people about it 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.069
 these offices of uncomplicated more 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.829
 they did not say that 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.939
 People like I said after special 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.859
 then we come to the awunner 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:03.150
 this exotic mysterious as 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.159
 inspiration to the bank the vampires 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.400
 elf-ghosts and close zoom 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.799
 the lizards, on the other hand, are sinister and powerful 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.720
 Tireless war machines we think 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.629
 and red then this master chiefs of 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.099
 Halo and the terminator as the give it 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.690
 In any case, really crass system that 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.269
 you in the character class and speci too 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.180
 can choose anything and according to the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.190
 beer in the story crank it and ever 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.590
 after what she fulfills for mission 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.769
 the good and bad as I said so 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.909
 your gameplay also develops 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.500
 I would say come to the 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.569
 whole mode as we said you have in 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.579
 field it campaign mission from the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.510
 different planets in the solar system 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.650
 you have inserts and raytracing 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.389
 then study in the group 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.859
 We can play up to three players 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.690
 it does not have to catch up group like at 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.609
 Halo was so we had four games in 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.049
 get a group and then just 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.220
 penetrate through the cover of the mode 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.810
 can that was just too easy so 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.430
 by now definitely more difficult 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.510
 made 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.769
 it will definitely be public 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.569
 give events that is in any case 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.190
 properly gas after you levi you have 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.489
 all shit 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.409
 you can attend events in 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.180
 time intervals will be held 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.799
 In any case, really blatant then there 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.440
 it like the complete multiplayer mode 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.600
 pvp arena again one against one 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.730
 can do against each other 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.640
 to test your character how strong you are 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.740
 They end up representing the community 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.480
 areas where you repair 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.000
 can perform and guard 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.260
 you can now your next ones too 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.350
 adventure break up 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.490
 then there are still super powers so 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.550
 now bring opponents up and let those 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.090
 then usually somewhere 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.040
 points of experience and any 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.600
 objects after meal you can 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.160
 just after a blueprint superpower 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.630

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.470
 they also have super powers now 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.570

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.860
