black-and-white printing so I'm going to
start<00:00:43.260> by<00:00:43.350> opening<00:00:43.470> up<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> box<00:00:44.390> fittingly

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
start by opening up the box fittingly

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.610 
start by opening up the box fittingly
with<00:00:45.720> an<00:00:45.870> all-in-one<00:00:46.320> knife<00:00:51.230> as<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.410> see

with an all-in-one knife as you can see

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
with an all-in-one knife as you can see
there<00:00:53.040> was<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.340> damage<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.850> shipping<00:00:54.120> on
