into realms my buddy has a realm that he

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.709 
into realms my buddy has a realm that he
pays<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.619> he<00:00:31.800> let<00:00:32.009> me<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.660> I

haven't<00:00:33.930> been<00:00:33.989> able<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
haven't been able to get into it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.770 
haven't been able to get into it
couldn't<00:00:35.790> figure<00:00:35.940> out<00:00:36.090> why<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> couldn't

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
couldn't figure out why I couldn't

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200 
couldn't figure out why I couldn't
figure<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:37.050> why<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.370> realized<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.149> was

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
figure out why and I realized it was

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
figure out why and I realized it was
because<00:00:39.329> I'm<00:00:39.809> using<00:00:40.050> Optifine<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
because I'm using Optifine which is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.170 
because I'm using Optifine which is
technically<00:00:42.090> considered<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.960> mod<00:00:44.149> now<00:00:45.149> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
technically considered a mod now I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
technically considered a mod now I
figured<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.559> couldn't<00:00:46.620> get

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
figured this out because I couldn't get

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.029 
figured this out because I couldn't get
into<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:48.230> 1.7.10<00:00:49.230> Optifine<00:00:49.950> HD<00:00:50.399> a4<00:00:52.039> so

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
into it with my 1.7.10 Optifine HD a4 so

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.090 
into it with my 1.7.10 Optifine HD a4 so
for<00:00:53.250> shits<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.550> giggles<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.030> went<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> my

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
have a badass computer that has a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.690 
have a badass computer that has a
ridiculous<00:01:07.590> CPU<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:09.750> ton<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> RAM<00:01:10.350> or

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
ridiculous CPU or a ton of RAM or

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.249 
ridiculous CPU or a ton of RAM or
some<00:01:11.700> badass<00:01:12.000> GPU<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.310> run<00:01:14.310> bare<00:01:14.610> minimum

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
some badass GPU I run bare minimum

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.350 
some badass GPU I run bare minimum
unfortunately<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> rely<00:01:18.330> on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
unfortunately for now so I rely on

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.080 
unfortunately for now so I rely on
things<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.869> Optifine<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.520> help<00:01:20.729> stabilize

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
things like Optifine to help stabilize

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.149 
things like Optifine to help stabilize
my<00:01:21.570> frames<00:01:21.840> per<00:01:22.080> second<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.650> allow<00:01:22.920> me<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
my frames per second and allow me to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.039 
my frames per second and allow me to
play<00:01:23.340> without<00:01:23.549> being<00:01:23.759> laggy<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.479> jumpy<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
play without being laggy and jumpy and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.399 
play without being laggy and jumpy and
 so<00:01:26.689> naturally<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.869> pretty<00:01:28.170> pissed

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
 so naturally I was pretty pissed
