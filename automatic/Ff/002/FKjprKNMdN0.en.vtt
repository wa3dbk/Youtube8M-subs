00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 the killer flees on a horse i 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.089
 cops chase him on his motorbike and he is 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 like a battle between engines and horses 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.129
 technology and fight against horses 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.379

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.850
 this book of his that you would like to make one 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.350
 movie 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.870
 I want to know what it feels like to have 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.940
 a passion for something 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.370
 red areas a man other decidedly 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.080
 attractive 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.730
 this book has no storyline 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.260
 a story and you invent ok starting 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.530
 from the red we do not start from the beginning of 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.400
 times 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:23.530
 ok let's start with the red white man 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.760
 fat ugly field admitted myself 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.000
 in the script 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.800
 weird idea we thought that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.520
 maybe it could be in the rock 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.780
 to fall in love 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.130
 I don't want to ruin it by making one 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.980
 Hollywood product I don't want in itself 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.140
 I talk about sex or arms or in segments 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.430
 of cars or characters that exceed 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.640
 all the obstacles in the end have it 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.640
 made and weeps what to hide 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.100
 I say you have to talk to us 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.170
 you must know that woman 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.180
 people try the agent the agent loses it 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.430
 every day someone somewhere 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.060
 decides science to destroy 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.060
 somebody else 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.610
 inter treatment but I believe it from 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.610
