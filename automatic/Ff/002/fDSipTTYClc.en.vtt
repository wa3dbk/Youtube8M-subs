00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.500
 angelines I left through this beautiful 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.360
 headband and it's super easy and fast 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.060
 do since all of us where they use 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.100
 the accessories as well as teaching being a 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.500
 accessory because it stings fabric and also 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.600
 certain dilemma is different from the others 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.470
 It has two colors and above all it is very 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.200
 easy to do 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.570
 look how it's done 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.600
 first we will make our mobiles this 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.670
 will be three rectangles of 2.5 x 40 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.190
 centimeters and here we have our three 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.410
 molds now we are going to double the to the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.960
 half 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 let's cut to give the shape of the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 curvature of the tip of the headband 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 so it does not have to stay now we're going to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 leave one aside and we will work 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.330
 with two hours or fold their molds in two 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.400
 parts to the height that you want and you go 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.600
 to cut into curves this way by 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.600
 of bend you just made 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.460
 so it has to be double through and 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.909
 now it cuts on the other side but much more 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.909
 thin 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.180
 since you finished cutting the 'paras' 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.430
 and you turn it two together of this 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.150
 way and that's how you have to stay 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.580
 your mold 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.100
 now we are going to need foamy and bing and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.560
 You can get this in a store 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.530
 of fabrics hanging from the carpentry that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.170
 it's like skin but synthetic and with 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.330
 cold silicone we are going to stick the vinyl to 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.430
 our family that we have attached to 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.800
 our vinyl to our foami we are going to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.260
 put our molds and we will highlight 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.140
 that you can highlight it with a pen 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.940
 black or with what the pen looks here 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.340
 black better you do not get to distinguish the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 camera but exhibits or the way since 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.130
 we finish plotting now let's 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.500
 cut around the contour 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.310
 and so we have our lives now 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.890
 with cloth or masks that you no longer use 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.530
 to line these strips with cold silicone 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.720
 we are going to stick our web it's time to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.880
 that the fabric is very tight since 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.979
 you finished pasting now we're going to 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.630
 cut has to be flush with your 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.880
 yellow hair and that's how it is when 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.040
 We cut before you finish cutting 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.989
 whole cloth fabric left some in 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.160
 tips so that we can bend towards 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.160
 in and we paste 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.760
 and that's how our tips are, let's go 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 do the same with the other piece just 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.590
 It will be different color of fabric 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.260
 and since we finished covering our 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.870
 pieces now we are going to cross them from this 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.739
 way to paste them and we will paste 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.739
 with cold silicone 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.040
 and so you have to stay to use a 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.900
 thin headband and you're going to line it up with 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.240
 that you just did the same is going to hit 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.160
 with cold silicone and so it has to be 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.920
 your diadema grace at the beginning we leave 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.960
 a mold now let's use a piece 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.150
 of black cloth and we are going to mark the mold 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.220
 you can mark it with hit that the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.170
 marks that you cut it now you're going to 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.420
 get your headband and you're going to hit it 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.460
 inside is so you do not see our 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.440
 headband so you're going to do it if you have to 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.690
 stay and you've finished doing your 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.790
 headband I hope you liked the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.860
 idea of this and besides I loved the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.690
 ideal truth and you want for the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.910
 next week I will teach you to be our 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.110
 type of accessory or if not demanding here 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.850
 down in the comments that other 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.620
 got the site of the disaster and not 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.970
 forget about you on the talk page 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.760
 by the index pointed to all pairs 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.030
 asthma instructors direction and what 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.030
 we decorate you can add chocolate and 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.240
 when you're ready to give it to your 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.240
