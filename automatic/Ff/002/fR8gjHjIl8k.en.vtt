00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.040
 the old man is known as nintendo 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.260
 enter system is one of the consoles 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.210
 most important in history since 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.980
 thanks to its launch the industry of 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.470
 the consoles came back to breathe after 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.450
 of the decay that atari suffered if 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.250
 well when we talk about nes we come to 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.650
 the big mind productions like super 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.020
 mario desserts ninja gaiden the legend of 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.670
 zelda task in front of him among many 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.620
 other games 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.170
 the console also had a very 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.300
 well I was not so known to 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.560
 then I will share 5 titles 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.199
 that even though they were not so 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.600
 known its quality is quite but 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.190
 quite high but good do not lose more 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.190
 time and let's what we creak 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.480
 lunar pool this game sure what 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.550
 you knew like the one a tree since it was a 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.800
 game that came in 64-in-1 games 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.740
 they have one those pirate cartridges that 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.810
 we all had although it may seem like a 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.640
 typical pool simulator tests 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.140
 that presents you in each level makes 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.150
 real-life billiards look like a 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.040
 children's game since the tables and 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.630
 tests are not at all orthodox 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.160
 besides that they require having a 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.130
 privileged pressure worthy of a 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.660
 true mathematical that title was 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.479
 made by the discrete company 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.220
 monica nerd inc without a doubt a whole 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.220
 rough diamond for our old nes 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.079
 ar are many years before 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.819
 there was call of duty activision not 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.100
 I used to recycle games and in fact 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.350
 I tried at all costs to provide games 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.079
 completely original on this occasion 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.280
 activision presents us with a game 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.469
 where the goal is to win a battle 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.450
 between two armies presented in a 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.159
 board every two characters of 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
 distinct army matches in a part 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.539
 of the board starts a battle where 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.360
 they have to give each other 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.580
 somebody comes out winner yet strength 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.530
 it's not everything and here if you use your 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.480
 tactics you will be able to defeat the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.220
 opposing army if you position your 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.260
 warriors in certain places marked in 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.690
 the board play this game of two 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.349
 people provide hundreds of hours of 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.349
 good entertainment 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.730
 otelo 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.189
 although klein will always be remembered by 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.230
 bring the bad games for the month of 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.230
 Suddenly they brought us pretty gems 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.760
 otelo is one of them and not 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.040
 precisely because they have made a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.480
 good title but because only 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.090
 They commissioned the distribution of this 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.670
 game while here laboratories was 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.219
 who developed it in fact the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.989
 satoru iwata himself produced this 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.689
 title for the surprise of own and 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.719
 strangers is surely why the 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.980
 game is pretty but pretty good 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.019
 this game was the electronic version 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.939
 of the board game of the same name and 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.370
 although the dynamics are the same as the game 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.870
 of board the synthesis to avoid 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.060
 that you change the chips will make the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.590
 games are more voice you love to cast 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.290
 larreta with someone in this title is 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.209
 something highly recommended as it demands 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.849
 that you think a lot and execute 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.819
 quickly and in fact it is becoming 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.590
 a healthy vice as you play it 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.090
 as it says its hotel slogan is a game 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.340
 that you learn in a minute but that 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.959
 It takes a lifetime to master while 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.569
 you do not have many versions in the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.940
 tions and ports on other consoles this 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.810
 clan version for me is the best that 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.760
 it has been done 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.290
 of this game of boards a game 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.290
 truly epic 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.540
 and more dance and more faith is a game of 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.880
 ships made by air which in turn is a 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.040
 port of an ark of the same name 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.990
 game had pretty mechanics 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.570
 innovative ways to manage your 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.710
 ship at four different speeds 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.720
 achieve jumping missions and the 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.970
 computer considered that you had a 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.120
 good level of play and have a section 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.950
 pretty good musical graphic 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.560
 this game can easily rival 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.390
 with games like gradius and solar force 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.600
 for being the best ship game in the 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.600
 month 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.699
 yes 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.220
 if you connect who you want to paint 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.840
 the bored in that title 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.849
 you drive a red car that has 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.620
 mission to paint all the streets of the 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.849
 most important cities in the world as 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.940
 new york london paris and mexico a no 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.830
 it's there is also painted 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.030
 to paint the streets you will have to 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.530
 dodge the patrols that you 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.990
 They will chase you for your terrible acts 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.880
 criminals also you have to take care 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.610
 of the peaks that come out of nowhere and 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.980
 shatter your car and especially 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.850
 take care of the terrible and beautiful 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.620
 Cardboard data cats that will make you 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.630
 run over them you suffer a terrible attack 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.260
 of conscience and you surrender to the 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.260
 authorities 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.259
 well as these games there were many 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.969
