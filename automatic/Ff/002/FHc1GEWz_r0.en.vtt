you about the exciting features we have

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.099 
you about the exciting features we have
an<00:00:19.920> extension<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.970> i<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.720> games

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
an extension one so i think what games

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.480 
an extension one so i think what games
artists<00:00:22.439> are<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.830> really<00:00:23.039> excited

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
artists are going to be really excited

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.120 
artists are going to be really excited
about<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> extension<00:00:24.630> 1<00:00:24.750> release<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
about in the extension 1 release is the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.089 
about in the extension 1 release is the
capabilities<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:28.619> game

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
capabilities we have with the game

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.400 
capabilities we have with the game
export<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.849> being<00:00:30.449> able<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> bring<00:00:30.869> models

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
export and being able to bring models

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
export and being able to bring models
quickly<00:00:31.769> from<00:00:32.250> max<00:00:32.489> into<00:00:33.000> their<00:00:33.120> game

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
quickly from max into their game

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
quickly from max into their game
environment<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.530> they're<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:34.770> going

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
environment I think they're really going

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.709 
environment I think they're really going
to<00:00:35.070> enjoy<00:00:35.160> some<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> capabilities<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.239> built

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
to enjoy some the capabilities we built

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
to enjoy some the capabilities we built
with<00:00:37.020> max<00:00:37.469> creation<00:00:37.980> graph<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.550> animation

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
with max creation graph to do animation

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.340 
with max creation graph to do animation
and<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:39.809> they're<00:00:39.899> really<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and I think they're really going to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.959 
and I think they're really going to
appreciate<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.739> quick<00:00:41.070> skinning<00:00:41.460> methods<00:00:41.820> we

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
appreciate the quick skinning methods we

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
appreciate the quick skinning methods we
now<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.239> available<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.960> voxels<00:00:43.710> gang<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
now have available with voxels gang and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.520 
now have available with voxels gang and
had<00:00:44.309> heat<00:00:44.550> map<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.390> getting<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.079> geodesic

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
had heat map is getting so geodesic

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
had heat map is getting so geodesic
voxel<00:00:46.950> skinning<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> volumetric<00:00:48.030> technique

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
voxel skinning is a volumetric technique

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.270 
voxel skinning is a volumetric technique
for<00:00:48.899> generating<00:00:49.289> skin<00:00:49.590> weights<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
for generating skin weights what that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
for generating skin weights what that
means<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.670> practice<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.660> lot<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.899> real

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
means in practice is in a lot of real

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.170 
means in practice is in a lot of real
world<00:00:52.410> meshes<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.309> many<00:00:53.610> parts<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
world meshes you have many parts that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
world meshes you have many parts that
may<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.390> intersecting<00:00:55.199> there<00:00:55.469> may<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.620> holes

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
may be intersecting there may be holes

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580 
may be intersecting there may be holes
in<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.640> may<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.199> non-medical<00:00:58.199> edges

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
in them there may be non-medical edges

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
in them there may be non-medical edges
we<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.100> than<00:00:59.250> two<00:00:59.370> polygons<00:00:59.850> getting

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
we have more than two polygons getting

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
we have more than two polygons getting
the<00:01:00.510> same<00:01:00.719> edge<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> complexity

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the same edge a lot of the complexity

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.830 
the same edge a lot of the complexity
that<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> modeling<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.570> try<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that you get in modeling to try to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.859 
that you get in modeling to try to
conserve<00:01:04.260> polycount<00:01:05.119> can<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.420> mess<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.750> an

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
conserve polycount can really mess up an

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
conserve polycount can really mess up an
initial<00:01:07.229> skin<00:01:07.470> waiting<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.130> what's<00:01:08.340> great

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
initial skin waiting so what's great

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
initial skin waiting so what's great
about<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.060> voxel<00:01:09.659> skinning<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.500> it's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
about the voxel skinning is that it's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
about the voxel skinning is that it's
robust<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> those<00:01:12.210> sorts<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.510> things<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.900> can

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
robust to those sorts of things you can

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.289 
robust to those sorts of things you can
deal<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.290> many<00:01:13.860> meshes<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.240> are

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
deal with many meshes that are that are

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
deal with many meshes that are that are
built<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.380> character<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.070> can

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
built into your character and you can

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039 
built into your character and you can
get<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> good<00:01:17.610> skin<00:01:17.970> waiting<00:01:18.270> across<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
get a good skin waiting across all of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
get a good skin waiting across all of
that<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.799> heat<00:01:20.040> map<00:01:20.220> skinning<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that the heat map skinning is a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
that the heat map skinning is a
technique<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.259> sort<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.770> shining<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
technique that's sort of like shining a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
technique that's sort of like shining a
light<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> bones<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.259> skeleton

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
light from the bones of your skeleton

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
light from the bones of your skeleton
onto<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> surface<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.750> great<00:01:28.080> example<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
onto the surface and a great example of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.859 
onto the surface and a great example of
that<00:01:28.710> comes<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.430> hand<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.390> often

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that comes from the hand you know often

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
that comes from the hand you know often
if<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.409> initial<00:01:31.680> waiting<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.310> end

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
if you do an initial waiting you can end

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
if you do an initial waiting you can end
up<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> fingers<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.570> skin<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.079> each

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
up with the fingers all skin to each

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
up with the fingers all skin to each
other<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.710> stretch<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> web<00:01:35.549> when

other and they stretch and web when

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.609 
other and they stretch and web when
you're<00:01:35.970> trying<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> pull<00:01:36.360> them<00:01:36.420> apart<00:01:36.619> heatmap

you're trying to pull them apart heatmap
skinning<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.250> great<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.520> dealing

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
skinning is really great for dealing

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.100 
skinning is really great for dealing
with<00:01:39.000> cases<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.570> where<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
with cases like that where you have a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
with cases like that where you have a
lot<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.350> bones<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.189> area<00:01:41.579> where<00:01:41.850> geometry

lot of bones in this area where geometry
is<00:01:42.479> very<00:01:42.659> close<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> each<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.290> because<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is very close to each other because the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
is very close to each other because the
light<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> speak<00:01:45.780> doesn't<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.439> from<00:01:46.680> one

finger to the next or one limb to the
next<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.290> stays<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:49.799> clean<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.310> robust

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
next it stays very clean and robust

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.719 
next it stays very clean and robust
between<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.200> geodesic<00:01:52.799> voxel<00:01:53.189> skinning<00:01:53.549> and

the<00:01:54.119> heat<00:01:54.299> maps<00:01:54.509> getting<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.930> added<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.439> think

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the heat maps getting we added I think

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.359 
the heat maps getting we added I think
we<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> couple<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.820> nice<00:01:57.920> tools<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
we put a couple of really nice tools in

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.889 
we put a couple of really nice tools in
place<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.820> people<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.270> their<00:02:00.570> their

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
place for people to get their their

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.630 
place for people to get their their
first<00:02:01.110> skin<00:02:01.439> waiting<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> character<00:02:02.369> as

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
first skin waiting for a character as

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.370 
first skin waiting for a character as
well<00:02:03.030> major<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.200> those<00:02:04.350> capabilities

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
well major that those capabilities

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.440 
well major that those capabilities
were<00:02:05.469> interactive<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.820> artist<00:02:07.299> could

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
were interactive so the artist could

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.330 
were interactive so the artist could
adjust<00:02:07.840> some<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.289> parameters<00:02:08.440> as<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
adjust some of the parameters as the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.589 
adjust some of the parameters as the
skinning<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.729> being<00:02:09.970> done<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.390> they<00:02:10.450> can

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
skinning is being done so they can

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.479 
skinning is being done so they can
really<00:02:10.750> fine-tune<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:11.950> they<00:02:12.069> don't<00:02:12.250> have

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
really fine-tune it so they don't have

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.130 
really fine-tune it so they don't have
to<00:02:12.550> do<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> whole<00:02:12.940> lot<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.120> custom<00:02:13.540> waiting<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
to do a whole lot of custom waiting to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.259 
to do a whole lot of custom waiting to
get<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.349> good<00:02:14.650> looking<00:02:14.920> result<00:02:15.280> what's<00:02:16.000> really

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
get a good looking result what's really

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.000 
get a good looking result what's really
exciting<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.080> extension<00:02:17.560> one<00:02:17.709> release

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
exciting about the extension one release

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.190 
exciting about the extension one release
for<00:02:18.250> max<00:02:18.400> creation<00:02:18.880> graph<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:20.019> we've

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
for max creation graph is that we've

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.080 
for max creation graph is that we've
taken<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.650> tool<00:02:20.950> set<00:02:21.160> those<00:02:21.430> available<00:02:21.700> for

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
taken the tool set those available for

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.150 
taken the tool set those available for
building<00:02:22.450> geometry<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.319> modifiers<00:02:23.920> and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
building geometry and modifiers and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.890 
building geometry and modifiers and
brought<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.849> controllers<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.630> what<00:02:25.720> that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
brought it to controllers and what that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.870 
brought it to controllers and what that
really<00:02:25.930> means<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.590> max<00:02:26.950> creation<00:02:27.430> graph<00:02:27.640> can

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
really means is max creation graph can

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.820 
really means is max creation graph can
not<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.209> animation<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:29.019> just<00:02:29.319> procedural

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
not do animation not just procedural

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.440 
not do animation not just procedural
modeling<00:02:30.280> I'm<00:02:30.550> very<00:02:30.610> excited<00:02:30.910> about<00:02:31.300> that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
modeling I'm very excited about that

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.180 
modeling I'm very excited about that
capability<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:32.050> think<00:02:32.349> I<00:02:32.500> can't<00:02:32.800> wait<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.069> see

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
capability I think I can't wait to see

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.620 
capability I think I can't wait to see
what<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> users<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.880> with<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.180> because<00:02:34.420> I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
what the users do with it because I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.820 
what the users do with it because I
think<00:02:34.810> we've<00:02:35.110> opened<00:02:35.440> up<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.620> whole<00:02:35.800> new

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
think we've opened up a whole new

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.160 
think we've opened up a whole new
frontier<00:02:36.250> for<00:02:36.550> what<00:02:36.970> max<00:02:37.269> creation<00:02:37.720> graph<00:02:37.930> can

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
frontier for what max creation graph can

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.500 
frontier for what max creation graph can
do<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.519> extension<00:02:39.880> one<00:02:40.090> release<00:02:40.360> we

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
do for the extension one release we

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.390 
do for the extension one release we
wanted<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.810> revisit<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.470> look<00:02:41.799> at<00:02:41.950> controller

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
wanted to revisit the look at controller

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.670 
wanted to revisit the look at controller
for<00:02:42.819> aiming<00:02:43.239> at<00:02:43.450> objects<00:02:43.959> or<00:02:44.140> cameras<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.590> the

by building those things in MCG we

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.630 
by building those things in MCG we
provided<00:02:56.110> new<00:02:56.230> capabilities<00:02:56.890> inside<00:02:57.099> of<00:02:57.400> Max

provided new capabilities inside of Max

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.759 
provided new capabilities inside of Max
but<00:02:57.940> we<00:02:58.090> also<00:02:58.269> give<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.989> graphs<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.620> can

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
but we also give you the graphs you can

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.620 
but we also give you the graphs you can
see<00:02:59.980> how<00:03:00.250> we<00:03:00.310> built<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.819> functionality<00:03:01.269> you

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
see how we built that functionality you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.240 
see how we built that functionality you
can<00:03:01.660> modify<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.380> functionality<00:03:02.829> and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
can modify that functionality and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.009 
can modify that functionality and
produce<00:03:03.610> your<00:03:03.790> own<00:03:03.849> custom<00:03:04.390> versions<00:03:04.870> of

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
produce your own custom versions of

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.170 
produce your own custom versions of
those<00:03:05.200> tools<00:03:05.560> for<00:03:06.220> your<00:03:06.340> Senor<00:03:06.640> environment

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
those tools for your Senor environment

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.940 
those tools for your Senor environment
but<00:03:07.569> in<00:03:07.720> addition<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.380> can<00:03:08.530> go<00:03:08.769> ahead<00:03:08.829> and

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
but in addition you can go ahead and

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.800 
but in addition you can go ahead and
create<00:03:09.190> your<00:03:09.370> own<00:03:09.430> graphs<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.390> can<00:03:10.540> package

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
create your own graphs you can package

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.210 
create your own graphs you can package
them<00:03:11.140> in<00:03:11.230> max<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.739> send<00:03:11.950> them<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.069> another

them in max and send them to another
user<00:03:12.579> they<00:03:12.819> can<00:03:12.970> pick<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.209> up<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.450> use<00:03:13.569> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
user they can pick it up and use the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.289

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
really wanted the work that you do in

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.140 
really wanted the work that you do in
stingray<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.889> look<00:04:12.040> as<00:04:12.160> close<00:04:12.370> as<00:04:12.579> possible<00:04:12.639> to

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
stingray to look as close as possible to

you in 3ds max and a big part of that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.590 
you in 3ds max and a big part of that
