00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
know could been changed I think my

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.720 
know could been changed I think my
opinion<00:02:48.570> but<00:02:49.410> uh<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> strap<00:02:50.520> should

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
opinion but uh I think the strap should

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.830 
opinion but uh I think the strap should
have<00:02:50.820> been<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.000> tiny<00:02:51.300> tiny<00:02:51.630> bit<00:02:51.870> smaller<00:02:53.450> but<00:02:54.450> I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
have been a tiny tiny bit smaller but I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.330 
have been a tiny tiny bit smaller but I
I<00:02:55.110> would<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.560> see<00:02:55.770> these<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.130> hand

I would like to see these in hand
personally<00:02:57.410> yeah<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.980> don't<00:02:59.100> really

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
personally yeah I don't really

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.300 
personally yeah I don't really
particularly<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.440> collar<00:03:01.680> way<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
particularly like this collar way the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.460 
particularly like this collar way the
gray<00:03:02.910> uppers<00:03:03.300> grace<00:03:03.690> wait<00:03:03.990> I'll<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:04.380> like

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
gray uppers grace wait I'll really like

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.620 
gray uppers grace wait I'll really like
it<00:03:04.620> too<00:03:04.860> much<00:03:04.890> maybe<00:03:05.550> if<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.730> do<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> beige<00:03:06.300> or

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
it too much maybe if you do a beige or

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.060 
it too much maybe if you do a beige or
tan<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.800> would<00:03:07.920> look<00:03:07.950> really

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.540 
tan I think that would look really
really<00:03:08.910> really<00:03:09.300> nice<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.520> know

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
really really nice and I think you know

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
I think people will be much more

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.970 
I think people will be much more
attracted<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.950> these<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.459> yeah<00:03:15.120> um<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.800> the

for adidas to be doing and that's just
me<00:04:04.980> personally<00:04:05.420> but<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.810> think<00:04:07.320> it's<00:04:07.470> smart<00:04:07.890> by

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
me personally but I think it's smart by

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.150 
me personally but I think it's smart by
adidas<00:04:08.430> but<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.120> know<00:04:09.239> there<00:04:09.540> were<00:04:09.750> some

I think it might you know it's gonna it
crashed<00:04:24.550> obviously<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.300> then<00:04:25.330> after<00:04:25.900> they

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
crashed obviously and then after they

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.370 
crashed obviously and then after they
tried<00:04:26.680> putting<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.580> like<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.750> reserve<00:04:29.080> them

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
tried putting it in like to reserve them

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.280 
tried putting it in like to reserve them
a<00:04:29.650> blank<00:04:30.310> white<00:04:30.610> screen<00:04:30.670> came<00:04:31.210> up<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.930> the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
a blank white screen came up so and the

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.410 
a blank white screen came up so and the
app<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.620> very<00:04:32.680> very<00:04:33.100> very<00:04:33.490> basic<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.270> think

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
app is very very very basic so I think

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.330 
app is very very very basic so I think
they<00:04:34.720> need<00:04:34.930> someone<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.710> really<00:04:35.860> work<00:04:36.100> on<00:04:36.220> the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
they need someone to really work on the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.040 
they need someone to really work on the
app<00:04:36.460> personally<00:04:36.970> but<00:04:37.180> this<00:04:37.420> is<00:04:37.540> not<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.690> video

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
app personally but this is not the video

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.960 
app personally but this is not the video
about<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.590> adidas<00:04:38.920> confirmed<00:04:39.280> appt<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.850> is

about the adidas confirmed appt it is

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.890

about<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.810> easy<00:04:41.170> 750<00:04:42.040> boosts<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:43.540> yeah<00:04:43.720> that's

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
about the easy 750 boosts so yeah that's

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.830 
about the easy 750 boosts so yeah that's
just<00:04:44.020> my<00:04:44.260> opinion<00:04:44.290> personally<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.640> will<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.540> try

just my opinion personally I will I try
to<00:04:46.900> get<00:04:47.140> these<00:04:47.380> um<00:04:47.920> if<00:04:48.880> another<00:04:49.090> colorway

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450
