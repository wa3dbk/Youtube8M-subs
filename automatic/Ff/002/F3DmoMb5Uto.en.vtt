00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.910

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.820
 others do not 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.000
 it's time to get to work 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.690
 doctor if I understood you correctly 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
 worked on for the spartan I 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.239
 well afraid that it is still top 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.040
 secret but the first smartphones have 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.720
 been enlisted children by force 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.140
 I did what was necessary 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.980
 why children 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.570
 in your opinion it gives them and maybe 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.350
 a benefit to start so young do not 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 to know anything else several 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.229
 reasons motivated the choices we made 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 have done as well psychological as 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 psychological physics 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.120
 so you think we are incapable 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.170
 to be spartan 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.350
 some may be more capable 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 that others 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.330

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.650

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.680

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.280
 joel m hamar bingo 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:13.280

 why are you interested in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.630
 my research I joined the spartan 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.980
 because I was in the army since a 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.850
 year when my family and friends were 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.200
 killed at newman x the spartan had a 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:37.970
 something else I might have been able to 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.870
 save and that helps you it soothes your 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.100

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.020
 gods to donate it to humanity I 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.420
 just ask me what forms 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.060
 Promethean life might have to 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.010
 we offer these are boring robots 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.160
 solid light and armor 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.400
 brutal and cruel 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.080
 what could we offer? 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.510
 that doctor trouble these are 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:21.940
 interesting killing machines doctoral 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.940
 know if it's a stop I work but 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.360
 for love how many times do I have to 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.360
 to say I do not speak bloody 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.300
 I need better equipment more 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.800
 of material there, it's as if you 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.410
 give me two flint stones for 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:51.000
 fire do not agree 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:54.970
 no need for translation you say 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.450
 that there is a very lively form to 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.450
 interior 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.799
