00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.969
 yes so people now welcome to this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:16.830
 video but how bewitched this morning only 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.160
 is it transferred so over here? 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.010
 really nice on the paint quickly 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.830
 cleaned and then he is in the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.289
 overflow and if it is in overflow then so 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.820
 I had never comes before 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.530
 you out of the tube and then 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.070
 really really bitter what happened now 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.780
 finally the lord shoe already in need 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:49.520
 I just activate the navi 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:56.010
 do not rate google maps 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:58.699
 good at my destination for the fairground in 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.699
 Karlsruhe 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 Of course I have navi but of course 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
 then yesterday I was so clever and so 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.560
 Wanted a ticket last night 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.570
 make update and then the card was gone 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.880
 that means I could not this morning 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.140
 take along yes, then try all that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.220
 again to draw the cards 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.220
 after it did not go last night 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.520
 yes but this morning it works too 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.710
 did not work , it takes forever 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.750
 could not wait for that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.730
 He had extremely good only problem 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.550
 I 've got that I'm not here yet 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.910
 outlet on the motorcycle have my power supply 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.430
 that means when I'm down there then 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.610
 I might be somewhere in the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.830
 mcdonalds or something but charge more 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.470
 also look at the numbers and mainz 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.080
 Luckily it is not that far if that 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.270
 whole with the phone so then works 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.790
 just google maps and there it is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.860
 then integrates a new feature in it 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.190
 Of course I do not know how tomtom 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.380
 wants to keep on water over time 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.850
 Let's see if we have your cellphone now 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.240
 times back anyway everyone 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.400
 and then recharge or you have 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.440
 motorcycle navi for few hundred euros 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.560
 In addition, that relativizes everything 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.180
 I do not call it dying and then 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.570
 though sooner or not much less 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.570
 long 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.750
 today we are also for once 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.970
 very early is now halfway 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.600
 ten and we are already on the direct 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.420
 away to Karlsruhe 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.480
 a meeting in jogging pants 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.730
 he is very sure of my role 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.170
 just as fast as the upper hand, well 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.860
 Here are 85 or so on the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.860
 eat life 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.250
 at the same skills 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.019
 today loses on the highway and 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.019
 would just say 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.710
 arrived below 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.710
 again 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.549
 sometimes 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.549
 No 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 shows me so no traffic jam sections 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.860
 here in red you can see that this is 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.860
 namely, just where we are 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.170
 police just greeted because 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.620
 the nation a bit unfair if you can 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.820
 which leaves it that are quite 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.640
 some with yes just do that because 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.930
 I like motorcycling on the go 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.820
 my uncle, for example, used to do that too 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.810
 made but I did it just the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.810
 illustration authored 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.260
 what I decide 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.600
 Now I'm just horny 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.300

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:17.180

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:23.800
 i never do that tomorrow i have to give them 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:27.280
