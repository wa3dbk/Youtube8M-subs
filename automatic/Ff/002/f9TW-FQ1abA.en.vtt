 the blades in the car this weird 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.980
 world by the way I spoke to you a long time ago 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.260
 in the video what artistic name 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.750
 choose to impose and I told you that I 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.870
 I had a friend named Antonio who 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.060
 I asked him what he liked 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.870
 who told me after a few days at the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:34.950
 moon and we composed and 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:37.070
 and this one is talking about the radio 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.140
 we go 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.490
 playing a video you're your eyes mandatan 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.040
 times if you make a video that is a bit 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 seen but I do not know how this channel has 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.820
 arisen does well little you have 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.460
 sent a bunch of videos that although 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.159
 they are very typical or many people have seen and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.140
 you know but you ask me so many times 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.030
 opinion of many of them that good 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.850
 We are going to play and we'll play 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.820
 all the videos of the story and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.800
 then we will start only to 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.509
 analyze it to investigate videos a 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.790
 abuse but good as year so much serves 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.800
 keep asking then let's see this 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.650
 video that also went around the world 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.420
 It's with people putting this guy to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.300
 give birth by not saying the disc-jockey anymore 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.150
 liar of the world the deepest disc jockey 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.730
 false this is a shame the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.280
 disc-jockeys do this and this is this 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.350
 video that we have here is worth many people 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.970
 I said look look look good if you look 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.290
 well please in this video if it is that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.590
 Nor is much more analysis needed 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.590
 to know 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.210
 It is not defined by a 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 disc jokey colleague who is doing 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.540
 the fool who does not have a friend at all 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.240
 you are many of those who are 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 watching this video requested keys has 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.310
 past a friend has entered a friend already 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.750
 started doing so I'm jabbing 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.570
 leave me the helmets that I have some photo 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.430
 we all have it all and if it is not 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.840
 decision and if it has ever happened to us 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.330
 better you are the ones who have 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.680
 entered a cabin to do this with 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.170
 The little buttons are clear because that is what 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.950
 is doing is a friend of disc-jockey 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.349
 and you notice for several reasons a face 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.020
 to look at the face of the disc jockey 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.150
 true in the helmets as it looks at you like 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.810
 saying how you touch something I kill you like 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.700
 is weaving is quiet and another of 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.560
 the very clear reasons is that in the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.110
 bracelet that this man has put 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.640
 press removes it so that it can service 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.080
 here also but good to put press 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.489
 surely he is an acquaintance of 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.739
 disc-jockey who is really acting 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.810
 I took advantage to go up to do some 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.720
 photos to the stage has gotten into the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.580
 booth and then he has made the foolish fool 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.310
 but without more 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.130
 well then after seeing all this I 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.470
 I wanted to say be a little critical one 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.780
 little the idea of these videos to analyze 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.560
 disc jockeys and I will call you and 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.690
 this video is enough said video 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.880
 is that you must not awaken your 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.349
 critical spirit that you do not believe everything 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.209
 what you see everything that anyone says 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.780
 because someone takes some pictures of a 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.520
 video puts a label says something and 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.370
 everyone starts to believe and what not 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.950
 let's go in the field of disc-jockeys 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.400
 in all areas of life is a 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.049
 little critics ask or know if not 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.480
 it really was decision that is 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.040
 clicking I do not believe this that they are 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.410
 counting that I'm going to see the images and 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.340
 I will say by myself it is not a little 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.550
 otherwise what I'm saying 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.290
 because I'm giving it my point of 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.880
 seen no longer do you have to believe us 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.310
 and in fact if someone thinks otherwise 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.050
 that says it there are many videos less is 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.520
 saying new the plan because I'm not 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.760
 some with you I know how to do perfect 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.810
 perfect to go simply from my opinion of 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.210
 professional of this because there's a lot 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.380
 people who better understand or do not understand 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.700
 really what little button is touching 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.830
 so I say nothing else that is touching 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.110
 such a button a year I am that point of view 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.030
 or my personal 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.450
 so I want to awaken that spirit 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.460
 critical please 84 times and think for 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.680
 yourselves is that it is very important 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.360
 because if someone says you look at them 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520
 this one that is not doing anything and you see the 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.710
 video and you think it can be a 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.810
 mounting may have been like that 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.100
 is finally that you have understood me 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.450
 let's continue analyzing other videos 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.400
 disc jockeys you know you can leave 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.960
 here in comments please on 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.480
 comments not on facebook and on twitter 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.070
 well because it's more complicated for me 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.120
 let's try to agglutinate everything 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.430
 have to do with the youtube channel 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.370
 be on youtube for several reasons a me 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.950
 I go crazy if I get so many 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.950
 messages on facebook on twitter until in 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.440
 instagram not because it brings us a photo 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.690
 where something was good a little more 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.550
 staff and someone asked me hey that 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.950
 controller you recommend me 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.120
 in the videos they do not talk about being well 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.770
 link is to say if you go for a 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.850
 question about he remembered quite that 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.070
 go to a video where you talk about 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.280
 record box although it is advisable because 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.180
 there is this second thing that means 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.790
 because many people read it 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.890
 the idea of ââthis channel is I create a 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.510
 video I take a topic debate I put them my 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.630
 point of view act roll taught us to 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.240
 do something I propose to do something and then 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.580
 you complete a little giving our 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.720
 Your opinion, what do you think? 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.030
 what has happened to you 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.650
 if your experience then when 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.030
 we talked about the artistic name 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.210
 each one said how he created his 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.130
 etcetera then it's something nice because 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.630
 apart from the video I recommend that you see it 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.130
 the comments because there we go 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.990
 interacting and someone makes me a 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.370
 ask when I'm going to answer more or 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.710
 less every day he came in to answer 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.450
 the dining rooms that I have each or two 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.250
 days and I see that many people have responded 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.290
 someone who asks me something other 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.210
 youtube users have answered and 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.940
 fuck that to me really that I 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.620
 he is very excited and that interaction 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.350
 It is what makes the channel go 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.390
 really growing up this is as if a 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.320
 community of djs a community knows that 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.510
 someone was saying it out there in some 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.400
 comment because there's no going to 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.720
 try not to have it though it will appear in 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.800
 that word that we can try not to 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.530
 There are haters that there is not 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.509
 envious people or I just do not know 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.150
 criticizing and we will try to help us 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:02.379
 between all because not so that's why 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.150
 all comments please on 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.860

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.330
 you have a question will you be able 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.729
 answer someone sometimes you ask me 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.860
 what do you think of the normal controller not 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.720
