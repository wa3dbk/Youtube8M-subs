00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.289
 Internet 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.629
 in case it depended on navigating that if using this case is using music 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.269
 usually as if it is there but rather it already puts with starter soup holes at 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.249

 that although a lot of people today 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.230
 and pragmatic and very functional the lightest most practical is actually firefox 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.890
