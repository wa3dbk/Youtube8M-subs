basically<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.399> saying<00:02:02.820> some<00:02:03.119> basic

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
basically kind of saying some basic

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.880 
basically kind of saying some basic
settings<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:06.110> don't<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.290> anything<00:02:07.560> here

I<00:02:12.760> guess<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.629> don't<00:02:13.690> know<00:02:13.890> but<00:02:14.890> basically<00:02:15.280> what

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
I guess I don't know but basically what

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.330 
I guess I don't know but basically what
you<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:15.790> with<00:02:16.000> these<00:02:16.150> bars<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:17.099> take<00:02:18.099> where

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you can do with these bars is take where

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.740 
you can do with these bars is take where
you<00:02:18.489> want<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:19.599> start<00:02:20.349> copying<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.069> videos<00:02:21.370> so

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
you want to start copying the videos so

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.040 
you want to start copying the videos so
if<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.080> want<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.319> portion<00:02:23.739> of<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> video

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
if you just want a portion of the video

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.479 
if you just want a portion of the video
from<00:02:26.050> anywhere<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.680> take<00:02:26.920> both<00:02:27.190> sides

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
from anywhere you can take both sides

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.850 
from anywhere you can take both sides
and<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.540> will<00:02:28.599> be<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.140> portion<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.590> video

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
and that will be the portion of video

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.390 
and that will be the portion of video
you<00:02:30.040> get<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.420> say<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.110> wanted<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.650> ending<00:02:33.099> piece

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
you get so say I wanted the ending piece

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.350 
you get so say I wanted the ending piece
of<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:35.010> section<00:02:38.280> yeah<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.670> think<00:02:40.030> that's<00:02:40.239> as

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
of this section yeah I think that's as

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.500 
of this section yeah I think that's as
good<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:40.989> get<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.790> I'll<00:02:42.940> just<00:02:42.970> do

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
good as I can get to it so I'll just do

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.030 
good as I can get to it so I'll just do
the<00:02:43.780> normal<00:02:44.440> copy<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:45.760> click<00:02:46.120> start

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the normal copy so you just click start

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.979 
the normal copy so you just click start
pretty<00:02:48.040> simple<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:49.000> pretty<00:02:49.540> quick<00:02:49.720> with

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
pretty simple it's pretty quick with

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.789 
pretty simple it's pretty quick with
getting<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> whole<00:02:50.829> movie<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.489> want<00:02:51.670> to

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
getting the whole movie if you want to

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.960 
getting the whole movie if you want to
it's<00:02:53.799> quicker<00:02:54.040> when<00:02:54.370> you're<00:02:54.400> doing<00:02:54.760> less

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
it's quicker when you're doing less

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.380 
it's quicker when you're doing less
obviously<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.430> will<00:02:57.549> open<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.880> file<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
obviously so that will open the file and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.120 
obviously so that will open the file and
then<00:02:58.810> I've<00:02:59.470> got<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:00.549> Simpsons<00:03:00.970> right<00:03:01.269> here<00:03:02.130> or

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
then I've got the Simpsons right here or

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.320 
then I've got the Simpsons right here or
the<00:03:03.340> ending<00:03:03.849> credits<00:03:05.400> speed<00:03:06.400> forward

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.850 

then<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.080> have<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.770> ending<00:03:11.040> piece<00:03:12.860> if

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
then you have like the ending piece if

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.060 
then you have like the ending piece if
you<00:03:14.100> really<00:03:14.370> wanted<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.990> don't<00:03:16.860> know

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
you really wanted just that I don't know

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.980 
you really wanted just that I don't know
why<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.340> would<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:21.120> exit<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.630> all<00:03:21.780> that

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
why you would so the exit of all that

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.590 
why you would so the exit of all that
I'll<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.740> show<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:22.980> some<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.610> things

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
I'll just show you some of the things

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.740 
I'll just show you some of the things
you<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.860> change<00:03:26.750> your

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
you can do so you can change your

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.120 
you can do so you can change your
kilobytes<00:03:28.290> per<00:03:28.410> second<00:03:29.420> your<00:03:30.420> sample<00:03:30.900> rate

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
kilobytes per second your sample rate

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.910 
kilobytes per second your sample rate
obviously<00:03:32.130> higher<00:03:32.940> numbers<00:03:33.450> equals<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.290> higher

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
obviously higher numbers equals a higher

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.230 
obviously higher numbers equals a higher
quality<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.850> sort<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.150> stuff<00:03:38.240> there's

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
quality and that sort of stuff there's

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.910 
quality and that sort of stuff there's
no<00:03:39.390> point<00:03:39.630> really<00:03:39.840> touching<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.680> video

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
no point really touching on the video

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.770 
no point really touching on the video
frame<00:03:41.220> rate<00:03:41.430> unless<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.880> really<00:03:42.060> want<00:03:42.180> more

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
frame rate unless you really want more

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.600 
frame rate unless you really want more
frames<00:03:45.230> change<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.410> resolution<00:03:46.740> here<00:03:47.340> if<00:03:47.459> you

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
frames change the resolution here if you

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.530 
frames change the resolution here if you
like<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:50.550> CPU<00:03:51.330> cores<00:03:52.280> might<00:03:53.300> if<00:03:54.300> you<00:03:54.420> have

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
like to the CPU cores might if you have

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.050 
like to the CPU cores might if you have
a<00:03:54.570> quad-core<00:03:54.930> or<00:03:55.350> whatever<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.490> use<00:03:56.520> just

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
a quad-core or whatever you can use just

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.020 
a quad-core or whatever you can use just
maybe<00:03:57.360> two<00:03:57.690> cores<00:03:57.959> if<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.320> have<00:03:59.000> the<00:04:00.000> other

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
maybe two cores if you have the other

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.730 
maybe two cores if you have the other
two<00:04:00.240> cores<00:04:00.600> doing<00:04:00.990> something<00:04:01.350> else<00:04:01.470> or

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
two cores doing something else or

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.160 
two cores doing something else or
something<00:04:02.340> along<00:04:02.459> those<00:04:02.700> lines<00:04:03.050> so<00:04:04.050> that's

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
something along those lines so that's

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.680 
something along those lines so that's
nothing<00:04:04.470> too<00:04:05.070> special<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:06.360> it's<00:04:06.480> nice<00:04:06.660> that

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
nothing too special but it's nice that

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.250 
nothing too special but it's nice that
the<00:04:07.110> option<00:04:07.640> so<00:04:08.720> if<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.810> go<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.020> options

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
the option so if you go to options

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.890 
the option so if you go to options
general<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.670> can<00:04:11.850> choose<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:13.769> output<00:04:13.890> folder

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
general you can choose the output folder

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.990 
general you can choose the output folder
when<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.019> copy<00:04:16.320> stuff<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.100> you'll<00:04:17.489> also

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
when you copy stuff in that you'll also

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.949 
when you copy stuff in that you'll also
see<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:20.820> actually<00:04:21.209> puts<00:04:21.450> in<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.690> copy

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
see that it actually puts in a copy

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.260 
see that it actually puts in a copy
folder<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.770> doesn't<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.550> put<00:04:23.760> in<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.090> video

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
folder it doesn't just put in the video

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.220 
folder it doesn't just put in the video
folder<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.290> kind<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.560> organized<00:04:26.100> it

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
folder so it kind of organized it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.190 
folder so it kind of organized it
organizes<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.650> little<00:04:29.100> bit<00:04:29.250> for<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:31.050> as

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
organizes it a little bit for you so as

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.790 
organizes it a little bit for you so as
you<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.440> see<00:04:31.590> there<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:33.380> it's<00:04:34.380> just<00:04:34.620> a

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you can see there it is and it's just a

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.310 
you can see there it is and it's just a
nice<00:04:34.980> simple<00:04:35.490> clean<00:04:35.970> program<00:04:36.570> they<00:04:36.870> have<00:04:37.050> here

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
nice simple clean program they have here

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.210 
nice simple clean program they have here
I<00:04:37.970> do<00:04:38.970> recommend<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:39.720> if<00:04:39.870> you're<00:04:40.169> someone<00:04:40.950> who

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
I do recommend it if you're someone who

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.900 
I do recommend it if you're someone who
wants<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.640> copy<00:04:41.820> off<00:04:42.150> like<00:04:42.750> copy<00:04:43.310> make<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.340> kind

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
wants to copy off like copy make a kind

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.240 
wants to copy off like copy make a kind
of<00:04:45.030> digital<00:04:45.660> copy<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.380> your<00:04:46.710> movie<00:04:47.010> on<00:04:47.040> your

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
of digital copy of your movie on your

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.600 
of digital copy of your movie on your
computer<00:04:47.700> so<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.120> can<00:04:48.330> have<00:04:48.480> backups<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.110> case

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
computer so you can have backups in case

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.270 
computer so you can have backups in case
somehow<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.970> your<00:04:51.120> DVD<00:04:51.660> gets<00:04:51.840> destroyed

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
somehow that your DVD gets destroyed

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.320 
somehow that your DVD gets destroyed
unfortunately<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.460> won't<00:04:53.580> kind<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:53.940> have<00:04:54.060> the

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
unfortunately you won't kind of have the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.850 
unfortunately you won't kind of have the
cutscenes<00:04:54.810> in<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.200> but<00:04:55.440> at<00:04:55.530> least<00:04:55.560> you'll

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
cutscenes in that but at least you'll

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.040 
cutscenes in that but at least you'll
have<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.190> actual<00:04:56.520> DVD<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:59.479> that's<00:05:00.479> all<00:05:00.720> for

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
have the actual DVD and that's all for
