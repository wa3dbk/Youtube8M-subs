this is the base right here this is the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.190 
this is the base right here this is the
base<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.760> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.510> transmitter

laptops all my ipod my iPad and

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.019 
laptops all my ipod my iPad and
everything<00:06:30.349> that<00:06:30.500> was<00:06:30.800> wireless<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:31.610> was<00:06:31.789> in

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
everything that was wireless and was in

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.269 
everything that was wireless and was in
like<00:06:32.419> the<00:06:32.659> rains<00:06:32.960> I<00:06:33.259> turned<00:06:33.589> those<00:06:33.770> off<00:06:34.009> and

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
like the rains I turned those off and

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.399 
like the rains I turned those off and
then<00:06:34.550> it<00:06:34.759> improved<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.330> signal<00:06:35.779> but<00:06:35.930> I<00:06:35.960> still

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
then it improved the signal but I still

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.499 
then it improved the signal but I still
don't<00:06:36.680> like<00:06:36.860> that<00:06:37.190> fuzzy<00:06:37.550> it<00:06:37.729> still<00:06:38.000> had<00:06:38.240> it<00:06:38.389> on

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:38.509 
don't like that fuzzy it still had it on

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.899 
don't like that fuzzy it still had it on
and<00:06:38.930> off<00:06:39.050> depending<00:06:39.560> on<00:06:39.979> what<00:06:40.159> I<00:06:40.190> was<00:06:40.490> doing

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
and off depending on what I was doing

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.469 
and off depending on what I was doing
but<00:06:41.949> that's<00:06:42.949> basically<00:06:43.310> it<00:06:43.729> that's<00:06:44.060> basically

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
but that's basically it that's basically

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.140 
but that's basically it that's basically
what<00:06:44.750> this<00:06:44.900> device<00:06:45.139> does<00:06:45.349> and<00:06:46.009> the<00:06:46.490> material

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
what this device does and the material

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.200 
what this device does and the material
itself<00:06:47.300> it<00:06:47.900> feels<00:06:48.259> kind<00:06:49.069> of<00:06:49.370> cheap<00:06:49.729> for<00:06:50.120> the

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
itself it feels kind of cheap for the

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.059 
itself it feels kind of cheap for the
price<00:06:50.479> it<00:06:50.750> comes<00:06:51.020> in<00:06:51.259> at<00:06:51.469> 98<00:06:53.080> box<00:06:54.080> and<00:06:54.409> yet<00:06:54.800> it

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
price it comes in at 98 box and yet it

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.980 
price it comes in at 98 box and yet it
feels<00:06:55.099> kind<00:06:55.639> of<00:06:55.759> cheap<00:06:56.060> for<00:06:56.330> for<00:06:56.599> the<00:06:56.689> price

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
feels kind of cheap for for the price

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.279 
feels kind of cheap for for the price
but<00:06:57.889> you're<00:06:58.159> not<00:06:58.189> going<00:06:58.490> to<00:06:58.610> be<00:06:59.050> showing<00:07:00.050> it

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289

down<00:07:00.529> anything<00:07:00.979> like<00:07:01.250> that<00:07:01.279> all<00:07:01.699> you<00:07:01.909> have<00:07:01.939> to

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
down anything like that all you have to

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.800 
down anything like that all you have to
be<00:07:02.300> careful<00:07:02.509> with<00:07:02.930> this<00:07:03.319> piece<00:07:03.680> though<00:07:04.069> I<00:07:04.370> miro

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
be careful with this piece though I miro

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.730 
be careful with this piece though I miro
transmitter<00:07:05.810> piece<00:07:06.080> you<00:07:06.229> have<00:07:06.349> to<00:07:06.469> be<00:07:06.560> careful

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
transmitter piece you have to be careful

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.679 
transmitter piece you have to be careful
with<00:07:06.979> this<00:07:07.129> because<00:07:07.189> I<00:07:07.580> think<00:07:07.759> if<00:07:08.089> it<00:07:08.210> takes<00:07:08.479> a

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:08.689 
with this because I think if it takes a

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.869 
with this because I think if it takes a
hard<00:07:08.900> enough<00:07:09.110> hit<00:07:09.289> it's<00:07:09.650> gonna<00:07:10.159> destroy

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
hard enough hit it's gonna destroy

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.140 
hard enough hit it's gonna destroy
itself<00:07:11.629> you<00:07:12.169> can<00:07:12.349> also<00:07:12.560> charge<00:07:13.039> your<00:07:13.759> device

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
itself you can also charge your device

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.959 
itself you can also charge your device
with<00:07:14.779> it<00:07:14.960> it's<00:07:15.349> not<00:07:15.589> going<00:07:15.860> to<00:07:15.979> play<00:07:16.189> I<00:07:16.580> try
