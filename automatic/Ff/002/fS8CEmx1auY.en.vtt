00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
on explosive chest movement this

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
on explosive chest movement this
involves<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.680> slowly<00:00:59.160> down<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
involves going slowly down on the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
eccentric part of the movement and then

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
eccentric part of the movement and then
if<00:01:01.949> you're<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> gym<00:01:02.609> pushing<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> weights

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
up this is where the explosive power

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.390 
up this is where the explosive power
comes<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.600> 4<00:01:06.900> seconds<00:01:07.350> down<00:01:07.500> pause

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
comes in so about 4 seconds down pause

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.149 
comes in so about 4 seconds down pause

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
follow directly after this decline or an

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:43.740 
follow directly after this decline or an
incline<00:02:08.440> chest<00:02:08.649> movement<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.610> what<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.630> saw

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
movement this is where that power area

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.020 
movement this is where that power area
comes<00:02:49.030> into<00:02:49.299> play<00:02:49.480> again<00:02:50.260> slowly<00:02:50.829> down<00:02:51.100> you

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
comes into play again slowly down you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.030 
comes into play again slowly down you
can<00:02:52.180> hear<00:02:52.329> from<00:02:52.390> my<00:02:52.569> breath<00:02:52.810> now<00:02:53.049> I'm<00:02:53.829> having

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
that normal energy with that oxygen

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.670 
that normal energy with that oxygen
circulating<00:03:03.970> around<00:03:04.299> this<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.350> where<00:03:05.530> it's

to constantly keep moving speaking of

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.059 
to constantly keep moving speaking of
which<00:03:28.630> let's<00:03:29.019> move<00:03:29.200> down<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.650> legs<00:03:29.829> and

which let's move down to the legs and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.500 
which let's move down to the legs and
focus<00:03:30.819> on<00:03:31.060> leg<00:03:31.450> speed<00:03:33.180> okay<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.359> next

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
focus on leg speed okay this next

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.410 
focus on leg speed okay this next
exercise<00:03:34.980> requires<00:03:35.980> getting<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.760> box<00:03:37.060> or<00:03:37.299> some

exercise requires getting a box or some

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.780 
exercise requires getting a box or some
kind<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.660> platform<00:03:37.870> that's<00:03:38.739> about<00:03:39.040> knee

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
kind of platform that's about knee

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.539 
kind of platform that's about knee
height<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.599> again<00:03:41.079> an<00:03:41.170> explosive<00:03:41.769> plyometric

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
height and again an explosive plyometric

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.979 
height and again an explosive plyometric
movement<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.090> we're<00:03:43.299> using<00:03:43.420> our<00:03:43.599> body<00:03:43.840> weight

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
movement so we're using our body weight

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.920 
movement so we're using our body weight
as<00:03:44.230> resistance<00:03:44.940> if<00:03:45.940> you're<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.450> gym<00:03:46.630> you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
as resistance if you're in the gym you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.440 
as resistance if you're in the gym you
can<00:03:46.959> use<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.230> squat<00:03:47.620> rack<00:03:47.799> or<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.670> bar<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.269> the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
can use a squat rack or a bar and the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.750 
can use a squat rack or a bar and the
movement<00:03:49.720> goes<00:03:49.870> like<00:03:50.049> this<00:03:50.230> we<00:03:51.220> squat<00:03:51.579> down

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
movement goes like this we squat down

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.449 
movement goes like this we squat down
sitting<00:03:52.269> right<00:03:52.509> into<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.250> slowly<00:03:54.250> down

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
sitting right into it slowly down

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.699 
sitting right into it slowly down
stretching<00:03:55.239> out<00:03:55.359> all<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:56.019> our<00:03:56.229> glutes<00:03:56.500> and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
stretching out all of our glutes and

stretching out all of our glutes and
quads<00:03:56.979> all<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.340> these<00:03:57.459> big<00:03:57.699> leg<00:03:57.910> muscles<00:03:58.329> squat

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
quads all of these big leg muscles squat

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.430 
quads all of these big leg muscles squat
down<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.650> then<00:04:00.280> I'm<00:04:00.459> gonna<00:04:00.579> explode<00:04:01.090> up

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
down and then I'm gonna explode up

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.409 
down and then I'm gonna explode up
lifting<00:04:02.440> my<00:04:02.530> legs<00:04:02.769> off<00:04:03.009> the<00:04:03.040> ground<00:04:03.389> about<00:04:04.389> a

you once again working all of your
stabilization<00:04:15.479> muscles<00:04:16.479> like<00:04:17.049> this

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.980 

got<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:48.919> keep<00:04:49.009> moving<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:49.550> far<00:04:50.210> we<00:04:50.389> focused<00:04:50.810> on

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
got to keep moving so far we focused on

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.650 
got to keep moving so far we focused on
power<00:04:51.259> and<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:52.009> explosive<00:04:52.639> movement<00:04:52.970> now

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
power and that explosive movement now

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.689 
power and that explosive movement now
let's<00:04:53.840> move<00:04:54.020> over<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.350> stamina<00:04:55.009> and<00:04:55.220> some

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
let's move over to stamina and some

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.850 
let's move over to stamina and some
endurance<00:04:55.970> again<00:04:56.960> going<00:04:57.169> back<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.410> that<00:04:57.650> ring

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
endurance again going back to that ring

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.070 
endurance again going back to that ring
scenario<00:04:58.430> you've<00:04:59.270> got<00:04:59.389> no<00:04:59.539> time<00:04:59.750> to<00:04:59.930> take<00:05:00.050> a

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
scenario you've got no time to take a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.110 
scenario you've got no time to take a
rest<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.680> catch<00:05:01.280> your<00:05:01.490> breath<00:05:01.639> back

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
rest and catch your breath back

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.050 
rest and catch your breath back
so<00:05:02.660> keeping<00:05:03.560> things<00:05:03.770> moving<00:05:03.860> I'm<00:05:04.820> going<00:05:05.000> to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
so keeping things moving I'm going to

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.820 
so keeping things moving I'm going to
sprint<00:05:05.449> interval<00:05:06.110> training<00:05:06.410> now<00:05:06.530> if<00:05:06.680> you're

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
sprint interval training now if you're

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.620 
sprint interval training now if you're
in<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.099> gym<00:05:07.280> use<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.030> treadmill

now<00:05:37.930> one<00:05:38.770> of<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:38.919> main<00:05:39.070> areas<00:05:39.280> that<00:05:39.669> fighters

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
now one of the main areas that fighters

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.629 
now one of the main areas that fighters
really<00:05:40.810> need<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.020> focus<00:05:41.139> on<00:05:41.470> is<00:05:42.100> being<00:05:42.370> able<00:05:42.520> to

really need to focus on is being able to

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.969 
really need to focus on is being able to
train<00:05:42.910> when<00:05:43.660> they're<00:05:43.810> out<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:43.960> breath<00:05:44.229> really

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
train when they're out of breath really
