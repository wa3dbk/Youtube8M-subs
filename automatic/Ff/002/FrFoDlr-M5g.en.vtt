FUNNY WAY TO DIE

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.732
I'm sure everyone imagined how they would die...

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, at least I did.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.250
I want to die for something honorable,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.000
For something meaningful,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.400
something heroic.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.600
Sigh, maybe I've watched too many movies

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.000
But I didn't even think I'd die like this!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.359
Drat!

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.500
Hmph disguisting!
Never imagined I would die like this.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.020
Dinda?

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.460
Dem, why are you absent today?
Been trying to call you.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.280
OTW there with Andre.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.560
CRAP!

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.199
Gawd, why!
Could it be more embarrassing!

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.040
Dead or alive, my life is a dissapointment
Might as well get dragged to hell by DEMONS!

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.599
What's up, bro?

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.099
Wo!

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.959
Okay, hang on!

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.699
Hi, we're from next door.
Just wanna welcome you, congrats!

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.719
WHOA, nice place you got here.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.820
Hi, I'm Santi. What's your name?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.820
Demi...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.500
Ow... how cute.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.440
Have any girlfriends?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.280
Huh?!? Buzz off, Cil!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
What is going on?

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.500
Wow! This is an awesome collection, bro!

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.880
Now this one is a classic!

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.599
Ehmm... Sir...

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.800
Yeah, bro?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.300
You can touch things?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.640
Of course!

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.840
Oh right, you can't.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.020
Don't worry... I will teach you how.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.600
Can you do me a favour?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.360
Absolutely!

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.300
Sure! What is it?

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.599
Aw, you poor thing.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.800
What did you do?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.380
... And ended up like that?!?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.000
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.199
So...what do you want us to do?

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.539
Just make it better.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.400
As long it doesn't look like that!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.840
Ok! What about...

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.100
Quiz of Ways to Die.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.960
Ah, there are people coming!

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.199
Dinda?!?

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.399
Demm?!?
