mechanism<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.020> anyways<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.469> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
mechanism to do that but anyways this is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
mechanism to do that but anyways this is
where<00:00:52.829> my<00:00:53.309> writs<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:53.789> set<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> as

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
where my writs don't set up as and as

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.549 
where my writs don't set up as and as
you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.960> basically<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you can see it's basically just like

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.319 
you can see it's basically just like
normal<00:00:55.890> minecraft<00:00:56.250> except<00:00:56.879> everything<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
normal minecraft except everything is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.660 
normal minecraft except everything is
really<00:00:57.449> compact<00:00:57.989> into<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.559> block<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.460> just

really compact into one block or just
one<00:01:00.090> location<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.500> very<00:01:01.649> useful

see<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.570> 12<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.049> them<00:01:28.200> right<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> top<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
see I have 12 of them right on top of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.880 
see I have 12 of them right on top of
just<00:01:29.729> two<00:01:30.030> blocks<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.380> could<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.530> very

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
just two blocks so that could be very

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
just two blocks so that could be very
very<00:01:32.040> very<00:01:32.640> useful<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.150> storing<00:01:33.570> items<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
very very useful for storing items and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.480 
very very useful for storing items and
just<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.439> keeping<00:01:34.710> everything<00:01:34.829> organized

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
just for keeping everything organized

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
just for keeping everything organized
now<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.180> tiny<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:36.509> area<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.900> did

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
now in this tiny little area I did

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.080 
now in this tiny little area I did
include<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.710> crafting<00:01:38.159> table<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> house<00:01:38.880> as

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
include a crafting table in the house as

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.280 
include a crafting table in the house as
well<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.270> two<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.630> instance<00:01:39.900> which<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> can

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
well as two for instance which you can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.469 
well as two for instance which you can
still<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.680> use<00:01:40.920> even<00:01:41.640> though<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> scale

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
still we use even though it's at a scale

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.880 
still we use even though it's at a scale
size<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.049> when<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> take<00:01:43.409> out<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.560> item

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
size but when you take out your item

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
size but when you take out your item
will<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> original<00:01:45.030> size<00:01:45.210> as

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
will go back to the original size as

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
will go back to the original size as
well<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.409> few<00:01:46.439> flower<00:01:46.920> pots<00:01:47.189> with

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
well as we have a few flower pots with

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
well as we have a few flower pots with
flowers<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.060> water<00:01:48.659> tank<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.200> water

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
flowers we have a water tank this water

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.719 
flowers we have a water tank this water
tanks<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:50.100> pretty<00:01:50.340> cool<00:01:50.549> because

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
tanks actually pretty cool because

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.190 
tanks actually pretty cool because
there's<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.090> water<00:01:51.329> inside<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.049> there's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
there's like water inside but there's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.929 
there's like water inside but there's
glass<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> edges<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.850> know

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
glass on the edges kind of you know

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.190 
glass on the edges kind of you know
keeping<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> water<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.170> be

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
keeping the water out so that could be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
keeping the water out so that could be
one<00:01:55.470> useful<00:01:56.040> thing<00:01:56.219> using<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:57.119> blocks

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
one useful thing using the little blocks

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.940 
one useful thing using the little blocks
mod<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.780> well<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> small

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
mod as well as we have a small

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
mod as well as we have a small
enchantment<00:01:59.460> table<00:01:59.759> we<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.420> an<00:02:00.570> ender<00:02:00.810> chest

we<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.469> an<00:02:01.590> anvil<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> head<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:03.060> well

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
we have an anvil we have a head as well

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.520 
we have an anvil we have a head as well
as<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> jack-o'-lantern<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> can

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
as a jack-o'-lantern so you can

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530 
as a jack-o'-lantern so you can
basically<00:02:04.680> put<00:02:05.009> anything<00:02:05.310> onto<00:02:05.700> any<00:02:06.299> surface

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
basically put anything onto any surface

using this tiny or using the little

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
using this tiny or using the little
blocks<00:02:09.270> mod<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.229> could<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.379> very<00:02:10.619> cool

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
blocks mod so that could be very cool

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.020 
blocks mod so that could be very cool
and<00:02:11.009> very<00:02:11.069> useful<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.640> let's<00:02:11.760> go<00:02:11.910> ahead

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and very useful so let's go ahead

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970

need to right-click onto a surface to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.020 
need to right-click onto a surface to
place<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.650> blocks<00:02:28.890> now<00:02:29.489> as<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:29.849> see

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
place little blocks now as you can see

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.759 
place little blocks now as you can see
once<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.480> hover<00:02:30.720> over<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.170> block<00:02:31.379> you'll<00:02:31.590> see

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
once I hover over this block you'll see

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.339 
once I hover over this block you'll see
that<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.129> flashing<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.790> white<00:02:33.349> phantom

that it's flashing this white phantom

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.660 
that it's flashing this white phantom
block<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:34.980> block<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.400> basically

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
block and this block is basically

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.190 
block and this block is basically
telling<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.090> where<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.569> could<00:02:36.750> place<00:02:36.930> little

telling you where you could place little

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.350 
telling you where you could place little
blocks<00:02:37.440> once<00:02:37.680> you've<00:02:37.799> activated<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.549> using

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
blocks once you've activated it using

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.369 
blocks once you've activated it using
the<00:02:39.450> wand<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.019> go<00:02:40.110> ahead<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
the wand so if I go ahead and

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.900 
the wand so if I go ahead and
right-click<00:02:40.530> I'll<00:02:41.010> activate<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.700> little

right-click I'll activate the little
blocks<00:02:42.180> mod<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.930> could<00:02:43.110> place<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.500> little

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
blocks mod and I could place the little

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.259 
blocks mod and I could place the little
blocks<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.220> area<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.489> was<00:02:44.760> indicated

before<00:02:45.390> now<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.290> order<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.980> extend

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
before now in order to kind of extend

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.759 
before now in order to kind of extend
this<00:02:48.090> onto<00:02:48.420> another<00:02:48.629> block<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.560> either

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
this onto another block you can either

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.530 
this onto another block you can either
convert<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.430> into<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.760> little<00:02:50.910> block<00:02:51.150> area<00:02:51.360> as

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
convert this into a little block area as

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.009 
convert this into a little block area as
well<00:02:51.720> or<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.680> also<00:02:53.640> kind<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.420> continue

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
well or you can also kind of continue

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.259 
well or you can also kind of continue
building<00:02:55.950> until<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.459> reach<00:02:56.640> another<00:02:56.790> block

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
building until you reach another block

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.759 
building until you reach another block
and<00:02:57.450> will<00:02:57.569> automatically<00:02:57.989> be<00:02:58.140> converted<00:02:58.319> into

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
and will automatically be converted into

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.740 
and will automatically be converted into
a<00:02:58.890> little<00:02:59.160> blocks<00:02:59.400> even<00:02:59.730> though<00:03:00.150> I'm<00:03:00.359> using<00:03:00.599> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
a little blocks even though I'm using a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.509 
a little blocks even though I'm using a
normal<00:03:00.900> block<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.440> will<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.709> be<00:03:01.980> placed<00:03:02.280> into

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
normal block it will just be placed into

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.640 
normal block it will just be placed into
a<00:03:02.549> little<00:03:02.819> block<00:03:03.030> wherever<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:04.079> know<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.470> mod

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
a little block wherever you know the mod

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.410 
a little block wherever you know the mod
is<00:03:04.799> basically<00:03:05.099> activated<00:03:05.790> now<00:03:06.000> if<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.269> want

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
is basically activated now if you want

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.270 
is basically activated now if you want
to<00:03:06.510> completely<00:03:06.840> remove<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.500> low<00:03:07.620> blocks<00:03:07.920> area

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
to completely remove the low blocks area

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.589 
to completely remove the low blocks area
from<00:03:08.489> this<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:08.879> you<00:03:08.940> could<00:03:09.090> place<00:03:09.269> another

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
from this so you could place another

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.330 
from this so you could place another
block<00:03:09.810> on<00:03:10.109> top<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.799> need<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.069> destroy

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
block on top you just need to destroy

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.860 
block on top you just need to destroy
all<00:03:11.519> your<00:03:11.549> low<00:03:11.760> blocks<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.359> then<00:03:12.480> hit<00:03:12.629> it<00:03:12.660> one

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
all your low blocks and then hit it one

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.449 
all your low blocks and then hit it one
more<00:03:12.900> time<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.319> remove<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.709> low<00:03:13.829> block<00:03:14.040> effect

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
more time to remove the low block effect

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.430 
more time to remove the low block effect
that<00:03:14.609> your<00:03:14.730> wand<00:03:14.940> put<00:03:15.150> onto<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.569> block<00:03:15.780> now

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
that your wand put onto the block now

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.080 
that your wand put onto the block now
you<00:03:16.500> could<00:03:16.890> also<00:03:17.010> place<00:03:17.340> other<00:03:17.519> things<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
you could also place other things on the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
you could also place other things on the
block<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.450> redstone<00:03:18.959> very<00:03:19.260> very<00:03:19.530> easily<00:03:19.739> so

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
block like redstone very very easily so

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.589 
block like redstone very very easily so
let's<00:03:20.099> go<00:03:20.190> ahead<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.639> convert<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.389> block

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
let's go ahead and convert this block

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.390 
let's go ahead and convert this block
back<00:03:21.840> into<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> little<00:03:22.560> blocks<00:03:22.769> area<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:23.310> in

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
back into a little blocks area and in

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220 
back into a little blocks area and in
place<00:03:23.669> some<00:03:24.060> redstone<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.750> as<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.019> see<00:03:25.139> we

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
place some redstone so as you can see we

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.900 
place some redstone so as you can see we
have<00:03:25.319> some<00:03:25.470> redstone<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.099> block<00:03:26.310> then<00:03:26.790> we

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
have some redstone on this block then we

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.370 
have some redstone on this block then we
take<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.120> lever<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.660> then<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:28.079> kind<00:03:28.290> of

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
take a lever and then we kind of

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.960 
take a lever and then we kind of
activate<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.549> Redstone

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
activate it and then the Redstone

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.120 
activate it and then the Redstone
activates<00:03:30.720> as<00:03:30.870> usual<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.590> also<00:03:31.739> put<00:03:31.980> a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
activates as usual and can also put a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.580 
activates as usual and can also put a
dispenser<00:03:32.910> here<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.329> dispense<00:03:33.750> items<00:03:34.109> once<00:03:34.470> we

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
dispenser here to dispense items once we

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.900 
dispenser here to dispense items once we
activate<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.310> let's<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:35.549> ahead<00:03:35.730> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
activate that so let's go ahead and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.599 
activate that so let's go ahead and
place<00:03:36.450> some<00:03:36.870> arrows<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.680> there<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.190> then

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
place some arrows in there and then

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.849 
place some arrows in there and then
let's<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.060> turn<00:03:39.269> on<00:03:39.480> our<00:03:39.900> dispenser<00:03:40.709> yet

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
let's just turn on our dispenser yet

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.379 
let's just turn on our dispenser yet
again<00:03:41.069> turn<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.730> off<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.269> see

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
again turn on and off and you can see

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.300 
again turn on and off and you can see
that<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.599> dispenses<00:03:43.109> arrows<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.040> doesn't

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
that it dispenses arrows now it doesn't

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.770 
that it dispenses arrows now it doesn't
shoot<00:03:44.400> very<00:03:44.609> far<00:03:44.880> mainly<00:03:45.269> because<00:03:45.419> it's<00:03:45.690> a

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
shoot very far mainly because it's a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.750 
shoot very far mainly because it's a
small<00:03:46.109> or<00:03:46.349> little<00:03:46.560> block<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.519> shooting

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
small or little block and it's shooting

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.309 
small or little block and it's shooting
like<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:47.970> really<00:03:48.299> huge<00:03:48.540> arrow<00:03:48.780> but<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.109> can

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
like a really huge arrow but you can

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.129 
like a really huge arrow but you can
dispense<00:03:50.099> things<00:03:50.430> like<00:03:50.760> rockets<00:03:51.419> or<00:03:51.720> not<00:03:51.930> rock

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
dispense things like rockets or not rock

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.229 
dispense things like rockets or not rock

dispenser on your world or in your
custom<00:03:58.980> map<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.609> guys<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> think<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.180> wraps<00:04:00.359> up
