want to do is take your scotch tape and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
want to do is take your scotch tape and
tape<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.200> edges<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.620> paper

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
tape down all of the edges of the paper

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.190 
tape down all of the edges of the paper
cut<00:01:46.980> cardboard<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:48.510> wanted<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.870> lay<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.170> flat

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
cut cardboard you wanted to lay as flat

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.780 
cut cardboard you wanted to lay as flat
as<00:01:49.620> possible<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:50.310> nothing's<00:01:50.700> popping<00:01:50.940> up<00:01:55.790> so

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
as possible so nothing's popping up so

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.920 
as possible so nothing's popping up so
probably<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.300> hardest<00:01:57.660> part<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.870> this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
probably the hardest part of this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.540 
probably the hardest part of this
project<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.470> going<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.860> cutting<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.400> the

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
project is going to be cutting out the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.000 
project is going to be cutting out the
castle<00:01:59.900> take<00:02:00.900> your<00:02:01.050> exacto<00:02:01.320> knife<00:02:01.620> or<00:02:01.830> bleed

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
castle take your exacto knife or bleed

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.710 
castle take your exacto knife or bleed
and<00:02:02.280> trace<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> silhouette<00:02:03.030> as<00:02:03.210> accurately

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
and trace the silhouette as accurately

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:15.580 
and trace the silhouette as accurately
as<00:02:03.870> possible<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.740> cardboard

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.870 

you<00:02:16.590> might<00:02:16.770> want<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> pop<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.400> what<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.640> cut

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you might want to pop out what you cut

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.130 
you might want to pop out what you cut
every<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.240> often<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.780> make<00:02:18.900> sure<00:02:19.050> that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
every so often just to make sure that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:38.620 
every so often just to make sure that
the<00:02:19.290> edges<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.710> clean

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.540 

it's<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.810> really<00:02:40.290> tedious<00:02:40.500> process<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.370> once

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
it's a really tedious process but once

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.290 
it's a really tedious process but once
you've<00:02:41.700> finished<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.240> time<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.660> eat<00:02:42.690> I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
you've finished it's time to eat I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.250 
you've finished it's time to eat I
recommend<00:02:45.300> using<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.630> bit<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.870> tape<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.080> hold

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
recommend using a bit of tape to hold

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.050 
recommend using a bit of tape to hold
the<00:02:46.500> cardboard<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.010> canvas<00:02:47.340> together<00:02:47.640> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
the cardboard and canvas together you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.250 
the cardboard and canvas together you
want<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.270> make<00:02:48.420> sure<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> cardboard<00:02:49.200> is

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
want to make sure that the cardboard is

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.870 
want to make sure that the cardboard is
on<00:02:49.410> securely<00:02:49.860> or<00:02:50.070> else<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.340> paint<00:02:50.520> will<00:02:50.640> bleed

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
on securely or else the paint will bleed

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.250 
on securely or else the paint will bleed
on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.090> outline<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.600> castle<00:02:51.930> won't<00:02:52.050> be

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
on the outline of the castle won't be

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.040 
on the outline of the castle won't be
sharp<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:54.060> from<00:02:54.270> here<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.720> totally

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
sharp but from here you can totally

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.770 
sharp but from here you can totally
paint<00:02:55.290> as<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.500> wish

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
paint as you wish

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.940 
paint as you wish
try<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.930> put<00:02:58.080> similar<00:02:58.470> shades<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:58.890> colors

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
try and put similar shades and colors

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.860 
try and put similar shades and colors
next<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.520> each<00:02:59.580> other<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.270> has<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> fading

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
next to each other so it has a fading

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.350 
next to each other so it has a fading
effect<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.830> example<00:03:01.950> green<00:03:02.610> sex<00:03:02.970> with<00:03:03.150> blues

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
effect for example green sex with blues

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.660 
effect for example green sex with blues
and<00:03:03.660> blues<00:03:03.810> purples<00:03:04.650> or<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> light<00:03:05.220> blue<00:03:05.460> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and blues purples or a light blue to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:04:30.840 
and blues purples or a light blue to
medium<00:03:05.970> blue<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.240> dark<00:03:06.270> blue

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.210 

so<00:04:31.480> unfortunately<00:04:31.690> at<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.650> point<00:04:32.950> my<00:04:33.040> camera

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
so unfortunately at this point my camera

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.070 
so unfortunately at this point my camera
died<00:04:33.550> without<00:04:33.820> me<00:04:33.970> realizing<00:04:34.150> but<00:04:34.750> I'm<00:04:34.930> going

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
died without me realizing but I'm going

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.420 
died without me realizing but I'm going
to<00:04:35.140> show<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.470> final<00:04:35.620> project<00:04:35.920> and<00:04:36.340> just

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
to show you the final project and just

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.730 
to show you the final project and just
explain<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.060> last<00:04:37.270> few<00:04:37.510> steps<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:37.930> did<00:04:38.170> so

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
explain the last few steps that I did so

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.230 
explain the last few steps that I did so
this<00:04:38.920> is<00:04:39.070> what<00:04:39.190> your<00:04:39.340> watercolor<00:04:39.700> campus<00:04:40.120> will

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
this is what your watercolor campus will

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.020 
this is what your watercolor campus will
look<00:04:40.360> like<00:04:40.480> yet<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:41.460> spread<00:04:42.460> a<00:04:42.520> bit<00:04:42.700> of<00:04:42.850> water

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
look like yet I spread a bit of water

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.730 
look like yet I spread a bit of water
across<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.420> bottom<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.050> make<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.170> lines<00:04:44.440> less

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
across the bottom to make the lines less

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.770 
across the bottom to make the lines less
sharp<00:04:45.040> there<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.670> then<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.060> put<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.300> nice<00:04:46.570> big

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
sharp there and then I put a nice big

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.480 
sharp there and then I put a nice big
drop<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:47.110> paint<00:04:47.290> on<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.590> bottom<00:04:47.860> in<00:04:48.070> different

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
drop of paint on the bottom in different

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.920 
drop of paint on the bottom in different
colors<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:48.730> let<00:04:48.970> them<00:04:49.120> drip<00:04:49.300> down<00:04:49.510> for<00:04:49.810> that

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
colors and let them drip down for that

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:59.249 
colors and let them drip down for that
kind<00:04:50.170> of<00:04:50.290> dripping<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:50.770> fact

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.570 

finally<00:05:00.259> I<00:05:00.289> decided<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.860> want<00:05:01.069> a<00:05:01.190> bit<00:05:01.430> more

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
finally I decided I want a bit more

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.950 
finally I decided I want a bit more
color<00:05:01.819> and<00:05:02.000> Spyder<00:05:02.270> painted<00:05:02.690> different

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
color and Spyder painted different

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.809 
color and Spyder painted different
colors<00:05:02.990> across<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.680> entire<00:05:03.919> canvas<00:05:04.280> which<00:05:04.669> is

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
colors across the entire canvas which is

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:19.300 
colors across the entire canvas which is
super<00:05:05.120> easy<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.660> then<00:05:06.410> you're<00:05:06.560> done

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.010 

while<00:05:19.910> some<00:05:20.090> parts<00:05:20.330> of<00:05:20.390> this<00:05:20.480> can<00:05:20.690> take<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:20.990> a

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
while some parts of this can take you a

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.660 
while some parts of this can take you a
while<00:05:21.170> to<00:05:21.230> do<00:05:21.590> this<00:05:21.890> campus<00:05:22.280> took<00:05:22.430> me<00:05:22.520> less

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
while to do this campus took me less

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.250 
while to do this campus took me less
than<00:05:22.730> an<00:05:22.970> hour<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.330> make<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.690> it's<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.870> totally

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260
