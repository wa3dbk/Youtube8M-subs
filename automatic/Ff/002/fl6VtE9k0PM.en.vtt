00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
because of the battery power as I said

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.640 
because of the battery power as I said
before<00:00:30.239> these<00:00:30.480> pickups<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:31.079> a<00:00:31.109> passive

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
before these pickups are a passive

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
an active pickups preamp ok let's hear

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
an active pickups preamp ok let's hear
these<00:00:49.560> deactivators<00:00:50.370> using<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.450> bridge

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
these deactivators using the bridge

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.430 
these deactivators using the bridge
pickup

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
pickup

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.250 
pickup
I<00:00:52.470> got<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.130> basic<00:00:53.460> rock<00:00:54.240> sound<00:00:54.720> and<00:00:55.020> you'll<00:00:55.140> get

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
I got a basic rock sound and you'll get

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.160 
I got a basic rock sound and you'll get
to<00:00:55.410> hear<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:56.220> cutting<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.060> is<00:00:57.240> so<00:00:57.630> let's<00:00:57.960> hear

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to hear how cutting it is so let's hear

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:22.010 
to hear how cutting it is so let's hear
what<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.290> sounds<00:00:58.710> like

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.779 

so<00:01:23.020> as<00:01:23.109> you<00:01:23.229> just<00:01:23.259> heard<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.920> pickups<00:01:24.609> are

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
so as you just heard the pickups are

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.359 
so as you just heard the pickups are
very<00:01:25.149> loud<00:01:25.539> and<00:01:25.960> they're<00:01:26.439> very<00:01:26.619> articulate

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
very loud and they're very articulate

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.730 
very loud and they're very articulate
and<00:01:27.549> they<00:01:28.299> don't<00:01:28.479> have<00:01:28.600> any<00:01:28.869> of<00:01:29.020> those<00:01:29.170> bumps

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
and they don't have any of those bumps

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.260 
and they don't have any of those bumps
that<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:30.069> get<00:01:30.310> when<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.759> use<00:01:30.789> an<00:01:31.060> active

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
that you get when you use an active

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.660 
that you get when you use an active
pickup<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.109> all<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.409> compression<00:01:32.950> even<00:01:33.579> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
pickup and all the compression even the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.010 
pickup and all the compression even the
change<00:01:33.909> in<00:01:34.060> volume<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.569> right

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
change in volume is right

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.620 
change in volume is right
take<00:01:35.409> a<00:01:35.439> listen<00:01:35.649> as<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.039> bounce<00:01:36.640> between<00:01:36.880> both

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
take a listen as I bounce between both

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.990 
take a listen as I bounce between both
the<00:01:37.810> bridge<00:01:38.049> neck<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.369> combination

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
the bridge neck and the combination

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:57.350 
the bridge neck and the combination
they're<00:01:40.179> very<00:01:40.479> even<00:01:41.049> here<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:41.439> go

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.490 

but<00:01:58.360> one<00:01:58.479> thing<00:01:58.659> I'm<00:01:58.780> drawn<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.080> about<00:01:59.380> the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
but one thing I'm drawn to about the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.100 
but one thing I'm drawn to about the
deactivators<00:02:00.159> is<00:02:00.369> it's<00:02:00.820> great<00:02:01.210> clean<00:02:01.659> sound

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
deactivators is it's great clean sound

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.950 
deactivators is it's great clean sound
so<00:02:02.860> moving<00:02:03.280> over<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.580> clean<00:02:03.909> channel<00:02:04.360> let's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
so moving over to a clean channel let's

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.840 
so moving over to a clean channel let's
use<00:02:05.170> both<00:02:05.409> pickups<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.070> you'll<00:02:06.310> get<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.610> hear

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
use both pickups and you'll get to hear

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.210 
use both pickups and you'll get to hear
how<00:02:07.360> clean<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.259> articulate<00:02:09.069> and

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
how clean and articulate and

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.980 
how clean and articulate and
particularly<00:02:09.729> allow<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.300> are<00:02:10.479> when<00:02:10.690> doing

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
particularly allow they are when doing

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.160 
particularly allow they are when doing
clean<00:02:11.470> lines<00:02:11.770> here<00:02:12.220> we<00:02:12.310> go

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:43.930 

you

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.880 

using<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.030> same<00:02:45.360> clean<00:02:45.690> sound<00:02:46.080> let's<00:02:46.350> hear

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
using that same clean sound let's hear

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.740 
using that same clean sound let's hear
both<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.310> bridge<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.819> neck<00:02:48.030> pickups<00:02:48.480> and

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
both the bridge and neck pickups and

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.900 
both the bridge and neck pickups and
I'll<00:02:49.020> toggle<00:02:49.290> between<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.920> as<00:02:50.130> well<00:02:50.610> as<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
I'll toggle between that as well as the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.730 
I'll toggle between that as well as the
middle<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.630> get<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> hear<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> variation

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
middle so you get to hear the variation

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.400 
middle so you get to hear the variation
at<00:02:52.980> how<00:02:53.280> even<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.000> how<00:02:54.330> all<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.600> strings<00:02:55.080> ring

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
at how even and how all the strings ring

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:19.920 
at how even and how all the strings ring
true<00:02:55.680> here<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.250> go

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
