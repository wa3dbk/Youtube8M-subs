00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:22.220
 the variation of nutritional requirements 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.029
 of knives throughout the production cycle 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.970
 determines that you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.739
 when formulating diets meets those 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.589
 different requirements 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.350
 otherwise you can provide a diet 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.020
 with too much energy for a cow that does not 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 need leading to a weight gain 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.990
 that may even be harmful 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.450
 animals and also the increased costs 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.090
 of production or can give food of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.040
 less for a cow than well fed 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.030
 could produce more 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.470
 in which case you would lose in production 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.350
 how to individually feed the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.990
 animals is generally not feasible or 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 technically or economically in the 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.330
 confinement as in pasture 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.450
 the solution will be to group animals with 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.260
 requirements and meet the average 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.260
 these requirements 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.310
 nutritional requirements of heifers 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.340
 rearing are relatively low in 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.710
 compared to cows in production 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.170
 so they should form a category 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.020
 Animal handled part of the system 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.140
 production in confinement where the food 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.490
 used is corn silage 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 You'll make an extra 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.700
 relatively low and concentrated at 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 diet 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.530
 according to expected weight gain 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.890
 balanced so that the coverage weight 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.310
 is reached at the age however proposed 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.750
 because of the nutritional requirements 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.849
 many heifers are moderately 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.700
 properties that produce milk with 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.979
 confined cows make the joy of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.640
 doubts on irrigated pastures such as 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.700
 In this example, they seek to reduce 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.489
 feeding costs installations 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.310
 tiff 85 and irrigated with 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.280
 fixed sprinklers manure and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.069
 rotating system can supply part of the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.410
 energy demanded by animals and all 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.930
 necessary to achieve the necessary 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.480
 coverage weight up to 15 months 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.810
 supplementation is done with a 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.060
 concentrate in our example 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.160
 ground corn crushed by descent to base 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.040
 two pounds per animal plus 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.819
 mineral mixture served in the trough in 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.310
 leisure areas attached to pickets 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.489
 it is important that even in growing you 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.079
 group heifers into subcategories 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.130
 forming lots with more 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.590
 homogeneous 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.079
 in this example heifers with four to 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.810
 five months of age are heavy and 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.150
 Tight is formed with a batch 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.760
 animals weighing 100 kilograms or more 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.230
 alive and another with those who weighed 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.049
 less than 100 pounds 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.200
 this way you will avoid that animals 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.690
 more developed countries dominate 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.250
 children who would have more difficulties 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.650
 to access the thigh of food 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 concentrate, which would further delay 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.720
 their development 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.000
 heifers should also form groups at 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.800
 part of the adult cows in the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.760
 transition and throughout the first 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.430
 lactation, it is advised that they receive 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.890
 a differentiated diet and coexist with 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.910
 animals of the same size and situation 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.830
 physiological 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.950
 also aimed at avoiding the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.480
 dominance in confinement 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.819
 or on pasture 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.069
 Ideally, you have a lot of 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.830
 pre-calving heifers and another in 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.910
 produced only by heifers 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.890
 the first would have the first but not 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.810
 only batch formation will be 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.239
 sufficient to ensure good 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.730
 different groups of 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.670
 food of any 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.920
 certain animal care are 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.200
 essential when establishing the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.510
 feeding strategies to be 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.310
 adopted as the teacher informs 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.910
 Julian resends 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.310
 if you take the leftover food from the body 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.100
 and passing the cow logo increases the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.200
 milk production is what is the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.300
 is left in the trough because the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.220
 cow is well fed then 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.950
 logically that production will increase 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.130
 if there was not any left in the body maybe she wanted 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.200
 eat a little more and there was not and there she 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.710
 will penalize the next day by producing 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.220
 less milk from the food supply always 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.620
 at ease in the specific case for the cow 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.979
 because she will only eat 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.349
 What are you offering her ended? 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.820
 the food has nothing more to do 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.400
 it's something else we observe 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.979
 with respect to ambience this is very 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.919
 important is when the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.500
 Ideally, you have a cow eating 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.870
 Ideally, you have the cow lying down and 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.000
 works the cow in the bones doing nothing 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.180
 is not ruminating is not feeding 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.880
 Cow lying down Cow lying down 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.370
 and it means the environment is good for 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.770
 all for all in the case 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.560
 every cow is doing what he wants 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.550
 now if you arrive at the corral tas vaca 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.620
 everything standing there gasping for breath 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.669
 cow has to eat the food on the course but 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.020
 Cow is not there. 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.080
 he is currently under stress 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.659
 caloric 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.819
 we are with the elderly metabolic a 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.539
 Cow does not want to eat anything is 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.669
 wrong 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.460
 nutrition also goes through a 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.490
 corral observation behavior of 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.550
 cow is the herd he has to be well 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.979
 Willingness to have the food that was 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.419
 formulation formulated understand that it 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.780
 leave the computer 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.030
 she goes through a mixer and she goes 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.050
 offered in the trough then has three 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.330
 phases 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.300
 there are those who say that the diet that is formulated 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.879
 on the computer is never the diet that the cow 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.210
 is eating because in this process of 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:10.240
 formulation to make the beat on the farm 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.300
 and to offer to the cow is much loss 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.729
 sometimes mixing right is a diet that 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.580
 is provided concentrated bulk together 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.159
 sometimes the cowboy at first he 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.779
 I mix well I saw you put all the 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.180
 on the trough line 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:29.229
 then come put the concentrate on top 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.539
 and back mixing at first he is at 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.490
 rest in the hotel and mix well blended 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.240
 right in the middle of the course he has 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.460
 to tire 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.129
 it only gives three volumes in the diet already in the 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.719
 then the tail end in the mixture cow 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.029
 is eating early will eat a diet 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:44.589
 different from the one in the middle 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:47.050
 different from the one at the end of 

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:48.849
 pur line today even has the tool 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.819
 to be able to measure that the first of penn 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.729
 state is that every technician should have a 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.860
 to see the uniformity of the mixture as well 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.440
 diet has nothing to do with 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.810
 nutritional theme but has a relationship 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.589
 very large production of milk from the 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.839
 cow 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:07.089
 the same diet the same diet as in the 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:08.409
 course has to be the one that 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:09.069
 is in the middle has to be the one that is 

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.349
 in the end 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:14.440
 after all, it was formulated to 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:18.080
 average production lot where we 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:48.809
 admits that all cows are the same 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:48.809
