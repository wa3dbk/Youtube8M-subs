00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.720
 hi let's learn how to install basins 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.720
 health 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.590
 we will now see the instructions for 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.560
 installation of sanitary basins with 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.300
 box coupled to eternit initially 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.980
 verify that the records are 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.829
 properly closed 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.079
 check your sewer exit point 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.570
 this distance from the wall to the center of the 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.850
 100mm tube should be between 30 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.430
 and 35 centimeters for this 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.430
 checks a line parallel to the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.670
 finished wall and with a check 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.070
 measure if it is not to the extent 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.940
 indicated must be done adjusting the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.160
 pipe 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.380
 this tube that will receive the box should 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.510
 level or a maximum of one 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.610
 centimeter above the floor 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.590
 the slope of the pipe on the floor should 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.329
 be at least 2% 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.700
 it is very important that all measures 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.130
 specified in our catalogs are 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.680
 followed by avoiding the disorders of work 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.130
 how to pour the dishes that will be applied 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.350
 you should also receive 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.469
 carefully on a soft surface to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.430
 turn the bowl outlet up you 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:20.229
 You can use a rubber mat 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.080
 locate the center and make the markings 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.350
 on the sides of the basin the markings 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.420
 basin must match 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.670
 perfectly positioned with chalk 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.040
 Removable wax or stylus 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.110
 marking of the attachment points through 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.330
 of the screw holes 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.479
 this marking shall coincide with the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.600
 marking the center of the tube removes basin 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.790
 and carefully check the floor 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.790
 with a 10 mm video drill 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.580
 which should be placed to make bushing 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.490
 silicone or grease 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.680
 caulk underneath and over the bag 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.659
 adjusting the conical pipe 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.710
 You can also use 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.570
 seal 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.810
 insert the taper 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.979
 basin in the sewage outlet of the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 position the basin over the holes with 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.489
 bushes and screw finish the finish 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.400
 with grout in the base of the installation part 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.349
 the coupled box box box 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.599
 discharge into the recess of the 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.690
 basin by meeting the openings 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.580
 for water flow and for anchorages all 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.440
 the parts for fixing the carton 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.470
 are enclosed in the carton 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.550
 float screws and 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.530
 download 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.050
 watch out to never leave the box 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.120
 leaning directly on the wall lets 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.710
 at least one centimeter apart 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.310
 for better accommodation 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.680
 tighten the screws evenly in 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.990
 the drive button and tighten the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.400
 door on the inside until it 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.320
 firm 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.750
 connect the flexible coupling to the 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.540
 the other end of the carton 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.070
 open the log to release your water 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.630
 bowl is ready for use 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.210
 the difference of the installation of a basin 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.790
 monoblock for conventional basins is 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.890
 only its attachment to the other base 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.230
 rules should be the same as basins 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.420
 with box coupled to the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.030
 basins that do not have an apparent siphon 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.580
 hiking calls will require 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.530
 a ratchet type switch on the models 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.310
 has sewage outlets facing the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.020
 wall 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.610
 an extension tube 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.740
 to the part 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.650
 after installed is due to the action of four 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.310
 inch or tapered pouch we apply this 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.140
 pipe 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.150
 eternit has a team of 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.850
