started<00:00:32.629> with<00:00:32.900> me<00:00:33.470> just<00:00:33.710> walking<00:00:34.070> through<00:00:34.100> a

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
started with me just walking through a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.369 
started with me just walking through a
Max's<00:00:34.970> house<00:00:35.150> with<00:00:35.390> my<00:00:35.510> little<00:00:35.750> notebook<00:00:35.989> and

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
Max's house with my little notebook and

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.750 
Max's house with my little notebook and
just<00:00:36.559> writing<00:00:36.890> down<00:00:36.920> what<00:00:37.400> was<00:00:37.580> going<00:00:37.730> to

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
just writing down what was going to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.790 
just writing down what was going to
happen<00:00:37.820> at<00:00:38.449> each<00:00:38.690> moment<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.230> then<00:00:39.290> we've

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
happen at each moment and then we've

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.460 
happen at each moment and then we've
drew<00:00:40.220> it<00:00:40.339> out<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.330> literally<00:00:41.930> drew<00:00:42.320> out<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
drew it out so I literally drew out the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.960 
drew it out so I literally drew out the
path<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:42.920> each<00:00:43.250> person<00:00:43.339> was<00:00:43.670> going<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.850> have

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
path that each person was going to have

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.930 
path that each person was going to have
to<00:00:44.000> take<00:00:44.239> because<00:00:44.540> once<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.710> camera<00:00:46.280> leaves<00:00:46.610> a

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
to take because once the camera leaves a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.119 
to take because once the camera leaves a
person<00:00:47.510> once<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.750> person<00:00:47.900> gets<00:00:48.079> off<00:00:48.350> frame<00:00:48.680> they

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
person once a person gets off frame they

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.040 
person once a person gets off frame they
literally<00:00:49.460> gotta<00:00:49.730> run<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.329> their<00:00:50.480> next<00:00:50.809> spot

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
literally gotta run to their next spot

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.490 
literally gotta run to their next spot
because<00:00:51.379> you<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:53.300> saw<00:00:53.539> them<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.020> then<00:00:54.320> you

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
because you just saw them and then you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.650 
because you just saw them and then you
see<00:00:54.710> them<00:00:54.829> five<00:00:55.100> seconds<00:00:55.489> later<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:55.969> it's

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
see them five seconds later and it's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.930 
see them five seconds later and it's
almost<00:00:57.199> impossible<00:00:57.559> but<00:00:58.250> it's<00:00:58.430> not<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:58.910> just

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
almost impossible but it's not and just

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.360 
almost impossible but it's not and just
writing<00:00:59.809> that<00:00:59.960> line<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.260> like<00:01:00.620> how<00:01:00.829> close<00:01:01.100> you

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
writing that line of like how close you

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.369 
writing that line of like how close you
can<00:01:01.489> get<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:02.000> seeming<00:01:02.420> impossible<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.260> do

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
can get to it seeming impossible to do

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.740 
can get to it seeming impossible to do
in<00:01:03.469> one<00:01:03.620> take<00:01:03.829> but<00:01:04.399> still<00:01:04.729> working<00:01:05.000> did<00:01:05.660> this

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
in one take but still working did this

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.090 
in one take but still working did this
feel<00:01:05.930> like<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.140> turning<00:01:06.380> point<00:01:06.440> video<00:01:06.770> for<00:01:07.009> you

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
feel like a turning point video for you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.310 
feel like a turning point video for you
and<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:07.280> were<00:01:07.369> making<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.789> when<00:01:08.750> we<00:01:09.200> are

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
and you were making it when we are

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.719 
and you were making it when we are
making<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:09.860> think<00:01:10.070> we<00:01:10.220> were<00:01:10.310> mostly<00:01:10.640> focused

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
making it I think we were mostly focused

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.240 
making it I think we were mostly focused
on<00:01:11.180> just<00:01:11.420> having<00:01:11.899> fun<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.560> also<00:01:12.920> making

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
on just having fun and also making

on just having fun and also making
something<00:01:13.460> cool<00:01:13.789> but<00:01:14.090> at<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.450> same<00:01:14.750> time<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.470> I

something cool but at the same time I I
did<00:01:16.460> believe<00:01:16.789> that<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:17.210> know<00:01:17.300> one<00:01:17.539> take

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
everyone is that person sometimes so how

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.389 
everyone is that person sometimes so how
many<00:02:02.990> takes<00:02:03.200> are<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.439> talking<00:02:03.740> about<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
many takes are we talking about the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.590 
many takes are we talking about the
thing<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.909> only<00:02:05.030> need<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.240> get<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.479> right

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
thing is you only need to get it right

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.560 
thing is you only need to get it right
once<00:02:05.869> though<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.820> every<00:02:07.820> take<00:02:08.060> before<00:02:08.239> that

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
once though so every take before that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.460 
once though so every take before that
someone<00:02:08.989> messed<00:02:09.229> up<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.679> three

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
someone messed up a three

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.860 
someone messed up a three
number<00:02:10.890> four<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:11.850> think<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.600> like<00:02:12.720> our

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
number four so I think this is like our

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.950 
number four so I think this is like our
fifth<00:02:13.260> take<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:14.160> fine<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.910> affecting<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
fifth take it's fine it's affecting you

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.840 
fifth take it's fine it's affecting you
almost<00:02:16.230> stop<00:02:16.500> thinking<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.310> terms<00:02:17.370> of

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
almost stop thinking of it in terms of

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.880 
almost stop thinking of it in terms of
number<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.690> takes<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.470> hours<00:02:19.860> that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
number of takes it's just the hours that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.310 
number of takes it's just the hours that
we've<00:02:20.220> been<00:02:20.400> filming<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.210> it's<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:22.050> well

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
we've been filming so it's like well

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.290 
we've been filming so it's like well
we've<00:02:22.560> been<00:02:22.710> filming<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.280> three<00:02:23.580> hours<00:02:23.610> I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
we've been filming for three hours I

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.030 
we've been filming for three hours I
don't<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.750> how<00:02:24.900> many<00:02:25.050> takes<00:02:25.320> we've<00:02:25.680> managed

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
don't know how many takes we've managed

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.060 
don't know how many takes we've managed
to<00:02:26.130> run<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.150> time<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:28.040> three<00:02:29.040> hours

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
to run and in that time but three hours

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.180 
to run and in that time but three hours
so<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.520> I'm<00:02:30.000> honestly<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.840> sure<00:02:31.020> master<00:02:31.950> gamer

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
so I I'm honestly not sure master gamer

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.300 
so I I'm honestly not sure master gamer

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109
