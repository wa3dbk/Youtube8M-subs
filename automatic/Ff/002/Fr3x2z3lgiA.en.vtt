HP com now we're going to go to two
places<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.570> find<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.229> answers<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
places to find all of our answers so the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
places to find all of our answers so the
first<00:01:38.460> thing<00:01:38.579> you're<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.360> you're

so<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.630> good<00:02:11.780> news<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.130> our<00:02:13.130> version<00:02:13.730> are<00:02:14.090> 32

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
so the good news is our version are 32

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.840 
so the good news is our version are 32
bit<00:02:14.780> operating<00:02:14.960> system<00:02:15.440> can<00:02:15.980> handle<00:02:16.250> four

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
bit operating system can handle four

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.300 
bit operating system can handle four
gigs<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.720> we're<00:02:17.900> good<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.080> go<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.950> side<00:02:19.280> note

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
gigs so we're good to go on a side note

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.750

if<00:02:19.880> you've<00:02:20.060> got<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.240> 64<00:02:20.930> bit<00:02:20.990> version<00:02:21.590> boom<00:02:22.490> you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
if you've got a 64 bit version boom you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.550 
if you've got a 64 bit version boom you
can<00:02:22.910> take<00:02:23.090> eight<00:02:23.270> gigs<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.840> make<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
can take eight gigs so make the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.310 
can take eight gigs so make the
adjustment<00:02:25.070> for<00:02:25.190> whatever<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.490> got<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:27.200> now

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
going to be able to support up to four

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.080 
going to be able to support up to four
gigs<00:03:14.780> on<00:03:14.989> our<00:03:15.170> 32-bit<00:03:15.769> pc<00:03:16.190> which<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:16.850> awesome

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
gigs on our 32-bit pc which is awesome

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.140 
gigs on our 32-bit pc which is awesome
so<00:03:17.720> we're<00:03:17.900> good<00:03:18.080> there<00:03:18.700> now<00:03:19.700> up<00:03:19.850> here<00:03:19.910> at<00:03:20.120> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
so we're good there now up here at the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.030 
so we're good there now up here at the
top<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.750> says<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.350> supports<00:03:21.739> dual

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
top it says that it supports dual

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.350 
top it says that it supports dual
channel<00:03:22.459> mode<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:22.910> we're<00:03:23.000> going<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.209> want<00:03:23.299> to

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
channel mode so we're going to want to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.060 
channel mode so we're going to want to
take<00:03:23.480> advantage<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.410> install

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
take advantage of that and install

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.000 
take advantage of that and install
impairs<00:03:26.030> now<00:03:26.720> right<00:03:26.900> below<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.470> say<00:03:27.769> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
impairs now right below that and say and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.740 
impairs now right below that and say and
lets<00:03:28.160> us<00:03:28.280> know<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.489> they've<00:03:28.730> got<00:03:28.910> four<00:03:29.239> slots

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
lets us know that they've got four slots

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.140 
lets us know that they've got four slots
in<00:03:29.989> there<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:31.310> way<00:03:31.519> we<00:03:31.549> can<00:03:31.700> actually<00:03:31.970> use

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
in there so this way we can actually use

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.170 
in there so this way we can actually use
to<00:03:32.750> two<00:03:33.320> gig<00:03:33.620> modules<00:03:34.070> if<00:03:34.190> we<00:03:34.310> want<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.940> we<00:03:35.060> can

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
to two gig modules if we want so we can

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.420 
to two gig modules if we want so we can
go<00:03:35.269> either<00:03:35.450> way<00:03:35.570> we<00:03:35.840> can<00:03:35.959> do<00:03:36.110> for<00:03:36.920> one<00:03:37.250> gig

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
go either way we can do for one gig

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.180 
go either way we can do for one gig
modules<00:03:37.880> or<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.390> two<00:03:38.720> gig<00:03:38.959> modules<00:03:39.410> now<00:03:39.830> I

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
modules or to two gig modules now I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.640 
modules or to two gig modules now I
recommend<00:03:41.060> do<00:03:41.330> whatever<00:03:41.600> one<00:03:42.110> you<00:03:42.320> can<00:03:42.530> get

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
recommend do whatever one you can get

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740
