boys a gorman body over it and it's a
double<00:00:50.010> air<00:00:50.190> wash<00:00:50.579> system<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.180> as<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.329> air<00:00:54.480> wash

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
double air wash system so as an air wash

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
double air wash system so as an air wash
system<00:00:55.379> at<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.559> front<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> another<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.520> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
system at the front and another one on

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.130 
system at the front and another one on
the<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.239> basically<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> does<00:00:57.930> is

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the back and basically what it does is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
the back and basically what it does is
it<00:00:58.289> burns<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.859> efficiently<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.609> don't

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it burns more efficiently so you don't

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.260 
it burns more efficiently so you don't
carry<00:01:00.090> smoke<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.469> smoke<00:01:01.649> anyway

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
carry smoke or not as much smoke anyway

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
carry smoke or not as much smoke anyway
