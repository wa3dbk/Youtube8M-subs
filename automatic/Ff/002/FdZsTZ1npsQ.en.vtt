00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
because I basically just started from

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.419 
because I basically just started from
scratch<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.410> redid<00:00:07.799> my<00:00:07.830> whole<00:00:08.160> thing<00:00:09.080> because

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
scratch and redid my whole thing because

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.230

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
there's too many Hydra balls in there so

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.080 
there's too many Hydra balls in there so
I<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.710> said<00:00:20.070> pluck<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.490> took<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:20.880> all

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.560 
I just said pluck it and took out all
the<00:00:21.240> Hydra<00:00:21.570> balls<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.109> made<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> false<00:00:23.189> bottom

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.380 
little fish in there moss ball and then
it<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.050> kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> molding<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.700> cut<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> all

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it was kind of molding like I cut it all

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
it was kind of molding like I cut it all
off<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.230> stuff<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.700> molding<00:00:51.090> down

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
off and stuff but it was molding down

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.520 
off and stuff but it was molding down
here<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.199> sitting<00:00:52.320> in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
here because it was just sitting in

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.430 
here because it was just sitting in
water<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.539> guess<00:00:54.539> that's<00:00:54.780> why<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> don't<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
water I guess that's why I don't know it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
water I guess that's why I don't know it
was<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.710> white<00:00:55.949> stringy<00:00:56.550> mold<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.420> was

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
really gross but I cut it off and it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
really gross but I cut it off and it
fits<00:01:03.449> perfect<00:01:05.750> if<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:08.100> know

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
platform thing I'm gonna do is either

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.719 
platform thing I'm gonna do is either
have<00:04:28.699> them<00:04:28.820> creep<00:04:29.030> up<00:04:29.240> this<00:04:29.599> would<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:31.610> know

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
here I might plant the other end theorem

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.779 
here I might plant the other end theorem
somewhere<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.520> don't<00:04:52.699> know<00:04:52.880> where<00:04:52.970> yet<00:04:53.860> but<00:04:54.860> off
