going to taut the area I'm going to
slide<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.210> we're<00:00:24.900> gonna<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.320> how<00:00:25.410> deep

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
slide in and we're gonna see how deep

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.620 
slide in and we're gonna see how deep
these<00:00:25.920> follicles<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.060> sexual

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
a little deeper a lot of times I might

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
a little deeper a lot of times I might
have<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.710> adjust<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:41.280> machine<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:41.969> we're

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
resistant to pull it comes right out so

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.140 
resistant to pull it comes right out so
i<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.619> move<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.490> area<00:01:41.880> because

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
i can really move on this area because

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330
