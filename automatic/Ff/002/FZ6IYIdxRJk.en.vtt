00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.260 
abnormal thing are these bows these
normally<00:01:39.950> would<00:01:40.070> be<00:01:40.160> hanging<00:01:40.430> up<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:40.820> her<00:01:40.880> wall

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
normally would be hanging up on her wall

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.140 
normally would be hanging up on her wall
but<00:01:41.960> she<00:01:41.990> has<00:01:42.500> been<00:01:42.890> taking<00:01:43.430> them<00:01:43.610> down<00:01:43.850> and

but she has been taking them down and

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.420 
but she has been taking them down and
pulling<00:01:44.480> them<00:01:44.600> apart<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.770> have<00:01:45.980> taken<00:01:46.340> these

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430

kinda see that this is kind of just more

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.930 
kinda see that this is kind of just more
of<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.530> storage<00:02:45.800> closet<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
of a storage closet but this is the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.540 
of a storage closet but this is the
other<00:02:46.970> closet<00:02:47.830> isabella<00:02:48.830> has<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.190> her<00:02:49.280> room

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
other closet isabella has in her room

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.699 
other closet isabella has in her room
and<00:02:49.910> i<00:02:50.810> think<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.200> would<00:02:51.380> be<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.500> super

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
and i think that this would be a super

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.770 
and i think that this would be a super
functional<00:02:52.130> closet<00:02:52.670> especially<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.330> as<00:02:53.570> she

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
functional closet especially like as she

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.660 
functional closet especially like as she
gets<00:02:53.930> older<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.890> she<00:02:55.100> could<00:02:55.220> use<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.459> for

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
gets older like she could use this for

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.250 
gets older like she could use this for
games<00:02:55.850> toys<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.630> sort<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.959> thing<00:02:57.140> which

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
games toys and that sort of thing which

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.470 
games toys and that sort of thing which
is<00:02:57.380> my<00:02:57.500> eventual<00:02:57.769> plan<00:02:58.160> for<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:59.330> for

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
is my eventual plan for this but for

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.729 
is my eventual plan for this but for
right<00:02:59.600> now<00:02:59.660> it's<00:02:59.989> kind<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.290> extra

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739
