00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
runners let go down here that's

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.990 
runners let go down here that's
basically<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.309> tray

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
basically your tray

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
basically your tray
these<00:01:03.899> trays<00:01:04.199> fit<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
these trays fit right here like this so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.520 
these trays fit right here like this so
I'm<00:01:07.020> gonna<00:01:07.170> cut<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.939> outside<00:01:08.939> edge<00:01:09.530> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I'm gonna cut on the outside edge of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.109 
I'm gonna cut on the outside edge of
these<00:01:10.740> two<00:01:10.979> pieces<00:01:11.720> I'll<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.140> trays

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
these two pieces I'll have these trays

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.450 
these two pieces I'll have these trays
so<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.320> vent<00:01:16.320> hole<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> good<00:01:17.040> place<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so the vent hole is a good place to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
so the vent hole is a good place to
start<00:01:18.049> right<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> says<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> vent

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
start right where it says to have a vent

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
start right where it says to have a vent
hole<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.820> would<00:01:21.360> stick<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.900> tin<00:01:22.290> snips<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.920> some

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
hole I would stick in tin snips or some

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.030 
hole I would stick in tin snips or some
really<00:01:23.640> sharp<00:01:23.909> scissors<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
really sharp scissors and just do a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
really sharp scissors and just do a
general<00:01:26.400> cut<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.060> clean<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.630> up

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
general cut you can clean this up

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
general cut you can clean this up
afterwards<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
afterwards right now you just get a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.440 
afterwards right now you just get a
general<00:01:30.180> cut<00:01:30.740> along<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.979> edge

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
general cut along this edge

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.770 
general cut along this edge
all<00:01:34.450> around<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.700> amazed<00:01:40.030> how<00:01:40.270> soon<00:01:40.570> you'll

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
have accumulated a whole bunch of useful

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.740 
have accumulated a whole bunch of useful
trays<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.580> won't<00:01:46.120> know<00:01:46.240> how<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:46.450> lived

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
trays that you won't know how you lived

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.140 
trays that you won't know how you lived
without<00:01:46.900> them<00:01:47.290> once<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.680> start<00:01:47.920> using<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:54.150> use

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
without them once you start using I use

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.480 
without them once you start using I use
the<00:01:55.330> trays<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.600> lot<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.050> times<00:01:56.260> for<00:01:56.560> casting<00:01:57.190> my

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
the trays a lot of times for casting my

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.450 
the trays a lot of times for casting my
resin<00:01:58.420> toys<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:59.110> urethane<00:01:59.410> resin<00:01:59.800> doesn't

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
resin toys the urethane resin doesn't

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.310 
resin toys the urethane resin doesn't
stick<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.060> HDPE<00:02:01.900> plastic<00:02:03.930> high<00:02:04.930> density

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
stick to the HDPE plastic high density

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.840 
stick to the HDPE plastic high density
polyethylene<00:02:05.650> that's<00:02:06.160> some<00:02:06.310> quality<00:02:06.790> stuff

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
polyethylene that's some quality stuff

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.700 
polyethylene that's some quality stuff
so<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.420> want<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:07.720> use<00:02:07.900> these<00:02:08.110> things<00:02:08.380> and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
so you want to use these things and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.150 
so you want to use these things and
recycle<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.470> still<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.890> useful

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
recycle so this is still a useful

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.740 
recycle so this is still a useful

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.610 

area<00:03:04.620> all<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.650> way<00:03:05.739> around

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
area all the way around

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.360 
area all the way around
once<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.799> get<00:03:09.099> them<00:03:09.220> away<00:03:09.549> from<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:14.370> now

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
once I get them away from that now

there's<00:03:16.180> only<00:03:16.269> one<00:03:16.540> handle<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.519> I'm<00:03:18.610> going<00:03:18.849> to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
there's only one handle so I'm going to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:40.410 
there's only one handle so I'm going to
just<00:03:19.750> cut<00:03:22.260> around<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:25.360> handle<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.239> you

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
just cut around this handle and this you

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.059 
just cut around this handle and this you
can<00:03:40.540> just<00:03:40.569> see<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.019> seam<00:03:41.260> line<00:03:41.560> right<00:03:41.829> there

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
can just see the seam line right there

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:52.920 
can just see the seam line right there
it's<00:03:42.250> already<00:03:42.489> there<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:52.540> it

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
it's already there so this is it

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.380 
it's already there so this is it
and<00:03:53.230> they're<00:03:53.349> still<00:03:53.500> kind<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.799> ugly<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.359> you

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
and they're still kind of ugly so you

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.780 
and they're still kind of ugly so you
can<00:03:55.569> clean<00:03:55.780> them<00:03:55.900> up<00:03:56.079> just<00:03:56.379> clean<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.709> edge<00:03:56.859> so

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
can clean them up just clean the edge so

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.210 
can clean them up just clean the edge so
it's<00:03:58.000> more<00:03:58.209> of<00:03:58.359> a<00:03:59.280> perfect<00:04:00.280> edge<00:04:00.430> for<00:04:02.220> using

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
it's more of a perfect edge for using

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.309 
it's more of a perfect edge for using
around<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.549> shop<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.810> that's<00:04:08.049> all<00:04:08.169> I<00:04:08.200> really

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
do just make us better edge now that

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.890 
do just make us better edge now that
I've<00:04:12.040> got<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.090> struggle<00:04:13.510> with<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.720> whole

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900
