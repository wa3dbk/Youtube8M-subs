read the words on the screen so I
thought<00:00:51.210> I'd<00:00:51.329> make<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> quick<00:00:51.780> HD<00:00:52.590> version<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
thought I'd make a quick HD version of a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.770 
thought I'd make a quick HD version of a
simple<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.879> show<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> how<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
simple way to show you how to do this so

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
simple way to show you how to do this so
from<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.280> almost<00:00:56.879> all

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
from here you're going to go almost all

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
from here you're going to go almost all
the<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> bottom<00:00:58.430> second<00:00:59.430> from

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the way down to the bottom second from

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
the way down to the bottom second from
the<00:00:59.640> bottom<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.059> system<00:01:00.449> information<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the bottom is system information and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.869 
the bottom is system information and
that<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.649> show<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.370> IP<00:01:02.640> address

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
