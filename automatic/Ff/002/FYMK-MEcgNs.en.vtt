00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
the people in the UK it doesn't come

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.330 
the people in the UK it doesn't come
with<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.220> universal<00:00:44.060> plug<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:45.470> you<00:00:46.100> have<00:00:46.220> to

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
with the universal plug so you have to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.730 
with the universal plug so you have to
go<00:00:46.460> out<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:46.790> find<00:00:47.210> one<00:00:47.450> I'm<00:00:47.960> pretty<00:00:48.170> sure<00:00:48.320> this

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
go out and find one I'm pretty sure this

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.520

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
is one that you use for shavers and then

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.000 
is one that you use for shavers and then
you<00:00:51.620> just<00:00:51.800> pop<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.040> in<00:00:52.310> like<00:00:52.490> that<00:00:53.980> like<00:00:54.980> that

you just pop that in like that like that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.950 
you just pop that in like that like that
and<00:00:55.400> then<00:00:55.490> you<00:00:55.550> can<00:00:55.730> use<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:56.540> with<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.750> hand

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
to set their Sun setup it didn't work

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.370 
to set their Sun setup it didn't work
when<00:01:17.539> it<00:01:17.630> first<00:01:17.840> comes<00:01:19.539> it<00:01:20.539> just<00:01:20.780> does<00:01:20.990> like

an<00:01:37.670> R<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.149> s<00:01:38.329> there<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.139> to<00:01:39.200> undo<00:01:39.829> each<00:01:40.009> you

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
an R and s there so to undo each you

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.379 
an R and s there so to undo each you
slide<00:01:41.179> it<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.539> AR<00:01:42.609> put<00:01:43.609> your<00:01:43.759> drill<00:01:43.969> bit<00:01:43.999> in

slide it to the AR put your drill bit in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.840 
slide it to the AR put your drill bit in
and<00:01:44.659> then<00:01:45.350> do<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.920> S<00:01:46.069> and<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.700> won't

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
and then do it to the S and that won't

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.599 
and then do it to the S and that won't
come<00:01:47.060> out<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.959> same<00:01:48.229> due<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.100> R<00:01:49.249> and

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
come out and the same due to the R and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.309 
come out and the same due to the R and
then<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.060> can<00:01:50.240> change<00:01:50.539> him<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.689> this<00:01:53.869> tripod
