00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
what I'm trying to I'm probably

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
what I'm trying to I'm probably
confusing<00:01:40.950> myself<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.520> confusing<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
confusing myself and confusing you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.090

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
trying to explain it but I couldn't

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
trying to explain it but I couldn't
figure<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> zipper<00:01:48.000> was<00:01:48.240> supposed<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
figure out if the zipper was supposed to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.530 
figure out if the zipper was supposed to
go<00:01:49.170> from<00:01:49.409> left<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> right<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.299> left

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
go from left to right or right to left

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.380 
go from left to right or right to left
so<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> only<00:01:56.790> reason<00:01:56.880> why<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> was

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
so the and the only reason why I was

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.760 
so the and the only reason why I was
thinking<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.719> was<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.290> wasn't<00:01:58.469> sure

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
thinking that was because I wasn't sure

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.569 
thinking that was because I wasn't sure
what<00:01:59.280> side<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.030> embellish<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:02.040> long<00:02:02.340> story

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
what side to embellish it so long story

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.179 
what side to embellish it so long story
short<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.270> embellish<00:02:03.810> both<00:02:04.140> sides<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:05.159> just

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
short I embellish both sides not just

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.119 
short I embellish both sides not just
one<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.509> either<00:02:07.049> way<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.409> look<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> bag

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
