already this potion a scimitar comes and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.940 
already this potion a scimitar comes and
I<00:05:06.130> kept<00:05:06.580> its<00:05:07.180> potion<00:05:09.660> as<00:05:10.660> its<00:05:11.320> original

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
I kept its potion as its original

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.460 
I kept its potion as its original
beverage<00:05:12.640> geometry<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:14.400> when<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:16.060> feather

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
beverage geometry and when the feather

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:25.469 
beverage geometry and when the feather
sticking<00:05:18.180> came<00:05:19.180> here<00:05:19.600> I<00:05:21.900> felt<00:05:22.900> odd<00:05:23.410> motion<00:05:24.479> to

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
sticking came here I felt odd motion to

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:32.940 
sticking came here I felt odd motion to
this<00:05:25.660> edge<00:05:26.020> so<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:29.110> decided<00:05:29.950> to<00:05:30.790> do<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:32.440> this

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
this edge so I decided to do to this

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.170 
this edge so I decided to do to this
fourth<00:05:33.720> pattern

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
fourth pattern

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.670 
fourth pattern
anyway<00:05:37.560> if<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.620> have<00:05:39.419> 400<00:05:40.419> chaucer<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:40.990> stone

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
anyway if you have 400 chaucer a stone

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:50.040 
anyway if you have 400 chaucer a stone
and<00:05:42.000> you<00:05:43.229> are<00:05:44.229> a<00:05:45.120> hunter<00:05:46.120> and<00:05:46.600> a<00:05:47.020> bushcraft<00:05:49.050> as

and you are a hunter and a bushcraft as

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.940 
and you are a hunter and a bushcraft as
well<00:05:52.020> this<00:05:53.020> geometry<00:05:53.380> is<00:05:55.140> best<00:05:56.140> in<00:05:56.500> my<00:05:56.770> opinion

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.090

feather sticks easy to ignite and

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.790 
feather sticks easy to ignite and
already<00:06:14.200> downside<00:06:14.770> is<00:06:15.990> for<00:06:16.990> splitting<00:06:17.500> wood

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
already downside is for splitting wood

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.260 
already downside is for splitting wood
it<00:06:18.640> is<00:06:18.700> fun<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.450> going<00:06:21.030> left

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
it is fun to going left

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.230 
it is fun to going left
yes<00:06:22.450> right<00:06:23.260> side<00:06:23.620> takes<00:06:24.039> strong<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.610> resistance

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
yes right side takes strong a resistance

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.520 
yes right side takes strong a resistance
from<00:06:25.510> the<00:06:25.690> wood<00:06:25.919> but<00:06:27.690> it<00:06:28.690> is<00:06:28.930> negligible<00:06:30.120> only

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
from the wood but it is negligible only

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.360 
from the wood but it is negligible only
in<00:06:32.530> making<00:06:33.220> very<00:06:34.080> thin<00:06:35.610> sticks

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
in making very thin sticks

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:44.010 
in making very thin sticks
it<00:06:37.970> can<00:06:38.510> appear<00:06:40.060> to<00:06:41.060> unite<00:06:42.280> easily<00:06:43.280> like

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
it can appear to unite easily like

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.219 
it can appear to unite easily like
chopsticks<00:06:45.020> or<00:06:45.320> such<00:06:45.650> very<00:06:46.460> thing<00:06:47.229> would
