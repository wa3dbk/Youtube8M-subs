00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
time I know that I can think of that a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
literally following what she does and I
think<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.920> fascinating<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> know

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
think that's so fascinating but you know

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
think that's so fascinating but you know
she's<00:01:39.090> she's<00:01:39.689> taking<00:01:40.110> heat<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> price

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
she's she's taking heat for the price

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.630 
she's she's taking heat for the price
points<00:01:41.189> too

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
points too

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.370 
points too
on<00:01:41.729> things<00:01:42.030> well<00:01:42.360> she's<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:42.750> taking<00:01:43.170> heat

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
on things well she's also taking heat

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
on things well she's also taking heat
for<00:01:43.530> some<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> design<00:01:44.250> fashion<00:01:44.939> choices

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
for some of the design fashion choices

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.819 
for some of the design fashion choices
that<00:01:45.689> she's<00:01:45.840> made<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.619> that's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
that she's made and I think it's that's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.160 
that she's made and I think it's that's
quite<00:01:47.100> interesting<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:47.640> people<00:01:48.000> who<00:01:48.780> are

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
quite interesting because people who are

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649 
quite interesting because people who are
celebrating<00:01:49.829> her<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.820> wonderful<00:01:51.329> new

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
celebrating her for this wonderful new

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.499 
celebrating her for this wonderful new
style<00:01:52.140> iconography<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.340> also<00:01:53.759> asking<00:01:54.180> her<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
style iconography are also asking her to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.090 
style iconography are also asking her to
be<00:01:54.689> an<00:01:54.899> icon<00:01:55.290> enough<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> way<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> don't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
be an icon enough a way that I don't

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.980 
be an icon enough a way that I don't
think<00:01:56.340> she<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.000> interested<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.780> being

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
think she really is interested in being

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.100 
think she really is interested in being
one<00:01:58.290> she<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:58.890> much<00:01:59.820> more<00:02:00.090> democratic<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.840> think

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
one she is much more democratic I think

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
one she is much more democratic I think
in<00:02:01.340> believing<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> should<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> matter

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
in believing that it should be a matter

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.850 
in believing that it should be a matter
of<00:02:03.180> choice<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:03.869> shouldn't<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.619> must

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
of choice so there shouldn't be you must

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.429 
of choice so there shouldn't be you must
do<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.700> must<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> you

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
do this and you must not do this and you

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.290 
do this and you must not do this and you
know<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.520> Oscar<00:02:08.819> de<00:02:08.910> la<00:02:08.940> Renta
