00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello everyone, I have a video answer today 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.580
 about water 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.639
 ask me how much water should i drink 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.799
 during the day I think you need to drink 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.139
 as much as the girl wants to write 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.000
 that at some point it occurred 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 the restructuring has come to be a lot of water 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 for him and a half liters per day at the very 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.300
 It was a little bit of a time when I was 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.310
 worked night i remember hair three 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.279
 liter bottle of water I drink everything 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.239
 tasks for me it was like this 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 I wanted to finish and she squeezed me here 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.829
 I wanted to here when thirst is announced 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.930
 what people say you can't drink during 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.629
 workout again way to workout up 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.670
 I believe that training is before the fair 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.550
 I think you should drink so much 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.950
 how much do you want to drink at that moment 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.480
 when you want when you drink you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.340
 really make up 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 enough and carry especially during 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.620
 training wasted resources during 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.680
 of what you were doing before maybe you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.460
 want to drink they have you need 25 thousand 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460
 good lush 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.189
 mankiewicz have your body asks for water 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.070
 look in this book described 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.200
 why does your body need water that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.100
 was performed by to 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:25.030
 waste it at the expense of water 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.030
 Considering the fact that we are 80 percent 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.759
 simple at 8 we create from water this 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.319
 mean we really need a lot 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.390
 water so i think what is the way 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.229
 tells batman health what's needed 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.310
 do twists today juicy kid 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.440
 this is bad need to drink water 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.970
 as much as you want at the same time as 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.750
 you have to do it you have to yourself 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.720
 teach you have to adjust yourself to this 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.429
 you should try for example 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.799
 try to drink more water 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.390
 try turning on more almost 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.149
 glasses of water at what you should not 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.569
 take that tea from the lessons water turns out 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.000
 throwing coffee at the water drops it is not water 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.550
 this is the substance of the boat there is juice 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.430
 contains preservatives stabilizers 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.590
 dyes flange or sugar substitute 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.950
 which you will then dilute with water 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.010
 you will need to drink water after this 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.519
 coffee is the same coffee very much 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.470
 causes drying i really am very 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.140
 just want a coffee queen sense 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.000
 love and because i am the same on 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.400
 in fact you pay attention to this 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.769
 you must study your body itself 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.840
 also like in everything you do 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.120
 must learn what you need 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.190
 he wants your body your body 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.810
 listen to learn what 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.390
 want like this for you 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.060
 try to add water in the morning stand 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.920
 you kill a glass of water and exactly you ate 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.750
 but on time or considered to drink water 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.330
 it is impossible to do any liquid at all 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.239
 took meals they are not needed 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.730
 body when you drink water drink 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.549
 drink some kind of juice fruit drinks 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.709
 but it is not at all helpful i suggest you 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.360
 general study what you eat 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.720
 I want to have such a day 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.209
 just write such an article 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.430
 the product and all the substances that are here 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.329
 see the internet what they mean 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.430
 what value do they bring to 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.650
 the body as they are useful as 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.599
 no way there is any composition 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.430
 really liked that gazelle I think that 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:36.610
 so do see what you drink 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:43.940
 what do you eat at all because water and that 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 what do they do doing sports young 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.450
 athlete and therefore continue the city 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.519
 beat out of the glass okay then eat 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.739
 you don't you don't drink water when you 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.829
 diluted with any liquids that 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.349
 you decide to dilute your meal this 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.700
 Means you change acidity 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.379
 gastric juice the more you fill 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.720
 liquids especially for example water would 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.099
 add the most cool thing in principle 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.019
 to open tea with it juice you 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.180
 diluted this food turns out that you 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.959
 acidity changes and food is not 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.700
 the pass 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.280
 not digested in such a way that 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.860
 need is obtained in order to 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.419
 gastric juice digested this food to him 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.090
 need to increase the acidity of it 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.540
 it turns out you are indexed development 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.910
 ulcers and gastritis when to improve by rays 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.620
 juice and then about digest your 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.020
 the stomach itself think about it 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.090
 look follow track and this 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.419
 feel a sense of still orgy 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.370
 after taking forgives him maybe 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.620
 then drink water between meals 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.790
 Duster can drink water through 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 hour and a half hours after eating 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.900
 individual children water is saturated with water until 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.250
 Reception training sometimes will during 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.840
