other<00:01:01.450> Samper<00:01:02.450> air<00:01:02.650> just<00:01:03.650> mainly<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.220> actually

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
other Samper air just mainly to actually

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.520 
other Samper air just mainly to actually
help<00:01:04.850> yourself<00:01:05.479> with<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.960> pressure<00:01:06.229> to

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
help yourself with the pressure to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.469 
help yourself with the pressure to
report<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.040> more<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.369> pressure<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.970> your

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
report it more the pressure of your

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.389 
report it more the pressure of your
sample<00:01:08.930> also<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.500> be<00:01:09.710> able<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.100> have<00:01:10.220> more

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
sample also to be able to have more

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.840 
sample also to be able to have more
parents<00:01:10.850> with<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.119> shifter<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.200> remote

know that on all the new grids now you
have<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> plastic<00:01:18.680> shell<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.430> providing

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
have a plastic shell that is providing

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.240 
have a plastic shell that is providing
you<00:01:20.180> all<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.140> Olding

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
you all the Olding

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.580 
you all the Olding
when<00:01:22.760> it<00:01:22.909> rains<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.510> grip<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:23.900> not<00:01:23.930> sliding<00:01:24.350> on

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
when it rains the grip is not sliding on

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.590 
when it rains the grip is not sliding on
the<00:01:24.710> bar<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.130> this<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.850> providing<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.390> lot<00:01:26.420> of

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
the bar and this is providing a lot of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.570 
the bar and this is providing a lot of
vibration<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.320> hand<00:01:27.560> what<00:01:28.159> we've<00:01:28.370> done

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
vibration in the hand what we've done

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.800 
vibration in the hand what we've done
with<00:01:28.820> their<00:01:29.060> gun<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.540> we<00:01:29.690> actually

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
with their gun is that we actually

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.830 
with their gun is that we actually
competative<00:01:30.590> cut<00:01:31.280> out<00:01:31.520> into<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.970> shell<00:01:32.240> that

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
competative cut out into the shell that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.200 
competative cut out into the shell that
is<00:01:33.110> actually<00:01:33.680> providing<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> lot<00:01:34.970> more

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
comfort where the pressure of the hand

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.670 
comfort where the pressure of the hand
is<00:01:37.220> this<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.150> protecting<00:01:38.780> actually<00:01:39.409> grip

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
is this is protecting actually grip

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.830 
is this is protecting actually grip
comfort<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.580> support<00:01:40.970> when<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.540> have<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.690> lot
