with<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.450> jointer<00:01:42.750> plane<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.890> switch

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
with your jointer plane you can switch

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.179 
with your jointer plane you can switch
over<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.640> smoothing<00:01:45.360> plane<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.409> make<00:01:46.590> your

of your board all right now here's a tip
from<00:01:57.390> Frank<00:01:57.689> clouds<00:01:57.930> steady<00:01:58.229> Tolman<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.070> today

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
from Frank clouds steady Tolman so today

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.389 
from Frank clouds steady Tolman so today
you<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> two<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:00.810> two<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.649> one

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you get like a two for one two or one

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
you get like a two for one two or one
before<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.060> done<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.600> make<00:02:04.110> three

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
before you're done with this make three

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.969 
before you're done with this make three
more<00:02:04.590> passes<00:02:05.219> you're<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.790> want<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.270> one

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
more passes you're gonna want to do one

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.430 
more passes you're gonna want to do one
two<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.910> three<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.479> full<00:02:09.720> length<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
two and then three the full length the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.900 
two and then three the full length the
reason<00:02:10.770> before<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
reason before that is you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.300 
reason before that is you
this<00:02:12.180> dished<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:13.140> little<00:02:13.410> bit<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.220> you

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
this dished a little bit so when you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.490 
this dished a little bit so when you
join<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> together<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.900> got<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.080> little<00:02:16.290> bit<00:02:16.410> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
join it together you got a little bit of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.040 
join it together you got a little bit of
spring<00:02:16.950> pressure<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:17.750> ends<00:02:18.750> because

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
spring pressure up here ends because

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.660 
spring pressure up here ends because
that's<00:02:19.230> typically<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.830> what's<00:02:20.250> gonna<00:02:20.400> want<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
when I run my hand plane I can never

when I run my hand plane I can never
seem<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.400> keep<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.790> perfectly<00:02:36.000> straight<00:02:36.360> I've

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
seem to keep it perfectly straight I've

seem to keep it perfectly straight I've
seen<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> angle<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.770> our<00:02:37.920> tipping<00:02:38.360> points

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540

again let's say this was my board I was

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.480 
again let's say this was my board I was
planing<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.400> was<00:02:59.640> this<00:03:00.120> far<00:03:00.180> off<00:03:01.160> as<00:03:02.160> long

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
planing and I was this far off as long

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.330 
planing and I was this far off as long
as<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:02.820> marked<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.270> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.870> outside<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.620> B<00:03:05.100> on

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
as it's marked a on the outside and B on

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.480 
as it's marked a on the outside and B on
the<00:03:05.370> outside<00:03:06.110> when<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.140> bring<00:03:07.470> my<00:03:07.530> boards<00:03:08.190> back

the outside when I bring my boards back

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.420 
the outside when I bring my boards back
together<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.560> angle<00:03:10.890> doesn't<00:03:11.220> matter

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
together the angle doesn't matter

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.530
