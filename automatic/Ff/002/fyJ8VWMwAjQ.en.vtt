00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.730
 hi friends this time we are going to 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.000
 make a princess design of hearts 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.880
 which is going to carry five little hearts 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.070
 in this part some little ones here and 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.020
 we can do it well with the technique 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.880
 that I taught them about hearts with 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.950
 the philbert brush or we can 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.980
 do it with a stencil like this one that 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.450
 previously I did when I started with 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.700
 just with those of the wolf that are the 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.410
 pintacaritas and good is very practical 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.809
 sometimes to do this kind of design 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.010
 the stencil I did it very 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.350
 simple 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.210
 paint the hearts first with what 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.220
 It is an eyeliner on my child's forehead 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.620
 when I was just starting for more or 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.420
 least have the size and then local 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.980
 that here in what is the plastic this 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.290
 that I showed you in the video of the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.020
 stencils and well then now nothing 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.500
 more I'm going to put it this way I'm going to 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.579
 preload my sponge with what 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.409
 it's red paint is more hoop 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.229
 and now let's place what is the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.600
 stencil in this way checking that the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.330
 hearts are well aligned and now 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.619
 nothing else with our sponge we are going to 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.619
 put the painting like this 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.690
 and good look at what bonito 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.000
 aligns the ones already left in this way and 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.120
 a very fast way good so what 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.880
 follow now is let's put with the 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.370
 white paint if you have these wands 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.710
 of dowries because they can use them or if not 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.170
 with the same brush they can make two 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 circles that go in this part 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 now with our sponge with a 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.130
 sponge apart let's put so much 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.090
 pink paint to put a little on 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.090
 what are the cheeks 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.410
 and we are going to put a little here in what 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.410
 what are the eyelids 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.040
 no return 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.620
 and now it is becoming our 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.710
 brush of number 4 let's take what 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.320
 it's so much white paint 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.120
 we load very well like that to do what 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.420
 are the chinitos in this part of the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.420
 eyes 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.920
 and here we are going to do like a little heart 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.920
 A) Yes 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.770
 and we do exactly the same thing about the other 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.100
 side 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.100
 ah 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.250
 in this aspect 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.050
 and good we will have left something like this already 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.510
 nothing else now let's put some 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.159
 details is what it is 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.640
 this part here we are going to put some 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:11.550
 dots to take advantage of what is the 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.670
 white paint 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.380
 here we are going to put other 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.590
 little dots in this space that we had left 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.590
 here 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.470
 and here we are going to put 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.470
 some tips 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.870
 or just a few lines in this part 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.870
 so that you see something like that 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.380
 and well now we're just going to 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.270
 delineate what red hearts are 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.110
 here we can make you three stones 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.910
 To make it look 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.910
 more beautiful our design 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.080
 now we are going to delineate again what 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.840
 are this in this part we are going to put you 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.430
 a little detail of red too but before 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.300
 we can give a little light to the 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.300
 hearts like that 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.240
 with a white hairline 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.270
 and well we load our color brush 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.040
 Red 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.720
 to give a touch to what are the 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.020
 chinitos in this part and that you see 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.020
 best 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.450
 and good and nothing else we lack the touch 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.450
 final that is to paint the lips 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.270
 with a little red 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.690
 and well look, we've already been 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.390
 finished what is our design of 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.590
 princess of hearts 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.260
 Well, I hope this design has 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.760
 I like it very practical and we 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.880
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.880
 then
