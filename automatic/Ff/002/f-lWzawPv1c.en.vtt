00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
several grams of weight and it's a temp

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.160 
several grams of weight and it's a temp
sexed<00:01:05.729> female<00:01:06.740> which<00:01:07.740> means<00:01:08.960> according<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
sexed female which means according to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.370 
sexed female which means according to
the<00:01:10.380> temperature<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> UH<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.049> eggs

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the temperature of the UH that the eggs

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.710 
the temperature of the UH that the eggs
are<00:01:16.590> incubated<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:17.340> determines<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> sex<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720

are incubated at determines the sex of
the<00:01:18.830> tortoise<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.189> hopefully<00:01:20.759> she<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
