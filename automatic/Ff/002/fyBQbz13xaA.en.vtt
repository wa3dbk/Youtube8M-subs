00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:07.420
 good games today I want to teach you to 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.179
 make this retro cd card with the 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.250
 pop up technique is super easy to 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.140
 do 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.140
 and you will need very few materials 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.710
 a cardboard of 37 centimeters x 15 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.520
 centimeters high 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.510
 the rule 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.080
 pencil 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.029
 scissors optional ccoo paper that what 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 you can download from the website security 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.870
 dot com 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.920
 and a CD that you can paint in black 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.920
 as I have done 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.690
 we will take the cardboard and on the side of 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.789
 37 centimeters 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.500
 we will make a mark at 7 centimeters 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.850
 we will do the same on the opposite side 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.920
 then we will join these marks 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.920
 and we will cut through this line 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.780
 you must have two parts one of thirty 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.760
 and a seven-centimeter look at the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.430
 piece of seven centimeters we will have 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.070
 to make a mark of half a centimeter 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.150
 to each end the same and on the side 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.540
 contrary 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.369
 then you will join these marks remember is 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.369
 half a centimeter on each side 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.030
 then from one of the brands towards 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.219
 inside 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.579
 we will have to do another two 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.579
 centimeters 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.220
 same on the opposite side and you will join these 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.820
 marks should be something like this these are 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.820
 the measures 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.040
 then we will have to double for these 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.040
 lines 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.050
 and also do not forget to delete the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.970
 marks we made with the pencil 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.850
 look now in the space of two 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.730
 centimeters we will have to make a hole 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.400
 right in the middle where between the disc 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.400
 that would be about 12 centimeters 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.900
 for this he will help you with the cutter and then 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.880
 with the scissors you will take out a piece of 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.880
 one millimeter approximately 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.310
 but do not get too involved with that 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.310
 between the disk is more than enough 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.250
 now we will take the other piece of 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.519
 cardboard and we will fold it just by the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.519
 half 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.200
 then when we see rubber in the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.540
 flaps half a centimeter from the other 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.270
 figure and we will lose it to the cardboard 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.120
 that we doubled previously generating a 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.730
 90 degree angle but neither do you 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 Complications just paste it and then close 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.610
 the card and insurance there is going to stick 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.490
 completely fine then you will have to 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.750
 Wait a little while to dry 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.100
 you will check that the disc fits and 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.100
 close correctly 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.850
 and it's time to decorate for it I'm 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.990
 using colored papers that I've 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.990
 previously cut 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.420
 and some I have decorated them with a 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.459
 black marker and for the cover and 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.700
 I will use ccoo paper that you can 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.560
 download from the website and remember all 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.810
 the links in the video description 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.180
 look here I've done a couple of 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.939
 decorations more and as you see this card 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.890
 It's super easy to do and ready until 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.780
 removed to your retro card 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.430
 do not forget to leave your comment on 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.819
