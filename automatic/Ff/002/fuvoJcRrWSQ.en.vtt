00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
way to incorporate it into your personal

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.150 
way to incorporate it into your personal
style<00:01:31.690> like<00:01:31.900> we<00:01:32.080> really<00:01:32.350> tried<00:01:32.680> with<00:01:32.710> this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
style like we really tried with this

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.480 
style like we really tried with this
because<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:34.540> can<00:01:34.780> skew<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.410> little<00:01:35.440> kitschy<00:01:36.070> and

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
because it can skew a little kitschy and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.430 
because it can skew a little kitschy and
quirky<00:01:37.330> but<00:01:37.479> we<00:01:37.630> also<00:01:37.780> wanted<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.170> try<00:01:38.320> to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
quirky but we also wanted to try to

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.190 
quirky but we also wanted to try to
ground<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.280> know<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.729> think<00:01:40.000> girls<00:01:40.960> look

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
ground it you know and think girls look

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.389 
ground it you know and think girls look
at<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.410> go<00:01:41.530> like<00:01:41.710> oh<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:41.890> want<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.220> wear<00:01:42.280> that

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
at it go like oh I want to wear that

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.340 
at it go like oh I want to wear that
whole<00:01:42.790> thing<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.630> think<00:01:43.810> it's<00:01:43.899> like<00:01:44.050> pulling
