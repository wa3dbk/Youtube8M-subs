00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
because I doing both consoles the ps4

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.560 
because I doing both consoles the ps4
any<00:03:15.290> xbox<00:03:16.070> one<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.910> wii<00:03:17.030> u<00:03:17.210> actually<00:03:17.360> as

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
any xbox one and the wii u actually as

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.610 
any xbox one and the wii u actually as
well<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:17.960> i<00:03:18.110> don't<00:03:18.260> really<00:03:18.350> count<00:03:18.500> that

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
well but i don't really count that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.490 
well but i don't really count that
basically<00:03:19.460> i<00:03:19.790> would<00:03:20.360> go<00:03:20.540> for<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.810> ps4<00:03:21.140> at<00:03:21.410> the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
basically i would go for the ps4 at the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.810 
basically i would go for the ps4 at the
moment<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.830> think<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> install<00:03:22.370> times<00:03:22.580> are

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
moment I think the install times are

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.940 
moment I think the install times are
better<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.720> console<00:03:24.110> looks<00:03:24.290> better<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.830> in

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
better the console looks better is in

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.400 
better the console looks better is in
visually<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.820> box<00:03:26.030> she<00:03:26.210> looks<00:03:26.360> better<00:03:26.570> at<00:03:27.230> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
visually the box she looks better at the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.950 
visually the box she looks better at the
start<00:03:27.770> times<00:03:28.070> are<00:03:28.310> quicker<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:29.600> install

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
start times are quicker the install

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.500 
start times are quicker the install
times<00:03:30.140> for<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.410> games<00:03:30.620> are<00:03:30.830> quicker<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.510> just

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
times for the games are quicker and just

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.180 
times for the games are quicker and just
it<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.810> crazy<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.230> start<00:03:33.470> time<00:03:33.680> for<00:03:33.710> the<00:03:33.890> xbox

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
it is crazy the start time for the xbox

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.880 
it is crazy the start time for the xbox
one<00:03:34.400> takes<00:03:34.730> ages<00:03:35.350> install<00:03:36.350> times<00:03:36.560> for<00:03:36.800> the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
one takes ages install times for the

content as well so I do get questions
quite<00:03:54.530> often<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.980> guess<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.820> main<00:03:55.850> thing<00:03:56.000> i'll

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420

quite often I guess the main thing i'll
talk<00:03:56.570> about<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.959> graphics<00:03:57.230> card<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:57.920> what

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
talk about it to graphics card but what

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.580 
talk about it to graphics card but what
we'll<00:03:58.340> do<00:03:58.520> is<00:03:58.730> update<00:03:58.910> my<00:03:59.330> about<00:03:59.810> page<00:03:59.870> on<00:04:00.380> my

660 ti which isn't the best graphics
card<00:04:10.160> that's<00:04:10.310> all<00:04:10.430> but<00:04:10.580> it<00:04:10.730> does<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.090> job<00:04:11.120> and

i'm pretty much play battlefield 4 in it
pretty<00:04:14.660> much<00:04:14.750> high<00:04:14.959> settings<00:04:15.290> which<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.709> not

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
pretty much high settings which is not

pretty much high settings which is not
which<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.370> pretty<00:04:16.489> good<00:04:16.840> it's<00:04:17.840> not<00:04:17.930> like<00:04:18.020> a

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
which is pretty good it's not like a

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.140 
which is pretty good it's not like a
tight<00:04:18.920> only<00:04:19.250> thing<00:04:19.430> I<00:04:19.520> can<00:04:19.700> really<00:04:19.790> afford<00:04:20.030> to

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
tighten yet but hopefully who knows next

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.700 
tighten yet but hopefully who knows next
year<00:04:22.760> might<00:04:23.060> try<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.870> upgrade<00:04:24.020> my<00:04:24.380> graphics

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
year might try and upgrade my graphics

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.220 
year might try and upgrade my graphics
card<00:04:24.740> or<00:04:25.130> something

card or something

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.410

in<00:04:26.260> some<00:04:26.500> way<00:04:26.680> but<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:27.190> have<00:04:27.730> about<00:04:27.940> 16

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
in some way but I have about 16

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.910 
in some way but I have about 16
gigabytes<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.840> RAM<00:04:29.110> which<00:04:29.320> is<00:04:29.440> pretty<00:04:29.710> much

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
gigabytes of RAM which is pretty much

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.460 
gigabytes of RAM which is pretty much
used<00:04:30.190> for<00:04:30.460> rendering<00:04:30.880> videos<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.930> pretty

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
used for rendering videos a pretty

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.460 
used for rendering videos a pretty
strong<00:04:32.650> processor<00:04:33.160> look<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:33.430> like<00:04:33.490> an<00:04:33.640> i7

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
strong processor look it's like an i7

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.950 
strong processor look it's like an i7
quad-core<00:04:35.470> crazy<00:04:36.420> CPU<00:04:37.420> it's<00:04:37.540> pretty<00:04:37.750> good<00:04:37.900> but

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
quad-core crazy CPU it's pretty good but
