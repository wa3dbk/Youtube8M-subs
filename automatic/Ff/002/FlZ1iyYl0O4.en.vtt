put one two three four going around this
is<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.430> same<00:01:15.700> base<00:01:16.090> as<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.390> water<00:01:16.720> fountain

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
is the same base as the water fountain

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.029 
is the same base as the water fountain
