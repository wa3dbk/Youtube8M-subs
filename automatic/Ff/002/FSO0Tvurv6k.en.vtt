00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
makes it happen was that it was nerfed

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.399 
makes it happen was that it was nerfed
projects<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.670> didn't<00:01:36.060> work<00:01:36.090> anymore<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
projects and it didn't work anymore and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
projects and it didn't work anymore and
because<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.860> there's<00:01:38.040> no<00:01:38.280> blood<00:01:38.549> store<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> used

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
because if there's no blood store a used

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.359 
because if there's no blood store a used
to<00:01:39.930> mini<00:01:40.110> game<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.560> players<00:01:40.770> started<00:01:41.159> going

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
to mini game and players started going

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.850 
to mini game and players started going
away<00:01:41.520> from<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> end<00:01:43.110> no<00:01:43.829> one

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
away from it and in the end no one

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.679 
away from it and in the end no one
really<00:01:44.220> used<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> sit<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.939> people<00:01:45.270> don't

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
really used to sit and people don't

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
really used to sit and people don't
really<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:46.020> well<00:01:46.320> how<00:01:47.009> much<00:01:47.189> fun<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.549> game

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
really know well how much fun this game

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
really know well how much fun this game
actually<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.530> mini<00:01:49.530> games<00:01:49.770> are

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
actually it's because mini games are

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
actually it's because mini games are
like<00:01:50.070> games<00:01:50.399> within<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.790> game<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> mobilizing

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
like games within a game and mobilizing

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.569 
like games within a game and mobilizing
armies<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
armies it's just that because this is a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.550 
armies it's just that because this is a
tactic<00:01:54.090> game<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:55.079> character

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
tactic game it's not your character

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.950 
tactic game it's not your character
doing<00:01:55.829> anything<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.670> controlling<00:01:57.570> ten

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
doing anything it's you controlling ten

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.389 
doing anything it's you controlling ten
different<00:01:58.140> squads<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> defeat<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
different squads you have to defeat the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
different squads you have to defeat the
other<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.729> scepter<00:02:00.149> ruined<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> role<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.170> case

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
other your scepter ruined a role in case

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.429 
other your scepter ruined a role in case
it's<00:02:02.159> different<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.210> scenario<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it's different kind of scenario so you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.889 
it's different kind of scenario so you
can<00:02:04.590> play<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.009> return<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.210> reward<00:02:06.540> points

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
can play in return for reward points

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.719 
can play in return for reward points
