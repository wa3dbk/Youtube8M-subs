either your device will be stuck in a

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.710 
either your device will be stuck in a

again and you're going to go through the
first<00:04:37.360> step<00:04:37.660> like<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.020> did<00:04:38.230> before<00:04:38.380> selecting

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
first step like you did before selecting

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.500 
first step like you did before selecting
four<00:04:39.370> point<00:04:39.580> three<00:04:39.610> point<00:04:39.760> one<00:04:40.000> for<00:04:40.420> the

respective device waiting for that and

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.030 
respective device waiting for that and
they'll<00:04:50.500> be<00:04:50.650> identified<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.670> next<00:04:52.120> button

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
they'll be identified to the next button

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.650 
they'll be identified to the next button
same<00:04:54.040> thing<00:04:54.280> will<00:04:54.430> happen<00:04:54.460> won't<00:04:55.450> take<00:04:55.630> very

same thing will happen won't take very

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.630 
same thing will happen won't take very
long<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.830> now<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.070> get<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.280> this<00:05:03.460> screen

the second from the bottom just boot

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.470 
the second from the bottom just boot
tethered<00:05:11.920> right<00:05:12.130> now<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.940> what<00:05:13.060> this<00:05:13.180> will<00:05:13.330> do

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
tethered right now and what this will do

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.990 
tethered right now and what this will do
will<00:05:13.840> help<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.770> root<00:05:15.190> your<00:05:15.220> device<00:05:15.460> into<00:05:15.970> a

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
tethered state where Cydia should then

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.570 
tethered state where Cydia should then
be<00:05:18.220> working<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.870> go<00:05:20.620> ahead<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:20.800> hit<00:05:20.950> next<00:05:21.010> and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
seconds your screen will light up at

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.050 
seconds your screen will light up at
first<00:05:40.780> and<00:05:41.050> then<00:05:41.200> about<00:05:41.980> like<00:05:42.250> seven<00:05:42.280> seconds

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
first and then about like seven seconds

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.580 
first and then about like seven seconds
in<00:05:43.180> or<00:05:43.390> although<00:05:43.660> black<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.230> you<00:05:44.290> should<00:05:44.440> just

keep<00:05:44.740> holding<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.190> for<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.430> few<00:05:45.580> more<00:05:45.760> seconds

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
keep holding it for a few more seconds

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.330 
keep holding it for a few more seconds
then<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.110> can<00:05:47.260> release<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.830> top<00:05:48.040> power

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340

button this step lasts for about 15

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.080 
button this step lasts for about 15
seconds<00:05:53.680> but<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:54.160> should<00:05:54.490> move<00:05:54.669> on<00:05:54.820> to<00:05:54.970> the

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
seconds but it should move on to the

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.480 
seconds but it should move on to the
next<00:05:55.120> section<00:05:55.450> about<00:05:55.750> seven<00:05:56.080> seconds<00:05:56.380> in<00:05:56.530> so

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
next section about seven seconds in so

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.620 
next section about seven seconds in so
now<00:05:57.610> once<00:05:57.910> again<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.270> goes<00:05:58.360> through<00:05:58.570> the

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
now once again it goes through the

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.360 
now once again it goes through the
process<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.020> exploiting<00:05:59.770> it<00:05:59.890> but<00:06:00.040> it<00:06:00.130> doesn't

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
process of exploiting it but it doesn't

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.890 
process of exploiting it but it doesn't
have<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.700> upload<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.150> jailbreak<00:06:01.540> data<00:06:01.720> or

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
have to upload the jailbreak data or

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.290 
have to upload the jailbreak data or
anything<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.860> just<00:06:03.220> wastes<00:06:03.790> with<00:06:03.910> a<00:06:03.970> reboot

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
anything it just wastes with a reboot

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.990 
anything it just wastes with a reboot
and<00:06:04.480> then<00:06:04.860> boot<00:06:05.860> tethered<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:06.760> have<00:06:06.880> a

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
and then boot tethered you have a

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.620 
and then boot tethered you have a
pineapple<00:06:07.240> as<00:06:07.690> a<00:06:07.720> boot<00:06:07.960> logo<00:06:09.510> everything<00:06:10.510> will

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
pineapple as a boot logo everything will

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.840 
pineapple as a boot logo everything will
be<00:06:10.660> fine<00:06:10.930> okay<00:06:11.650> so<00:06:11.890> this<00:06:12.130> doesn't<00:06:12.550> take

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
be fine okay so this doesn't take

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.550 
be fine okay so this doesn't take
ridiculously<00:06:13.390> long<00:06:13.570> usually<00:06:14.020> about<00:06:14.169> the<00:06:14.320> same

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
ridiculously long usually about the same

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.800 
ridiculously long usually about the same
time<00:06:14.590> as<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:15.100> normal<00:06:15.460> startup<00:06:15.910> probably<00:06:16.780> a

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
time as a normal startup probably a

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.450 
time as a normal startup probably a
little<00:06:17.020> bit<00:06:17.230> longer<00:06:17.440> just<00:06:17.890> possess<00:06:18.310> the

little bit longer just possess the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
process everything but once it does

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.310 
process everything but once it does
we'll<00:06:21.280> be<00:06:21.370> coming<00:06:21.550> back<00:06:21.669> and<00:06:22.120> you<00:06:22.810> should<00:06:23.110> have
