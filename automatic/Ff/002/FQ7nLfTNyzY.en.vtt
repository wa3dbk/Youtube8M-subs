such<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> clever<00:00:37.559> way<00:00:37.800> Batman's<00:00:38.280> ultimately

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
such a clever way Batman's ultimately

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.189 
such a clever way Batman's ultimately
losing<00:00:39.059> his<00:00:39.179> mind<00:00:39.300> cuz<00:00:39.539> he<00:00:39.600> has<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.839> Joker

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
losing his mind cuz he has like Joker

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.720 
losing his mind cuz he has like Joker
blood<00:00:40.409> in<00:00:40.499> him<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> Joker's<00:00:41.159> condition<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
