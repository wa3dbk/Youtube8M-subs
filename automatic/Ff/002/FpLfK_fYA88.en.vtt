if<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.989> school<00:00:01.140> has<00:00:02.360> 6525<00:00:03.360> students<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.500> nine

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
if a school has 6525 students and nine

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.150 
if a school has 6525 students and nine
of<00:00:05.670> 15<00:00:06.089> students<00:00:06.569> are<00:00:06.720> female<00:00:06.990> how<00:00:07.980> many

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
of 15 students are female how many

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.419 
of 15 students are female how many
females<00:00:08.670> attend<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> school<00:00:10.250> when<00:00:11.250> we're

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
females attend the school when we're

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.190 
females attend the school when we're
told<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.759> nine<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.269> fifteen<00:00:12.360> students<00:00:13.110> are

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
told that nine and fifteen students are

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.640 
told that nine and fifteen students are
female<00:00:13.880> that's<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.030> ratio<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.509> female<00:00:15.960> students

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
female that's a ratio of female students

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010 
female that's a ratio of female students
to<00:00:16.800> total<00:00:17.130> students<00:00:17.520> which<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.869> written

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
to total students which can be written

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.109 
to total students which can be written
as<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> fraction<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.390> 915<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.260> students<00:00:22.769> are

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
as a fraction so 915 of the students are

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.650 
as a fraction so 915 of the students are
females<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:24.960> want<00:00:25.140> 915<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.359> total

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
females so we want 915 of the total

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.250 
females so we want 915 of the total
students<00:00:28.019> which<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:29.510> 6525<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:32.600> of<00:00:33.600> means<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
students which is 6525 and of means to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.190 
students which is 6525 and of means to
multiply<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> determine<00:00:36.020> 915<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:38.210> 6525<00:00:39.210> we

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
multiply so to determine 915 of 6525 we

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.610 
multiply so to determine 915 of 6525 we
need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> multiply<00:00:40.730> 915<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:44.180> 6525

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
need to multiply 915 and 6525

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.590 
need to multiply 915 and 6525
so<00:00:46.620> we'll<00:00:46.710> write<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> fraction<00:00:47.610> but

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so we'll write this as a fraction but

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.850 
so we'll write this as a fraction but
one<00:00:48.719> thing<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.899> noticed<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.200> away<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.530> this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
one thing I noticed right away is this

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.819 
one thing I noticed right away is this
fraction<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:51.000> simplified

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
fraction here can actually be simplified

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.840 
fraction here can actually be simplified
which<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:52.980> make<00:00:53.129> multiplying<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
which will make multiplying this a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
which will make multiplying this a
little<00:00:54.000> bit<00:00:54.210> easier<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> prime

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
little bit easier the prime

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.610 
little bit easier the prime
factorization<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> 9<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.670> 3<00:00:59.699> times<00:01:00.210> 3<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
factorization of 9 is 3 times 3 the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.509 
factorization of 9 is 3 times 3 the
prime<00:01:01.890> factorization<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> 15<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> 3<00:01:03.539> times<00:01:03.570> 5

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
prime factorization of 15 is 3 times 5

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.710 
prime factorization of 15 is 3 times 5
notice<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:05.790> threes<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.420> simplify

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
notice how these threes would simplify

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.120 
notice how these threes would simplify
out<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.439> 3<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.310> 3<00:01:08.340> simplifies<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> 1<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.130> we

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
out or 3 over 3 simplifies to 1 so we

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.899 
out or 3 over 3 simplifies to 1 so we
can<00:01:11.400> rewrite<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.260> 3/5<00:01:13.310> times<00:01:15.799> 6525<00:01:16.909> all

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
can rewrite this as 3/5 times 6525 all

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
can rewrite this as 3/5 times 6525 all
over<00:01:18.270> 1<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.560> also<00:01:19.710> notice<00:01:20.040> through<00:01:20.159> this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
over 1 and I also notice through this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.429 
over 1 and I also notice through this
large<00:01:20.430> number<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.880> ends<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.330> 5<00:01:21.570> which

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
large number here ends in a 5 which

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.830 
large number here ends in a 5 which
means<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.890> divisible<00:01:23.130> by<00:01:23.340> 5<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.720> let's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
means it's divisible by 5 so let's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.969 
means it's divisible by 5 so let's
rewrite<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.140> again<00:01:25.549> 3/5<00:01:26.600> times<00:01:27.740> now<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
rewrite this again 3/5 times now you can

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.580 
rewrite this again 3/5 times now you can
check<00:01:29.130> me<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:30.350> 6525

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
check me on this but 6525

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.870 
check me on this but 6525
is<00:01:32.070> equal<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> 5<00:01:33.119> times<00:01:35.060> 1305<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.670> can

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is equal to 5 times 1305 so now we can

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
is equal to 5 times 1305 so now we can
see<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.210> factor<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.720> 5<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.500> here

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
see this factor of 5 here and here

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.490 
see this factor of 5 here and here
simplify<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> 1<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.290> multiply

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
simplify to 1 so now when we multiply

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
simplify to 1 so now when we multiply
we're<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.100> three<00:01:44.369> times<00:01:45.530> 1305

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.120 

which<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:59.460> 3915<00:02:00.490> all<00:02:01.119> over<00:02:01.810> one<00:02:02.109> which<00:02:02.920> tells

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
which is 3915 all over one which tells

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.960 
which is 3915 all over one which tells
us<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.399> we<00:02:03.549> have<00:02:05.549> 3915<00:02:06.579> females<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:09.190> this

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
us that we have 3915 females at this

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.269 
us that we have 3915 females at this
school
