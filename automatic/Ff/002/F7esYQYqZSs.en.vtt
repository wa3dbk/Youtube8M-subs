came in like two or three parts of leave
in<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:39.970> platform<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.740> attach<00:04:42.010> the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
in that platform you have to attach the

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.570 
in that platform you have to attach the
mass<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.840> rope<00:04:44.050> he's<00:04:44.560> holding<00:04:44.889> on<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.280> and

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
than that it was pretty easy to put

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.050 
than that it was pretty easy to put
together<00:04:50.020> so<00:04:50.590> let's<00:04:50.950> take<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.190> closer<00:04:51.550> look<00:04:51.700> at

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
in the middle to make it look like it's

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.550 
in the middle to make it look like it's
flowing<00:05:06.550> blowing<00:05:07.270> in<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:07.480> wind<00:05:07.510> also<00:05:08.440> of

cool<00:05:10.419> there<00:05:10.990> is<00:05:11.200> this<00:05:11.440> top<00:05:11.770> part<00:05:12.070> right<00:05:12.130> here

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
cool there is this top part right here

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.630 
cool there is this top part right here
you<00:05:13.510> could<00:05:13.690> tie<00:05:14.350> this<00:05:14.410> rope<00:05:14.890> which<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.460> comes

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
you could tie this rope which it comes

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.820 
you could tie this rope which it comes
with<00:05:15.850> through<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.750> loop<00:05:17.020> over<00:05:17.260> here<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.650> it

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
with through the loop over here and it

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.590 
with through the loop over here and it
comes<00:05:18.040> down<00:05:18.220> into<00:05:18.460> Edward<00:05:18.880> Kenway<00:05:19.090> his<00:05:19.330> hand

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
comes down into Edward Kenway his hand

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.870 
comes down into Edward Kenway his hand
down<00:05:19.990> here<00:05:20.320> so<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:20.860> makes<00:05:20.979> it<00:05:21.100> look<00:05:21.160> like<00:05:21.490> he's

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
down here so it makes it look like he's

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.510 
down here so it makes it look like he's
swinging<00:05:22.419> around<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.229> masts<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.860> look<00:05:24.490> a

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
swinging around the masts and look a

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.129 
swinging around the masts and look a
little<00:05:24.729> bit<00:05:24.940> farther<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.510> goes<00:05:25.870> around

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
little bit farther and it goes around

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.610 
little bit farther and it goes around
his<00:05:26.530> leg<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.240> under<00:05:28.240> his<00:05:28.600> boot<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:29.440> could

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
his leg and under his boot and you could

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.860 
his leg and under his boot and you could

some dirt marks on his pants which give
it<00:06:25.120> a<00:06:25.180> little<00:06:25.330> bit<00:06:25.479> more<00:06:25.690> on<00:06:25.900> more<00:06:26.470> detailed<00:06:27.130> I

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
it a little bit more on more detailed I

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.180 
it a little bit more on more detailed I
guess<00:06:27.430> and<00:06:27.729> there's<00:06:27.850> just<00:06:28.030> coat<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:29.190> here's

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
guess and there's just coat and here's

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.430 
guess and there's just coat and here's
the<00:06:30.400> bottom<00:06:30.580> part<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.450> plank<00:06:31.720> that<00:06:32.020> he<00:06:32.200> is

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
the bottom part the plank that he is

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.920 
the bottom part the plank that he is
standing<00:06:33.160> on<00:06:33.300> overall<00:06:34.300> I<00:06:34.330> think<00:06:34.539> it's<00:06:34.810> a

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
standing on overall I think it's a

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.450 
standing on overall I think it's a
really<00:06:35.260> cool<00:06:35.500> looking<00:06:35.830> figure<00:06:36.099> it<00:06:36.310> looks

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
really cool looking figure it looks

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.360 
really cool looking figure it looks
really<00:06:36.880> dynamic

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
really dynamic

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.010 
really dynamic
I<00:06:38.400> like<00:06:38.730> how<00:06:38.850> he<00:06:38.910> looks<00:06:39.060> like<00:06:39.390> he's<00:06:39.570> swinging

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
I like how he looks like he's swinging

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.110 
I like how he looks like he's swinging
around<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.440> mast<00:06:40.680> and<00:06:40.950> I<00:06:41.460> should<00:06:41.790> also<00:06:41.910> add

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
around the mast and I should also add

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.990 
around the mast and I should also add
that<00:06:42.150> you<00:06:42.540> can<00:06:42.810> move<00:06:43.110> this<00:06:43.520> swing<00:06:44.520> it<00:06:44.640> over<00:06:44.850> to

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
that you can move this swing it over to

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.390 
that you can move this swing it over to
the<00:06:45.120> other<00:06:45.240> side<00:06:45.570> so<00:06:46.050> the<00:06:46.170> flag<00:06:46.620> is<00:06:46.830> behind<00:06:47.160> him

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
the other side so the flag is behind him

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.240 
the other side so the flag is behind him
but<00:06:47.970> I<00:06:48.030> just<00:06:48.540> found<00:06:48.660> it<00:06:48.870> easier<00:06:49.290> or<00:06:49.650> it<00:06:49.860> looks<00:06:50.040> a

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
but I just found it easier or it looks a

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.830 
but I just found it easier or it looks a
little<00:06:50.340> bit<00:06:50.550> better<00:06:50.670> if<00:06:51.240> it's<00:06:51.420> on<00:06:51.540> the<00:06:51.630> left

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
little bit better if it's on the left

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.890 
little bit better if it's on the left
side<00:06:52.070> also<00:06:53.070> the<00:06:53.580> saber<00:06:54.060> kind<00:06:54.450> of<00:06:54.570> gets<00:06:54.750> in<00:06:54.870> the

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
side also the saber kind of gets in the

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.830 
side also the saber kind of gets in the
way<00:06:55.160> if<00:06:56.160> the<00:06:56.310> flag<00:06:56.550> is<00:06:56.580> on<00:06:56.790> the<00:06:57.000> right<00:06:57.420> side<00:06:57.630> but

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
way if the flag is on the right side but

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.810 
way if the flag is on the right side but
other<00:06:57.990> than<00:06:58.200> that<00:06:58.260> looks<00:06:58.680> like<00:06:58.920> a<00:06:59.070> really<00:06:59.580> cool

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
other than that looks like a really cool

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.570 
other than that looks like a really cool
