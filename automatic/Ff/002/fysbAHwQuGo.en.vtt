00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

you<00:00:00.120> know<00:00:00.210> about<00:00:00.480> what<00:00:01.050> was<00:00:01.399> what<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.490> house

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
you know about what was what this house

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.300 
you know about what was what this house
was<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.240> additions<00:00:04.049> or<00:00:04.259> changes<00:00:04.319> well<00:00:05.100> there

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
was and additions or changes well there

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.190 
was and additions or changes well there
are<00:00:05.339> four<00:00:05.670> houses<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.540> are<00:00:06.660> seemingly

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
are four houses here that are seemingly

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.830 
are four houses here that are seemingly
identical<00:00:08.300> originally<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.510> then<00:00:09.540> they've

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
identical originally and then they've

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.629 
identical originally and then they've
all<00:00:09.990> had<00:00:10.170> different<00:00:10.410> editions<00:00:11.010> put<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
all had different editions put on and

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.640 
all had different editions put on and
different<00:00:11.940> changes<00:00:12.360> made<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.630> them<00:00:12.960> I've<00:00:13.440> been

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
different changes made to them I've been

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.650 
different changes made to them I've been
in<00:00:13.830> all<00:00:13.950> four<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.309> them<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.420> interesting

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
in all four of them so it's interesting

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.180 
in all four of them so it's interesting
to<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.080> how<00:00:16.289> different<00:00:16.500> they<00:00:16.770> are<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.100> how

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
to see how different they are and how

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.060 
to see how different they are and how
like<00:00:17.490> they<00:00:17.699> are<00:00:18.260> they<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.380> originally<00:00:19.830> built

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
like they are they are originally built

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.340 
like they are they are originally built
I<00:00:20.220> guess<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> mid<00:00:20.880> 19th<00:00:21.480> century<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.170> then

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
I guess in the mid 19th century and then

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.109 
I guess in the mid 19th century and then
at<00:00:22.529> various<00:00:22.859> times<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> next<00:00:23.609> 50<00:00:23.939> years

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
at various times in the next 50 years

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.450 
at various times in the next 50 years
there<00:00:24.420> were<00:00:24.510> additions<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.199> changes<00:00:25.460> made

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
there were additions and changes made

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.019 
there were additions and changes made
and<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.369> almost<00:00:29.369> some<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> it's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and this one is in almost some of it's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
and this one is in almost some of it's
an<00:00:30.150> original<00:00:30.330> condition<00:00:30.960> almost<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.650> can

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
an original condition almost so you can

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.139 
an original condition almost so you can
see<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.880> built

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
see what it was like when it was built

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.340 
see what it was like when it was built
and<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> changes<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and then you can see the changes that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.500 
and then you can see the changes that
owners<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.920> made<00:00:35.130> over<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.430> years<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.360> what

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
owners have made over the years and what

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.260 
owners have made over the years and what
were<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> changes<00:00:37.079> well<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.399> main<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:39.090> walk

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
were the changes well the main we walk

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.060 
were the changes well the main we walk
around<00:00:39.420> yeah<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.110> main<00:00:40.260> part<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.680> probably

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
around yeah the main part was probably

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.400 
around yeah the main part was probably
just<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.350> two<00:00:43.350> rooms<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> front<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.550> then

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
just the two rooms in the front and then

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.190 
just the two rooms in the front and then
straight<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.789> two<00:00:47.789> stories<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.660> then

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
straight up two stories and then then

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.400 
straight up two stories and then then
the<00:00:49.969> addition<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.120> back<00:00:51.360> almost<00:00:51.809> doubled

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the addition in the back almost doubled

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.880 
the addition in the back almost doubled
the<00:00:52.530> size<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> house<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:55.820> think<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.890> probably

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the size of the house I think I probably

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
the size of the house I think I probably
added<00:00:59.609> central<00:01:00.030> heat<00:01:00.270> when<00:01:00.510> they<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
added central heat when they put the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.360 
added central heat when they put the
additional

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.120 

and<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:09.000> modern<00:01:09.360> kitchen<00:01:11.060> bathroom<00:01:13.010> for<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and a modern kitchen bathroom for this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.980 
and a modern kitchen bathroom for this
part<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> yeah<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.120> is<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.660> addition

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
part here is yeah this is the addition

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.250 
part here is yeah this is the addition
there<00:01:19.490> where<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:20.730> meet<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:22.020> little

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
there where do they meet this little

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.770 
there where do they meet this little
front<00:01:22.860> bump<00:01:23.370> sout<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> bit<00:01:24.120> for<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> drink

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
front bump sout just a bit for the drink

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:45.730 
front bump sout just a bit for the drink
oh<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.260> see<00:01:25.470> ya

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.330 

three<00:01:46.340> stories<00:01:47.259> two<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.439> a<00:01:48.470> half<00:01:48.500> stories<00:01:49.130> we

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
three stories two and a half stories we

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.670 
three stories two and a half stories we
would<00:01:49.490> call<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.939> an<00:01:50.390> originally<00:01:50.960> heated<00:01:51.320> by

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
would call this an originally heated by

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.230 
would call this an originally heated by
what<00:01:52.009> people<00:01:52.159> well<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.549> think<00:01:52.880> originally

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
what people well I think originally

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.910 
what people well I think originally
probably<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:53.960> was<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.350> heated<00:01:54.740> by

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
probably it was just heated by

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.330 
probably it was just heated by
fireplaces<00:01:55.909> or<00:01:56.330> coal<00:01:56.659> stoves<00:01:57.520> inside<00:01:58.990> and<00:02:00.340> now

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
fireplaces or coal stoves inside and now

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.130 
fireplaces or coal stoves inside and now
of<00:02:01.490> course<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.939> has<00:02:02.090> forced<00:02:02.600> air<00:02:02.780> heat<00:02:02.990> in

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
of course it has forced air heat in

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.799 
of course it has forced air heat in
central<00:02:03.590> air
