little<00:02:01.950> bit<00:02:02.190> of<00:02:02.340> white<00:02:02.610> eyeshadow<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.540> lid

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
little bit of white eyeshadow to the lid

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.360 
little bit of white eyeshadow to the lid
just<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.350> create<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.620> little<00:02:04.800> bit<00:02:04.980> of<00:02:05.130> dimension

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
just to create a little bit of dimension

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.180 
just to create a little bit of dimension
so<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.120> not<00:02:06.240> completely<00:02:06.780> flat<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.980> you're

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so it's not completely flat so you're

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.560 
so it's not completely flat so you're
just<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.550> apply<00:02:08.760> that<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.030> then<00:02:09.300> blend

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
just going to apply that and then blend

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.720 
just going to apply that and then blend
it<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.130> subtle<00:02:11.400> little

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
it out this is a really subtle little

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.310 
it out this is a really subtle little
effect<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> don't<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.020> colors

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
effect because you don't want the colors

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.380 
effect because you don't want the colors
to<00:02:13.350> be<00:02:13.500> too<00:02:13.860> different<00:02:14.370> because<00:02:15.030> we're<00:02:15.240> just

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
to be too different because we're just

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.420 
to be too different because we're just
very<00:02:15.540> solid<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:16.890> will<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.130> make<00:02:17.220> your

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
very solid but this will just make your

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.640 
very solid but this will just make your
eyes<00:02:17.610> pop<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> little<00:02:18.360> bit<00:02:18.480> more<00:02:18.540> now<00:02:19.500> we're

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
eyes pop a little bit more now we're

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.710 
eyes pop a little bit more now we're
going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> line<00:02:20.010> our<00:02:20.070> eyes<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> dark<00:02:21.450> blue

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
going to line our eyes with a dark blue

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.440 
going to line our eyes with a dark blue
gel<00:02:22.260> liner<00:02:22.530> because<00:02:23.010> she<00:02:23.220> actually<00:02:23.430> has<00:02:23.850> like

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
gel liner because she actually has like

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.040 
gel liner because she actually has like
a<00:02:24.480> royal<00:02:24.810> blue<00:02:25.340> eyeliner<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.690> had<00:02:27.870> one

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
a royal blue eyeliner and if I had one

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.660 
a royal blue eyeliner and if I had one
that<00:02:28.140> was<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.320> little<00:02:28.380> bit<00:02:28.710> more<00:02:28.980> vibrant<00:02:29.370> to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
that was a little bit more vibrant to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.940 
that was a little bit more vibrant to
blue<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.150> would<00:02:30.300> use<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> only

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
blue I would use it but this is the only

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.490 
blue I would use it but this is the only
blue<00:02:32.310> liner<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.350> we're<00:02:34.470> just

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
blue liner that I have so we're just

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160 
blue liner that I have so we're just
going<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.770> create<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.660> relatively<00:02:36.660> thin

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
going to create a relatively thin

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.970 
going to create a relatively thin
natural<00:02:38.100> type<00:02:38.550> line<00:02:38.910> along<00:02:39.720> our<00:02:40.020> upper<00:02:40.740> lash

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
line and wing it out just ever so

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.620 
line and wing it out just ever so
slightly<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.730> for<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.970> more<00:02:45.150> flattering

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630

taper<00:02:46.350> on<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> end<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:48.800> then<00:02:49.800> bring<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.100> all

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
taper on the end and then bring it all

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.830 
taper on the end and then bring it all
the<00:02:50.340> way<00:02:50.490> down<00:02:50.760> into<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.150> inner<00:02:51.330> corner<00:02:51.690> just

for a nice clean finish and repeat on
the<00:02:57.750> other<00:02:57.930> eye<00:02:59.750> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.900> don't<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.290> any<00:03:01.590> blue

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the other eye if you don't have any blue

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.010 
the other eye if you don't have any blue
liner<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.880> can<00:03:02.910> still<00:03:03.240> use<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> black<00:03:03.720> liner

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
liner you can still use a black liner

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.440 
liner you can still use a black liner
and<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.380> look<00:03:04.590> will<00:03:04.770> still<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.730> fine<00:03:06.030> but

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and the look will still be just fine but

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.660 
and the look will still be just fine but
I<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.320> doing<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.920> blue<00:03:08.160> because<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> makes

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
I like doing the blue because it makes

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.760 
I like doing the blue because it makes
the<00:03:08.790> colors<00:03:09.090> pop<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.360> little<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.350> now<00:03:10.560> we're

just<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> tightline<00:03:11.400> our<00:03:11.940> upper<00:03:12.600> lash

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
just going to tightline our upper lash

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.020 
black pencil liner
this<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:18.859> really<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.219> to<00:03:19.280> define<00:03:19.640> our<00:03:19.670> eyes

and now this is optional but I'm just

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.869

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
these aren't super super dramatic but

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.949 
these aren't super super dramatic but
they<00:03:46.939> will<00:03:47.120> add<00:03:47.329> a<00:03:47.359> little<00:03:47.689> bit<00:03:47.810> more

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959

over where we applied the pink eyeshadow
this<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.519> optional<00:04:21.000> because<00:04:21.150> she<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.109> a

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
this is optional because she is a

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.340 
this is optional because she is a
cartoon<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.160> her<00:04:23.460> look<00:04:23.699> is<00:04:23.910> more<00:04:24.150> solid<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:25.229> in

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
cartoon so her look is more solid but in

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.290

some<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.740> episodes<00:04:26.190> she's<00:04:26.669> very<00:04:27.030> very

some of the episodes she's very very
glittery<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.199> I<00:04:28.440> thought<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.710> would<00:04:28.889> be<00:04:28.919> a
