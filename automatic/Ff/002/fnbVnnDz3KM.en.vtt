00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 Tuesday to daily from Tuesday, March 10 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.109
 when the days and the everyday in 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.150
 four points where we summarize a little 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.710
 little high tech news since the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.900
 China 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.860
 jt geeks news and news and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.660
 comments that we read a little 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.619
 little on the internet so today the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.970
 daily which is a little shorter 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.400
 who yesterday even on the cam well 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.320
 worked so what is good at 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080
 paul clozel on these bases it's when 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.160
 even made in china right next to the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.449
 collecting at the wrong apple that has mostly 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.800
 showed the age polo because actually at the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.019
 base everyone thought that apple 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 was going to define a standard saying here 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.710
 connected world it's going to be that and that's it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 standards and that's our vision is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 round will follow force is to contact 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 who yesterday they did not take out something 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.860
 do not want to feel something 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.300
 unbelievable 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 there is so much stuff on which they 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.160
 did not respond in particular to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.570
 autonomy 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 I thought he had a load 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 fast thing and uh and if it's going to take a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.700
 collector to the con because if it takes 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.809
 a collector to the con here is so that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.039
 you're going to have the watch he'll have to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 recharge and ben you will prepare 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.280
 any case at all not good I 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.079
 mean it does not break three paws to a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 duck they will still sell some 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.500
 peanuts and whole mac the mac book 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.879
 Air fact that he will call you the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.080
 macbook air it was called the mac that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.479
 I was interesting enough that I 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.560
 will have 11 for m6 still holds 12 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 inches it might not be bad and 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 spinning he is beautiful anyway 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.130
 you hear ultra- wide metal and that a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 big screen retina screen against this 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.619
 who shits is the connection with ya 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.150
 more than a connection that apply 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 their connectivity blizzard has shattered charge 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.220
 actually emanating in to the hdmi usb 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 thing and everything like a little nerd me 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.100
 what I like with my macbook air 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 when I took my book air at the base of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.920
 macbook pro are doing that's exactly 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.869
 the same park the screen is a little less 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 less good but good after it's not very 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.479
 serious but still two usb jacks 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.520
 one on each side one afford 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 usb keys and a mouse a mouse 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 giant we work a little pad this is 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.460
 fun five minutes but that's the name 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 released that personally I will change 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.149
 no i would not change usb jack when 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.659
 even on the shit side not bad good the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.729
 news of the country 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.890
 and still libya is back well 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.990
 who will in theory feel z9 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.000
 we liked the z7 anyway 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.380
 someone really well cardboard and there 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.940
 apparently there is z9 that should happen 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.360
 the course of the month so apparently the 26 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.030
 March 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.650
 we can not wait to see 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.030
 because even so, it's really 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.250
 nubia range that's really what does 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 of muse was at home with 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.140
 dishes as much there in China the range 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.740
 nubia is what a minium that is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.000
 incredible a rumor that runs after 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.040
 mostly Chinese journalists and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.319
 Asians like how I get drunk 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.790
 could equip itself in media library 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.440
 what seems coherent abandoned 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.910
 qualcomm especially for entry and 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.230
 mid -range a yoga I necessarily 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.940
 believe to be like there is passing but the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.989
 tech is nothing amazing a country to 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.160
 reindeer better than the 810 at qualcomm 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.330
 so he should put himself with them for 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.610
 the entry-level which would be consistent 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.800
 when we see the range names t 67,30 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.239
 207 50 2 who are quad core and 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.970
 other agreements are kabyles that works 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.989
 super good and in my opinion the 67 30 of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.630
 works great 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.209
 64 bits and it must be cheaper than 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.300
 the qualcomm 410 so blow and samsung 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.800
 for and that's what it's like with 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.750
 with media library and feel anyway 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.130
 a big range of devices like 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.120
 that and everything is what could give a 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.860
 few of them is the media library in 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.030
 waiting for the two boxers are the end 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.530
 we talked we would like to see a 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.420
 iphone arrives and who are 5 95 that's 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.100
 really the 65,95 the one found 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.720
 on the meizu like that which is very little 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.680
 used and who now we are going to be in 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.739
 big productions 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.329
 before arriving at 67.95 maybe for 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.549
 the moment we will rather use for sure 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.140
 we know when good news 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.459
 because it's going to boost the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.680
 media library market that will encourage them 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.090
 to invest know how to give cash and 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.959
 then it will democratize a little the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.070
 mediatheques a few in the world that is 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.620
 nothing else an article from an editor 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.299
 invited others put to us because come and 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.920
 and then he'll always be a little 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.450
 quiet cover ah yes bah yeah bah 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.380
 this is the first jt geek so we have 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.510
 succeeded before half calm 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.730
 this is the thing here it is there she 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.989
 train to load up there so 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.410
 it's funny because today those 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.780
 who will see the geeks +0 I tested a 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.140
 sports camera that I do not know I was 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.720
 dirty la la 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.860
 shit I forgot the name laso blaise who 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.450
 is a very very good camera when 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.980
 even a pond buying stumm then 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.569
 apparently you will see on the video in 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.920
 did there was no sound when I 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.569
 do the angel - the bosses I even believe 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.330
 it must be unscrewed salah will need davis 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.430
 and the plug there is in my opinion the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.629
 its going to be done here but I have not 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.700
 thought when the short I made the video 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.540
 and when I did the editing also say 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.430
 now if there is no sound 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.599
 weird we hear very far but 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.160
 as if we were really at 110 and I 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.989
 think that when we do not really serve 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.070
 remove the cap there and I believe that I 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.479
 do tests I can time 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.250
 today it was a bit tense but 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.660
 a very very good camera here moment the 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.460
 sound problem it's really the wind 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.330
 this little crap of shit right here 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.949
 if they know it's exchanged it and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.800
 who is a spokesperson so here we are 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.389
 back to school test tomorrow I'm going to do a 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.860
 versus also that the gopro I will put the 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.330
 two that an elastic 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.250
 I 'll go outside and we 'll really do a 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.289
 comparison between the two cameras even 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.419
 if this camera down there is no 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.979
 waterproof case not optional and marked 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.900
 on the small breastsheet marked 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.240
 optional housing is for the moment the 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.860
 not sell no lcd you go through 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.780
 the smartphone where I'm not super 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.370
 convinced years and more and more bomb at the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.169
 camera that is worth 400 r'n'b that we can not 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.570
 buy here in that I bought 500 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.610
 stops tell me oh fucking almost 15 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.560
 hours or more finally I bought one 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.539
 we will test we have a mission we will do 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.910
 do two three saw the asome by pro who 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.020
 is being pet some have had 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.300
 problems with the update to t1 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.099
 either willy-nilly or they do not have 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.599
 been patient they tinkered stuff that 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.460
 are all planted in essoyes 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.139
 so here we go we ask the dress 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.760
 locals imploding and I the 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.919
 would put on the jt geek there in the 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.200
 morning the camera at the bled so there I 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:31.570
 let's test that we have tested well 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:34.030
 the jack is paris beautiful it's a jack o 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.860
 mtp green it was there only 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.810
 for hulot phone by pro here we buy 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.800
 we have no cable we will put them on sky 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.240
 phone offer they will put him the ball 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.410
 and back who will know the time are a 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.870
 little overworked there is new that starts 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.449
 today here it is cables that 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.970
 will really help co2 solve 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.320
 the problem that we have seen with the 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.030
 fbi pro since failing that manufactures 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.729
 between a solution we be the solution 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.349
 buy that we will sell one euro so 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.400
 it's not excessively expensive it's not 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.840
 with that we will make money but 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.699
 at least that will help 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.139
 to please those who need 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.580
 we took this model to want there is a 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.810
 model that goes two sus in case we 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.240
 put the jack but it was a 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.560
 overthick on it was a trick 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.150
 more stuff it was a big 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.800
 height actually it was ugly and that 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
 could damage the jack so there at 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.699
 the less you put this one there is something 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.110
 at the end the test put your jack 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.770
 your jack at the end of your helmet and that 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.720
 will do a little bit of black 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.639
 will it list I had pretty much not given 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.320
 a lot of requests so the camera 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.820
 I went back home and asked for a species 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.380
 of gopro support and everyone 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.960
 was seeing it I really found it 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.229
 expensive in purchase price and so I do not have 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.910
 purchased 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.560
 and finally he is really expensive up there 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.810
 the link how to send they were 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.710
 almost as dear real name lester 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.180
 more expensive than you can buy 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.950
 but so suddenly I 'll read cowardice 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.479
 I will go buy tomorrow and this week 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.290
 we will finish this lover with the camera that 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.300
 asked on Wednesday 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.370

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.510

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.260
 notice his banderilla but this time the 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.220
 webcam 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.150
 I would like to do with ouakam 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:59.199
 logitech before attacking the camera here 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.550
 too strong and that's yesterday so suddenly 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.350
 we made a video and the camera 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.490
 had seen that with depending on the 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.169
 Camera is brought cash as much 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.490
 darker it is not more beautiful there we 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.780
 really has a luminosity that has hung 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.760
 with that one what makes you in 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.410
 natural light is the window one 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.710
 lighting the impression of time in full 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.910
 Sun 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.860
 the weather is rotten we are not even worth the 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.479
 ground and there were no questions yesterday 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.070
 on the water because there was only gi 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.330
 more than they had access to it so there is 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.260
 few questions to take in my opinion 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.750
 there may be questions about 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.669

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.570

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.580
 like always 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.200

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.430
 machine well and in fact it's this tax 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.990

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.960

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.820
 so much that she rings hollow ballan 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.200
