wrote it off of what it even been in the
air<00:02:09.599> once<00:02:10.250> brilliant

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
air once brilliant

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.190 
air once brilliant
and<00:02:12.790> then<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.120> course<00:02:13.300> there's<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.599> a380

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
and then of course there's the a380

and then of course there's the a380
which<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.650> wonderful<00:02:15.190> playing<00:02:15.400> the

which is a wonderful playing the
double-decker<00:02:16.140> excellent<00:02:17.140> plane<00:02:17.410> but<00:02:18.040> my<00:02:18.220> own

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
double-decker excellent plane but my own

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.300 
double-decker excellent plane but my own
criticism<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.360> all<00:02:19.569> airplanes<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.650> they're

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
criticism of all airplanes is they're

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.370 
criticism of all airplanes is they're
getting<00:02:21.580> quarter-on-quarter<00:02:22.360> apart<00:02:23.230> from

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
getting quarter-on-quarter apart from

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.740 
getting quarter-on-quarter apart from
the<00:02:23.470> Boeing<00:02:23.650> 787<00:02:24.220> which<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.060> noisy<00:02:25.720> and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
the Boeing 787 which is noisy and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.260 
the Boeing 787 which is noisy and
horrible<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:27.160> they're<00:02:27.310> getting<00:02:27.400> quieter<00:02:28.120> and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
horrible but they're getting quieter and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.990 
horrible but they're getting quieter and
quieter<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:29.440> why<00:02:29.739> can't<00:02:30.010> they<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.700> know<00:02:30.850> when

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
quieter but why can't they you know when

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.820 
quieter but why can't they you know when
you<00:02:31.090> get<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.390> rushing<00:02:32.080> noise<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.590> all<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
you get that rushing noise of all the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.010 
you get that rushing noise of all the
air<00:02:32.950> rushing<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.580> surely<00:02:34.239> they<00:02:34.390> can<00:02:34.569> find<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
air rushing in surely they can find a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.470 
air rushing in surely they can find a
way<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.860> get<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.130> air<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:37.209> sort<00:02:37.390> of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
way to get the air in just sort of

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.160 
way to get the air in just sort of
wafting<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.290> very<00:02:39.010> quietly<00:02:39.450> anyway<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:41.140> was

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
wafting in very quietly anyway that was

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.800 
wafting in very quietly anyway that was
my<00:02:41.290> idea<00:02:41.680> about<00:02:42.099> that<00:02:42.180> could<00:02:43.180> someone<00:02:43.630> please
