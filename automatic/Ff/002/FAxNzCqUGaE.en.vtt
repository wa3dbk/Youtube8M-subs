disadvantage into an advantage so that's

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.390 
disadvantage into an advantage so that's

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
really the best time to use invisibility

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.400 
really the best time to use invisibility
and<00:04:01.340> but<00:04:02.340> yeah<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.940> always<00:04:03.090> gotta<00:04:03.380> make<00:04:04.380> sure

it and in a lot of games sprinting is

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.880 
it and in a lot of games sprinting is
just<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.700> know<00:04:25.870> walking<00:04:26.870> faster<00:04:27.500> pretty<00:04:27.710> much

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
just you know walking faster pretty much

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.240 
just you know walking faster pretty much
but<00:04:28.160> in<00:04:28.430> crisis<00:04:29.210> sprinting<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.320> more<00:04:31.040> of<00:04:31.160> a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
but in crisis sprinting is more of a

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.700 
but in crisis sprinting is more of a
tool<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:32.120> got<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.420> know<00:04:32.780> how<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.080> use<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.560> you

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
tool you got to know how to use it you

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.050 
tool you got to know how to use it you
have<00:04:33.830> no<00:04:33.860> one<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.220> use<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.610> um<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:37.310> know<00:04:37.430> it's

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
have no one to use it um you know it's

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.140 
have no one to use it um you know it's
you<00:04:38.660> can't<00:04:38.960> just<00:04:39.200> sprint<00:04:39.820> everywhere<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:40.850> go

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
you can't just sprint everywhere you go

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.570 
you can't just sprint everywhere you go
because<00:04:41.870> then<00:04:42.080> you're<00:04:42.530> going<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:42.860> not<00:04:43.370> have

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
because then you're going to not have

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.180 
because then you're going to not have
your<00:04:43.730> abilities<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.260> want<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.620> save<00:04:45.980> your

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
your abilities so you want to save your

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.710 
your abilities so you want to save your
sprint<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:46.880> want<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.150> use<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:47.480> when<00:04:47.630> you

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
sprint and you want to use it when you

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.330 
sprint and you want to use it when you
really<00:04:47.990> need<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:50.380> also<00:04:51.380> another<00:04:52.160> thing

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
really need it and also another thing

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.060 
really need it and also another thing
that<00:04:52.910> can<00:04:53.090> really<00:04:53.360> help<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.900> is<00:04:54.170> map

that can really help you is map
knowledge<00:04:55.670> I<00:04:55.940> know<00:04:56.330> when<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.840> demo<00:04:57.020> there's

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
knowledge I know when the demo there's

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.060 
knowledge I know when the demo there's
only<00:04:57.470> one<00:04:57.740> map<00:04:58.040> but<00:04:58.550> I<00:04:59.410> assume<00:05:00.410> all<00:05:00.620> maps<00:05:00.860> in

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
only one map but I assume all maps in

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.320 
only one map but I assume all maps in
the<00:05:01.100> game<00:05:01.310> will<00:05:01.490> be<00:05:01.610> pretty<00:05:01.940> similar<00:05:02.360> um<00:05:02.600> I

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
the game will be pretty similar um I

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.220 
the game will be pretty similar um I
love<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.720> maps<00:05:05.930> because<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:08.270> maps<00:05:08.630> in<00:05:08.780> crisis

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
love the maps because the maps in crisis

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.310 
love the maps because the maps in crisis
they<00:05:09.800> have<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.550> many<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.300> many<00:05:11.360> routes<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.169> so

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
they have so many so many routes and so

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.130 
they have so many so many routes and so
many<00:05:12.440> ways<00:05:12.680> to<00:05:12.919> go<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.340> if<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.450> know<00:05:14.720> all<00:05:14.990> the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
many ways to go and if you know all the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.260 
many ways to go and if you know all the
routes<00:05:15.380> if<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:15.919> know<00:05:16.130> where<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:16.760> want<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.120> go

and you know the fastest route to get

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.770 
and you know the fastest route to get
there<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:19.340> know<00:05:19.580> where<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.450> enemies<00:05:20.750> are

there you know where the enemies are

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.650 
there you know where the enemies are
coming<00:05:21.169> from<00:05:21.290> you<00:05:21.530> know<00:05:21.680> escape<00:05:22.190> routes

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
coming from you know escape routes

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.730

you're going to have a major advantage
and<00:05:26.350> double<00:05:27.350> that<00:05:27.530> with<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:28.180> the

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
and double that with the the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.150 
and double that with the the
maneuverability<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:30.200> have<00:05:30.380> in<00:05:30.530> this<00:05:30.650> game<00:05:30.890> I

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
maneuverability you have in this game I

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.610 
maneuverability you have in this game I
mean<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.760> could<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.660> could<00:05:32.810> jump<00:05:33.200> you<00:05:33.440> could

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
mean you could you could jump you could

calm you could slide all that stuff and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.850 
calm you could slide all that stuff and

aware you have to know where they could

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.510 
aware you have to know where they could
possibly<00:05:59.120> coming<00:05:59.690> from<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:01.340> know<00:06:01.460> you

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
possibly coming from and you know you

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.679 
possibly coming from and you know you
have<00:06:01.700> to<00:06:01.820> play<00:06:02.000> some<00:06:02.180> mind<00:06:02.390> games

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:03.689 
have to play some mind games

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.269 
have to play some mind games
and<00:06:04.489> that's<00:06:05.489> about<00:06:05.699> all<00:06:05.969> four<00:06:06.769> basic<00:06:07.769> tips<00:06:08.039> I

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
and that's about all four basic tips I

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.089 
and that's about all four basic tips I
mean<00:06:08.459> you<00:06:09.119> could<00:06:09.299> go<00:06:09.509> a<00:06:09.749> lot<00:06:10.229> more<00:06:10.499> advanced

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
mean you could go a lot more advanced

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.559 
mean you could go a lot more advanced
once<00:06:11.369> you<00:06:11.580> start<00:06:11.879> getting<00:06:11.939> into<00:06:12.449> the

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
once you start getting into the

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.529 
once you start getting into the
different<00:06:13.259> perks<00:06:13.499> and<00:06:14.209> different<00:06:15.209> weapons

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:18.119 
and all that but for now going to keep

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.499 
and all that but for now going to keep
it<00:06:18.269> basic<00:06:18.419> maybe<00:06:19.110> i'll<00:06:19.349> do<00:06:19.529> another<00:06:19.799> one

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
it basic maybe i'll do another one

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:26.719 
it basic maybe i'll do another one
sometime<00:06:22.129> more<00:06:23.129> advanced<00:06:23.669> but<00:06:25.129> yeah<00:06:26.129> I<00:06:26.159> hope

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
sometime more advanced but yeah I hope
