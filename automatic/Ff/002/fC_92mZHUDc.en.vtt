00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.570
 lg launches the second version of his 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.580
 portable photo printer pocket 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 photo this communicating printer 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 bluetouff with your smartphone or with 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.060
 your tablet and she stands out by 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.189
 his paper since in the paper there is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.930
 layers of color crystals so 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.439
 there is no need for ink alone the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439
 paper enough 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.109
 the first strong point is the ease 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.329
 of implementation 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 just open the lid and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.059
 load the paper and close the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.590
 lid and it's done 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 the printer is ready to use 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.210
 then you just have to download a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.680
 application that is offered for free 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.059
 for android or for apple 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.649
 the second strong point is 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.700
 the application that is very well designed and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.440
 very easy to use 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.090
 once you have chosen the photo 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.449
 you can apply effects 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.309
 you can also change the border or 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 the background of the photo you can 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.570
 add the date you can add even 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 a QR code that will then allow you to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.010
 identify it with your smartphone 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 and you can also make settings 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.920
 classics like for example the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.600
 brightness or contrast 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 finally the third strong point is the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 nfc function if you are not equipped 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.509
 of nfc on your smartphone 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 Well you just have to press 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.350
 the print button of the application for 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.280
 start printing but if you are 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.080
 equipped with nfc 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.939
 just put the smartphone on 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 the printer and printing itself 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.710
 automatically triggers printing 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 it itself takes about 60 seconds but 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 we must also include the time of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.570
 bluetouff transmission that is enough 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.130
 variable it can vary between 40 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.130
 seconds and two minutes 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.659
 so the first point is done this is the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.170
 print quality already the pictures sound 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.630
 small since they are 5 cm by 7.6 cm 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.340
 and there have been problems with 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 colorimetry ie leblanc turns 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.930
 a little to the blues and on some 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.789
 colors there are problems of 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.689
 dynamic that make that for example one does not 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.340
 not see some details 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.500
 the second weak point is the cost 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.840
 print you have to shell out 12 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
 euros to buy 30 sheets and you 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960
 can not do otherwise because this 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.560
 are specific sheets for 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.049
 printer 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.420
 which amounts to 40 cents the 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:16.640
 final photo this lg printer 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.260
 is a bit of high-tech gadget but 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.330
 it is really very very simple 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.640
 to use and very nice application 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.930
 is really very well designed on 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 just regret that the quality 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.470
 printing is average and that the cost 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.470
 photos are a bit high
