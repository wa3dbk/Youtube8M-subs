00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.470 
downloaded the file I haven't brought
into<00:00:34.020> aperture<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.120> let's<00:00:36.120> take<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> quick

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
into aperture and let's take a quick

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.229 
into aperture and let's take a quick
look<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.350> file<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.860> some<00:00:38.040> stats<00:00:38.340> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
look at this file get some stats this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
look at this file get some stats this
was<00:00:39.420> taken<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> Canon<00:00:40.379> Rebel<00:00:40.410> t2i<00:00:42.020> EF<00:00:43.520> 2470

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
was taken with a Canon Rebel t2i EF 2470

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.110 
was taken with a Canon Rebel t2i EF 2470
f28<00:00:45.180> l<00:00:45.440> lens<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.890> ISO<00:00:47.399> 465<00:00:48.360> millimeters<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
f28 l lens at ISO 465 millimeters and

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
f28 l lens at ISO 465 millimeters and
1.33<00:00:51.120> expose<00:00:51.809> your<00:00:52.020> value<00:00:52.320> compensation<00:00:53.219> up

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
1.33 expose your value compensation up

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
1.33 expose your value compensation up
so<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:54.649> adjusting<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> exposure<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.280> make

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
so that's adjusting the exposure to make

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.080 
so that's adjusting the exposure to make
it<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.670> bright<00:00:57.199> f28<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.920> sixtieth<00:00:59.430> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it more bright f28 and at one sixtieth a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
it more bright f28 and at one sixtieth a
second<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> okay

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
second so there you have it okay

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
second so there you have it okay
so<00:01:02.879> let's<00:01:03.180> jump<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so let's jump right into some of the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
so let's jump right into some of the
adjustments<00:01:04.530> first<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.939> do

little bit and help bring out those

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.780 
little bit and help bring out those
edges<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.920> next<00:01:23.130> brick<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> list

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.280 
edges and the next brick in the list
here<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> white<00:01:24.330> balance<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.200> your

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
here is a white balance one for your

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
here is a white balance one for your
color<00:01:25.590> temperature<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:26.850> think

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
color temperature and I don't think

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
color temperature and I don't think
there's<00:01:27.210> anything<00:01:27.420> wrong<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.049> file<00:01:28.560> at

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
there's anything wrong with this file at

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
there's anything wrong with this file at
all<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.400> comes<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.570> color<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> white

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
all and comes to the color or the white

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260 
all and comes to the color or the white
balance<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.520> bugger<00:01:32.970> all

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
balance so I'm not going to bugger all

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.020 
balance so I'm not going to bugger all
of<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.930> always<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> check<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.850> the

of that I always like to check out the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.359 
of that I always like to check out the
exposure<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.990> an<00:01:37.170> aperture<00:01:37.799> gives<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
exposure here an aperture gives you the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.980 
exposure here an aperture gives you the
exposure<00:01:38.700> recovery<00:01:39.420> black<00:01:39.630> point<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
thing you can do is if the command
stroke<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.469> this

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
stroke here you can go and put on this

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
stroke here you can go and put on this
mask<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.640> shows<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.060> where<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.719> blown<00:02:01.110> out

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
mask that shows you where the blown out

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.230 
mask that shows you where the blown out
areas<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
areas are you can see that in the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.030 
areas are you can see that in the
histogram<00:02:03.570> here<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.140> how<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> kind<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
histogram here to how it kind of is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980 
histogram here to how it kind of is
blown<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.700> what<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.810> grab

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
blown out so what I like to do is I grab

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.990 
blown out so what I like to do is I grab
the<00:02:07.170> old<00:02:07.290> exposure<00:02:07.770> thing<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.700> drop

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the old exposure thing and I just drop

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
the old exposure thing and I just drop
that<00:02:09.030> right<00:02:09.450> back<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.899> until<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.679> just

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that right back down until it's just

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.270 
that right back down until it's just
about<00:02:11.099> gone<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.360> use<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> little<00:02:12.930> bit<00:02:13.050> of

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
about gone and I use a little bit of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.559 
about gone and I use a little bit of
every<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.670> kind<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.850> take<00:02:14.000> out<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.240> rest<00:02:14.420> of

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
every to kind of take out the rest of

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.180 
every to kind of take out the rest of
those<00:02:14.660> highlights<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.380> clean<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.860> up<00:02:15.920> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
those highlights and clean that up and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.970 
those highlights and clean that up and
and<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.180> tame<00:02:17.750> those<00:02:18.050> wild<00:02:18.440> ponies<00:02:18.740> bring

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
and and tame those wild ponies bring

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.650 
and and tame those wild ponies bring
them<00:02:19.130> back<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.459> okay

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
them back in okay

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.890 
them back in okay
once<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.590> done<00:02:21.890> then<00:02:22.490> what<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.090> will<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.569> is

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
once that is done then what I will do is

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.680 
once that is done then what I will do is
I'll<00:02:24.680> sneak<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.130> down<00:02:25.310> here<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.640> contrast<00:02:26.270> and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
I'll sneak on down here to contrast and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.550 
I'll sneak on down here to contrast and
I<00:02:27.410> will<00:02:27.620> pump<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.730> up<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:28.970> make<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:29.560> boom

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
I will pump that up and make it go boom

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.760 
I will pump that up and make it go boom
as<00:02:31.280> they<00:02:31.790> say<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> photos<00:02:32.600> photo<00:02:32.780> show<00:02:32.989> a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
as they say on a photos photo show a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.620 
as they say on a photos photo show a
little<00:02:34.160> bit<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.400> definition<00:02:34.489> -<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.450> bring

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
little bit of definition - just to bring

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.710 
little bit of definition - just to bring
out<00:02:35.720> some<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.050> those<00:02:36.140> things<00:02:37.420> vibrancy<00:02:38.420> I

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
out some of those things vibrancy I

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.840 
out some of those things vibrancy I
really<00:02:38.989> like<00:02:39.170> color<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.709> saturation<00:02:40.069> so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
really like color and saturation so

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.020 
really like color and saturation so
let's<00:02:41.030> bring<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.360> up<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:43.010> looks<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.489> bit<00:02:43.520> too

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
let's bring that up that looks a bit too

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.360 
let's bring that up that looks a bit too
much<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.750> we'll<00:02:45.050> scale<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.590> back<00:02:46.070> down<00:02:46.340> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
much so we'll scale that back down a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.210 
much so we'll scale that back down a
little<00:02:46.610> bit<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.180> nice<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.330> have<00:02:47.540> color

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
little bit but it's nice to have color

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.440 
little bit but it's nice to have color
what<00:02:49.220> else<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:49.580> do<00:02:49.670> here<00:02:49.820> I<00:02:49.880> think<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.269> can

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
what else can we do here I think we can

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.110 
what else can we do here I think we can
zoom<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.110> we<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.380> use<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.769> old<00:02:51.800> tone<00:02:52.519> curve<00:02:52.880> if

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
zoom in we can use the old tone curve if

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.420 
zoom in we can use the old tone curve if
we<00:02:53.180> wanted<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.480> do<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.260> kind<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.130> bring

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
we wanted to do that and kind of bring

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.220 
we wanted to do that and kind of bring
that<00:02:55.670> down<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.480> wee<00:02:56.750> bit<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:58.750> if<00:02:59.750> we<00:02:59.870> got<00:03:00.019> that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
that down a wee bit and if we got that

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.570 
that down a wee bit and if we got that
and<00:03:00.319> kind<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.500> bring<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.830> back<00:03:01.010> up<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.370> should

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
and kind of bring that back up it should

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.740 
and kind of bring that back up it should
help<00:03:03.160> brighten<00:03:04.160> up<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.670> overall<00:03:05.060> image<00:03:05.480> but

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
help brighten up this overall image but

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.420 
help brighten up this overall image but
yeah<00:03:05.930> Athol<00:03:06.260> somewhere<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:06.890> there<00:03:07.220> looks

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
yeah Athol somewhere in there looks

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.840 
yeah Athol somewhere in there looks
pretty<00:03:07.519> good<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.959> histogram<00:03:09.410> in<00:03:10.280> my<00:03:10.580> mind

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
pretty good the histogram in my mind

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.550 
pretty good the histogram in my mind
looks<00:03:11.090> pretty<00:03:11.540> good

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
looks pretty good

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.970 
looks pretty good
I<00:03:13.630> don't<00:03:14.630> think<00:03:14.720> I'm<00:03:15.319> gonna<00:03:15.440> mess<00:03:15.650> around<00:03:15.680> with

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
I don't think I'm gonna mess around with

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.880 
I don't think I'm gonna mess around with
the<00:03:16.100> levels<00:03:16.400> too<00:03:16.550> much<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.750> what<00:03:18.530> else<00:03:18.650> can<00:03:18.769> we

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
the levels too much so what else can we

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.289 
the levels too much so what else can we
do<00:03:19.010> here<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.250> think<00:03:19.579> one<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.000> coolest

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
do here I think one of the coolest

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.880 
do here I think one of the coolest
things<00:03:20.480> about<00:03:20.540> aperture<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.530> ability<00:03:21.860> to

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
things about aperture is the ability to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.000 
things about aperture is the ability to
use<00:03:22.720> apertures<00:03:23.720> brushes<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.590> kind<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.860> do

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
use apertures brushes to kind of do

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.120 
use apertures brushes to kind of do
selective<00:03:26.230> adjustments<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.530> it's<00:03:27.739> super<00:03:27.980> cool

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
selective adjustments so it's super cool

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.390 
selective adjustments so it's super cool
to<00:03:28.340> grab<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:28.850> Sacher<00:03:29.690> are<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.200> sharpen<00:03:30.709> one

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
to grab the Sacher are the sharpen one

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.620 
to grab the Sacher are the sharpen one
here<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:31.910> what<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.060> do<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.329> all<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.570> my

the image so what I do is I'll just grab
my<00:03:40.940> sharpen<00:03:41.600> thing<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.989> little<00:03:42.079> bit<00:03:42.290> of

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
my sharpen thing a little bit of

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.370 
my sharpen thing a little bit of
softness<00:03:42.859> in<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.780> settings<00:03:44.780> there<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.290> I'll

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
softness in the settings there and I'll

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.630 
softness in the settings there and I'll
just<00:03:45.530> go<00:03:45.680> I'll<00:03:45.799> do<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.070> I'll<00:03:46.190> just<00:03:46.310> kind<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.519> go

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
just go I'll do is I'll just kind of go

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.090 
just go I'll do is I'll just kind of go
over<00:03:46.730> right<00:03:46.970> around<00:03:47.359> the<00:03:47.690> outside<00:03:47.720> edge<00:03:48.530> of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
over right around the outside edge of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.550 
over right around the outside edge of
the<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.340> kind<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.090> bring<00:03:50.329> out<00:03:50.480> those<00:03:50.750> eyelashes

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
the I kind of bring out those eyelashes

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.620 
the I kind of bring out those eyelashes
and<00:03:52.310> I'll<00:03:52.579> usually<00:03:52.730> do<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.359> edge

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
and I'll usually do just that edge

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.580 
and I'll usually do just that edge
around<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:56.060> iris<00:03:56.540> too<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.109> kind<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.350> bring

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
around the the iris too to kind of bring

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.800 
around the the iris too to kind of bring
out<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.739> little<00:03:57.920> bit<00:03:58.160> more<00:03:58.390> sharpness<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.600> little

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
out a little bit more sharpness a little

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.080 
out a little bit more sharpness a little
bit<00:03:59.900> more<00:04:00.019> contrast<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.859> kind<00:04:01.070> of<00:04:01.190> look<00:04:01.850> in

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
bit more contrast you kind of look in

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.530 
bit more contrast you kind of look in
there<00:04:02.739> then<00:04:03.739> what<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.250> do<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:05.239> can<00:04:05.420> kind

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
there then what you do is you can kind

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.030 
there then what you do is you can kind
of<00:04:05.660> zoom<00:04:05.720> over<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:06.109> sue<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.440> looks<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:06.829> and

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
of zoom over to sue this looks like and

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.060 
of zoom over to sue this looks like and
it<00:04:07.100> does<00:04:07.280> make<00:04:07.519> those<00:04:07.730> eyes<00:04:07.940> just<00:04:08.239> go<00:04:08.390> pop<00:04:09.070> but

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
it does make those eyes just go pop but

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.009 
it does make those eyes just go pop but
almost<00:04:10.280> too<00:04:10.519> much<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.540> coolest<00:04:11.840> thing

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
almost too much so the coolest thing

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.160 
almost too much so the coolest thing
about<00:04:12.049> aperture<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:12.890> when<00:04:13.579> you<00:04:13.700> have<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
about aperture is when you have the the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.779 
about aperture is when you have the the
brick<00:04:15.410> that<00:04:15.560> shows<00:04:15.769> up<00:04:15.950> here<00:04:15.980> on<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> left<00:04:16.519> you

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
brick that shows up here on the left you

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.900 
brick that shows up here on the left you
can<00:04:17.269> adjust<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.320> amount<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.799> sharpness<00:04:19.100> that

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
can adjust the amount of sharpness that

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.450 
can adjust the amount of sharpness that
you<00:04:20.060> have<00:04:20.239> brushed<00:04:20.630> in<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.590> can<00:04:22.039> kind<00:04:22.400> of

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
you have brushed in so you can kind of

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.860 
you have brushed in so you can kind of
if<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.669> don't<00:04:22.880> like<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.180> want<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.419> have<00:04:23.539> more

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
if you don't like you want to have more

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.000 
if you don't like you want to have more
and<00:04:24.110> really<00:04:24.349> make<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.530> look<00:04:24.620> like<00:04:24.800> she's<00:04:24.979> a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
and really make it look like she's a

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.810 
and really make it look like she's a
raccoon<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.610> you

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
raccoon and you

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.060 
raccoon and you
do<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.180> or<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.900> can<00:04:27.020> drop<00:04:27.170> it<00:04:27.350> back<00:04:27.470> down<00:04:27.530> you

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
do that or you can drop it back down you

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.430 
do that or you can drop it back down you
kind<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.340> see<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.000> adjustment<00:04:29.780> there<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.230> I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
kind of see the adjustment there so I

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.350 
kind of see the adjustment there so I
think<00:04:30.920> I'm<00:04:31.070> going<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.250> leave<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:32.000> a

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
think I'm going to leave it just a

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.970 
think I'm going to leave it just a
little<00:04:32.870> bit<00:04:32.990> there<00:04:33.260> just<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.530> little<00:04:33.710> bit<00:04:33.800> under

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
little bit there just a little bit under

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.240 
little bit there just a little bit under
so<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:35.060> eyes<00:04:35.210> are<00:04:35.240> definitely<00:04:35.810> popping<00:04:36.250> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
so the eyes are definitely popping the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.680 
so the eyes are definitely popping the
other<00:04:37.400> adjustment<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.120> would<00:04:38.300> like<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.600> do

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
other adjustment that I would like to do

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.170 
other adjustment that I would like to do

now all acts out of that and then we'll

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.280 
now all acts out of that and then we'll

bring up the the retouch brush and we'll
repair<00:05:28.400> and<00:05:28.910> so<00:05:29.090> we'll<00:05:29.240> select<00:05:29.450> our<00:05:30.070> point

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070

I'm not going to worry too much about it
today<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:48.740> probably<00:05:49.580> would<00:05:49.790> get<00:05:49.910> rid<00:05:50.060> of<00:05:50.090> that

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
today I probably would get rid of that

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.710 
today I probably would get rid of that
if<00:05:50.450> this<00:05:50.540> was<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.780> real<00:05:52.030> photo<00:05:53.030> for<00:05:53.210> a<00:05:53.240> client<00:05:53.630> or

if this was a real photo for a client or

if this was a real photo for a client or
something<00:05:53.870> like<00:05:54.080> that<00:05:54.230> but<00:05:54.470> overall<00:05:55.100> it's<00:05:55.280> not

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
something like that but overall it's not

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.400 
something like that but overall it's not
too<00:05:55.520> shabby<00:05:55.810> what<00:05:56.810> else<00:05:56.930> can<00:05:57.050> we<00:05:57.110> do<00:05:57.230> to<00:05:57.290> this

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
too shabby what else can we do to this

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.990 
too shabby what else can we do to this
photo<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:58.160> think<00:05:58.340> it's<00:05:58.460> looking<00:05:58.580> pretty<00:05:58.850> good

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.380 
photo I think it's looking pretty good
but<00:05:59.060> I<00:05:59.300> like<00:05:59.360> to<00:05:59.750> always<00:06:00.080> use<00:06:00.640> Nik<00:06:01.640> software<00:06:01.910> so

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.950 
almost like a vignette but they have a
really<00:06:21.230> cool<00:06:21.380> plug-in<00:06:21.740> here<00:06:21.950> called<00:06:22.960> bright

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
really cool plug-in here called bright

one<00:06:26.720> of<00:06:26.750> my<00:06:26.870> favorite<00:06:27.260> ones<00:06:27.740> here<00:06:28.040> and<00:06:28.520> what

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
one of my favorite ones here and what

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.930 
one of my favorite ones here and what
you<00:06:29.210> do<00:06:29.360> is<00:06:29.540> you<00:06:29.990> grab<00:06:30.680> your<00:06:31.010> the<00:06:31.370> center<00:06:31.640> of

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
you do is you grab your the center of

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.730 
you do is you grab your the center of
where<00:06:32.180> you<00:06:32.300> want<00:06:32.510> the<00:06:32.780> focus<00:06:33.050> to<00:06:33.230> be<00:06:33.350> which<00:06:33.620> is

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
where you want the focus to be which is

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.370 
where you want the focus to be which is
of<00:06:33.860> course<00:06:34.070> right<00:06:34.730> there<00:06:35.060> boom<00:06:35.570> right<00:06:36.140> on<00:06:36.260> the

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
of course right there boom right on the

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.340 
of course right there boom right on the
eyes

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
eyes

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.770 
eyes
and<00:06:37.470> you<00:06:38.130> can<00:06:38.280> grab<00:06:38.640> the<00:06:38.940> slider<00:06:39.210> for<00:06:39.510> border

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
and you can grab the slider for border

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.250 
and you can grab the slider for border
luminosity<00:06:40.560> and<00:06:40.950> you<00:06:41.940> can<00:06:42.120> just<00:06:42.270> bring<00:06:42.660> down

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
luminosity and you can just bring down

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.130 
luminosity and you can just bring down
and<00:06:44.220> that'll<00:06:44.610> make<00:06:44.760> all<00:06:45.000> of<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.330> background

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
and that'll make all of the background

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.940 
and that'll make all of the background
or<00:06:46.320> the<00:06:46.380> out-of-focus<00:06:46.790> elements<00:06:48.650> decrease<00:06:49.650> in

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
or the out-of-focus elements decrease in

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.220 
or the out-of-focus elements decrease in
in<00:06:50.520> brightness<00:06:50.790> also<00:06:51.720> will<00:06:51.810> adjust<00:06:52.050> the

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
in brightness also will adjust the

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.810 
in brightness also will adjust the
center<00:06:52.560> size<00:06:52.770> down<00:06:53.130> so<00:06:53.340> it's<00:06:53.460> just<00:06:53.640> kind<00:06:53.790> of

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
center size down so it's just kind of

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.720 
center size down so it's just kind of
more<00:06:54.030> centrally<00:06:54.480> located<00:06:54.840> on<00:06:55.020> her<00:06:55.170> face<00:06:55.730> okay

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
more centrally located on her face okay

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.690 
more centrally located on her face okay
and<00:06:57.560> we'll<00:06:58.560> drop<00:06:58.740> the<00:06:58.950> border<00:06:59.280> a<00:06:59.310> luminosity

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
and we'll drop the border a luminosity

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.800 
and we'll drop the border a luminosity
bit<00:07:00.000> more<00:07:00.150> so<00:07:00.270> you<00:07:00.330> get<00:07:00.420> this<00:07:00.510> really<00:07:00.690> cool

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
bit more so you get this really cool

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.740 
bit more so you get this really cool
kind<00:07:01.440> of<00:07:01.530> more<00:07:01.740> more<00:07:02.400> selective<00:07:03.150> vignette

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
kind of more more selective vignette

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.900 
kind of more more selective vignette
happening<00:07:04.230> so<00:07:05.010> there's<00:07:05.190> a<00:07:05.250> preview<00:07:05.490> of<00:07:05.700> what

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
happening so there's a preview of what

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.850 
happening so there's a preview of what
we've<00:07:06.030> done<00:07:06.240> okay<00:07:06.840> so<00:07:07.140> just<00:07:07.350> kind<00:07:07.530> of<00:07:07.560> darkened

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
we've done okay so just kind of darkened

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.440 
we've done okay so just kind of darkened
I'm<00:07:07.920> going<00:07:08.040> to<00:07:08.100> darken<00:07:08.280> it<00:07:08.430> even<00:07:08.790> more<00:07:09.030> just<00:07:09.390> to

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
I'm going to darken it even more just to

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.970 
I'm going to darken it even more just to
get<00:07:09.540> more<00:07:09.750> contrast<00:07:10.290> because<00:07:10.590> I<00:07:10.740> think<00:07:10.890> that

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
get more contrast because I think that

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.000 
get more contrast because I think that
looks<00:07:11.160> super<00:07:11.430> cool<00:07:12.140> okay<00:07:13.140> so<00:07:13.380> there<00:07:13.830> you<00:07:13.980> have

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
looks super cool okay so there you have
