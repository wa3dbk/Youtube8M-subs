00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.120
 places 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.770
 then there began the interventions 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.380
 ours started that we had to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.220
 do this today and is to create a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.559
 new one that was not just a 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.600
 revitalization of the former using 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.330
 which existed but that it was a detail 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.790
 what if you project your future so 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.250
 we have 43 thousand places 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.949
 we have to increase 10,000 places in the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.489
 same space that they have a project of 36 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.070
 thousand 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.620
 then the magic began, then they were 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.519
 was removed from the roof to cover 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 old 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.800
 therefore after 6 were removed 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.040
 and this has generated these three 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.479
 miracles voted voted approx. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 two million more of the places where 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.860
 were the teachers who also 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.510
 reported that let's say 4min 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 we stayed at all levels 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.520
 all the public are aware of the duty of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.909
 become orders for all the elements and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.310
 logistics and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.760
 with this we achieved a stage of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.650
 43 thousand seats and was a fifa testimonial 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.380
 and that the increase also in the club 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.300
 because for example one a cup final 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.400
 can only be used in a 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.230

 this theme of the legacy is was and always will be 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.520
 our main purpose 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.409
 urban intervention was not good 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.600

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.660
 areas that are not many but have to 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.660
 be just correct with no goals for the game 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.810
 35 cabins create the new one

 people each one of them 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.990
 this grass he existed gave up two 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.010
 and a half years is ready was 2 us 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.930
 It is already ripe to his roots has 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.910
 possibly between 15 and 18 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.450
 hundreds of drawings implanted a month of 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.320
 January so far and he is the shorts 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.290
 which is the grass lived curitiba is the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.420
 city ​​of the world that has more 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.550
 cold weather time is more time to 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.690
 use of lawn with grass with 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.430
 winter grass 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.770
 We have five months he will play. 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.230
 about bermuda that happens in the other 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.060
 seven months we do one of campinho 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.150
 Xai Grassi that O is a winter grass 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.490
 which was intertwined mute snake because 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.630
 she shorts serves as support for drought 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.390
 grace then it creates a dense mesh 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.240
 which allows what it is thanks to him and 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.220
 roots in the formula itself and grow 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.460
 only in the winter said that any 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.190
 cob bermuda sheet decreases and is 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.800
 dying then grow the leaf of the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.480
 Thanks and stay in winter now you can go to 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.930
 world cup I do not know that certainly

 today we will play with the whole pitch of 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:44.030
 fall grace but it is not for free 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.030
 only he will fall back on shame 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.380
 we made a water catchment affiliates 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.130
 with this surface 108 thousand meters 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.820
 squares that we have the ceiling we turned 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.830
 self-sufficient in terms of water 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.720
 rainwater and therefore could have 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.540
 sustainability of our certification 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.860
 leed was a one score we won 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.140
 very strong 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.420
 the term rainwater revolution throughout 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.250
 irrigation of the field all feed 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.340
 The entire state's water will be ours. 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.620
 and it also serves as a restraint 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.640
 of floods and also the gray water 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.200
 are recovered 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.780
 in this sense, sustainability 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.230
 from the point of view of water was newcomers 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.230
 caution 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.060
 this kind of arenas as it has today where the 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.300
 people are taking a distance to the 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.060
 playing field and 6 meters wide 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:41.240
 laterally both compact sand 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:44.539
 vibrant, and is very inspired by the 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.879
 our metaphor of the cauldron this is 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.860
 a cauldron with all the fans 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:51.319
 present on the field so we wanted to 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.250
 keep this spirit of the crowd very 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.250
 present in office
