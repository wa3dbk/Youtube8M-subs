00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.920
 Hello everybody 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.180
 because the building zones of parrot originally 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.340
 no lighting brings and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.990
 the attitude detection these difficult 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 is because I like to go with you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.779
 simple led stripes fix the whole thing 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.570
 can 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.059
 These run on 12 volt at 5 cm and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.809
 fit perfectly among the authors 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.440
 we will solder the wires in the wood afterwards 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 together 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.840
 we are on the booms with 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.309
 Seconds glue fastens the circuit 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.980
 with directly under the title of the middle 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.289
 capital city at construction micro switch 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 between the two supply lines 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 and so can if the battery too 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.079
 the lighting is always on 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.010
 on and off at paul me now 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010
 my battery come out 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.500
 if the whole afterwards glued clean 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.880
 is and with black paint color 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.110
 was then deleted and sell 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.630
 to see here we still see so 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.100
 On the other hand, the cable people know when you are 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.690
 so the housing here a bit 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.150
 you can also edit that 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.150
 nice to integrate into the housing 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.000
 from the respective direction you can see 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.700
 then always two led speaks from the beginning 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.560
 you see two white and one red and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.970
 from behind you can see two red and 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.970
 one at celtic 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.320
 you do not need a lot of money 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.360
 a little bit of time maybe a two 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.460
 hours depending on someone's the whole field 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.910
 can and you have profiles 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.910
 lighting
