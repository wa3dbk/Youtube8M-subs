00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
gauges or anything like that but it's

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.149 
gauges or anything like that but it's
not<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.080> small<00:00:56.320> that<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.530> can't<00:00:56.710> really<00:00:56.860> carry

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
or a wire port for that so that you want

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.740 
or a wire port for that so that you want
to<00:02:02.530> run<00:02:02.680> your<00:02:02.800> wires<00:02:03.010> up<00:02:03.300> into<00:02:04.300> your<00:02:04.390> helmet

you can do that that way there as well

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.530 
you can do that that way there as well
and<00:02:06.790> then<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:06.940> might<00:02:07.120> notice<00:02:07.390> there's

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
on the sides and that actually will hold

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.309 
on the sides and that actually will hold
the<00:04:49.030> bag<00:04:49.180> shape<00:04:49.509> see<00:04:49.749> how<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:49.960> kind<00:04:50.080> of<00:04:50.169> holds

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
the bag shape see how it kind of holds

the bag shape see how it kind of holds
the<00:04:50.560> bag<00:04:50.740> open<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:52.330> that's<00:04:52.419> going<00:04:52.749> to

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
the bag open and that's going to

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.469 
the bag open and that's going to
basically<00:04:52.990> keep<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.949> bag<00:04:54.129> up<00:04:54.580> nice<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.150> tall
