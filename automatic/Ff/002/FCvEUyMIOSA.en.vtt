00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.399 
do I like oh just colors like the only
difference<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> color<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.689> mean<00:01:46.229> that's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
difference is the color so I mean that's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.929 
difference is the color so I mean that's
something<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.579> huge<00:01:47.670> fan<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
something I'm not really a huge fan of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.130 
something I'm not really a huge fan of
plus<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.020> looks<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.680> bit<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.899> cheap<00:01:51.899> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
plus it looks a little bit like cheap I
do<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.710> they're<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.159> overpriced<00:01:53.729> for

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
do think they're kind of overpriced for

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.830 
do think they're kind of overpriced for
what<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.240> cuz<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.570> made

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
what they are cuz we made

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.109 
what they are cuz we made
like<00:01:55.289> like<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> nylon<00:01:56.310> material<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.939> don't

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.190 
durable but it is wearing at the bottom
like<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> holes<00:02:06.569> where<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> put<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.109> the

relationship for them I think I I won't
probably<00:02:13.799> repurchase<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.580> after<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.000> I'll

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
probably repurchase one after this I'll

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.570 
probably repurchase one after this I'll
just<00:02:15.360> stick<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.660> other<00:02:15.810> more<00:02:16.560> unique<00:02:17.040> bags<00:02:17.310> I
