00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
hopefully as you can see I don't have an

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.540 
hopefully as you can see I don't have an
interior<00:00:36.629> yet<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.530> coming<00:00:37.890> along<00:00:38.069> quite

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
interior yet but it's coming along quite

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.790 
interior yet but it's coming along quite
nicely<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> outside<00:00:39.479> and<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.620> want

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
nicely on the outside and I really want

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
nicely on the outside and I really want
to<00:00:40.859> add<00:00:40.949> a<00:00:40.979> pool<00:00:41.249> to<00:00:41.519> it<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.850> hopefully<00:00:42.269> we<00:00:42.870> can

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
to add a pool to it so hopefully we can

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
to add a pool to it so hopefully we can
do<00:00:43.289> that<00:00:43.440> pretty<00:00:43.739> easily<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.429> I<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.729> can

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
do that pretty easily and I know we can

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.829 
do that pretty easily and I know we can
because<00:00:45.149> I've<00:00:45.239> already<00:00:45.449> tried<00:00:45.569> it<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.809> but

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
because I've already tried it out but

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.319 
because I've already tried it out but
the<00:00:46.829> pool<00:00:46.979> tool<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.429> so<00:00:47.609> awesome<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> sims

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
we actually have a triangle pool that

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.220 
we actually have a triangle pool that
actually<00:01:13.650> gives<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.340> diagonal<00:01:15.230> angular

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
actually gives you the diagonal angular

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.590 
actually gives you the diagonal angular
look<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.190> your<00:01:17.310> pools<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> take<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
look to your pools and if you take a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.830 
look to your pools and if you take a
triangle<00:01:19.140> pool<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:20.520> drag<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.300> one

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
triangle pool and you drag it out on one

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.590 
triangle pool and you drag it out on one
side<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.130> drag<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:24.120> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
side and then you drag it out here you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
side and then you drag it out here you
can<00:01:24.720> actually<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.290> multiple<00:01:25.800> angles<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.760> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
can actually get multiple angles so it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.940 
can actually get multiple angles so it
kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> forms<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.780> coolest<00:01:28.200> shape<00:01:28.410> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
kind of forms this coolest shape that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.650 
kind of forms this coolest shape that
you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.370> pull<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.730> even<00:01:30.120> further<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
you can then pull out even further and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.380 
you can then pull out even further and
make<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> nice<00:01:31.080> pool<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:32.190> are<00:01:32.370> no<00:01:32.520> curved<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
make a nice pool there are no curved and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
make a nice pool there are no curved and
um<00:01:33.930> yet<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.800> are<00:01:34.830> no<00:01:34.920> curved<00:01:35.280> pools<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
um yet there are no curved pools in the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.320 
um yet there are no curved pools in the
sims<00:01:36.120> for<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.230> further<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
sims for going in further we have a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.630 
sims for going in further we have a
diagonal<00:01:39.380> yes<00:01:40.380> we're<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> pool<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.460> first

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
diagonal yes we're a pool actually first

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.540 
diagonal yes we're a pool actually first
this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.450> similar<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.410> pool<00:01:43.890> tool<00:01:44.130> except

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
this is similar to the pool tool except

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.070 
this is similar to the pool tool except
that<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.420> drag<00:01:45.660> it<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.900> like

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
that you actually can drag it out like

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.520 
that you actually can drag it out like
this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
this
much<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.920> your<00:01:47.100> room<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.940> roof<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.690> then

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
much like your room or a roof and then

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.930 
much like your room or a roof and then
you<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.220> same<00:01:50.460> thing<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
you also have the same thing in a

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.700 
you also have the same thing in a
diagonal<00:01:51.210> fashion<00:01:51.540> where<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.560> actually

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
diagonal fashion where you can actually

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.280 
diagonal fashion where you can actually
just<00:01:53.250> place<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.630> pull<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.140> all

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
just place it down and pull it in all

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.710 
just place it down and pull it in all
four<00:01:55.590> directions<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:56.760> lastly<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.510> have

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
four directions and then lastly we have

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.230 
four directions and then lastly we have
the<00:01:58.020> octagonal<00:01:58.530> pool<00:01:59.100> which<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.760> really<00:02:00.090> nice

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the octagonal pool which is really nice

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.550 
the octagonal pool which is really nice
because<00:02:00.300> it<00:02:00.690> gives<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.050> really<00:02:01.380> nice

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
because it gives you a really nice

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.500 
because it gives you a really nice
starting<00:02:01.979> point<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.490> some<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.270> unique

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
starting point for some really unique

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.990 
starting point for some really unique
looking<00:02:04.020> pools<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.220> can<00:02:05.370> pull<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.729> on

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
looking pools and you can pull it out on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.119 
looking pools and you can pull it out on
all<00:02:06.240> eight<00:02:06.600> sides<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.800> make<00:02:07.950> these

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
all eight sides and then make these

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.360 
all eight sides and then make these
really<00:02:08.310> funky<00:02:08.879> looking<00:02:09.179> shapes<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:11.009> far<00:02:11.310> as

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
about it for for those I really like I

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.089 
about it for for those I really like I
said<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.260> can't<00:03:46.470> really<00:03:46.560> figure<00:03:46.829> out<00:03:46.859> which

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
said I can't really figure out which

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.770 
said I can't really figure out which
ones<00:03:47.340> are<00:03:47.489> exactly<00:03:48.030> new<00:03:48.239> when<00:03:48.419> which<00:03:48.569> ones

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
ones are exactly new when which ones

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.159 
ones are exactly new when which ones
have<00:03:48.900> been<00:03:48.959> there<00:03:49.730> um<00:03:50.790> now<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:51.329> far<00:03:51.569> as<00:03:51.629> pools

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
have been there um now as far as pools

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.259 
have been there um now as far as pools
go<00:03:52.410> that's<00:03:52.620> about<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.980> but<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.970> are<00:03:54.000> some

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
go that's about it but there are some

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.849 
go that's about it but there are some
really<00:03:54.419> nice<00:03:54.599> creative<00:03:55.230> things<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.769> do

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
really nice creative things you can do

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.800 
really nice creative things you can do
with<00:03:55.980> pools<00:03:56.220> now<00:03:56.430> as<00:03:56.609> well<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:57.419> one<00:03:57.540> thing

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
with pools now as well for one thing

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.099 
with pools now as well for one thing
that's<00:03:58.139> super<00:03:58.739> super<00:03:59.489> awesome<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.930> you

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
that's super super awesome is that you

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.890 
that's super super awesome is that you
can<00:04:01.349> basically<00:04:01.590> place<00:04:02.160> pools<00:04:02.579> on<00:04:02.970> top<00:04:03.660> of

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
can basically place pools on top of

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
can basically place pools on top of
houses<00:04:04.199> or<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.829> between<00:04:05.040> floors<00:04:05.730> which<00:04:06.359> is

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
houses or in between floors which is

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.089 
houses or in between floors which is
incredible<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.260> that's<00:04:07.709> something<00:04:07.949> that's

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
incredible and that's something that's

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.770 
incredible and that's something that's
really<00:04:08.220> awesome<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.879> have<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.299> sims<00:04:09.510> form

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
really awesome to have in the sims form

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.080 
really awesome to have in the sims form
so<00:04:10.410> all<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.799> have<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:10.980> do<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.220> build<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.699> room

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
so all you have to do is build a room

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.439 
so all you have to do is build a room
and<00:04:12.389> I'm<00:04:13.049> actually<00:04:13.230> going<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.519> think<00:04:15.239> I'm

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
and I'm actually going to I think I'm

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.330 
and I'm actually going to I think I'm
going<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.720> move<00:04:16.019> into<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.560> different<00:04:16.919> lot<00:04:17.130> for

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
going to move into a different lot for

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.469 
going to move into a different lot for
this<00:04:17.459> because<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:17.910> think<00:04:18.060> it'll<00:04:18.180> be<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> little

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
this because I think it'll be a little

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.020 
this because I think it'll be a little
bit<00:04:18.599> easier<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.229> do<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.579> I've<00:04:20.699> moved<00:04:20.910> on

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
bit easier to do that so I've moved on

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.550 
bit easier to do that so I've moved on
to<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> different<00:04:21.299> lot<00:04:21.810> here<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.530> show

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
to a different lot here so I can show

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.439 
to a different lot here so I can show
you<00:04:22.830> how<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.190> use<00:04:23.460> pools<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:24.000> little<00:04:24.210> bit<00:04:24.330> more

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
you how to use pools a little bit more

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.450 
you how to use pools a little bit more
efficiently<00:04:24.900> so<00:04:25.710> all<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:25.979> have<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.190> do<00:04:26.310> is

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
efficiently so all you have to do is

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.300 
efficiently so all you have to do is
drag<00:04:26.760> out<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.300> wall<00:04:28.050> or<00:04:28.409> a<00:04:28.469> room<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.950> should<00:04:28.979> say

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
drag out a wall or a room I should say

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.380 
drag out a wall or a room I should say
like<00:04:30.180> that

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
like that

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.840 
like that
and<00:04:31.480> all<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.320> have<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.560> do<00:04:32.650> from<00:04:32.800> here<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.340> take

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
and all you have to do from here is take

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.090 
and all you have to do from here is take
a<00:04:33.880> pool<00:04:34.150> or<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> pool<00:04:35.140> tool<00:04:35.440> or<00:04:35.740> whatever<00:04:36.010> you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
a pool or a pool tool or whatever you

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.130 
a pool or a pool tool or whatever you
want<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.850> drag<00:04:37.390> it<00:04:37.540> out<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.930> can<00:04:38.050> also

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
want to do and drag it out you can also

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.200 
want to do and drag it out you can also
take<00:04:38.560> any<00:04:38.890> of<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.220> pool<00:04:39.460> types<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.180> just

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
take any of the pool types and just

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.570 
take any of the pool types and just
place<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.780> down<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.080> drag<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.770> around<00:04:41.920> as<00:04:42.370> well

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
place it down and drag it around as well

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.800 
place it down and drag it around as well
which<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:43.570> also<00:04:43.750> really<00:04:44.380> neat<00:04:45.510> same<00:04:46.510> goes<00:04:46.780> for

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
which is also really neat same goes for

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.260 
which is also really neat same goes for
this<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.320> well<00:04:47.500> you<00:04:47.710> place<00:04:48.040> it<00:04:48.220> down<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.700> drag

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
this as well you place it down and drag

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.140 
this as well you place it down and drag
it<00:04:49.480> out<00:04:49.600> in<00:04:49.720> all<00:04:49.810> sorts<00:04:50.080> of<00:04:50.140> directions

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
it out in all sorts of directions

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.790 
it out in all sorts of directions
pulling<00:04:52.150> out<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.390> pool<00:04:52.570> further<00:04:53.020> from<00:04:53.350> this<00:04:53.530> I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
pulling out the pool further from this I

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.320 
pulling out the pool further from this I
don't<00:04:54.130> know<00:04:54.310> if<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.580> creates<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.880> wall<00:04:55.030> yes<00:04:55.210> it

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
don't know if it creates a wall yes it

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.420 
don't know if it creates a wall yes it
does<00:04:55.450> so<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.930> basically<00:04:56.320> will<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:56.620> create<00:04:57.160> a

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
does so it basically will just create a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.690 
does so it basically will just create a
new<00:04:58.120> wall<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.720> expand<00:04:59.200> out<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.770> house<00:04:59.950> so

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
new wall to expand out the house so

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.780 
new wall to expand out the house so
pools<00:05:01.180> worked<00:05:01.540> very<00:05:01.840> well<00:05:01.930> with<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.650> inn<00:05:03.250> and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
pools worked very well with the inn and

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.130 
pools worked very well with the inn and
you<00:05:03.880> know<00:05:04.000> they<00:05:04.210> work<00:05:04.360> really<00:05:04.540> well<00:05:04.780> in

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
you know they work really well in

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.900 
you know they work really well in
conjunction<00:05:05.620> with<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.100> walls<00:05:06.280> in<00:05:06.550> this<00:05:06.700> game

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
conjunction with the walls in this game

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.330 
conjunction with the walls in this game
so<00:05:07.660> that's<00:05:07.780> really<00:05:08.110> nice<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.680> see<00:05:08.920> you

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
so that's really nice to see you

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.920 
so that's really nice to see you
actually<00:05:09.520> get<00:05:09.910> three<00:05:10.060> different<00:05:10.270> types<00:05:10.720> of

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
actually get three different types of

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.800 
actually get three different types of
depths<00:05:11.380> with<00:05:11.530> pools<00:05:11.830> now<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.450> course<00:05:13.630> you

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
depths with pools now so of course you

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.620 
depths with pools now so of course you
have<00:05:13.840> your<00:05:14.110> tall<00:05:14.380> pool<00:05:14.800> which<00:05:15.580> basically<00:05:16.030> goes

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
have your tall pool which basically goes

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.860 
have your tall pool which basically goes
along<00:05:16.900> with<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.260> tall<00:05:17.530> walls<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:19.690> know<00:05:19.810> of

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
along with the tall walls you know of

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.450 
along with the tall walls you know of
course<00:05:20.050> with<00:05:20.200> your<00:05:20.440> short<00:05:20.680> walls<00:05:20.890> as<00:05:21.070> well<00:05:21.250> and

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
course with your short walls as well and

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.430 
course with your short walls as well and
your<00:05:21.550> medium<00:05:21.940> height<00:05:22.120> walls<00:05:22.360> so<00:05:23.050> basically

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
your medium height walls so basically

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.320 
your medium height walls so basically
just<00:05:23.770> giving<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.580> three<00:05:25.030> different

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
just giving you the three different

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.880 
just giving you the three different
options<00:05:25.480> for<00:05:25.930> Heights<00:05:26.170> just<00:05:26.530> like<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.770> get

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
options for Heights just like you get

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.130 
options for Heights just like you get
with<00:05:27.040> walls<00:05:27.340> of<00:05:27.610> course<00:05:27.820> because<00:05:28.210> they<00:05:28.930> can

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
with walls of course because they can

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.990 
with walls of course because they can
interconnect<00:05:29.680> with<00:05:29.950> walls<00:05:30.190> now<00:05:30.460> so<00:05:30.790> that's

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
interconnect with walls now so that's

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.320 
interconnect with walls now so that's
really<00:05:31.210> neat<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:32.490> if<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.640> delete<00:05:33.820> pools<00:05:34.090> they

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
really neat and if you delete pools they

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.800 
really neat and if you delete pools they
basically<00:05:34.660> will<00:05:35.280> F<00:05:36.280> up<00:05:36.520> your<00:05:36.760> your<00:05:37.240> houses<00:05:37.660> but

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
basically will F up your your houses but

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.800 
basically will F up your your houses but
that's<00:05:37.990> okay<00:05:38.290> I<00:05:38.320> guess<00:05:39.450> they<00:05:40.450> work<00:05:40.660> really

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
that's okay I guess they work really

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.060 
that's okay I guess they work really
well<00:05:40.930> though<00:05:41.200> I'm<00:05:41.320> really<00:05:41.440> happy<00:05:41.710> with<00:05:41.920> how

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
well though I'm really happy with how

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.100 
well though I'm really happy with how
they're<00:05:42.280> integrated<00:05:42.760> of<00:05:42.880> course<00:05:43.630> you<00:05:43.960> can

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
they're integrated of course you can

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.310 
they're integrated of course you can
also<00:05:44.260> place<00:05:44.620> windows<00:05:45.220> on<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.520> side<00:05:45.730> as<00:05:46.000> well

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
also place windows on the side as well

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.780 
also place windows on the side as well
any<00:05:47.320> windows<00:05:47.710> will<00:05:47.860> work<00:05:48.040> you<00:05:48.460> can<00:05:48.610> place

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
any windows will work you can place

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.180 
any windows will work you can place
these<00:05:48.970> small<00:05:49.300> windows<00:05:49.510> you<00:05:50.260> can<00:05:50.440> place<00:05:50.710> these

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
these small windows you can place these

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.370 
these small windows you can place these
little<00:05:51.460> portholes<00:05:51.940> it's<00:05:52.570> really<00:05:52.900> up<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.200> you

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
little portholes it's really up to you

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.560 
little portholes it's really up to you
of<00:05:53.680> course<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.160> best<00:05:54.580> ones<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:55.150> think<00:05:55.450> the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
of course the best ones I think the

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.190 
of course the best ones I think the
place<00:05:55.780> would<00:05:56.470> be<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.830> tall<00:05:58.200> contemporary

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
place would be the tall contemporary

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.500 
place would be the tall contemporary
windows<00:05:59.650> that<00:06:00.250> can<00:06:00.490> go<00:06:00.670> of<00:06:00.790> course<00:06:01.030> either<00:06:01.270> on

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
windows that can go of course either on

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.040 
windows that can go of course either on
the<00:06:01.630> top<00:06:01.810> or<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.140> bottom<00:06:02.320> and<00:06:02.850> then<00:06:03.850> if<00:06:04.540> you

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
the top or the bottom and then if you

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.570 
the top or the bottom and then if you
want<00:06:05.230> to<00:06:05.290> pick<00:06:05.440> any<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.950> taller<00:06:06.160> windows

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
want to pick any of the taller windows

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.300 
want to pick any of the taller windows
for<00:06:06.970> the<00:06:07.110> medium<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.290> tall<00:06:08.560> height<00:06:08.740> walls<00:06:09.010> you

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
for the medium and tall height walls you

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.090 
for the medium and tall height walls you
can<00:06:09.370> also<00:06:09.580> do<00:06:09.790> that<00:06:09.880> as<00:06:10.030> well<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:12.070> can

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
can also do that as well and you can

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.100 
can also do that as well and you can
really<00:06:12.220> make<00:06:12.430> a<00:06:12.790> really<00:06:13.300> nice<00:06:13.570> looking

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.720 

infinity<00:06:17.110> pool<00:06:17.260> I<00:06:17.320> guess<00:06:17.650> they<00:06:18.400> don't<00:06:18.520> quite

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
infinity pool I guess they don't quite

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.040 
infinity pool I guess they don't quite
go<00:06:18.880> to<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:19.090> top<00:06:19.270> of<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.480> wall<00:06:19.630> but<00:06:19.870> they're

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
go to the top of the wall but they're

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.800 
go to the top of the wall but they're
kind<00:06:20.290> of<00:06:20.440> infinity<00:06:20.950> like<00:06:21.160> and<00:06:21.430> of<00:06:22.420> course<00:06:22.630> you

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
kind of infinity like and of course you

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.570 
kind of infinity like and of course you
can<00:06:22.960> interconnect<00:06:23.500> your<00:06:23.800> houses<00:06:24.190> with<00:06:24.370> these

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
can interconnect your houses with these

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.030 
can interconnect your houses with these
and<00:06:24.910> make<00:06:25.450> some<00:06:25.720> really<00:06:25.900> cool<00:06:26.140> effects<00:06:26.590> where

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.500 
and make some really cool effects where
you<00:06:27.100> have<00:06:27.280> like<00:06:27.400> a<00:06:27.430> master<00:06:27.880> bedroom<00:06:28.000> with

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
you have like a master bedroom with

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.600 
you have like a master bedroom with
these<00:06:29.110> this<00:06:29.470> beautiful<00:06:29.920> view<00:06:30.130> of<00:06:30.280> the<00:06:30.400> pool

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
could make some decorative pools and

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.910 
could make some decorative pools and
what<00:06:43.750> I<00:06:43.780> mean<00:06:43.930> by<00:06:44.020> decorative<00:06:44.290> is<00:06:44.530> actually

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
what I mean by decorative is actually

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.150 
what I mean by decorative is actually
that

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
that

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.210 
that

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
you can make these cool porches and

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.000 
you can make these cool porches and
bring<00:06:48.580> up<00:06:48.760> the<00:06:48.880> foundation<00:06:49.450> tool<00:06:49.860> which<00:06:50.860> is

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
bring up the foundation tool which is

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.280 
bring up the foundation tool which is
right<00:06:51.220> here<00:06:51.250> and<00:06:51.640> bring<00:06:51.790> it<00:06:51.970> up<00:06:52.060> to<00:06:52.290> whatever

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
right here and bring it up to whatever

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.070 
right here and bring it up to whatever
height<00:06:53.560> you<00:06:53.590> want<00:06:53.830> to<00:06:54.070> really<00:06:54.400> and<00:06:54.990> then<00:06:55.990> you

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
height you want to really and then you

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.180 
height you want to really and then you
can<00:06:56.200> also<00:06:56.350> place<00:06:56.830> a<00:06:57.100> pool<00:06:58.770> inside<00:06:59.770> of<00:07:00.010> this

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
can also place a pool inside of this

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.640 
can also place a pool inside of this
foundation<00:07:00.850> and<00:07:01.060> pretty<00:07:01.930> much<00:07:02.080> make<00:07:02.350> a<00:07:02.380> nice

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
foundation and pretty much make a nice

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.590 
foundation and pretty much make a nice
pool<00:07:03.010> that<00:07:03.280> you<00:07:03.370> can't<00:07:03.670> actually<00:07:03.880> swim<00:07:04.450> in

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
pool that you can't actually swim in

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.060 
pool that you can't actually swim in
because<00:07:05.230> there's<00:07:05.380> no<00:07:05.440> stairs<00:07:05.740> there<00:07:05.950> to

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
because there's no stairs there to
