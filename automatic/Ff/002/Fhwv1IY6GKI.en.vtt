00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.370
 after seven years between discussions 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.839
 planning and projects 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 the new airport of conquest victory 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.300
 starts to life the works 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.309
 began in May of last year 70% of the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.960
 work has already been done 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.060
 some spaces are in phase of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.240
 completion of the landing and landing runway 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.580
 is more than 2 thousand meters long 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 and can extend up to 3 thousand 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.289
 on the sides are the service tracks 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 here at this point a section 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.360
 against the first fire in the bay 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.180
 to the new ANAC standards 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.420
 the structure of the new airport 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.129
 impress 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.950
 to get a sense of the size of this 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.840
 space we can make a comparative area 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.140
 total airport capacity already 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.390
 city is 700 thousand square meters already 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.940
 this new one reaches 6 million meters 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.050
 square an area almost nine times 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.329
 bigger 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.430
 while the works end the concern 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.510
 now is with the construction of the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.910
 passengers 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.609
 the service depends on a bid for 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 beginning to be done according to the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.030
 airports of the secretary of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.460
 state infrastructure the term 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.479
 provided for the bidding process 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.360
 progress of the work is until 2017 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.220
 expected date for the airport to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 has more than its infrastructure 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 all executed plus the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 passengers and then we started to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 operate the airport this is all within the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.259
 the plan to what is planned 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.619
 obviously can have is modifications 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.420
 changes more is by how I said 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.200
 previously we are inside a 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.780
 schedule has long been and has been 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 It is fulfilled all the goals during this 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 time a group of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.960
 entrepreneurs and representatives of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.850
 civil society in the municipality has 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.549
 accompanied by the development of the new 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.620
 airport from the beginning the expectation 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.690
 to achieve an even faster deadline 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.210
 accompanies step by step this descent 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.890
 of this work, we come here every month to 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.150
 people make a monthly report of what 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.530
 it's happening I think this is 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.750
 participation is important. 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.980
 that society be involved in works that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.690
 they are interesting 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.220
 this involves more than two million 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 inhabitants or which has in the region 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.260
 southwest part of northern minas gerais 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.970
 So what we want today is to charge the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.410
 notice of the airport and the company 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.900
 To do that, we'll do several 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.310
 Movements will come here will charge you 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.380
 we have an agenda will have audience 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.850
 public hearing on September 18 in the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.370
 of councilmen then we will do 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.020
 everything that society could articulate 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.780
 so that we can have this one 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.900
 terminated within one year 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.360
 so that in 2016 and not 2017 we have 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.280
 the great and victory of conquest 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.050
 the current airport pedro otacilio de 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.480
 figueiredo was built in the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.760
 the 1960s with the development of 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.210
 region also grew demand for 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.910
 service is expected around 350 thousand 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.580
 passengers year 2015 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.680
 early on, it was only 35,000 the new 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.440
 airport will be able to receive 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.900
 aircraft and may 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.510
 to meet this demand, everything was 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.670
 evaluated to choose the location that is 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.220
 about nine kilometers from the center of 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.510
 conquest as soon as the new airport 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.040
 start operating 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.980
 the pedro otacilio de figueiredo should 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.220
 stop working in the city this is a 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.950
 is a forecast that has already been made there 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.830
 in the master plan and possibly this 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.980
 current airport area will have another 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.560
 destination that still depends on the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.080
 documentation nautical define why 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.739
 the entire airport when it is installed 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.830
 when it is approved the area the area is 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.560
 patrimonial becomes the union ne 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.140
 the union has to answer for it 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.239
 when we already deactivate the airport 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.300
 the union has to make that deactivation 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.230
 also she can pass the city hall can 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.659
 move to the state 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.030
 another destination that is better with came 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.030
 which was interesting at the time
