exactly why I didn't have my nuke maybe
I<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.710> might<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.920> been<00:01:59.010> early<00:01:59.550> I<00:01:59.790> think

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I think it might have been early I think

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
I think it might have been early I think
I<00:02:00.330> might<00:02:00.480> have<00:02:00.570> been<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.720> low-level<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.500> maybe<00:02:02.220> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I might have been a low-level I maybe I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.220 
I might have been a low-level I maybe I
didn't<00:02:02.580> have<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.090> ability<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.630> unlock<00:02:03.900> it<00:02:04.110> yet

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
didn't have the ability to unlock it yet

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.950 
didn't have the ability to unlock it yet
no<00:02:04.620> that<00:02:05.490> can't<00:02:05.730> be<00:02:05.790> right<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.900> have

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
no that can't be right because I have

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.010 
no that can't be right because I have
the<00:02:07.230> m16<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.429> an<00:02:08.550> idiot<00:02:08.750> maybe<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> just

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the m16 so I'm an idiot maybe I just

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.420 
the m16 so I'm an idiot maybe I just

I hear the little click of calling in

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.280 
I hear the little click of calling in
the<00:03:41.270> airstrike<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:41.810> don't<00:03:41.959> know<00:03:42.020> if<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.140> guys

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
the airstrike I don't know if you guys

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.930 
the airstrike I don't know if you guys
knew<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.010> but<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.430> kind<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.640> makes<00:03:43.790> some

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
knew that but it kind of makes some

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.970 
knew that but it kind of makes some
collisions<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.200> I'm<00:03:45.350> pretty<00:03:45.530> sure<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.830> was

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
collisions and I'm pretty sure that was

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.090 
collisions and I'm pretty sure that was
him<00:03:46.540> if<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.630> wasn't<00:03:47.959> oh<00:03:48.050> well<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.440> still<00:03:48.680> killed

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
him if it wasn't oh well I still killed

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.490 
him if it wasn't oh well I still killed
someone<00:03:49.520> so<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.700> guess<00:03:49.940> that's<00:03:50.120> all<00:03:50.959> good<00:03:51.290> and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
someone so I guess that's all good and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.860 
someone so I guess that's all good and
then<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.650> hear<00:03:51.860> someone<00:03:51.890> up<00:03:52.340> here<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.510> shoot

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
then I hear someone up here and I shoot

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.150 
then I hear someone up here and I shoot
so<00:03:54.110> I'm<00:03:54.200> not<00:03:54.319> just<00:03:54.470> like<00:03:54.530> shooting<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:54.920> wall

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
so I'm not just like shooting the wall

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.430 
so I'm not just like shooting the wall
and<00:03:55.520> just<00:03:55.760> throwing<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.120> stun<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.720> didn't<00:03:57.319> hit

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
and just throwing a stun I didn't hit

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.710 
and just throwing a stun I didn't hit
anybody<00:03:57.650> but<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.010> knew<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:59.090> he<00:03:59.209> was<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.600> know

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
anybody but I knew that he was you know

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.750 
anybody but I knew that he was you know
if<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.140> know<00:04:00.319> that<00:04:00.350> someone's<00:04:00.920> waiting<00:04:01.610> for

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
if you know that someone's waiting for

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.870 
if you know that someone's waiting for
you<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:03.140> kind<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.860> makes<00:04:04.040> sense<00:04:04.130> not<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.489> go<00:04:04.730> up

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
you it kind of makes sense not to go up

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.610 
you it kind of makes sense not to go up
there<00:04:05.090> right<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.540> mean<00:04:05.810> cuz<00:04:06.230> they're<00:04:06.440> just

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
there right I mean cuz they're just

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.729 
there right I mean cuz they're just
gonna<00:04:07.269> be<00:04:08.269> waiting<00:04:08.600> for<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.930> waiting<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.560> kill

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
gonna be waiting for you waiting to kill

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.180 
gonna be waiting for you waiting to kill
you<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.269> in<00:04:11.269> my<00:04:11.480> opinion<00:04:11.959> it<00:04:12.230> made<00:04:12.380> sense<00:04:12.650> not

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
you so in my opinion it made sense not

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.009 
you so in my opinion it made sense not
to<00:04:13.220> go<00:04:13.489> up<00:04:13.670> there<00:04:13.880> because<00:04:14.030> especially<00:04:14.660> since

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
to go up there because especially since

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.440 
to go up there because especially since
I<00:04:15.110> didn't<00:04:15.319> hit<00:04:15.410> him<00:04:15.530> with<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.650> stun<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:17.269> just

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
I didn't hit him with a stun that just

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.789 
I didn't hit him with a stun that just
really<00:04:17.750> made<00:04:17.959> no<00:04:17.989> sense<00:04:18.350> he<00:04:18.530> was<00:04:18.620> probably

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
really made no sense he was probably

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.960 
really made no sense he was probably
just<00:04:19.070> waiting<00:04:19.250> for<00:04:19.400> me<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:19.730> he's<00:04:19.820> probably

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
just waiting for me and he's probably

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.400 
just waiting for me and he's probably
