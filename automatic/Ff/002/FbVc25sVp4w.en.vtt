and<00:00:56.300> rapid<00:00:57.300> changes<00:00:58.079> are<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.579> avoided<00:00:59.730> as

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and rapid changes are to be avoided as

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.260 
and rapid changes are to be avoided as
well<00:01:00.480> some<00:01:01.320> violin<00:01:01.920> players<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.000> fiddle

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
well some violin players and fiddle

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.649 
well some violin players and fiddle
players<00:01:03.510> will<00:01:04.470> actually<00:01:05.129> moisten<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.970> sponge

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
players will actually moisten a sponge

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.609 
players will actually moisten a sponge
and<00:01:07.080> put<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> inside<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.520> film<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.570> which<00:01:10.439> has

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and put it inside a film can which has

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.160 
and put it inside a film can which has
had<00:01:10.799> holes<00:01:11.070> drilled<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> keep<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.900> in

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
had holes drilled in it and keep that in

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
had holes drilled in it and keep that in
the<00:01:13.200> fiddle<00:01:13.619> case<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> idea<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the fiddle case and the idea is that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.710 
the fiddle case and the idea is that
that<00:01:15.689> moist<00:01:16.049> sponge<00:01:17.000> releases<00:01:18.000> water<00:01:18.330> vapor

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that moist sponge releases water vapor

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.020 
that moist sponge releases water vapor
into<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> environment<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:20.100> environment<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
into the environment of environment of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.310 
into the environment of environment of
the<00:01:21.180> fiddle<00:01:21.509> case<00:01:21.860> which<00:01:23.540> maintains<00:01:24.540> some

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the fiddle case which maintains some

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.219 
the fiddle case which maintains some
degree<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.770> humidity<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:26.759> especially

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
degree of humidity and that's especially

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
degree of humidity and that's especially
considered<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.950> considered<00:01:29.549> an

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
considered that's considered an

fiddle during the winter it's good to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.210 
fiddle during the winter it's good to
avoid<00:02:35.940> leaving<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.690> violin<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.440> direct

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.390 
violins but the darker it is the more it
can<00:02:43.890> act<00:02:44.069> like<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.400> solar<00:02:44.790> collector<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
can act like a solar collector and it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.860 
can act like a solar collector and it
can<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:47.790> hot<00:02:48.060> enough<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:49.200> actually<00:02:49.860> cause

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
can get hot enough to actually cause

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
can get hot enough to actually cause
glue<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.709> fail<00:02:53.130> within<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.880> instrument<00:02:54.180> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
glue to fail within the instrument and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.900 
glue to fail within the instrument and
I've<00:02:54.720> heard<00:02:55.530> stories<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:56.450> violins<00:02:57.709> literally

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
I've heard stories of violins literally

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.070 
I've heard stories of violins literally
imploding<00:02:59.910> when<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:01.459> lot<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.910> glue<00:03:03.299> holding

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
imploding when a lot of the glue holding

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.550 
imploding when a lot of the glue holding
the<00:03:04.440> top<00:03:04.709> ribs<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.910> back<00:03:06.299> together<00:03:06.560> failed

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the top ribs and back together failed

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.610 
the top ribs and back together failed
all<00:03:07.920> at<00:03:08.640> once<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:10.019> string<00:03:10.350> tension

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
all at once and the string tension

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.970 
all at once and the string tension
literally<00:03:11.280> pulled<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.060> instrument<00:03:12.799> parts<00:03:13.799> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
literally pulled the instrument parts of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.880 
literally pulled the instrument parts of
the<00:03:14.069> instrument<00:03:14.459> apart
