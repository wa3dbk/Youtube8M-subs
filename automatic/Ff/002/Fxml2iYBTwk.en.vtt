right<00:00:00.380> this<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.620> my<00:00:01.860> solar<00:00:02.220> system<00:00:03.259> I'm<00:00:04.259> going

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:04.339 
right this is my solar system I'm going

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.400 
right this is my solar system I'm going
through<00:00:06.470> looking<00:00:07.470> at<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.980> batteries<00:00:09.410> this

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
through looking at the batteries this

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.470 
through looking at the batteries this
gives<00:00:10.800> me<00:00:10.980> an<00:00:11.040> indication<00:00:11.190> just<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.269> quick

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
gives me an indication just a quick

play they're very good quality I enjoy

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.370 
play they're very good quality I enjoy
them<00:01:23.710> they're<00:01:24.220> doing<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.759> job<00:01:25.060> perfectly

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380

that's my generator I haven't installed

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.950 
that's my generator I haven't installed
him<00:01:29.619> yet<00:01:29.920> I'm<00:01:30.790> going<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.330> install<00:01:31.720> them

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
him yet I'm going to install them

him yet I'm going to install them
outside<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.890> ever<00:01:33.220> gets<00:01:33.550> flat<00:01:33.880> which<00:01:34.119> I<00:01:34.300> doubt

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
outside it ever gets flat which I doubt

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.310 
outside it ever gets flat which I doubt
things<00:01:36.460> like<00:01:36.759> it's<00:01:37.060> just<00:01:37.300> pumping<00:01:37.960> along

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
things like it's just pumping along

things like it's just pumping along
doing<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.100> nice<00:01:39.340> thing<00:01:40.050> I<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:43.000> go<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.360> see

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
doing the nice thing I can go and see

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.550 
doing the nice thing I can go and see
the<00:01:43.869> state<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.470> things<00:01:44.800> I<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.960> check<00:01:47.259> the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
the state of things I can check the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.800 
the state of things I can check the
battery<00:01:48.340> temperature<00:01:48.640> it's<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.360> little<00:01:49.660> bit

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
battery temperature it's a little bit

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.340 
battery temperature it's a little bit
high<00:01:50.229> cuz<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.920> very<00:01:51.250> hot<00:01:51.550> day<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:52.390> battery

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
high cuz it's a very hot day the battery

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.980 
high cuz it's a very hot day the battery
current

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990

what<00:01:56.560> good<00:01:56.830> control<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.659> sun.star

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
what good control is that the sun.star

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.609 
what good control is that the sun.star
time<00:01:59.799> i<00:02:00.330> could<00:02:01.330> just<00:02:01.540> go<00:02:01.780> through<00:02:01.810> some<00:02:02.470> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
time i could just go through some the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.609 
time i could just go through some the
absorption<00:02:03.130> stage<00:02:03.610> at<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.090> moment<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.900> it's

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
absorption stage at the moment and it's

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.160 
absorption stage at the moment and it's
no<00:02:06.340> floating<00:02:06.700> today<00:02:07.270> because<00:02:07.990> i've<00:02:08.140> been

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
no floating today because i've been

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.559 
no floating today because i've been

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.390 

it's<00:02:20.180> sound<00:02:20.570> wrong<00:02:20.870> 20<00:02:21.350> years<00:02:21.560> from<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.920> one

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
it's sound wrong 20 years from that one

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.060 
it's sound wrong 20 years from that one
these<00:02:23.120> ones<00:02:23.390> are<00:02:23.600> allow<00:02:23.870> up<00:02:24.080> because<00:02:24.590> they're

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
these ones are allow up because they're

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.190 
these ones are allow up because they're
not<00:02:25.220> needing<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.850> much<00:02:26.090> more<00:02:26.330> charge<00:02:26.750> to

not needing that much more charge to
keep<00:02:27.380> them<00:02:27.590> topped<00:02:27.890> up<00:02:28.930> okay<00:02:29.930> that's<00:02:30.440> all
