then you have to leave it on top of it
that<00:04:17.959> leaving<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:18.980> not<00:04:19.220> getting<00:04:19.519> through

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
that leaving is not getting through

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.430 
that leaving is not getting through
because<00:04:20.090> of<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.359> water<00:04:20.600> so<00:04:21.170> I<00:04:21.230> definitely

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
because of the water so I definitely

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.310 
because of the water so I definitely
suggest<00:04:21.980> waiting<00:04:22.670> 15<00:04:23.120> minutes<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.750> even<00:04:24.200> an

suggest waiting 15 minutes to even an

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.879 
suggest waiting 15 minutes to even an

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.800

for<00:05:18.139> me<00:05:18.440> at<00:05:18.530> all<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.340> suggest<00:05:20.120> personally

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
for me at all so I suggest personally

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.750 
for me at all so I suggest personally
staying<00:05:21.110> away<00:05:21.350> from<00:05:21.590> products<00:05:22.370> that<00:05:22.430> close

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
staying away from products that close

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.530 
staying away from products that close
the<00:05:22.970> cuticle<00:05:23.260> eleméry<00:05:24.260> gel<00:05:24.680> has<00:05:25.010> a<00:05:25.040> low<00:05:25.340> pH<00:05:25.669> so

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
the cuticle eleméry gel has a low pH so

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.690 
the cuticle eleméry gel has a low pH so
it<00:05:26.660> also<00:05:26.810> closes<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.500> cuticle<00:05:28.040> but<00:05:28.220> I<00:05:28.370> find

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
it also closes the cuticle but I find

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.879 
it also closes the cuticle but I find
when<00:05:29.030> mixed<00:05:29.419> with<00:05:29.540> other<00:05:29.810> products<00:05:30.410> it<00:05:30.740> is

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
when mixed with other products it is

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.800 
when mixed with other products it is
fine<00:05:31.190> for<00:05:31.520> me<00:05:31.669> but<00:05:31.850> when<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.000> try<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.300> use<00:05:32.419> aloe

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
fine for me but when I try to use aloe

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.190 
fine for me but when I try to use aloe
vera<00:05:33.050> gel<00:05:33.440> straight<00:05:34.250> out<00:05:34.460> of<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.760> bottle<00:05:35.200> not

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
vera gel straight out of the bottle not

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.170 
vera gel straight out of the bottle not
so<00:05:36.530> much<00:05:36.740> but<00:05:36.980> mixed<00:05:37.280> in<00:05:37.430> with<00:05:37.550> other<00:05:37.760> products

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
so much but mixed in with other products

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.570 
so much but mixed in with other products
I<00:05:38.389> don't<00:05:38.750> have<00:05:39.139> problems<00:05:39.650> with<00:05:39.680> aloe<00:05:39.919> vera<00:05:40.160> gel

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
I don't have problems with aloe vera gel

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.750 
I don't have problems with aloe vera gel
but<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:41.090> CV<00:05:41.660> apple<00:05:42.080> cider<00:05:42.200> vinegar<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.919> a<00:05:43.400> note

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
but a CV apple cider vinegar is a note

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.710 
but a CV apple cider vinegar is a note
and<00:05:44.000> my<00:05:44.150> last<00:05:44.389> tip<00:05:44.960> is<00:05:45.200> use<00:05:45.919> products<00:05:46.580> that

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
and my last tip is use products that

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.510 
and my last tip is use products that
open<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.810> cuticle<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:48.710> that's<00:05:48.889> using<00:05:49.130> any

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
open the cuticle so that's using any

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.090 
open the cuticle so that's using any
type<00:05:49.910> of<00:05:49.940> alkaline<00:05:50.660> treatment<00:05:51.320> one<00:05:51.860> of<00:05:51.980> the

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
type of alkaline treatment one of the

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.040 
type of alkaline treatment one of the
most<00:05:52.430> popular<00:05:52.880> ones<00:05:53.060> on<00:05:53.270> YouTube<00:05:53.690> is<00:05:53.840> the

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
most popular ones on YouTube is the

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.379 
most popular ones on YouTube is the
cherry<00:05:54.350> Lola<00:05:54.470> treatment<00:05:55.250> I've<00:05:55.580> used<00:05:56.120> that
