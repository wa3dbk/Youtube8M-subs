00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:04.919
Hey Head Squeezers!

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.380
I hope you're well and welcome to the first
Ask Head Squeeze Thursdays!

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.160
Now as promised in my announcement video last
week I'm going to be looking at You Tuber

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.150
James The Weirdo's question all about tickling.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.820
Don't even think about it!

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.060
Now in this film I'm going to uncover why
we can't tickle ourselves and also which animals

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.699
laugh when tickled?

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.449
But first, feather dusters at the ready.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.780
Not you.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.070
What is a tickle?

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.270
Now if you peeled off your epidermis, the
top layer of your skin you'd see hair follicles,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.789
sweat glands, muscles, nerve endings and probably
quite a lot of blood.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.610
It's those nerve endings we're interested
in.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.839
They connect to nerve fibres that make up
the whole central nervous system throughout

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.229
your whole body.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.979
When you are touched the nerve endings pick
up heat, cold, pressure, the amount of time

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.309
you've been touched for and that gets sent
as electrical signals to your brain.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.089
Now as you know when you've been tickled it's
normally a very light touch that sets off

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.760
that ticklish feeling.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760
But why?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.950
Well there are two parts of the brain responsible
for analysing all these signals.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.259
Now we know this because people have kindly
jumped in big metallic tubes and been tickled

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.360
for science.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.460
Oh yes!

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.560
Now fMRI studies have shown that it's the
somatosensory cortex in the brain that analyses

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.840
the data to do with touch, so pressure.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.950
But it's also being analysed by the anterior
cingulate cortex, that governs pleasurable

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.119
feelings and it's a weird combination of the
two.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.049
So why can't we actually tickle ourselves?

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.020
Well that is down to the cerebellum at the
back of the brain.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.039
It's the bit that governs your movements and
it predicts a self tickle.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.060
It tells your brain that you're about to tickle
yourself.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.340
But why?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.350
Why does this happen?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.049
Well if you think about it our brains are
getting bombarded by information all the time

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.810
and you don't want to be overloaded so it
filters out some of that noise allowing us

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.899
to focus on the important stuff.

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.210
Here's a question though.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.540
Why do people laugh when they're tickled?

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.230
Well step up two gentlemen.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.879
The first one Charles Darwin, he of fantastic
illustrious beard and Ewald Hecker, he of

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.330
also magnificent facial hair but also more
on top than Mr Darwin here.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.430
They both said that ticklishness is related
to humour that you need to be in a good mood

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.980
to have both of them.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.930
Kind of makes sense.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.599
However, well done on the finches Mr D but
this one is slightly off.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.409
Think about it, if you're watching fail videos
on YouTube and you're chuckling away at yourself

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.420
you won't be more prone to ticklishness than
normal.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.269
So we don't laugh because it's funny so why
do we laugh when we're tickled?

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.769
Well the clue to this comes when you realise
that the most vulnerable bits of your body

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.360
for ticklishness are also the most vulnerable
bits of your body for injury.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.189
Now evolutionary biologists and neuroscientists
say that when you laugh you're showing you're

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.200
submission to an aggressor.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.890
In other words if someone comes and attacks
you, you chuckle about it and that diffuses

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.050
the situation.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.920
It's supported by research that shows that
the parts of your brain that fire when you're

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.140
having ticklish laughter are also the parts
of your brain that fire when you're anticipating

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.550
pain.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.860
Think about which parts of your body make
you laugh when you're tickled.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.140
So underneath your arms, yeah there's kind
of a lot of arteries there and also it's a

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.019
straight root around your rib cage to your
heart.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.610
Your neck, you've got loads of arteries there
but you've also got your trachea as well and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.950
of course the soles of your feet.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.689
Yeah now they are covered in very highly sensitive
receptors known as meissner corpurscles.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.709
Ok BONUS FACT time!

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.599
If you were to tickle a gorilla, not a good
idea but alright if they've been hand reared

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.769
you would notice that their response is quite
similar to that of a tickled human.

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.510
And if you analyse the sounds they're also
very very similar to when we are tickled and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.720
we laugh.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.569
That suggests to researchers that laughing
when tickled is a very very old response,

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.459
shared by a common ancestor of both the great
apes and us which puts that response at something

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.459
like 30 to 60 million years old.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.519
BONUS BONUS FACT!

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.170
Other animals also laugh when they're tickled
including rats.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.500
Oh yeah of course scientists have tickled
rats in the name of science.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.140
What they found is that they do giggle away
at about 50kHz, which is outside of our audible

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.140
range.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.300
So you wouldn't actually know if there was
a giggling rat in the room next to you.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.750
So there you go that's the full low down on
tickling.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.721
Why you actually feel a tickle and how you
feel it, why you can't tickle yourself, why

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:53.940
we laugh when we get tickled and also the
fact that gorillas and rats also laugh when

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.940
tickled.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.940
So now you know.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.830
Now of course there's going to be more of
these Ask Head Squeeze videos every Thursday

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.350
answering your questions so let us know.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.350
What do you want to know?

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.980
Put it in the comments down below this video
or subscribe and join our G+ community page

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.410
and send them in that way.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.380
Until next time, happy Head Squeezing.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:24.169
Just getting back to business.
