00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
can go about using this method the first

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.170 
can go about using this method the first
way<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.500> investing<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> see<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> player

way is investing so if you see a player

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.420 
way is investing so if you see a player
from<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.810> recent<00:00:22.260> team<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> week<00:00:22.890> it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
up for that 10k bid or 10k lowest buy

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.749 
up for that 10k bid or 10k lowest buy
now<00:00:30.630> price<00:00:30.869> his<00:00:31.619> price<00:00:31.949> will<00:00:32.219> go<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
now price his price will go up in the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.639 
now price his price will go up in the
upcoming<00:00:32.910> weeks<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> reason<00:00:34.410> for

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
upcoming weeks but that's the reason for

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.830 
upcoming weeks but that's the reason for
that<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.370> he'll<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.329> packs

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that is that he'll go out of packs

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
that is that he'll go out of packs
because<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.530> course<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.040> replaced<00:00:38.460> by

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
because of course they get replaced by

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.459 
because of course they get replaced by
the<00:00:38.730> new<00:00:38.820> team<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> week<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.780> following<00:00:39.989> week

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the new team the week the following week

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
the new team the week the following week
and<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.070> means<00:00:41.309> there's<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.000> less

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and that means there's going to be less

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
and that means there's going to be less
on<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> market<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.710> player<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.520> an
