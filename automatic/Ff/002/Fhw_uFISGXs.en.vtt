00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.950
 to the mercy of local authorities 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.030
 Minsk City Executive Committee and Administration 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.439
 as well as our builder kitchen 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
 central district of his his 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.579
 mismanagement and possibly with 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.730
 vested in, and they themselves failed 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.829
 building our house the house is being built with 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.720
 government support and we see 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.300
 that government allocated money 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.340
 spent inefficiently now for three 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.680
 year to includes the unconditional schedule 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 commissioning troubled homes but 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 result no regulatory deadline 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.570
 the construction of our house is over yet 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.469
 May 2011 to today 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.850
 construction readiness whether 69 percent 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.429
 Sharp over time, postponed deadline 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 at home making cost calculations which 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.960
 not only contrary to our contract 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.059
 not legislation now building 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.859
 stopped because ux will not provide 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.830
 or uninterrupted financing 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.140
 let's talk about the factor first ux 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.060
 did not present at the time of the bank settlement 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.370
 documents for payment of construction and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.780
 they were under the financing of construction 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.250
 we find out found out that in 2011 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 bank references were provided by mix 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 only twice on not every month like 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 this is due to one of the problems you want 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.930
 refused to transfer money at all 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.850
 since according to the documents they are not 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.550
 have already paid advances 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.260
 that means having a contractor remember 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.260
 tacit financing 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.750
 the employee of the Fuchs why for some reason led 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.250

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.900
 it is known that the current contractor is a new house 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.700

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.160
 five apartments in our house are not sold 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.379
 and gux is in no hurry to sell them 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.670
 refusing buyers under the pretext of 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.790
 what free apartments 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.280
 no where all this huge money went 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.410
 why the contractor is not paid and he wants 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.760
 leave construction alexander 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.799

 control money without control 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.200
 ordinary citizens is a state 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.150
 boxing threatens us to conserve 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.560
 construction to terminate all acts 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.200

 cost per square meter about three 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.049
 million rubles because they are waiting 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.630
 legitimate increase in value 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.940

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.410
 million these expenses we calculated by

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.610
 rubles 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.220

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.920
 thousand rubles will quote also Anatoly 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.870
 Kalinin 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.420

 salaries in the country by a factor of 1 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.270
 a full two tenths based on these dreams 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.070
 the final cost of a meter in our 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.860

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.720
 and a half million rubles Andrei 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.490
 Kobyak I there reported in what 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.350
 real cost of commercial 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.770
 construction per square meter housing in 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.980
 Minsk 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.200
 is about 600 dollars in rubles 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.160
 in terms of maximum 6 million 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.440
 rubles even at the current rate 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.410
 During this time, our contractor hides in two 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.580
 times more than 12 million rubles for 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.220
 every square meter 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.220
 ibooks see no problems with it 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.380
 according to our skill costs of 12 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.380
 million per meter indicates 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.570
 embezzlement and collateral huge scale and 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.860
 It is likely that you and corruption 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.110
 scheme to take money from the population 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.870

 representatives of stock contractors but also 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.860
 officials are involved 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.930
 Now contractors want a new home 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.240
 abandon the construction of our house and 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.610
 need to warn the situation that 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.680
 originated with the first bankrupt when 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.020
 unexplained circumstances by the contractor 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.090
 namely to prevent theft through 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.490
 overstating and not working out 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.740

 this situation and conduct an audit of all 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.560
 organizations, too, on sweeping 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.919
 responsible for building our 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.660
 at home we want one fulfillment uk itself 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.620
 of their obligations under equity agreements

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.210
 each new additional agreement 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.640
 proposed uxom causes shock price 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.260
 construction is not justified 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.270
 and the funds we have contributed are not 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.270
 indexed we think that 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.729
 resolution of the Council of Ministers number 1006 22 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.340
 November which approved the calculation procedure 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.990
 share price changes 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.900
 should apply to our home and 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.479
 all other long-term similar 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.710
 it will lead us in order 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.720
 additional agreements excluding 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.970
 budget credit overruns 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.890
 will eliminate the corruption scheme and will give 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.930
 building momentum all over belarus 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.030
 Shareholders who do not sign 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.490
 illegal supplemental agreements do not 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.950
 will have to prove in court that already

 the cost of the apartment is the size of us already 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.270
 made by means

 in fact we are offered to pay 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.740
 apartments for the second time without a guarantee 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.249
 that and with this money could finish 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.830
 chord 

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:33.909
 dear Alexander Grigorievich we 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.349
 remember as may 27, 2011 you 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:37.749
 demanded not to increase the cost 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:38.469

 they will throw these apartments and life 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.979
 will be offended by the nose and will be right 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.779
 Hurt must be the toughest control 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:55.120
