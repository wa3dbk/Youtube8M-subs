00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the length of the door and the carribean

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.380 
the length of the door and the carribean
around<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.610> outside<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.000> hammock<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
around the outside of hammock on the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.260 
around the outside of hammock on the
inside<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.200> shut<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> door<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.640> we're<00:01:24.150> not

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
inside and I shut the door so we're not

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.660 
inside and I shut the door so we're not
done<00:01:24.540> because<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.650> i<00:01:25.950> sat<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> hammock

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
done because if i sat in the hammock

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.160 
done because if i sat in the hammock
could<00:01:26.820> pull<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.360> these<00:01:27.540> carabiners<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
could pull down on these carabiners and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.410 
could pull down on these carabiners and
likely<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:29.009> dent<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.850> roof<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
likely would dent the the roof of the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
likely would dent the the roof of the
car<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> door<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.710> pulled<00:01:31.979> hard<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.880> can

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
car on the door if I pulled hard you can

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.690 
car on the door if I pulled hard you can
see<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.479> slide<00:01:33.600> through<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.490> we

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
see that it will slide through so we

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.100 
see that it will slide through so we
need<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> fasten<00:01:36.119> these<00:01:36.360> across<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.900> top

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
need to fasten these across the top

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.480 
need to fasten these across the top
that's<00:01:37.829> where<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> tie-downs<00:01:38.400> come<00:01:40.490> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that's where the tie-downs come so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.600 
that's where the tie-downs come so
really<00:01:41.790> all<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:41.970> do

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
really all I do

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
really all I do
hook<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> two<00:01:44.850> tie-downs<00:01:45.240> together<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.350> they

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
hook the two tie-downs together so they

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.090 
hook the two tie-downs together so they
make<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.100> long<00:01:47.250> tied<00:01:47.610> down<00:01:49.100> throw

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
make one really long tied down throw

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.990 
make one really long tied down throw
this<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:51.170> across<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> top<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> van<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.250> have

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
this in across the top of the van I have

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
this in across the top of the van I have
these<00:01:54.180> racks<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.200> underneath

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
these racks on here so I go underneath

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.810 
these racks on here so I go underneath
the<00:01:55.770> rack<00:01:58.100> throw<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.159> back<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.670> back

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the rack throw it back to the back

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.070 
the rack throw it back to the back
corner<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:02.250> we'll<00:02:02.399> clip<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.729> our<00:02:02.790> carabiners

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.480 
so all I do on this side clip the
webbing<00:02:08.979> through<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.070> carabiner<00:02:12.340> now<00:02:13.340> we'll

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
webbing through the carabiner now we'll

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.740 
webbing through the carabiner now we'll
go<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> other<00:02:13.910> side<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.330> tighten<00:02:14.630> that

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
go to the other side to tighten that

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.810 
go to the other side to tighten that
down<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.840> we<00:02:17.900> pull<00:02:18.440> these<00:02:18.590> tight<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.550> can<00:02:19.670> see

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
down so we pull these tight you can see

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.340 
down so we pull these tight you can see
that<00:02:19.970> will<00:02:20.090> slide<00:02:20.300> through<00:02:20.330> it'll<00:02:20.900> only<00:02:21.050> slide

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
that will slide through it'll only slide

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.510 
that will slide through it'll only slide
through<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.710> direction<00:02:22.160> because<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
through one direction because the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.710 
through one direction because the
tie-down<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:22.970> going<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.180> get<00:02:23.270> stuck<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
tie-down is going to get stuck on the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.570 
tie-down is going to get stuck on the
carabiner<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.470> know<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.650> can<00:02:24.770> slide<00:02:25.010> this

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
carabiner so we know it can slide this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.460 
carabiner so we know it can slide this
way

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
way

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.340 
way
so<00:02:27.470> put<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.190> one<00:02:28.340> through<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.580> carabiner

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.540 

connect<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> webbing<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:37.040> then<00:02:37.370> just

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
connect to the webbing and then just

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.570 
connect to the webbing and then just
tighten<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.940> down<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.570> as<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.870> tighten<00:02:39.050> it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
tighten it down so as you tighten it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.400 
tighten it down so as you tighten it
it'll<00:02:40.580> be<00:02:40.670> pulling<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.210> straps<00:02:41.930> out<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.260> both

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
it'll be pulling the straps out of both

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.750 
it'll be pulling the straps out of both
sides<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> door<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.340> tightening<00:02:43.670> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
sides of the door and tightening the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.610 
sides of the door and tightening the
hammock<00:02:44.060> across<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.510> middle<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.840> van<00:02:45.080> so

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
hammock across the middle of the van so

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.920 
hammock across the middle of the van so
I<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.800> get<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> nice<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.220> snug<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.930> now

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
I just get it nice and snug that and now

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.130 
I just get it nice and snug that and now
your<00:02:51.110> hammock<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.470> installed<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:55.130> tight<00:02:55.430> fit

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.580 
your hammock is installed so a tight fit

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590
