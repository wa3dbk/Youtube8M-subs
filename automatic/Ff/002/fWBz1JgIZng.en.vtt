Dallas<00:01:58.770> Cowboys<00:01:59.100> playbook<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.750> know

Dallas Cowboys playbook so you know
we've<00:02:01.380> been<00:02:01.409> playing<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.009> playbook<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
we've been playing with this playbook it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179 
we've been playing with this playbook it
has<00:02:03.210> some<00:02:03.329> very<00:02:03.600> little<00:02:03.930> changes<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:05.009> yet

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
has some very little changes but yet

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.039 
has some very little changes but yet
it's<00:02:05.369> still<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.850> effective<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.840> last

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it's still very effective just like last

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.619 
it's still very effective just like last
year<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.710> last<00:02:08.459> year<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.640> made<00:02:08.729> vol<00:02:09.090> 1<00:02:09.450> this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
year so last year we made vol 1 this

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.290 
year so last year we made vol 1 this
volume<00:02:10.020> 2<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.030> good

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
volume 2 and this is really really good

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.620 
volume 2 and this is really really good
so<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.840> recommend<00:02:12.870> it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
so I really recommend it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.510 
so I really recommend it
for<00:02:14.260> all<00:02:14.440> those<00:02:14.590> players<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.040> really<00:02:15.310> want<00:02:15.490> to

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
for all those players I really want to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.030 
for all those players I really want to
go<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.880> next<00:02:16.000> level<00:02:16.420> because<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.010> a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
go to the next level because this is a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.550
