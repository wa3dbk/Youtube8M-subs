the top with a light candy coat around
all<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.500> piping<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.340> here<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.480> we'll

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
all the piping on here and then we'll

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.380 
all the piping on here and then we'll
black<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> edge<00:02:32.440> at<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.770> end<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.280> i<00:02:33.670> kind

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
black in the edge at the end but i kind

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.940 
black in the edge at the end but i kind
of<00:02:34.420> want<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.630> leave<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.870> panel<00:02:35.320> silver<00:02:35.770> and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
of want to leave this panel silver and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.949 
of want to leave this panel silver and
then<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.250> have<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.610> colored<00:02:37.330> piping<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.810> it

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
then just have the colored piping in it

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.620 
then just have the colored piping in it
you<00:02:38.650> know<00:02:38.800> it'll<00:02:39.160> make<00:02:39.430> for<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.670> nice<00:02:40.450> little

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
you know it'll make for a nice little

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.410 
you know it'll make for a nice little
transition<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.730> sides<00:02:43.000> we're

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
transition and then the sides we're

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.440 
transition and then the sides we're
probably<00:02:43.630> going<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.110> do<00:02:44.260> fish<00:02:44.739> gills<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.450> two

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
probably going to do fish gills and two

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.360 
probably going to do fish gills and two
greens<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:47.020> this<00:02:47.170> side<00:02:47.350> now<00:02:47.980> we'll<00:02:48.100> do<00:02:48.190> fish

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
greens on this side now we'll do fish

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.610 
greens on this side now we'll do fish
scales<00:02:48.640> into<00:02:49.030> blues<00:02:49.270> on<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.570> side<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.930> then

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
scales into blues on this side and then

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.970 
scales into blues on this side and then
on<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.459> back<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.850> was<00:02:51.940> thinking<00:02:52.239> about<00:02:52.420> some

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.440 

basically<00:04:04.650> I've<00:04:04.980> made<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.450> plastic

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
basically I've made this plastic

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.960 
basically I've made this plastic
template<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.080> can<00:04:07.110> get<00:04:07.350> them<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.709> little<00:04:08.670> stiff

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
template you can get them a little stiff

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.900 
template you can get them a little stiff
flexible<00:04:09.720> plastic<00:04:10.170> anywhere<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.910> basically

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
flexible plastic anywhere I basically

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.430 
flexible plastic anywhere I basically
just<00:04:12.180> cut<00:04:12.540> equal<00:04:13.110> scales<00:04:13.610> one<00:04:14.610> row<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.410> what<00:04:16.410> I

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
just cut equal scales one row and what I

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.530 
just cut equal scales one row and what I
do<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.889> make<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.459> whole<00:04:17.669> panel<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.090> fish<00:04:18.269> scales

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
do I make a whole panel and fish scales

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.030 
do I make a whole panel and fish scales
and<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.870> highlight<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.320> with<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.470> darker<00:04:19.829> color

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
and you highlight it with a darker color

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.039 
and you highlight it with a darker color
and<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.340> kind<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.090> looks<00:04:21.269> like<00:04:21.329> it's<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.840> fish

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and it kind of looks like it's a fish

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.470 
and it kind of looks like it's a fish
nice<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:23.130> pretty<00:04:23.340> cool<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.820> got<00:04:24.000> some<00:04:24.180> smaller

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
nice it's pretty cool I got some smaller

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.500 
nice it's pretty cool I got some smaller
ones<00:04:24.570> too<00:04:24.930> I'll<00:04:25.500> show<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.770> but<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.760> you

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
ones too I'll show you but that you

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.130 
ones too I'll show you but that you
start<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.050> then<00:04:28.669> where<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.870> bottoms<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:31.050> the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
start and then where the bottoms of the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.770 
start and then where the bottoms of the
scales<00:04:31.410> go<00:04:31.790> when<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:32.880> move<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.150> down<00:04:33.330> they<00:04:33.660> go

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
scales go when you move it down they go

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.440 
scales go when you move it down they go
to<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.020> tip<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.380> each<00:04:34.590> round<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.790> then<00:04:35.880> vice

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
to the tip of each round and then vice

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.060 
to the tip of each round and then vice
versa<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.110> basically<00:04:37.290> like<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.860> all<00:04:38.040> the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
versa so you basically like that all the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.909 
versa so you basically like that all the
way<00:04:38.190> down<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:38.550> they're<00:04:38.700> staggered<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.919> it

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
way down so they're staggered and it

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.920 
way down so they're staggered and it
actually<00:04:41.040> turns<00:04:41.340> out<00:04:41.460> pretty<00:04:41.640> cool<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.180> I'll

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
actually turns out pretty cool so I'll

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:58.049 
actually turns out pretty cool so I'll
show<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.169> show<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:43.919> how<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.220> goes<00:04:44.400> nice

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:58.059 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:01.029
