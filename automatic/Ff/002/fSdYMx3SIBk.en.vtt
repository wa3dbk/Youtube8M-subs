00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
I'm not really sure I see sub shimmers

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.640 
I'm not really sure I see sub shimmers
in<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:49.159> other<00:04:49.580> ones<00:04:49.820> but<00:04:50.450> um<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:51.260> have<00:04:51.409> five

in the other ones but um you have five

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.469 
in the other ones but um you have five
Matt<00:04:51.950> I<00:04:52.159> guess<00:04:52.219> at<00:04:52.550> five<00:04:52.729> shimmers<00:04:53.120> I'm<00:04:53.330> not

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
Matt I guess at five shimmers I'm not

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.750 
Matt I guess at five shimmers I'm not
really<00:04:53.750> too<00:04:53.900> sure<00:04:53.930> like<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.770> said<00:04:55.070> when<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.580> do

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
really too sure like I said when you do

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.490 
really too sure like I said when you do
use<00:04:55.969> this<00:04:56.150> palette<00:04:56.389> maybe<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.110> have<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.349> get

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
use this palette maybe you have to get

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.740 
use this palette maybe you have to get
through<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> first<00:04:57.919> or<00:04:58.159> second<00:04:58.460> layers<00:04:58.750> to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
through the first or second layers to

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.899 
through the first or second layers to
see<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.139> color<00:05:00.320> payoff<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:01.280> when<00:05:01.729> i

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
see the color payoff of this when i

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.240 
see the color payoff of this when i
swatched<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.539> I<00:05:02.780> really<00:05:03.260> like<00:05:03.469> the<00:05:03.620> colors<00:05:03.979> of

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
swatched it I really like the colors of

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.250 
swatched it I really like the colors of
the<00:05:04.340> stormy<00:05:04.639> skies<00:05:04.880> so<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.360> went<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:05.960> pick<00:05:06.110> up

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
the stormy skies so I went and pick up

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.920 
the stormy skies so I went and pick up
this<00:05:06.380> palette<00:05:06.650> but<00:05:07.520> now<00:05:07.820> as<00:05:08.150> using<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.659> for<00:05:08.840> the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
this palette but now as using it for the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.170 
this palette but now as using it for the
first<00:05:09.139> time<00:05:09.320> on<00:05:09.560> my<00:05:09.800> eyes<00:05:09.979> I<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.820> colors

first time on my eyes I the colors

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.420 
first time on my eyes I the colors
really<00:05:11.570> don't<00:05:11.810> show<00:05:12.020> up<00:05:12.110> on<00:05:12.229> my<00:05:12.320> eyes<00:05:12.529> kind<00:05:13.279> of

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
really don't show up on my eyes kind of

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.129

NYX<00:05:15.409> I<00:05:15.680> will<00:05:16.130> still<00:05:16.490> give<00:05:16.909> this<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.120> try<00:05:17.389> and<00:05:17.719> use

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
NYX I will still give this a try and use

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.690 
NYX I will still give this a try and use
it<00:05:18.460> but<00:05:19.460> as<00:05:19.639> for<00:05:19.849> me<00:05:20.029> I<00:05:20.270> really<00:05:20.719> don't<00:05:21.080> see<00:05:21.229> any

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
it but as for me I really don't see any

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.850 
it but as for me I really don't see any
color<00:05:22.700> payoff<00:05:23.479> and<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:24.110> don't<00:05:24.169> know<00:05:24.440> if<00:05:24.620> that's

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
color payoff and I don't know if that's

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.879 
color payoff and I don't know if that's
just<00:05:25.159> me<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:25.789> that's<00:05:26.510> what<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.440> is

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
just me and that's what it is

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.360 
just me and that's what it is
but<00:05:28.159> I<00:05:28.520> do<00:05:29.360> like<00:05:29.690> this<00:05:29.840> palette<00:05:30.139> it's<00:05:30.889> a<00:05:31.070> really

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
but I do like this palette it's a really

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.000 
but I do like this palette it's a really
good<00:05:31.520> palette<00:05:32.029> and<00:05:32.180> you're<00:05:32.570> paying<00:05:32.779> $14<00:05:33.740> for

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
good palette and you're paying $14 for

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.180 
good palette and you're paying $14 for
it<00:05:34.159> so<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.820> should<00:05:35.240> work<00:05:35.570> really<00:05:36.560> well<00:05:36.800> like

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
it so it should work really well like

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.649 
it so it should work really well like
I'm<00:05:37.310> saying<00:05:37.520> I<00:05:37.669> don't<00:05:37.729> know<00:05:38.060> if<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.419> have<00:05:38.510> to

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
I'm saying I don't know if you have to

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:39.940 
I'm saying I don't know if you have to
get<00:05:38.779> to<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.020> first<00:05:39.169> or<00:05:39.349> second<00:05:39.590> layers<00:05:39.740> to

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
get to the first or second layers to

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.560 
get to the first or second layers to
actually<00:05:40.340> see<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.610> color<00:05:40.820> payoff<00:05:41.060> on<00:05:41.389> this

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
actually see the color payoff on this

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.500 
actually see the color payoff on this
thing<00:05:41.810> give<00:05:42.289> this<00:05:42.529> more<00:05:42.919> of<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.310> try<00:05:43.669> and<00:05:44.029> see<00:05:44.389> if

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
thing give this more of a try and see if

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.540 
thing give this more of a try and see if
this<00:05:44.690> actually<00:05:44.900> really<00:05:45.320> work<00:05:45.500> for<00:05:45.740> me<00:05:45.800> well<00:05:46.279> if

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
this actually really work for me well if

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.540 
this actually really work for me well if
it<00:05:46.729> does<00:05:46.909> or<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:47.180> I<00:05:47.539> won't<00:05:48.349> say<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.770> recommend
