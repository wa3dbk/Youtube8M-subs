dark vampy lips I think it's a little
bit<00:00:22.680> different<00:00:22.980> than<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.310> looks<00:00:23.609> I've<00:00:23.789> been

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
guess as we're getting into the fall

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.099 
guess as we're getting into the fall
season<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.359> yet<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.869> coming
