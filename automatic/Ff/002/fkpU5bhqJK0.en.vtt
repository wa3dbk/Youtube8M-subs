00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
particular figure it came with a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.769 
particular figure it came with a
removable<00:00:21.990> black<00:00:22.769> backpack<00:00:23.730> sort<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
removable black backpack sort of like a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.000 
removable black backpack sort of like a
GI<00:00:25.080> Joe<00:00:25.170> backpack<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> peg<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:28.529> peg

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
GI Joe backpack with a peg the peg

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.910 
GI Joe backpack with a peg the peg
didn't<00:00:29.340> fit<00:00:29.490> very<00:00:29.519> well<00:00:29.939> into<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.750> hole<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.289> I

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
didn't fit very well into the hole so I

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.680 
didn't fit very well into the hole so I
have<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> small<00:00:32.700> screwdriver<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.510> just

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
have to get a small screwdriver and just

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.770 
have to get a small screwdriver and just
try<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.140> widen<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.860> hole<00:00:35.300> just<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> little<00:00:36.660> bit

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
try and widen the hole just a little bit

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
try and widen the hole just a little bit
so<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.380> backpack<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.430> stay<00:00:38.700> because

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
so that the backpack will stay because

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.049 
so that the backpack will stay because
without<00:00:39.860> tweaking<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> whole<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
without tweaking the whole of it the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.060 
without tweaking the whole of it the
backpack<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.780> stay<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.260> walk<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
backpack would stay on the walk for a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.029 
backpack would stay on the walk for a
bit<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:44.969> pop<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.860> if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.010> just

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
bit and then pop off or if you just

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
bit and then pop off or if you just
knock<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.430> off<00:00:48.140> by<00:00:49.140> accident<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.820> thing<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
knock it off by accident the thing is

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.760 
knock it off by accident the thing is
going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> pop<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.350> had<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:54.770> make

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
going to pop off so I had to just make

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.979 
going to pop off so I had to just make
the<00:00:55.920> hole<00:00:56.039> bigger<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.690> stays

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the hole bigger and now that back stays

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.950 
the hole bigger and now that back stays
so<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.590> want<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.539> it's<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
so if you want to do that it's up to you

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.410 
so if you want to do that it's up to you
figure<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.049> quite<00:01:04.320> big<00:01:07.369> you<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.549> getting

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
figure is quite big you just getting

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.230 
figure is quite big you just getting
standing<00:01:10.020> straight

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.370 

let's<00:01:16.240> get<00:01:16.360> rid<00:01:16.480> of<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.690> stand<00:01:16.960> so<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.260> can

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
let's get rid of the stand so you can

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.220 
let's get rid of the stand so you can
see<00:01:17.590> him<00:01:17.710> from<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.640> ground<00:01:18.910> up<00:01:19.140> figure<00:01:20.140> is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
see him from the ground up figure is

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.900 
see him from the ground up figure is
actually<00:01:20.560> pretty<00:01:20.800> big<00:01:22.620> if<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.880> a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
actually pretty big if you have a

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.870 
actually pretty big if you have a
regular<00:01:25.390> iron<00:01:25.600> man<00:01:25.900> figure<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.670> about

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
regular iron man figure this is about

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.420 
regular iron man figure this is about
the<00:01:28.030> size<00:01:28.210> comparison<00:01:28.900> he's<00:01:29.110> about<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.710> third

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
the size comparison he's about a third

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.080 
the size comparison he's about a third
easily<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.570> third<00:01:31.900> bigger<00:01:32.260> than<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.670> irregular

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
easily a third bigger than the irregular

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.230 
easily a third bigger than the irregular
figure<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:35.050> an<00:01:35.140> iron<00:01:35.350> man<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.950> know<00:01:39.070> it's<00:01:39.970> so

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
figure of an iron man you know it's so

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.020 
figure of an iron man you know it's so
much<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.220> size<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:44.170> much<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.490> scale<00:01:45.760> I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
much the size is so so much the scale I

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.620 
much the size is so so much the scale I
say<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.930> little<00:01:47.200> bit<00:01:47.290> is<00:01:47.800> in<00:01:48.550> scale<00:01:48.910> but<00:01:49.240> it's

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
say is a little bit is in scale but it's

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.380 
say is a little bit is in scale but it's
just<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.650> big<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.670> didn't<00:01:51.970> expect<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.300> be

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
just so big that I didn't expect to be

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.700 
just so big that I didn't expect to be
this<00:01:52.450> big<00:01:53.050> that<00:01:54.040> I<00:01:54.930> honestly<00:01:55.930> think<00:01:56.530> you're

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
this big that I honestly think you're

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.040 
this big that I honestly think you're
getting<00:01:56.980> more<00:01:57.280> for<00:01:58.120> from<00:01:58.720> what<00:01:58.870> you're

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
getting more for from what you're

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.190 
getting more for from what you're
actually<00:01:59.230> paying<00:01:59.650> for<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.870> amount<00:02:02.050> of

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
actually paying for with the amount of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.710 
actually paying for with the amount of
plastic<00:02:02.410> they<00:02:02.800> put<00:02:03.010> on<00:02:03.100> this<00:02:03.220> figure<00:02:03.610> also<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
plastic they put on this figure also the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.240 
plastic they put on this figure also the
other<00:02:04.810> thing<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.050> really<00:02:05.290> surprised<00:02:05.830> me<00:02:05.980> was

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
other thing that really surprised me was

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.639 
other thing that really surprised me was
I've<00:02:06.520> seen<00:02:07.240> pictures<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:07.960> on<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
I've seen pictures of this on the

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.169 
I've seen pictures of this on the
internet<00:02:08.950> before<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.520> was<00:02:09.670> released<00:02:09.820> on

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
internet before it was released on

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.950 
internet before it was released on
retail<00:02:10.600> I<00:02:11.610> thought<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.850> had<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.180> lacked<00:02:13.570> detail

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
retail I thought it had it lacked detail

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.500 
retail I thought it had it lacked detail
I<00:02:14.410> mean<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:15.070> was<00:02:15.370> at<00:02:15.610> they<00:02:15.760> only<00:02:15.940> showed<00:02:16.210> like

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
I mean it was at they only showed like

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.380 
I mean it was at they only showed like
the<00:02:16.960> upper<00:02:17.410> half<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.550> figure<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.239> was

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the upper half of the figure and it was

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500 
the upper half of the figure and it was
I<00:02:19.630> was<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> bit<00:02:20.470> too<00:02:20.620> plain<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.400> ta's<00:02:22.180> bro

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
I was a bit too plain and the ta's bro

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.650 
I was a bit too plain and the ta's bro
again<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> good<00:02:23.950> job<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.610> opening<00:02:25.600> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
again then do a good job but opening the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.970 
again then do a good job but opening the
figure<00:02:26.110> revealed<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.900> does<00:02:29.200> have<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> lot

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
figure revealed that it does have a lot

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.140 
figure revealed that it does have a lot
of<00:02:30.010> detail<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.970> especially<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.170> legs

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
of detail in it especially in the legs

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.270 
of detail in it especially in the legs
somewhere<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.360> neck<00:02:34.570> I'm<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.800> arm<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
somewhere in the neck I'm the arm and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.550 
somewhere in the neck I'm the arm and
part<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.700> reason<00:02:36.760> why<00:02:37.209> most<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.200> armor

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
part of the reason why most of the armor

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
part of the reason why most of the armor
plating<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.040> smooth<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.670> because<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.510> an

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
plating is smooth is because this is an

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.010 
plating is smooth is because this is an
air<00:02:40.900> assault<00:02:41.050> drone<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> he<00:02:42.820> he<00:02:43.300> needs<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
air assault drone and he he needs the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.949 
air assault drone and he he needs the
armor<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.470> be<00:02:44.560> very<00:02:44.800> aerodynamic<00:02:45.130> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
armor to be very aerodynamic and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.990 
armor to be very aerodynamic and
invisible<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.230> radar<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
invisible to radar so that that's the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.229 
invisible to radar so that that's the
main<00:02:49.150> reason<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.739> colors<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.489> robot<00:02:51.970> are

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
main reason the colors of the robot are

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.380 
main reason the colors of the robot are
in<00:02:52.660> sort<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.320> war<00:02:53.680> machine<00:02:53.890> color<00:02:54.390> with

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
in sort of like a war machine color with

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.190 
in sort of like a war machine color with
a<00:02:55.420> gun<00:02:56.200> metal<00:02:56.470> gray<00:02:56.709> light<00:02:57.280> gray<00:02:57.959> silver<00:02:58.959> here

out<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.290> just<00:03:50.740> I<00:03:50.830> thought<00:03:51.160> I've<00:03:51.520> been<00:03:51.640> thinking

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
out I just I thought I've been thinking

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.910 
out I just I thought I've been thinking
it's<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.480> paint<00:03:52.780> that's<00:03:53.350> got<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.770> on

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
it's just the paint that's got it on

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.580 
it's just the paint that's got it on
together<00:03:54.460> but<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.540> more<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.810> look<00:03:56.110> at<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.350> I

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
together but the more I look at it I

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.030 
together but the more I look at it I
don't<00:03:57.040> think<00:03:57.480> pause<00:03:58.480> bro<00:03:58.930> actually<00:03:59.530> put<00:03:59.800> a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
don't think pause bro actually put a

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.480 
don't think pause bro actually put a
ball<00:04:00.310> joint<00:04:00.610> or<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.150> or<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.810> thigh<00:04:02.320> joint<00:04:02.490> for

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
ball joint or a or a thigh joint for

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.390 
ball joint or a or a thigh joint for
this<00:04:03.610> particular<00:04:03.760> figure<00:04:04.210> so<00:04:05.130> I'm<00:04:06.130> not<00:04:06.280> going

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
this particular figure so I'm not going

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.160 
this particular figure so I'm not going
to<00:04:06.459> risk<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.850> I'm<00:04:07.330> just<00:04:07.570> going<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.750> accept<00:04:07.959> it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
to risk it I'm just going to accept it

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.140 
to risk it I'm just going to accept it
for<00:04:08.320> what<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.400> no<00:04:09.670> thigh<00:04:09.970> joint

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
for what it is there is no thigh joint

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.630 
for what it is there is no thigh joint
so<00:04:10.630> with<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:12.040> absence<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.520> that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
so with that the absence of that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.120 
so with that the absence of that
articulation<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.840> cannot<00:04:14.290> point<00:04:14.590> his<00:04:14.860> legs

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
articulation you cannot point his legs

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.610 
articulation you cannot point his legs
forward<00:04:15.520> without<00:04:15.940> really<00:04:16.330> making<00:04:16.720> me<00:04:17.170> look

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
forward without really making me look

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.560 
forward without really making me look
stupid<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:18.480> can<00:04:19.480> only<00:04:19.600> go<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.049> out<00:04:20.170> so<00:04:21.570> but

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
stupid I can only go in and out so but

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.840 
stupid I can only go in and out so but
still<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.990> know<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.860> these<00:04:24.310> figures<00:04:24.730> are

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
still you know this these figures are

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.730 
still you know this these figures are
really<00:04:25.210> meant<00:04:25.420> to<00:04:25.510> be<00:04:25.630> displayed<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.320> just

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
really meant to be displayed and just

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.040 
really meant to be displayed and just
either<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.640> flight<00:04:27.880> mode<00:04:28.090> or<00:04:28.300> standing<00:04:28.720> up<00:04:28.870> he

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
either in flight mode or standing up he

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.050 
either in flight mode or standing up he
doesn't<00:04:29.170> need<00:04:29.440> his<00:04:29.530> legs<00:04:29.800> forward<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.940> would

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
doesn't need his legs forward it would
