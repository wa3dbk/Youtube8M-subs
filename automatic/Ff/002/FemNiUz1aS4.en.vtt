frame<00:01:41.970> by<00:01:42.119> frame<00:01:42.150> you're<00:01:42.659> through<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.439> can't

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
frame by frame you're through you can't

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.039 
frame by frame you're through you can't
kind<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.100> back<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.520> change<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.210> frame<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
kind of go back and change your frame it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
kind of go back and change your frame it
you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.070> either<00:01:47.310> work<00:01:47.579> or<00:01:47.850> not

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you know it has to either work or not

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
you know it has to either work or not
it's<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> performance<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.710> on

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
sure the characters in focus and hitting

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
sure the characters in focus and hitting
its<00:02:10.259> spots<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.009> everything<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.459> know

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
its spots and everything you know

its spots and everything you know
in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> light<00:02:13.080> lighting<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.709> everything<00:02:14.099> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
in the light lighting and everything and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.800 
in the light lighting and everything and
that's<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.209> lighting<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
that's for for the lighting and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.899 
that's for for the lighting and
everything<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.950> there's<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.489> also

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
everything and then there's and also

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.160 
everything and then there's and also
then<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.180> cut<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.019> get<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
then we cut that in and we get the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.770 
then we cut that in and we get the
timing<00:02:19.500> right<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.129> then<00:02:20.879> we<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> more<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
timing right and then we do a more a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.740 
timing right and then we do a more a
more<00:02:22.049> kind<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.980> proper<00:02:23.280> rehearsal<00:02:23.430> see<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
more kind of proper rehearsal see the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.600 
more kind of proper rehearsal see the
animation<00:02:25.110> doesn't<00:02:25.349> get<00:02:25.470> exhausted<00:02:25.610> putting

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
animation doesn't get exhausted putting

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.640 
animation doesn't get exhausted putting
too<00:02:26.790> much<00:02:26.909> happening<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.780> then<00:02:28.260> when<00:02:28.409> we<00:02:28.500> go

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
too much happening and then when we go

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.830 
too much happening and then when we go
for<00:02:28.829> a<00:02:28.860> real<00:02:28.980> tank<00:02:29.250> house<00:02:30.030> things<00:02:30.360> change<00:02:30.690> from

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
for a real tank house things change from

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.300 
for a real tank house things change from
your<00:02:31.049> first<00:02:31.290> short<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.799> this<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.280> sure

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
your first short to this and I'm sure

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.390 
your first short to this and I'm sure
that<00:02:33.230> technology<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.349> head-down<00:02:34.590> come<00:02:35.129> into

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
that technology is head-down come into

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.569 
that technology is head-down come into
play<00:02:35.579> somewhere<00:02:36.530> yeah<00:02:37.530> yeah<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> mean<00:02:38.129> I'm<00:02:38.519> a

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
normal character animation you know is

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.110 
normal character animation you know is
using<00:02:40.379> clay<00:02:40.980> models<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.549> these<00:02:41.700> yeah<00:02:42.000> these

yeah we like it to have the clay look
you<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.329> handmade<00:02:51.720> look<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.260> part<00:02:52.500> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
you know the handmade look is part of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.500 
you know the handmade look is part of
the<00:02:52.680> charm<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.129> all<00:02:53.310> we'd<00:02:53.970> only<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.269> too

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
the charm of it all we'd only get too

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.050 
the charm of it all we'd only get too
slick<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:55.650> there<00:02:55.829> are<00:02:55.920> things<00:02:56.099> some<00:02:56.819> things

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
are just impossible to do with clay and

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.729 
are just impossible to do with clay and
they're<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.540> some<00:03:00.540> water<00:03:00.780> effects<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.590> and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
fog there's a lot of fog put in

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.250 
fog there's a lot of fog put in
digitally<00:03:04.140> what<00:03:04.379> about<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.739> BG<00:03:05.030> 6000<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.180> mean

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.020 

yeah<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.590> was<00:03:10.799> one<00:03:11.040> instance<00:03:11.489> where<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.849> had

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
yeah that was one instance where we had

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.640 
yeah that was one instance where we had
to<00:03:12.180> use<00:03:12.209> technology<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.349> know<00:03:13.470> digital

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
to use technology you know digital

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.129 
to use technology you know digital
technology<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.480> was<00:03:15.720> really<00:03:15.870> because

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
technology and it it was really because

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.539 
technology and it it was really because
they<00:03:16.680> were<00:03:16.739> rabbits

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
they were rabbits

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.220 
they were rabbits
they're<00:03:17.880> all<00:03:18.030> floating<00:03:18.510> around<00:03:18.599> inside<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
they're all floating around inside the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.670 
they're all floating around inside the
bunvac<00:03:19.410> 6000<00:03:20.400> reel<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:21.079> if<00:03:22.079> we<00:03:22.410> could<00:03:22.590> have

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
bunvac 6000 reel and if we could have

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.080 
bunvac 6000 reel and if we could have
done<00:03:22.829> them<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.069> clay<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:23.760> they'd<00:03:23.880> have<00:03:24.000> all

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
done them with clay but they'd have all

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.030 
done them with clay but they'd have all
had<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.419> have<00:03:24.480> supports<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.889> though

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
had to have supports and with though

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.979 
had to have supports and with though
it's<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.310> easy<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.730> do<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.000> CGI<00:03:27.209> cuz<00:03:27.840> they

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
it's just easy to do the CGI cuz they

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.190 
it's just easy to do the CGI cuz they
were<00:03:28.049> floating<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.859> with<00:03:29.609> such<00:03:29.790> detail<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.660> we

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
were floating and with such detail we we

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.379 
were floating and with such detail we we
we<00:03:31.739> built<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.190> rabbits<00:03:32.519> first<00:03:32.790> out<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.030> clay

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
we built the rabbits first out of clay

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.330 
we built the rabbits first out of clay
and<00:03:33.569> got<00:03:33.750> them<00:03:33.870> scanned<00:03:34.200> into<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.530> computer<00:03:35.010> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
and got them scanned into a computer and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.940 
and got them scanned into a computer and
then<00:03:35.910> they'll<00:03:36.120> they<00:03:36.870> honor<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.290> CGA<00:03:37.680> guys

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
then they'll they honor the CGA guys

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.699 
then they'll they honor the CGA guys
made<00:03:38.280> them<00:03:38.430> all<00:03:38.579> rotate<00:03:39.379> animated<00:03:40.379> them<00:03:40.530> so

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
made them all rotate animated them so

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.110 
made them all rotate animated them so
how<00:03:40.859> many<00:03:40.919> different<00:03:41.250> versions<00:03:41.669> will<00:03:42.030> you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
how many different versions will you

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.509 
how many different versions will you
have<00:03:42.359> of<00:03:42.569> Wallace<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.799> film<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.220> mean<00:03:44.370> it

so many sets at the same time we have

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.509 
so many sets at the same time we have
about<00:03:49.310> 25<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.639> him<00:03:50.849> and<00:03:51.030> same<00:03:51.810> Gromit<00:03:52.519> alright

now<00:03:53.669> here's<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.180> big<00:03:54.359> question

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
now here's the big question

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.770 
now here's the big question
grommet<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.340> obviously<00:03:56.849> much<00:03:57.510> more

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
grommet is obviously much more

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.839 
grommet is obviously much more
intelligent<00:03:57.840> than<00:03:58.560> Wallace<00:03:59.040> White<00:03:59.400> hasn't

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
intelligent than Wallace White hasn't

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:07.250 
intelligent than Wallace White hasn't
grown<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.150> talk<00:04:03.290> well<00:04:04.290> he<00:04:04.379> never<00:04:04.560> has<00:04:05.480> he's<00:04:06.480> ever

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
grown a talk well he never has he's ever

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.569 
grown a talk well he never has he's ever
since<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.739> first<00:04:07.919> days<00:04:08.160> know<00:04:08.370> when<00:04:08.489> I

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
since the first days know when I

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.610 
since the first days know when I
invented<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.419> characters<00:04:09.930> back<00:04:10.079> at<00:04:10.230> college

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
invented the characters back at college

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.089 
invented the characters back at college
and<00:04:10.889> I<00:04:11.790> found<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.989> was<00:04:13.440> always<00:04:13.650> gonna<00:04:13.859> have

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
then with a big mouth is gonna be a very

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.520 
then with a big mouth is gonna be a very
different

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
different

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.080 
different
I<00:04:22.560> found<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.070> was<00:04:23.160> so<00:04:23.340> difficult<00:04:23.550> when<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:23.880> came

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
I found it was so difficult when I came

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.420 
I found it was so difficult when I came
to<00:04:24.270> do<00:04:24.420> it<00:04:25.230> was<00:04:25.350> part<00:04:25.590> probably<00:04:26.100> out<00:04:26.280> of

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
to do it was part probably out of

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.640 
to do it was part probably out of
laziness<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:27.180> found<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:27.930> much<00:04:28.080> easier<00:04:28.260> just

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
laziness I found it so much easier just

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.610 
laziness I found it so much easier just
to<00:04:28.800> move<00:04:28.980> his<00:04:29.160> brow<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.930> he<00:04:30.930> doesn't<00:04:31.260> hold

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
to move his brow and he doesn't hold

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.129 
to move his brow and he doesn't hold
facial<00:04:31.980> expression<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:36.090> know<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:36.630> mean<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:36.960> I

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
facial expression I know I mean I I

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.720 
facial expression I know I mean I I
suddenly<00:04:37.410> realized<00:04:37.889> he<00:04:38.040> doesn't<00:04:38.310> need<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.490> do

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
suddenly realized he doesn't need to do

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.140 
suddenly realized he doesn't need to do
anything

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
anything

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.000 
anything
it<00:04:39.690> certainly<00:04:39.930> made<00:04:40.139> him<00:04:40.260> very<00:04:40.380> intelligent

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
it certainly made him very intelligent

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.650 
it certainly made him very intelligent
and<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.340> was<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> really<00:04:41.669> good<00:04:42.000> dynamic<00:04:42.510> with

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
and so it was a really good dynamic with

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.720 
and so it was a really good dynamic with
a<00:04:42.690> man<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.200> dog<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.130> have<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.370> dog<00:04:44.550> as

a man and a dog and to have the dog as

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.390 
a man and a dog and to have the dog as
the<00:04:44.850> smart<00:04:45.120> one<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.830> know<00:04:46.950> he<00:04:47.100> was<00:04:47.250> wish

the smart one and you know he was wish

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.580 
the smart one and you know he was wish

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
with the clay animation you can put such

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.210 
with the clay animation you can put such
a<00:04:49.620> lot<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:49.830> feeling<00:04:50.280> into<00:04:50.430> his<00:04:50.580> face<00:04:52.130> thank<00:04:53.130> you
