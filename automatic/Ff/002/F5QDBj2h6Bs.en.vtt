00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
ground in relation to a golf ball what

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.630 
ground in relation to a golf ball what
would<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.250> tell<00:00:14.460> me<00:00:14.840> behind<00:00:15.840> the<00:00:15.960> ball<00:00:16.369> at<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
would you tell me behind the ball at the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.470 
would you tell me behind the ball at the
ball<00:00:17.820> or<00:00:18.260> beyond<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> ball<00:00:20.150> we<00:00:21.150> need<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
ball or beyond the ball we need to

strike the ground just beyond the ball

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.710 
strike the ground just beyond the ball
why<00:00:25.250> because<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.489> want<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:26.880> club<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.450> be

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
why because we want the club to be

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.920 
why because we want the club to be
coming<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.650> above<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.160> ball<00:00:29.599> striking<00:00:30.599> at

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
coming from above the ball striking at

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.800 
coming from above the ball striking at
the<00:00:31.079> equator<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> way<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.669> when<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> do

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
the equator on the way down when you do

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.840 
the equator on the way down when you do
that<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.320> ball<00:00:34.500> comes<00:00:35.220> up<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.579> grooves

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that the ball comes up the grooves

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.490 
that the ball comes up the grooves
creates<00:00:36.300> backspin<00:00:36.930> you're<00:00:37.260> still

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
creates backspin you're still

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
creates backspin you're still
accelerating<00:00:37.969> you<00:00:38.969> get<00:00:39.180> distance<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
accelerating you get distance and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040 
accelerating you get distance and
trajectory<00:00:40.769> control<00:00:41.269> so<00:00:42.269> what<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.629> would<00:00:42.809> want

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
trajectory control so what we would want

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.660 
trajectory control so what we would want
to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:44.629> create<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:46.070> place<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to do then is create a place for you to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.900 
to do then is create a place for you to
stand<00:00:48.000> I've<00:00:48.449> used<00:00:49.079> two<00:00:49.320> rods<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.640> chalk

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
stand I've used two rods and a chalk

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.479 
stand I've used two rods and a chalk
line<00:00:51.019> you<00:00:52.019> could<00:00:52.199> actually<00:00:52.410> draw<00:00:52.890> these<00:00:53.190> lines

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
line you could actually draw these lines

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299 
line you could actually draw these lines
with<00:00:54.000> chalk<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.660> wanted<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.160> put<00:00:56.160> your

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
with chalk if you wanted to put your

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.989 
with chalk if you wanted to put your
handle<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.089> line<00:00:57.420> why<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.999> wherever

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
handle on that line why because wherever

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.509 
handle on that line why because wherever
the<00:01:00.329> handle<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.289> where<00:01:01.499> that<00:01:01.679> Club<00:01:01.980> reaches

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
the handle is is where that Club reaches

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.340 
the handle is is where that Club reaches
the<00:01:02.670> bottom<00:01:02.999> of<00:01:03.120> its<00:01:03.269> arc<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.929> can<00:01:04.110> see

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the bottom of its arc so you can see

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
the bottom of its arc so you can see
right<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.040> reaching<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.550> bottom<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
right there it's reaching the bottom of

bottom of the arc there it's on the way
up<00:01:14.190> when<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.490> gets<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.940> ball<00:01:15.150> too<00:01:15.930> far

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
up when it gets to the ball too far

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.550 
up when it gets to the ball too far
forward<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:17.760> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> top<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.320> scull

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
