skirt<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:05.820> how<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> used<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> describe<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
skirt that's how I used to describe it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
skirt that's how I used to describe it
it's<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> funny<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:09.060> how

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it's really kind of funny and that's how

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.600 
it's really kind of funny and that's how
we<00:01:09.299> used<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> teach<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.770> still<00:01:11.010> teach<00:01:11.189> how

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
we used to teach and we still teach how

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.510 
we used to teach and we still teach how
to<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:12.119> really<00:01:12.930> nice<00:01:13.080> Iker<00:01:13.680> sculptured<00:01:14.250> nails

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to get really nice Iker sculptured nails

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
to get really nice Iker sculptured nails
so<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> way<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.479> miss<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> sides

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so that way they don't miss the sides

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
so that way they don't miss the sides
because<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> times<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.640> sculpting

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
because a lot of times when sculpting

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
because a lot of times when sculpting
the<00:01:18.210> sides<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.720> missed<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.890> how

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the sides can be missed so this is how

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.039 
the sides can be missed so this is how
we<00:01:20.070> were<00:01:20.340> training<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.729> many<00:01:21.000> years<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.869> now
