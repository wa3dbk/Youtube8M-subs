00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello I have my skincare today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.509
 routine for you because I much on 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.610
 was asked if I can do it 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.349
 and yes we drive directly with the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.139
 make-up removal and I do that mostly 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.690
 with the l'orÃ©al paris hydro active 3 with 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.310
 cells technology cleaning street and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.310
 I just paint my eyes with it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 and my whole face off because of that 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.640
 make-up removal is for eyes and face 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099
 also for the lips 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.710
 that is very convenient and I like that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 also very much because that is very gentle 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 I use someone under the shower 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.590
 First one peeling and that is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 means currently sits by barea and yes 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.309
 I just have it in normal 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.030
 my skin again I think so 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.950
 would do 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 and after I washed it off 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.210
 from barea uses a shower gel and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.879
 Although this is currently with maracuja 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 smell and I always do that with one 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 shower bath because I think that then 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.149
 I also think that it works much better 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.850
 always a kind of bodylotion you again 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.379
 you have to wash off how to wear it 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.820
 his skin and washes it 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 then again from there I have 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.730
 honestly not one 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.070
 seen great effect but I try 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 they are still out then we come 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.119
 for facial cleansing and he uses me 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.700
 always first out of the machine series that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.560
 Facial peeling against blemished skin and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.820
 I just wear it with my hands 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.470
 I've got that with me too 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.689
 made peeling pad but I find that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 just a little more practical with your hands 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.560
 and then I just know that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
 normally off and then I wore that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.189
 Then dry with a towel 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.229
 and something goes out of it 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.729
 I only wear this series with mine 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.320
 get on easily and then 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.380
 I go with my electric 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.360
 the biggest of holidays 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.549
 especially my chin my 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.430
 nose and my forehead come from the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.640
 that was the most impurity that was 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.320
 quite normal with water 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.720
 and then I go back with that 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.610
 I use this towel sometimes 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.229
 also from olaz this skin perfectly in 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.479
 clans but I 'm doing so completely 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.190
 but often every night I use then 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.979
 still this l'orÃ©al paris hydro active 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.690
 three facial waters and that's what I'm getting 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.509
 just the last dirt from my 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.729
 skin out so to speak and yes you see 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.500
 there is still a lot to it and yes I am 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.270
 by the way also very happy masks 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.580
 and I sometimes use the anti 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.290
 pimple mask of shards and am 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.620
 Dearest the cleansing mask of 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.150
 valea also likes the trucks on the mag 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.830
 I love to continue with mine 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.959
 eat very strongly 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.400
 which is supposed to refine also born 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.050
 I do not know if that's right 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.450
 I do not really care about that 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 important after ten minutes I do the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.440
 then again with those sensitive 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.410
 wet towels from babylove because I 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.300
 think that goes best for it 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.300
 the moisture is always used 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.430
 same as china the series one 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.160
 moisturizing and yes the lately 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.060
 First, just on my skin and then 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.709
 then compared them normally 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.390
 and most important of all is natural 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.250
 Drink a lot because it gets through the water 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.870
 the skin is better supplied with more blood 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.180
 supplied with oxygen and then with the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.590
 skin metabolism boosted want yes 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.690
 that was my main character 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.690
 routine and I liked it
