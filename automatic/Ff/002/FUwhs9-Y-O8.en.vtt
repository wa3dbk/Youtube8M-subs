going<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.180> use<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.780> tip<00:01:56.620> of<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.100> iron<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
going to use the tip of this iron to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.770 
going to use the tip of this iron to
create<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.290> shape<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.860> plumeria<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
create the shape of the plumeria it

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.100 
create the shape of the plumeria it
really<00:02:01.990> turns<00:02:02.230> out<00:02:02.440> me

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.230 

and<00:02:09.619> if<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.890> don't<00:02:10.070> quite<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.090> can

and if you don't quite like that you can

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.780 
and if you don't quite like that you can
go<00:02:12.140> over<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.500> one<00:02:12.650> more<00:02:12.830> time<00:02:13.070> till<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.640> get

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
go over it one more time till you get

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.720 
go over it one more time till you get
something<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:15.580> there<00:02:16.580> we

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
something that you really like there we

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.320 
something that you really like there we
