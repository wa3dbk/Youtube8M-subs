 andreas history of your computer and 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.600
 After you download the program jÃ´ 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.550
 now that I've forgotten the name of the program 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.269

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.700
 description of the video link for you to download 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.010
 It's a very cool show and it has 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.270
 several modifications you like 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.950
 drift races and has deise servers 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:21.630
 also that in the case is the one that I am 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:25.720
 playing now and has many varied and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.700
 etc to play and not through creek 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.130
 worship taking but I'll pause and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 return 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.330
 good going back to the game is coming in now 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.220
 Here I am going to put a reminder that 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.920
 I'll put the ipi and download link 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.720
 This world here is here is how you 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.880
 enter I think all servers have this 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.250
 that you are here you register as the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.890
 your nick that there is always who is is that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.790
 already have or click the link to place 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.110
 obviously it's this world and if that is there 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.710
 What's the name? 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.970
 it leaves the gta much more realistic and not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.830
 he leaves at the same time I leave 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.540
 more realistic to give more details to 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.869
 characters etc 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.900
 He did not do a little bit, it's pretty cool. 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.140
 as I said it is the way since 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.980
 I'm playing right now 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.510
 I'm going normally, you're going to be born in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.530
 desert usually always in this desert 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.470
 Is it that there is a lot of br is not just 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.230
 I have a lot of br and I know of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.400
 an easter egg of a dead guy just okay 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.590
 now neither should have 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.670
 I had I think it's around here that has 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.360
 a car and such 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.220
 Well, here's how it's since it's true. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.500
 hard to find it difficult to tea 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.570
 car is difficult to find difficult bike 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.720
 leave more difficult to leave the water is 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.350
 Hard to find the food it's hard to find everything 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.290
 - unb adunb you think it's easy is gay 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.180
 Do you find it easy or not at all? 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.530
 because zombie sometimes can change some 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.810
 drop thing could not even he sometimes 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.600
 you can die comes close tighten 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.250
 letter je tal who plays now is 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.940
 accustomed to these things with this 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.900
 No playing system I'm going to teach here 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.549
 How to play is to hear it here. 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.970
 how am I going to vest here 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.280
 I'm good here, it's me. 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.350
 I think a car that of the cars and I know how 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.150
 but probably should not have anything 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.530
 inside it just squeeze the sj then 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.390
 Talking here with me, this does not 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:37.380
 I know that much is much less like 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:40.230
 that that br / argentina server but has 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.239
 but I do not know what this car is here 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.549
 here is missing the engine missing a lot 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.040
 thing and there is no way to get close to it. 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.920
 to start the engine because there is not me here 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.299
 I think I just found a gun. 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.090
 silent ammunition a knife 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:01.280
 I already put everything near here just put 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:06.250
 Lenses, this way, not here again. 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.100
 I'm going to die here is illegal 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.830
 for a start I think the woman who 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.450
 was near me and swore at me 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:26.380
 time the guy had playing style of 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:28.630
 way to help but the mountain is one thing 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:36.670
 important in the game but will by seen 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:38.320
 bet on a good me is the basic is this me 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.600
 I'll show you your base for now. 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.700
 You want me to continue and I 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.360
 I'm still here to show you more tutorials 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.610
 go is to show more the gameplay of 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.320
 so here you also want to give 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.380
 to make a I would do it there and I 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.700
 call you to play on the same server 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.140
 It's just talk there, it 's just you give me the idea that I 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.780
 I make the beauty 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.180

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.130

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.620
 but I'm going to record or 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.860

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.270
