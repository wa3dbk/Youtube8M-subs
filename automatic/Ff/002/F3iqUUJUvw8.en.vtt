they come out so in an incredibly
comfortable<00:02:35.360> position<00:02:35.959> if<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.709> have

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
wouldn't be a great position so that's a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.470 
wouldn't be a great position so that's a
reason<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.340> talk<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.670> your<00:02:40.760> provider<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.239> say
