00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.200
 in front of us is and is the google nexus 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.179
 5 and we want a precise look 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.280
 a detailed look at the design 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.820
 may I wish you much fun going 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 is it the first few words has become 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 the back deserves as well as the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.119
 google nexus 7 2013 is a soft hat 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.800
 surface like you really very much 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 feels good and also good in the hand 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 We find a vertical axis 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.269
 lettering and top left in the corner 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 A big camera lens on the left 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.050
 We can not find anything below 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 the frame a bit further up the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.430
 made of ceramic existing volume this 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 has a really solid good 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.140
 pressure point and stands out a bit 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.360
 the housing out on the top there 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.160
 It is a secondary microphone to active 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 noise suppression for example 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.730
 when acquitting or if you are one 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.559
 record video and the 35 mm 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 jack connection for any 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 headset right there is another 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.699
 Taste of ceramic and indeed it is the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.590
 a power button and then we find 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 Of course, the micro SIM card slot 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.979
 just put the included tool into that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.200
 small hole cover the sled comes 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.630
 raus micro sim card in and the whole 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.470
 to do now 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.780
 below we find the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.479
 micro-usb connector microphone and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.490
 of course, the speakers 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.409
 backside starts with the lg logo 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.229
 some markings one made in 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.880
 korea and a model name then 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.680
 comes the vertically held next one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.509
 lettering and on the top left of the eck 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 the camera by a single led 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.530
 the camera area is supported 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.240
 very big you can see it already auÃŸenrum 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.130
 there is still a magnetic ring 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.140
 you can still do it so little extra 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.210
 attach optional lenses 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.000
 not really official though 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.500
 works on the front 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.299
 staring at the far left with the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.009
 front camera in the middle then is times 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.140
 what else do we see a round 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.200
 earpiece and right but light and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.369
 Proximity sensor to the fore 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.259
 of course, the whole thing has to be controlled 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.540
 we'll have three on screen for that 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.110
 keys back rom and an active one 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.880
 applications and that's it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.640
 with the detailed view of the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.530
 design of google nexus 5 is always 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.420
 matter of taste I think the thing has 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.330
 Something is extreme in any case 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.220
 Well 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.840
 In my hand that was mine, I hope 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.840
 you liked the video, that's good
