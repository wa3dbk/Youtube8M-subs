and safely remove a mini DV tape from a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.700 
and safely remove a mini DV tape from a
dead<00:00:10.679> camcorder<00:00:11.340> such<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.330> Canon<00:00:12.840> HV<00:00:13.259> 30

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.260 

first<00:00:16.710> undo<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> hand<00:00:17.460> strap<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.000> set<00:00:18.180> it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
first undo the hand strap and set it

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.050 
first undo the hand strap and set it
aside

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.670 

now<00:00:24.060> remove<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.450> base<00:00:24.750> by<00:00:24.960> unscrewing<00:00:25.440> these

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
now remove the base by unscrewing these

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:39.420 
now remove the base by unscrewing these
eight<00:00:25.980> screws

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.490 

the<00:00:40.430> bottom<00:00:40.760> should<00:00:40.910> now<00:00:41.090> easily<00:00:41.630> pop<00:00:41.840> off<00:00:44.500> the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
the bottom should now easily pop off the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.080

mechanism<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.129> eject<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.520> tape<00:00:46.790> must<00:00:46.970> be

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
mechanism to eject the tape must be

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.479 
mechanism to eject the tape must be
activated<00:00:47.720> by<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.840> small<00:00:48.110> power<00:00:48.350> source<00:00:48.710> you

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
activated by a small power source you

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.010 
activated by a small power source you
want<00:00:49.699> to<00:00:49.790> make<00:00:49.910> sure<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.270> don't<00:00:50.390> run<00:00:50.600> too<00:00:50.840> much

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
want to make sure you don't run too much

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.780 
want to make sure you don't run too much
power<00:00:51.260> through<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.340> double-a

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
power through it and to double-a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.119 
power through it and to double-a
batteries<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:53.360> perfect<00:00:53.829> tape<00:00:54.829> them<00:00:55.010> together

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
batteries is perfect tape them together

batteries is perfect tape them together
like<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:55.519> to<00:00:55.970> create<00:00:56.839> about<00:00:56.930> 3<00:00:57.290> volts<00:00:59.019> now

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
like this to create about 3 volts now

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.899 
like this to create about 3 volts now
attach<00:01:00.350> two<00:01:00.620> pieces<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:01.070> wire<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:01.460> act<00:01:01.610> as<00:01:01.790> your

attach two pieces of wire to act as your

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.600 
attach two pieces of wire to act as your
jumper<00:01:02.180> wires<00:01:05.950> notice<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.040> polarity<00:01:07.580> is

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
jumper wires notice the polarity is

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.700 
jumper wires notice the polarity is
negative<00:01:08.180> on<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.420> left<00:01:08.630> make<00:01:09.080> sure<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.470> main

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
negative on the left make sure the main

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.210 
negative on the left make sure the main

a positive wire on the upper contact
touch<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.740> wires<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.250> motor<00:01:16.520> which<00:01:16.729> will

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
touch the wires to the motor which will

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.130 
touch the wires to the motor which will
now<00:01:17.210> spin<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.840> open<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.289> tape<00:01:18.470> player<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.930> tape

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
now spin to open a tape player the tape

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.810 
now spin to open a tape player the tape
will<00:01:21.289> not<00:01:21.350> eject<00:01:21.740> fully<00:01:22.039> and<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.520> there<00:01:22.729> will

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
will not eject fully and that there will

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.820 
will not eject fully and that there will
be<00:01:22.850> some<00:01:23.180> slack<00:01:23.539> left<00:01:23.869> out<00:01:24.080> of<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.320> tape<00:01:24.560> which

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
be some slack left out of the tape which

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.340 
be some slack left out of the tape which
you<00:01:24.860> must<00:01:25.250> carefully<00:01:25.640> remove<00:01:26.149> you<00:01:26.810> can<00:01:26.960> simply

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you must carefully remove you can simply

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.320 
you must carefully remove you can simply
relay<00:01:27.649> back<00:01:27.860> in<00:01:28.070> like<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.970> close<00:01:32.179> the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
relay back in like this to close the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.389 
relay back in like this to close the
tape<00:01:32.539> drive<00:01:32.780> again<00:01:33.080> tape<00:01:33.740> down<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.100> door

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.010 

reverse<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.580> polarity<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.360> batteries<00:01:38.840> by

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
reverse the polarity of the batteries by

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.779 
reverse the polarity of the batteries by
applying<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.619> positive<00:01:40.100> side<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.550> lower

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
applying the positive side to the lower

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.950 
applying the positive side to the lower
contact<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.600> motor<00:01:41.780> instead<00:01:46.600> now<00:01:47.600> simply

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
contact on the motor instead now simply

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.960 
contact on the motor instead now simply
set<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.290> base<00:01:48.470> piece<00:01:48.770> back<00:01:49.009> on<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.490> replace

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
set the base piece back on and replace

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:10.620 
set the base piece back on and replace
all<00:01:50.210> eight<00:01:50.479> screws
