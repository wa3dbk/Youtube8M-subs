that<00:02:14.549> we<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.939> that<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.420> showed<00:02:15.629> that

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
that we like that because it showed that

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.390 
that we like that because it showed that
you<00:02:15.810> were<00:02:16.049> real<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.129> you<00:02:17.189> were

I think people responded to that that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.850 
I think people responded to that that
