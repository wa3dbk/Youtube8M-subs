00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.880
 The plans have probably many places on the kidneys 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:10.419
 in the team 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.419
 the camera is focused on me it's mean 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:15.820
 holds so far 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.810
 you are 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.970
 a good 2 percent and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.509
 good of us 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.909
 lie down yes I'm so old 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.869
 up to 12 level 2 and explained it is obviously drifting it is nice to hold what 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:30.529
 she from it 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 how does it work 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 push these basic company visits 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 negative pressure 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 London Aachen Hello you love the beautiful test 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 we are to every case 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.670
 the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.470
 OK 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.590
 in my opinion, this is 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.150
 but what is mine at 1 Neumarkt 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.110
 and we 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.480
 This is done by hand 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.890
 I'm just out I realize that I'm talking to Caritas 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 So he really does not say anything acceptable 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 in Frankfurt 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.690
 Rheine 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.570
 while the injured numbers probably was a chat 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.830
 next to the construction hound half runs 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.200
 Red Dahlenburg give 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.150
 and now you should 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.790
 Issue the euro and give it promptly 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.430
 Well 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.300
 and 4 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.420
 and there is another classic 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.720
 now in our block 4 that's Dr May in focus 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.890
 this does not count 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.520
 Tom Ford honored and he wants to combine 2 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 or can there actually be said 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.729
 there is no line suite no longer take a sentence 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:16.180
 felt like end up bumping my neck here then again 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.929
 immediately 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.519
 in the end I absolutely predicted it was completely clear to me 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 Well, finally, you do not have fun 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.859
 Reason enough to say it 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.439
 Germany arrived in the middle of the mid-20th century 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.029
 Franconia 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.719
 a movement over the head 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.169
 earlier 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.529
 Carmen felon in four, too, that was this wood story two though 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.009
 given by at least one kicked yes too 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.269
 It was called then and yet all the people of course not so 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.210
 it makes it symbolic that the offense is because what would do 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.210
 then in the marketplace was driven into the too 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.279
 seven points 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.259
 and 4 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.229
 and 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.829
 there 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.409
