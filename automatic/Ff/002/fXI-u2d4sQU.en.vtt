make sure you incorporate that really

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:36.970 
make sure you incorporate that really
well<00:02:34.599> now<00:02:35.599> you<00:02:35.690> can't<00:02:36.110> use<00:02:36.230> baking<00:02:36.680> soda<00:02:36.890> in

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980

this<00:02:37.069> recipe<00:02:37.400> baking<00:02:37.910> powder<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.239> really

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
this recipe baking powder is really

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.059 
this recipe baking powder is really
important<00:02:38.810> because<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.379> liquids<00:02:39.829> going<00:02:40.010> to

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
important because the liquids going to

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.920 
important because the liquids going to
interact<00:02:40.310> with<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.670> baking<00:02:40.970> powder<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.480> then

again<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.349> oven<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.829> it's<00:02:42.980> really<00:02:43.190> going

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
again in the oven so it's really going

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.319 
again in the oven so it's really going
to<00:02:43.459> help<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.760> puff<00:02:43.940> up

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
to help it puff up
