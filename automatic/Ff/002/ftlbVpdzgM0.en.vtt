so today I'm going to teaching you the

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.480 
so today I'm going to teaching you the
360<00:00:22.419> bar<00:00:22.599> spin

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
360 bar spin

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.390 
360 bar spin
before<00:00:25.150> you<00:00:25.270> even<00:00:25.420> start<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.140> do<00:00:26.260> it<00:00:26.440> this<00:00:26.950> is<00:00:27.190> a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
before you even start to do it this is a

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.279 
before you even start to do it this is a
pretty<00:00:27.610> technical<00:00:27.939> trick<00:00:28.480> you've<00:00:28.840> got<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.170> be

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
pretty technical trick you've got to be

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.190 
pretty technical trick you've got to be
very<00:00:29.529> competent<00:00:30.400> 360s<00:00:31.029> very<00:00:31.689> confident<00:00:32.169> with

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
very competent 360s very confident with

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.830 
very competent 360s very confident with
bass<00:00:32.439> bins<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:33.040> be<00:00:33.460> capable<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:34.030> jump<00:00:34.390> pretty

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
bass bins and be capable to jump pretty

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.180 
bass bins and be capable to jump pretty
big<00:00:35.080> jumps<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.260> step<00:00:38.559> one<00:00:38.830> you<00:00:38.860> want<00:00:39.129> to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
big jumps so step one you want to

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.860 
big jumps so step one you want to
approach<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.640> take<00:00:39.850> off<00:00:40.059> at<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.239> same<00:00:40.480> speed

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
approach the take off at the same speed

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.410 
approach the take off at the same speed
for<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.140> normal<00:00:41.410> 360<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.400> second<00:00:43.360> you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
for a normal 360 and the second you

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.759 
for a normal 360 and the second you
leave<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.750> lip<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.050> want<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.230> prepare<00:00:44.530> for

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
leave the lip you want to prepare for

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.820 
leave the lip you want to prepare for
the<00:00:44.830> bar<00:00:45.010> spin<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.360> get<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:46.960> bike<00:00:47.170> out<00:00:47.410> forward

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
the bar spin so get the bike out forward

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.660 
the bar spin so get the bike out forward
and<00:00:47.949> get<00:00:48.040> your<00:00:48.250> knees<00:00:48.760> clamp

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and get your knees clamp

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
and get your knees clamp
so<00:00:51.269> in<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.539> step<00:00:51.870> you'll<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.589> got<00:00:53.010> your

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so in this step you'll have got your

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.619 
so in this step you'll have got your
knees<00:00:53.309> clamped<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:53.969> you'll<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.269> ready<00:00:54.510> for

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
knees clamped and you'll be ready for

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.540 
knees clamped and you'll be ready for
the<00:00:54.809> bar<00:00:54.989> spin<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.739> weight<00:00:55.920> will<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.309> in

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the bar spin so your weight will be in

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.689 
the bar spin so your weight will be in
the<00:00:56.909> correct<00:00:57.089> position<00:00:57.589> now<00:00:58.589> you<00:00:59.219> gotta<00:00:59.399> throw

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the correct position now you gotta throw

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.560 
the correct position now you gotta throw
those<00:00:59.940> bars<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.190> catch<00:01:02.190> them<00:01:02.519> ready<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
those bars and catch them ready for the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
those bars and catch them ready for the
rest<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> spin<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> quicker<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.670> do

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
rest of the spin and the quicker you do

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
rest of the spin and the quicker you do
the<00:01:06.000> bar<00:01:06.180> spin<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> 360<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.530> easier<00:01:07.860> it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the bar spin in the 360 the easier it's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
the bar spin in the 360 the easier it's
going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:09.149> this<00:01:09.330> trick<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.690> work<00:01:09.840> for

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
going to be for this trick to work for

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.719 
going to be for this trick to work for
you<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:13.380> third<00:01:13.409> step<00:01:14.039> you<00:01:14.430> want<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
you so for the third step you want to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.420 
you so for the third step you want to
have<00:01:14.850> spun<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.810> bars<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.409> caught<00:01:17.159> them

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
have spun your bars and caught them

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.270 
have spun your bars and caught them
before<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.930> 180<00:01:19.259> degrees<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
before you get to 180 degrees if you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.190 
before you get to 180 degrees if you
wanted<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> make<00:01:20.789> this<00:01:20.939> trick<00:01:21.270> even<00:01:21.600> more

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
wanted to make this trick even more

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.219 
wanted to make this trick even more
awesome<00:01:22.800> you<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.190> delay<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.940> bar<00:01:24.420> spin<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
awesome you could delay the bar spin so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
awesome you could delay the bar spin so
the<00:01:25.740> bar<00:01:25.950> spin<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.460> taking<00:01:26.909> longer<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.360> do

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the bar spin is taking longer to do

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.499 
the bar spin is taking longer to do
rather<00:01:28.020> than<00:01:28.229> catching<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.770> before<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.880> 180

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
rather than catching it before your 180

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.609 
rather than catching it before your 180
degrees<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:33.060> bull<00:01:33.330> fuel<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.170> caught<00:01:34.440> your

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
degrees the bull fuel have caught your

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.070 
degrees the bull fuel have caught your
handlebars<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:36.209> want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> look

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
handlebars and now you want to look

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.410 
handlebars and now you want to look
around<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> landing<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:38.970> can

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
around for the landing so you can

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.169 
around for the landing so you can
continue<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:40.110> rotation<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.880> were<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
continue your rotation if you were to

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.660 
continue your rotation if you were to
not<00:01:42.330> look<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.720> landing<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.409> would<00:01:43.590> slow<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
not look the landing you would slow the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
not look the landing you would slow the
rotation<00:01:45.149> down<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.360> probably<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.929> get<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
rotation down and probably not get the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:57.370 
rotation down and probably not get the
the<00:01:46.860> whole<00:01:47.039> 360<00:01:47.640> degrees

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380

that<00:01:58.040> was<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.549> 360<00:01:59.210> bar<00:01:59.420> spin<00:01:59.689> but<00:02:00.229> now<00:02:00.439> here's

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
