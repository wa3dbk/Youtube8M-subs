00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.070
 where modernity interacts with with 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.530
 the challenges 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.330
 this is we create spaces so that 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.580
 people feel comfortable that spaces 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.530
 conceptual the concept of the cream 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.380
 comes from france what we look for in the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.260
 creperÃ­a is to mexicanize that concept is 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.330
 say bring us the original recipe 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.810

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.040
 in the region create exclusive recipes 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.730
 where people can taste a 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.010
 different way 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.180
 The original recipe from France is a 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.130
 little bit because I have to add the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.130
 creperie 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.409
 also beautiful 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:05.350

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:07.420
 it's very nice you want to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.700

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.580
 I would creperÃ­a to see germinated that you finish

 of all your good preparation you help me and I 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.280
 loved the cream and what I love 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.640
 is that if something is so much salty with 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.069
 chipotle then now in a cream yes or yes 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.470
 if you want something sweet they have cream 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.390
 fruit of different sweets until the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.250
 field that yes also the parents also 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.709
 I know they have different rooms with 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.140
 different environments have the terrace 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.629
 they take away they have a lot of driver drives 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.790
 in the concept is what it is that you most 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.230
 they make your food slowly but with 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.349
 enough time for them to 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.200
 chat with someone to talk in games 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.410
 So you have 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.180
 and then leave your recommendations 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.680

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.849
 a variety of strains of all and 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.060
