00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
has gold dots in it and so I thought

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.300 
has gold dots in it and so I thought
that<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.379> particular<00:03:12.620> built<00:03:13.099> with

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
that this particular built with

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.050 
that this particular built with
definitely<00:03:14.000> I'll<00:03:14.859> accentuate<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.459> gold<00:03:16.729> dots

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
definitely I'll accentuate the gold dots

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.939 
definitely I'll accentuate the gold dots
and<00:03:17.329> just<00:03:17.449> bring<00:03:17.629> it<00:03:17.810> up<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.169> chose<00:03:18.709> these

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
and just bring it up I chose these

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.379 
and just bring it up I chose these
earrings<00:03:19.400> because<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.819> earrings<00:03:20.239> are

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
earrings because the earrings are

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.599 
earrings because the earrings are
similar<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.760> design<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:24.739> shape<00:03:25.129> on

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
similar to the design in the shape on

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.210 
similar to the design in the shape on
the<00:03:25.669> dress<00:03:26.659> so<00:03:27.349> I<00:03:27.379> think<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.859> it's<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.189> little

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the dress so I think that it's a little

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.899 
the dress so I think that it's a little
bit<00:03:28.720> bohemian<00:03:29.720> type<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.470> look<00:03:30.620> um<00:03:30.889> if<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.849> took

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
bit bohemian type of look um if I took

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.369 
bit bohemian type of look um if I took
this<00:03:32.150> off<00:03:32.359> it<00:03:32.540> will<00:03:32.569> still<00:03:32.870> be<00:03:32.900> kind<00:03:33.290> of

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
this off it will still be kind of

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.500 
this off it will still be kind of
flowing<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:34.040> like<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.699> the<00:03:34.819> sleeves<00:03:35.120> are<00:03:35.269> kind

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
flowing I like that the sleeves are kind

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.960
