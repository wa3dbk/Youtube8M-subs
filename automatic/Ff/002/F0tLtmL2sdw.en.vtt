00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.280
 youtube channel is all sulfur and we decide 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.320
 task 292 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.349
 spacecraft vega 1 was moving towards 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.049
 comet galileo at thirty 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.750
 four kilometers per second and the comet itself 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.510
 moving towards him with speed 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.050
 forty six kilometers per second which 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.539
 the distance between them was 15 minutes 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 see you 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.820
 if it is said that 15 minutes before the meeting 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.160
 mean somewhere they met 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.260
 suppose they met right here 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.550
 it means on the one hand the comet flew 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.399
 let it be a comet and this is a satellite 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.910
 vega 1 and so they 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 running one satellite flew from here 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.350
 arrow comets alliteration and here they are 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.239
 met here can be solved by two 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.900
 any body methods Method 1 1 with vega 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.460
 thirty- four kilometers at 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.210
 second comet flew with speed 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.070
 forty six kilometers a second can 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.030
 first calculate how much vega flew 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.790
 in 15 minutes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 because ask us what distance 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 between them for 15 minutes that is, 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.430
 15 minutes a fig flew 34 kilometers in 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 second multiply by 15 minutes speed 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.320
 multiply by the time and we get 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.640
 the distance that the comet has flown and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 we can still here means with us 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.079
 46 kilometers per second also multiplied by 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.380
 15 minutes because a comet or a body too 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.180
 15 minutes before meeting here 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 get some distance here get 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.390
 some distance and then you need to be 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.049
 just put them together and we will know everything 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.460
 the distance between our objects and 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.390
 option 2 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.550
 first calculate the total speed of three 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.410
 four kilometers per second 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.110
 plus 46 kilometers per second 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.510
 combine speed add up speed and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.080
 we will know this cumulative or total 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.870
 speed 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.670
 and then multiply this total rate 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.850
 15 minutes can be solved so 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.800
 depends on how you are comfortable let's 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.410
 I'll add speed first and then 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 multiply by 15 minutes to me every 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.070
 the number does not multiply and it is more convenient with a point 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.070
 view of calculations 34 multiplies a 15 and then 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.530
 will need 46 we have this 15 i have this skill 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.380
 do not mind should be considered here 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.750
 a little more comfortable, see 34 plus 46 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.430
 it will be 80 kilometers per second 80 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.200
 kilometers per second is much more convenient 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.990
 multiply by 15 maybe even in umme 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.570
 It will turn out to be considered but definitely easier than 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:11.040
 first 34 to 15 and then 4615 so to us 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:15.930
 you need to multiply 80 kilometers per second 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.940
 you can not multiply by 15 minutes because 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.550
 what is here seconds and here minutes we are not 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.970
 so we can multiply so we 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.170
 need 15 minutes to turn into a second 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.810
 let's separate and auxiliary 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.310
 we will make the decision first 15 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.660
 minutes turn into seconds in one 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.050
 minute 60 seconds 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.930
 then in 15 minutes how many seconds 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:53.910
 60 times 15 60 times 15 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:59.190
 how much will be how much will be how much 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:04.760
 will be 3 st she probably up to 300 is not enough 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.760
 read 900 seconds 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.000
 up to 900 seconds 15 minutes in every minute 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:19.259
 60 seconds each when we multiply 60 seconds 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:25.280
 for 15 it turns out 900 seconds then here 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:28.110
 replace 80 kilometers per second 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.870
 multiply not by 15 minutes 15 mm replace 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.310
 for seconds for 900 seconds we can now 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.460
 multiply passed here seconds and here 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.259
 seconds we get in kilometers some 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:48.199
 8 kilometers multiplied by 70, we got 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:51.150
 say 8 multiply by 9 will be 72 and 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.639
 count the number of zeros here 10 a 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:05:00.990
 here 20 and here we are adding it here 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:07.919
 we are 10 from here and 20 and from here that I have 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:10.580
 it turns out 72 72 thousand kilometers it 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.870
 distance between them 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.690
 let's take another quick task 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.010
 let's run 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.470
 they flew towards each other two 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.110
 object speed 1 speed other 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.750
 we add these speeds 1 they fly 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.300
 towards each other 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.810
 we get 80 kilometers per second and 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.550
 multiply by the time of 15 minutes since we 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.669
 here second here minutes 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.039
 we need 15 minutes to translate into seconds 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.310
 one minute 60 seconds therefore 60 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.020
 multiply by 15 we get that dick 15 minutes 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.990
 it's 90 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.139
 900 seconds and then our speed 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.560
 joint aggregate 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:55.289
 merged cumulative as not 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.729
 call 80 meters per second multiply by 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:03.240
 900 seconds 8 on 9 7 out of 2 and 0 and count 1 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:06.620
 2 3 and here we write them once or twice 72 thousand 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.430
 kilometers is the distance between 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.770
 companion and comet 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.539
 15 minutes before the meeting my name is Andrei 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.380
 Andreevich my channel on YouTube all-all ru 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.380
 bye everyone
