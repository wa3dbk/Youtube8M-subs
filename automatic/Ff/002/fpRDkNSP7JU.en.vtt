 it has been so hard for me to be where 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.600
 I am but believe me I would leave everything 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.210

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:41.420
 the repetition when when it flips over and 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.190

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.190
 pilot almost gets delivered to the plane 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.700

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.700

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.530
 now impressive the reaction see 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.370
 like the hug a few moments ago 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.000
