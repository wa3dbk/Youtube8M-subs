00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello again is the second part 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:12.420
 review my collection of pc games and well 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.360
 let's start the first disk this disk 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.369
 compilation twenty-three in one hunt and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.779
 fishing 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.010
 Now I will show you this one thing. 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.910
 interesting usually 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.550
 hunt different versions to honestly toys 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.800
 is lousy graphics for those times 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 it was a cool one-sided drive 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.809
 and funny in how 23 games could 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.329
 fit on one side of the ordinary 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.300
 disk that is, you can all imagine 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.660
 what's the lousy graphics ask 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.449
 optimization nudist took 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.180
 quite a long time further we go 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.329
 three-in-one collection 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.710
 this assassin's creed revelations 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.570
 the templar and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.830
 because of the war the war of the clones speak honestly 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.680
 I played I only assassin game 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.880
 I liked pretty pretty 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.710
 double-sided drive but minus was 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 that there were no voices in the game 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.180
 there are sounds all were facial expressions that is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.340
 also everything was but 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.540
 voices characters for some reason I was not 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.329
 I know why so I climbed in the settings but 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.390
 nothing like that say never changed 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.850
 They also gave us a small collection of games 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:53.490
 four in one 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:58.020
 king kong turok shark simulation game and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.270
 Avatar I played only in the Turk and the avatar 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.860
 avatar still quite liked it troc 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 also pretty good king himself 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.229
 he is well full of management shark 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.229
 of course wild 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:25.770
 someone like that, too, did again 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:30.090
 normal double sided drive now 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.790
 write in haste can also 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.750
 some places stumble further 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.560
 dragon age compilation 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.870
 fully meeting seems to be here and not 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.680
 I remember everybody playing in one here not only 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 dragon age there are some more games here but 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.440
 I never played them 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:04.200
 the dome disk has long been an ordinary bilateral 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:05.730
 nothing more so the bath we go I do not 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.290
 I know at least that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.290
 I climbed in my desk and found this 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.069
 someone's some conflict landing troops 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.760
 storm something i didn't play it play like 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.120
 would not think but if he write in 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 comments in general what kind of game 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.239
 incomprehensible such further we have 9 boxing 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.060
 excuse was gouged though if he 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.549
 in general was also found in my box as 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.640
 battlefield 2142 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.379
 and for some reason it sits 2 and by the way he 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.599
 I was even on the computer does not start I 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.340
 do not understand the Volt, that is, I like 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.900
 I understand there is such a game, well, why 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.860
 side 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:55.340
 that is, if I do not know if that is necessary 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.739
 can you husband is a moron i just don't understand 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.239
 why not sidiya dividik may well 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.939
 no soundtrack what they want 2 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:10.879
 sits 2 this of course gray knows 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:13.340
 fluff in general is all let's say so leftovers 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:19.769
 Sorry for not being able to 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:23.130
 there was no one to solder it in the atoms 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.680
 big video insofar as my 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.870
 old memory card in my old camera 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.380
 didn't let me write more than 8 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.539
 minutes and now I say pour and bought 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.090
 new camera which allows me 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.970
 write but again with new flash drives 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.630
 which allows not to record about 35 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.449
 minutes 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.979
 Therefore, in the future when there will be 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.320
 collectible large collectible 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.710
 buildings I hope no problems 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.979
 will the quality of the video be better me and me 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.800
 I will try for you even more well in 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:01.440
 general is so well then thank you very much for 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.370
