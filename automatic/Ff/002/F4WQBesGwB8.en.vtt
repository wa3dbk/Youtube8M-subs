00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
which are you know at full strength

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
which are you know at full strength
definitely<00:00:44.460> something<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.410> hold

and shoot that with this and we'll take

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:06.200 
and shoot that with this and we'll take
a<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.789> happens<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> it<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:06.030> see

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a look at what happens to it and see

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
a look at what happens to it and see
it's<00:01:06.330> penetrating<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.290> its<00:01:07.830> back

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it's penetrating in there its back

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.890 
it's penetrating in there its back
filling<00:01:08.340> itself<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> material<00:01:09.450> but

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
filling itself with the material but

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.690 
filling itself with the material but
it's<00:01:10.260> definitely<00:01:10.939> penetrating<00:01:11.939> through<00:01:12.270> this

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's definitely penetrating through this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's definitely penetrating through this
these<00:01:14.930> railroad<00:01:16.220> logs<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.650> you<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.040> don't

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
with these brain keys definitely not

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.710 
with these brain keys definitely not
cheap<00:01:25.500> these<00:01:26.250> things<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.729> they're<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.509> get

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
know it's not that bad I actually like

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.990 
know it's not that bad I actually like
shooting<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.369> better<00:01:41.579> than<00:01:41.700> my<00:01:41.820> regular

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
shooting this better than my regular

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.149 
shooting this better than my regular
slugs<00:01:44.030> get<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> box<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:47.100> know

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
slugs get the box here for you you know

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.440 
slugs get the box here for you you know
this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this is what it's like if you get the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.120 
this is what it's like if you get the
green<00:01:48.659> lightning<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.409> green<00:01:49.590> lightning<00:01:49.979> is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
green lightning the green lightning is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.740 
green lightning the green lightning is
pretty<00:01:50.430> much<00:01:50.579> identical<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
pretty much identical to this so you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.730 
pretty much identical to this so you
shouldn't<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.170> any<00:01:52.280> problems<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
shouldn't have any problems with that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.569 
shouldn't have any problems with that
see<00:01:55.740> muzzle<00:01:56.159> velocities<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.360> very

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
see muzzle velocities and all that very

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.179 
see muzzle velocities and all that very
good<00:01:59.579> stuff<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.049> these<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> lot

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
good stuff I really like these a lot

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.870 
good stuff I really like these a lot
for<00:02:02.909> breaching<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.369> stuff<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.700> these

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
for breaching and stuff like that these

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.359 
for breaching and stuff like that these
things<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.710> excellent<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.950> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
things would be excellent for that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.889 
things would be excellent for that
supposedly<00:02:09.090> these<00:02:09.149> they're<00:02:09.330> actually<00:02:09.660> like

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
supposedly these they're actually like

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.500 
supposedly these they're actually like
go<00:02:10.080> through<00:02:10.160> like<00:02:11.160> engine<00:02:11.819> blocks<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.450> all

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
go through like engine blocks and all

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.190 
go through like engine blocks and all
the<00:02:12.629> other<00:02:12.810> core

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the other core

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
the other core
definitely<00:02:14.160> gonna<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> job<00:02:14.640> done<00:02:14.880> if

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
definitely gonna get the job done if
