into their bodies so instead of putting
something<00:00:39.530> into<00:00:39.829> their<00:00:39.920> body<00:00:40.129> that's<00:00:40.340> going

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
something into their body that's going

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.849 
something into their body that's going
to<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.940> know<00:00:41.059> constipate<00:00:41.870> them<00:00:42.110> or<00:00:42.409> at<00:00:42.589> worst

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
to you know constipate them or at worst

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.279 
to you know constipate them or at worst
brought<00:00:43.730> in<00:00:44.089> their<00:00:44.269> digestive<00:00:44.449> system<00:00:45.109> and

brought in their digestive system and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:46.509 
brought in their digestive system and
then<00:00:45.469> they're<00:00:45.620> going<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.769> have<00:00:45.829> leaky<00:00:46.339> gut

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
then they're going to have leaky gut

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.029 
then they're going to have leaky gut
syndrome<00:00:46.629> and<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:48.379> know<00:00:48.469> have<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.649> whole<00:00:48.859> host

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
of autoimmune things like eczema and

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.229 
of autoimmune things like eczema and
allergies<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.280> know<00:00:52.399> some<00:00:52.579> other<00:00:52.789> issues

allergies and you know some other issues

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.779 
allergies and you know some other issues
the<00:00:53.809> best<00:00:54.079> thing<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.589> do<00:00:54.739> is<00:00:55.129> give<00:00:55.399> your<00:00:55.550> baby

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
the best thing to do is give your baby

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.099 
the best thing to do is give your baby
egg<00:00:56.539> yolk<00:00:57.229> and<00:00:57.589> not<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:59.120> egg<00:00:59.329> white<00:00:59.629> because

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
egg yolk and not the egg white because

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.469 
egg yolk and not the egg white because
the<00:01:00.350> egg<00:01:00.499> white<00:01:00.769> is<00:01:01.100> has<00:01:01.639> proteins<00:01:02.149> in<00:01:02.329> them

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
the egg white is has proteins in them

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.990 
the egg white is has proteins in them
that<00:01:02.659> are<00:01:02.719> highly<00:01:03.139> allergenic<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.820> egg

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
that are highly allergenic and the egg

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.180 
that are highly allergenic and the egg
yolk<00:01:05.330> is<00:01:05.630> got<00:01:06.020> all<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.229> nutritious<00:01:06.740> stuff<00:01:06.950> and

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
yolk is got all the nutritious stuff and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.490 
yolk is got all the nutritious stuff and
it's<00:01:07.610> easily<00:01:08.120> digestible<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:09.170> mean<00:01:09.350> it's

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's easily digestible I mean it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.149 
it's easily digestible I mean it's
almost<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.190> most<00:01:10.430> perfect<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.890> most

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
almost the most perfect the most

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.580 
almost the most perfect the most
perfectly<00:01:13.640> easily<00:01:14.170> digestible<00:01:15.170> food<00:01:15.350> there

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
perfectly easily digestible food there

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.380 
perfectly easily digestible food there
is<00:01:15.740> on<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.040> planet<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.090> what<00:01:17.300> you're

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
is on the planet and so what you're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.880 
is on the planet and so what you're
going<00:01:17.480> to<00:01:17.540> do<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.810> you're<00:01:17.900> going<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.050> soft<00:01:18.440> boil

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
going to do is you're going to soft boil

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.620 
going to do is you're going to soft boil
an<00:01:19.130> egg<00:01:19.160> for<00:01:19.760> three<00:01:20.180> minutes

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
an egg for three minutes

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.080 
an egg for three minutes
and<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.440> a<00:01:21.740> hard-boiled<00:01:22.130> egg<00:01:22.490> would<00:01:22.730> be<00:01:22.850> about

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
and so a hard-boiled egg would be about

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.850 
and so a hard-boiled egg would be about
ten<00:01:23.420> minutes<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.080> what<00:01:24.290> you're<00:01:24.500> looking

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
ten minutes and so what you're looking

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.430 
ten minutes and so what you're looking
for<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.220> about<00:01:25.340> three<00:01:25.850> minutes<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.450> then<00:01:27.170> once

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
for is about three minutes and then once

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.790 
for is about three minutes and then once
you<00:01:27.560> pull<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.920> out<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> your<00:01:29.380> top<00:01:30.380> you're<00:01:30.680> just

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
you pull it out of your top you're just

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.670 
you pull it out of your top you're just
going<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.010> run<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.630> water<00:01:32.930> over<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.530> so

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
going to run it the water over it so

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.980 
going to run it the water over it so
that<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:34.010> can

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
that you can

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.960 
that you can
touch<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.220> it's<00:01:36.430> cool<00:01:36.640> enough<00:01:36.940> to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
touch it so that it's cool enough to

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.900 
touch it so that it's cool enough to
touch<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.380> then<00:01:38.830> at<00:01:38.950> this<00:01:39.100> point<00:01:39.370> you're<00:01:39.730> just

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
touch and then at this point you're just

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.430 
touch and then at this point you're just
going<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.090> crack<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.540> open<00:01:40.690> just<00:01:41.140> like<00:01:41.290> you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
going to crack it open just like you

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.190 
going to crack it open just like you
would<00:01:41.680> if<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.580> were<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.120> know<00:01:43.240> cracking<00:01:43.960> it

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
would if you were you know cracking it

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.620 
would if you were you know cracking it
open<00:01:44.290> if<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.710> were<00:01:44.800> raw<00:01:45.040> but<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.940> white<00:01:46.240> part

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
open if it were raw but the white part

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.410 
open if it were raw but the white part
is<00:01:46.870> now<00:01:47.200> solid<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.580> yolk<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:50.050> liquid<00:01:50.680> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
is now solid and the yolk is liquid so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.760 
is now solid and the yolk is liquid so
once<00:01:52.420> you've<00:01:52.630> cracked<00:01:52.900> open<00:01:53.200> your<00:01:53.590> egg

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
once you've cracked open your egg

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.010 
once you've cracked open your egg
sometimes<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.790> cook<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.210> it's<00:01:55.540> got<00:01:55.780> like

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
sometimes you cook it and it's got like

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.590 
sometimes you cook it and it's got like
the<00:01:56.170> membranes<00:01:56.710> are<00:01:57.010> just<00:01:57.729> cooked<00:01:58.180> enough<00:01:58.420> and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
the membranes are just cooked enough and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.480 
the membranes are just cooked enough and
