some big-name guys and some lesser named

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.750 
some big-name guys and some lesser named
guys<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.369> much<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:23.670> some

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
guys and I really like as much as some

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.040 
guys and I really like as much as some
of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> big-name<00:00:24.240> guys<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:24.660> taking<00:00:24.930> anything

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
of the big-name guys not taking anything

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
of the big-name guys not taking anything
away<00:00:25.170> from<00:00:25.289> them<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
away from them I just think it's a and

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.970 
away from them I just think it's a and
it's<00:00:27.300> complete<00:00:27.660> across<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> board<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.890> know

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
it's complete across the board you know

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.070 
it's complete across the board you know
i'm<00:00:29.070> saying<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.760> standpoint<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
i'm saying so from that standpoint I I

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.139 
i'm saying so from that standpoint I I
really<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.489> would<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.820> would<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
really do that would that would be a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.060 
really do that would that would be a
good<00:00:33.300> good<00:00:33.600> analogy<00:00:33.960> hopefully<00:00:34.230> it'll<00:00:34.920> pan

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
good good analogy hopefully it'll pan

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
good good analogy hopefully it'll pan
out<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.579> successful<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> group

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
out to be as successful as that group

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.910 
out to be as successful as that group
that's<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:36.960> sure<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that's for sure I think that is one of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.670 
that's for sure I think that is one of
the<00:00:37.980> most<00:00:38.570> untaught<00:00:39.570> about<00:00:39.899> things<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.500> talk

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the most untaught about things we talk

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.920 
the most untaught about things we talk
about<00:00:40.710> talent<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.430> size<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.879> speed<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
about talent and size and speed but the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
about talent and size and speed but the
chemistry<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> cohesiveness<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.789> people

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
chemistry and the cohesiveness of people

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
chemistry and the cohesiveness of people
dead<00:00:45.570> were<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:46.020> along<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.500> able<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> do

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
dead were to get along and be able to do

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
dead were to get along and be able to do
as<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.000> say<00:00:48.149> work<00:00:48.390> together<00:00:48.570> play<00:00:48.989> together<00:00:49.050> all

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
as I say work together play together all

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.660 
as I say work together play together all
those<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> things<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
those kind of things I think it's that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.310 
those kind of things I think it's that
is<00:00:51.030> extremely<00:00:51.449> critical<00:00:51.690> something<00:00:52.170> we

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is extremely critical something we

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.930 
is extremely critical something we
always<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> work<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.129> develop<00:00:53.340> these

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
always have to work and develop these

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.040 
always have to work and develop these
guys<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.510> playing<00:00:54.719> time<00:00:54.809> now

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
guys will get a lot of playing time now

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.119 
guys will get a lot of playing time now
I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.260> that's<00:00:55.410> why<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.680> critical<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.039> we

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I think that's why it's critical that we

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.099 
I think that's why it's critical that we
get<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> junior<00:00:56.760> college<00:00:56.789> guys<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.360 
get to junior college guys you have you
got<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> top<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> number<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.160> guard

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
got to top you get the number one guard

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.220 
got to top you get the number one guard
number<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.760> tackle<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.329> junior<00:01:00.989> college

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
number one tackle and junior college

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
number one tackle and junior college
football<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
football that also so when they have to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.549 
football that also so when they have to
fill<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:03.719> guys<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.110> been<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.260> games

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

of those spots also i think getting

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.980 
of those spots also i think getting
those<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:08.850> guys<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.420> critical<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.900> this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
those two guys is very critical in this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.240 
those two guys is very critical in this
group<00:01:10.200> plus<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> group<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.100> here

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
group plus the group that we have here

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
group plus the group that we have here
we<00:01:11.580> still<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.540> good<00:01:12.750> players

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
we still have some really good players

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
we still have some really good players
here<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.350> i<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.590> Wilson<00:01:14.130> Bell<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.580> those

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
know from that standpoint but then I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.209 
know from that standpoint but then I
think<00:01:56.000> with<00:01:57.200> Bobo<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> Kermit<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> think

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
think with Bobo and Kermit now I think

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.469 
think with Bobo and Kermit now I think
you<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.430> some<00:01:59.610> guys<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> makes<00:02:00.299> their

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you got some guys and that makes their

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
you got some guys and that makes their
with<00:02:00.630> Isaiah<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.530> good<00:02:01.680> players

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.630 
but if these guys come in already which

definitely<00:02:05.880> there<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.509> learn<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
definitely there they can learn the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.749 
definitely there they can learn the
system<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.290> play<00:02:07.439> there's<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.190> chance<00:02:08.429> very

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
system and play there's a chance very

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.800 
system and play there's a chance very
early<00:02:09.000> they<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.300> make<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> great<00:02:09.629> contribution

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
early they can make a great contribution

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
early they can make a great contribution
oh<00:02:10.319> no<00:02:10.619> doubt<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:11.039> who<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> guy<00:02:11.430> is
