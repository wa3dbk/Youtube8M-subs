00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.910
 be well 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.040
 today we find ourselves in a 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.110
 video tips tips about 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.719
 styles on how to have eyelashes so 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.700
 and bathrobes provided is lying without 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.460
 mascara nor fossils summer is there the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 beach sun sun sand 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.189
 that's all this is news 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.020
 this moment and it's true that it's enough 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.130
 delicate make-up for me the m 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.820
 waterproof it's not at all 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.730
 thing I like 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.230
 here I do not know I hang on after 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.609
 to bathe I always at the lake 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.949
 crumbs like that that have fallen 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.120
 on the days be the six who are all 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.350
 stuck together because when we go out 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.870
 the head of the water we wipe our eyes 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
 to remove those where the chlorine I 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.660
 find that styles stick together between 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.610
 them with the heat the waterproof remains 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.110
 pretty peggle what I find that 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.969
 personally the waterproof is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.649
 still very hard to remove it takes 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.570
 really put some fat things like 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.730
 that's good, it's not at all my thing 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 so after seven years of living in the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 antilles and so you have so many beaches and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.480
 cetera I found a little parade that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.550
 replaces the waterproof and which in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.359
 same time so stuffs and lengthens bossi 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 the considerably 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.239
 it's simply the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 coloring for eyelashes and eyebrows 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.080
 you can do both with me 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.799
 it's something that I do 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 approximately once every two 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.140
 month 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 because with that with this process 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 quiet 6 to 8 weeks easily 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.390
 you will understand that it is a trick 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.860
 more more for blondes or who have 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.450
 targets we see there to have them 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.369
 well black and have a good look 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.930
 defined open for brunettes also 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.310
 it's a good tip because with 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.540
 summer and not that with them was 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.040
 Besides, I think we tend to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.479
 see the ends of the eyelashes like that they 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.770
 blonden who clear a little 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.450
 little they tend to appear 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.950
 slightly shorter and of course I 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.900
 you shot a demonstration that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.770
 comes after this little 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.119
 introduction 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.960
 I hope you enjoy this video 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.090
 leave you right away with the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.450
 magneto marcel explanations you go 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.990
 need a series to protect 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.090
 Vaseline your work plan 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 large cotton of small cotton cotton 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.750
 scissors water rod the coloring and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.659
 a small brush start with 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.380
 precut your cotton in half moon 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.380
 no 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.300
 once it's done take your 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.620
 staining tube and poured about two 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.500
 centimeters of coloring in the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.160
 small scoop added j 3 drops of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.160
 hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.780
 we mixed everything vigorously so 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.780
 to obtain a creamy paste 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.870
 we are now moving to the protection of 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.189
 eyes so let you other ribs 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 have tricked apply a small price of 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.680
 base one above underneath avoiding 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.349
 to touch the su apply now 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.760
 your half moon cotton under your eye in 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.129
 leaving out many eyelashes 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.870
 on it now to degrease your lashes to 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.639
 using a cotton swab and water 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.409
 hot to really remove all the 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.739
 fat or make-up residues that 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.739
 can stay 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.340
 now place to the application 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.230
 take your brush and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.609
 start with the bottom eyelash 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.840
 especially not to overflow a little bit his 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.389
 cotton anyway it is there for 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.590
 protect so it's not really 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.849
 really a problem was fine 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.290
 to the inside corner to catch 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.730
 returns every 6.6 therein 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.739
 same for the top so pin the eye 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.909
 and start by applying over 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.169
 the styles at first in 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.849
 going back to the root 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:28.979
 always catching small signs 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.419
 from inside the eye and then with 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.699
 your brush 7 as if you apply 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.329
 mascara in order to get well coated is it worth 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.329
 staining 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.790
 you can now remove the small 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.470
 half moon cotton and perfect your 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.720
 work by just applying the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.040
 coloring on the tip of your eyelashes 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.040
 it's very important for finishing 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:04.450
 it's time to leave for 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:05.950
 five minutes were now going on 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.630
 remove all this so reindeer quite simple 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.980
 sure I see you your big cotton 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.120
 and rub your lashes to 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.230
 to remove all russian goal from kolo 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.230
 simply receives 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.549
 And this is the final result 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.760
 you can leave quietly at the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.760
 cage 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.110
 like me but I still find that 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.820
 the difference is quite obvious 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.889
 here I purposely left 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.650
 the without coloring is thus the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.900
 here that discoloration of the coloring 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.190
 there is no mascara and nothing else and that 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.889
 it still lasts six to eight weeks 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.449
 so that's really great the only one 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.009
 thing you have to do before you 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.360
 go out of your place at the very least 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.830
 it's just if you feel like it 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.150
 heard it's just to find your 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.190
 eyelashes to set them up and who 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.870
 otherwise remains relatively bent apart 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.010
 there's really no maintenance to anything 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.360
 do it once it's done 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.919
 really you are quiet during 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.820
 easily a good month and a half I 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.530
 would like of course anbar 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.620
 of information the link to find this 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.090
 coloring there so for me it's my 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.520
 favorite combines it here I am 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.380
 tested many others and for me that 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.139
 remains the best that lasts the most 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.280
 a long time that remains intense of the month 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.199
 because the others that I could try 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.330
 especially its thinning as and when 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.250
 Ben measure here is a cleansing and 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.750
 cetera this one is really very black 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.919
 and very intense if you have any 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.150
 questions I would of course make a 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.070
 pleasure to answer them 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.660
