starts out with hammer-ons and pull-offs

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.390 
starts out with hammer-ons and pull-offs
power<00:00:16.330> cords<00:00:16.960> and<00:00:17.619> a<00:00:17.680> little<00:00:17.920> bit<00:00:18.039> of<00:00:18.070> moving

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.090 
power cords and a little bit of moving
around<00:00:18.670> let's<00:00:19.119> do<00:00:19.300> the<00:00:19.420> basic<00:00:19.900> beginning<00:00:20.830> part

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
around let's do the basic beginning part

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:39.750 
around let's do the basic beginning part
first<00:00:37.560> okay<00:00:38.560> as<00:00:38.739> you<00:00:38.860> can<00:00:38.920> see<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.400> involves

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
first okay as you can see it involves

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.450 
first okay as you can see it involves
hammer-ons<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.239> pull-offs<00:00:40.329> with<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:42.190> 3rd

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
hammer-ons and pull-offs with the 3rd

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.850 
hammer-ons and pull-offs with the 3rd
fret<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.810> D<00:00:43.870> string<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:44.800> you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
fret of the a and the D string so you

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.180 
fret of the a and the D string so you
pluck<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.640> string<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:47.230> hammer<00:00:47.530> on<00:00:47.739> I<00:00:47.920> use

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
pluck the a string you hammer on I use

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.480 
pluck the a string you hammer on I use
my<00:00:48.340> middle<00:00:48.489> finger

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
my middle finger

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.920 
my middle finger
pluck<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.610> open<00:00:51.850> D

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
pluck the open D

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.020 
pluck the open D
and<00:00:54.800> when<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:54.980> hammer<00:00:55.160> on<00:00:55.400> to<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.700> 3rd<00:00:55.910> fret

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
and when you hammer on to the 3rd fret

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.050 
and when you hammer on to the 3rd fret
of<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.180> D<00:00:56.240> you<00:00:56.390> pull<00:00:56.780> off<00:00:56.810> and<00:00:57.730> then<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:58.850> play

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
of the D you pull off and then you play

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:08.010 
of the D you pull off and then you play
the<00:00:59.300> 3rd<00:00:59.900> fret<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:01.300> open<00:01:02.300> D<00:01:02.739> so<00:01:03.739> slowly

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.570 

you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.670 

and<00:01:13.120> then<00:01:13.360> you<00:01:13.600> do<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.720> Power<00:01:13.960> Core<00:01:14.230> 2d<00:01:14.500> power

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
and then you do a Power Core 2d power

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.800 
and then you do a Power Core 2d power
cord<00:01:14.980> which<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.340> 5th<00:01:15.550> fret

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
cord which is the 5th fret

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.069 
cord which is the 5th fret
let's<00:01:17.470> see<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.890> it's<00:01:21.040> just<00:01:21.189> a<00:01:21.250> descending<00:01:21.700> line

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
let's see so it's just a descending line

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:28.200 
let's see so it's just a descending line
d<00:01:23.079> c<00:01:23.649> b<00:01:23.680> flat<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.860> then<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.039> play<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.250> G<00:01:27.579> after

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
d c b flat and then you play a G after

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.080 
d c b flat and then you play a G after
you<00:01:28.329> re<00:01:28.539> articulate<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.320> B<00:01:29.439> flat<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.920> then<00:01:30.700> C

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
you re articulate the B flat and then C

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.810 
you re articulate the B flat and then C
power-chord<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:32.229> then<00:01:33.100> fifth<00:01:33.520> fret<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.729> the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
power-chord and then fifth fret of the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.149 
power-chord and then fifth fret of the
low<00:01:33.909> E<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.509> then<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.500> d<00:01:35.619> power<00:01:35.890> cord<00:01:36.070> again

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
low E and then that d power cord again

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:46.380 
low E and then that d power cord again
so<00:01:36.939> slowly<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.390> section<00:01:37.929> I<00:01:45.179> was<00:01:46.179> a<00:01:46.210> little

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
so slowly that section I was a little

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.999 
so slowly that section I was a little
square<00:01:46.810> feeling<00:01:47.259> rhythmically<00:01:47.590> but<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:47.920> get

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
square feeling rhythmically but you get

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:59.399 
square feeling rhythmically but you get
the<00:01:48.070> idea<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.709> next<00:01:56.740> part<00:01:57.009> of<00:01:57.280> it
