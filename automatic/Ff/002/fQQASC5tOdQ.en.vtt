00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.359
 yourself inspiration I give you today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.150
 a few tips to work with you 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.670
 duct tape make these five easier 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.219
 Though tips make the work easier 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 I understand that too with me it is 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.890
 quite often that I something 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.480
 glued or yes that one again 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.160
 must cut off pieces and new 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.400
 I think I have to take that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.500
 so my first tip is that if everyone 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 you used a pair of scissors that one 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.239
 very clean scissors and sharp 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.829
 So it's not a storm for scissors because 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.030
 this will cut off the tape very much 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.920
 playful on is so sticky or 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.940
 dull then that works a lot 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 worse with a sharp pair of scissors 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 you can cautiously so a strip 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.940
 cut off when the scissors blunt that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 I had already or if that already 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 the glue remains on the scissors 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.989
 It's all stuck here and you make it 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.340
 not a bit of the tape 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.530
 to cut it off at all 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.270
 my next tip is that you are very good 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.900
 so a cutter knife can use 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.780
 I'll put something under it for that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.030
 this strip and so on the on the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.500
 Document a ruler exactly 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.500
 the place where I want to cut long 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:38.469
 to and cuts here with the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.840
 cutter knife a along the land again 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.350
 pull off so carefully and I have 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.020
 a nice strip even if you 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.640
 now several things stuck together 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.649
 several stripes like me 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.750
 I've done that with the bags 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.110
 I also put the whole thing there 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.390
 with the ruler as well just knew 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.610
 cut how much catalysis 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.009
 cut along and that works 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.159
 really much better than the scissors 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.160
 I think that's a very important tip 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.450
 that you keep calm and the whole 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.970
 Carefully peel off 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.980
 I have the same thing once 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.890
 quickly pulled off and got here 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.540
 already playful and zack facto so one 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.480
 It must always be careful 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.560
 and with a lot of rest so my fourth 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.610
 place as a lassmann and also here in front 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.610
 that can bend over 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.650
 so that one can put the beginning then finds 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.930
 you have to piece here following 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.959
 cut off but it saves you 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.420
 this is the reason from the beginning that is yes 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.670
 sometimes at tesa film or at 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.439
 is other tapes and totally annoying 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.849
 That's why you can be difficult there 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.810
 just either a small corner 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.150
 or you can do the same as well 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.620
 click once 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.760
 that gave me such a small edge and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.849
 always finds the beginning quickly and so 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.859
 seriously for today the fifth tip 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 is that the whole thing if you like that 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:12.829
 make bigger project with duct tape 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.319
 you want that on a big scale 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.079
 Table does as few things as possible 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.470
 because if you do that on a small scale 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.000
 This is a table that lives and lives somewhere 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.159
 the whole thing is too close together then 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.370
 sticks the fast one big one 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.620
 I have to table and you have to cut eg 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.870
 cut off five strips you put one 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.400
 stripes on one side as you leave 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.239
 put a whole piece of space 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.109
 others and then glue the then 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.549
 not too fast 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.930
 I've had that too sometimes 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.489
 problem I then somehow the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.079
 had finished stripe and then I am 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.010
 Made with another strip 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.169
 come to it 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.970
 sometimes you can do that if you want 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.799
 very carefully is apart again 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.900
 tear 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.590
 but if you time a large table 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.879
 used and the whole neat 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.940
 beautiful forest then falls apart 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.379
 you can spare yourself this trouble 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.919
 yes I hope that I can help you with these 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.930
 could help a bit already 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:11.180
 if you still have other tips I 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.909
 not named then then 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.319
 Write it in the comments 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.180
 we can help each other and 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.190
 Give each other tips how to 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.609
 bypass this difficult tape 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.310
 can 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.860
 I always like the result 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.280
 but it's really hard to handle 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.340
 I think so who has tips still likes 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.199
 in the comments 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.820
 if you like the video if you like 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.669
 one or two tips like it

 click on the thumbs up and 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.729
 also look our other videos looks 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.130
 which I have so much with duct tape 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.630
 if you have our channel still 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.340
