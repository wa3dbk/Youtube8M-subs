episodes<00:00:37.430> from<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.730> past<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.750> you'll<00:00:39.079> find

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
some hopefully good information there

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.540 
some hopefully good information there
about<00:00:41.600> why<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.019> record<00:00:42.710> audio<00:00:42.829> separately<00:00:43.460> the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
about why I record audio separately the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.399 
about why I record audio separately the
main<00:00:43.670> idea<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:44.239> that<00:00:44.600> I<00:00:44.839> think<00:00:45.050> I<00:00:45.140> can<00:00:45.199> get

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
main idea is that I think I can get

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.619 
main idea is that I think I can get
better<00:00:45.530> audio<00:00:45.769> typically<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:46.730> way<00:00:46.879> it's<00:00:47.329> not

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
better audio typically that way it's not

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.380 
better audio typically that way it's not
for<00:00:47.839> every<00:00:48.019> circumstance<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.159> I<00:00:49.519> don't<00:00:50.269> want

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
for every circumstance so I don't want

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.500 
for every circumstance so I don't want
to<00:00:50.420> come<00:00:50.600> across<00:00:50.629> as<00:00:51.910> conveying<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.269> that

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
to come across as conveying that that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.540 
to come across as conveying that that
this<00:00:53.629> is<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.899> only<00:00:54.050> way<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.440> do<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.769> but

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
this is the only way to do it but

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.250 
this is the only way to do it but
whenever<00:00:55.730> I<00:00:55.910> can<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.660> whenever<00:00:57.050> it's

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
whenever I can and whenever it's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.599 
whenever I can and whenever it's
feasible<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:57.890> like<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.190> record<00:00:58.429> my<00:00:58.579> audio

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
feasible I like to record my audio

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.520 
feasible I like to record my audio
separately<00:00:59.149> now<00:00:59.840> one<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.320> biggest

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
separately now one of the biggest

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.990 
separately now one of the biggest
objections<00:01:01.219> or<00:01:01.429> one<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.820> biggest

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
objections or one of the biggest

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.029 
objections or one of the biggest
concerns<00:01:02.510> people<00:01:02.780> express<00:01:03.350> when<00:01:03.649> they<00:01:03.829> hear

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
concerns people express when they hear

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.240 
concerns people express when they hear
about<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.550> whole<00:01:05.390> concept<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:06.530> don't<00:01:07.130> want

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
about that whole concept is I don't want

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.950 
about that whole concept is I don't want
to<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:07.429> to<00:01:07.520> sync<00:01:07.759> it<00:01:07.850> in<00:01:07.970> post<00:01:08.179> it<00:01:08.509> takes<00:01:08.720> so

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
to have to sync it in post it takes so

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.469 
to have to sync it in post it takes so
much<00:01:09.110> time<00:01:09.410> and<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:10.610> think<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.119> used<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.390> be

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
much time and I think that used to be

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.999 
much time and I think that used to be
the<00:01:11.600> case<00:01:11.780> definitely<00:01:12.170> in<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.410> past<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:12.860> it's

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
the case definitely in the past but it's

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.340 
the case definitely in the past but it's
gotten<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.490> lot<00:01:13.880> easier<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:14.630> here's<00:01:15.200> an

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
gotten a lot easier now here's an

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.590 
gotten a lot easier now here's an
example<00:01:15.590> from<00:01:15.890> Premiere<00:01:16.280> Pro<00:01:16.310> CC<00:01:16.600> it's

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
example from Premiere Pro CC it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.590 
example from Premiere Pro CC it's
December<00:01:18.140> 2013<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:18.979> whatever<00:01:19.369> version<00:01:19.789> that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
December 2013 so whatever version that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.050 
December 2013 so whatever version that
is<00:01:20.869> let's<00:01:21.560> see<00:01:21.710> here<00:01:22.070> that's<00:01:23.030> seven<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.539> one<00:01:23.840> so

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
is let's see here that's seven to one so

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.400 
is let's see here that's seven to one so
this<00:01:26.060> will<00:01:26.300> probably<00:01:26.569> just<00:01:26.869> get<00:01:26.989> easier<00:01:27.080> as

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
this will probably just get easier as

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.139 
this will probably just get easier as
time<00:01:27.470> goes<00:01:27.860> on<00:01:28.039> but<00:01:28.220> I'm<00:01:28.489> that's<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> version

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
time goes on but I'm that's the version

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.600 
time goes on but I'm that's the version
I'm<00:01:29.360> using<00:01:29.569> just<00:01:29.690> for<00:01:30.020> reference<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.560> have<00:01:31.039> here

I'm using just for reference I have here

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.490 
I'm using just for reference I have here
an<00:01:31.789> audio<00:01:32.090> clip<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.750> video<00:01:32.959> clip<00:01:33.200> these<00:01:33.319> are

an audio clip and a video clip these are
both<00:01:33.649> recorded<00:01:34.099> at<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.220> same<00:01:34.489> time<00:01:34.789> just<00:01:35.030> on

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
both recorded at the same time just on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.510 
both recorded at the same time just on
an<00:01:35.450> audio<00:01:35.690> recorder<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.319> this<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.130> my<00:01:37.250> camera

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
an audio recorder and this on my camera

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.609 
an audio recorder and this on my camera
now<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.179> camera<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.599> also<00:01:38.780> recorded<00:01:39.319> audio

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
now in the camera I also recorded audio

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.680 
now in the camera I also recorded audio
I<00:01:39.770> needed<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.130> use<00:01:40.250> that<00:01:40.489> and<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.149> purpose<00:01:41.479> of

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
I needed to use that and the purpose of

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.600 
I needed to use that and the purpose of
that<00:01:41.720> was<00:01:41.869> use<00:01:42.319> the<00:01:42.530> audio<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.130> captured

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
that was use the audio that it captured

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.120 
that was use the audio that it captured
as<00:01:43.819> reference<00:01:44.479> audio<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.709> just<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.099> a

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
as reference audio and that is just as a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.119 
as reference audio and that is just as a
kind<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:46.849> placeholder<00:01:47.110> that<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:48.470> could<00:01:48.890> use

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:49.129 
kind of a placeholder that I could use

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:51.190 
kind of a placeholder that I could use
here<00:01:49.429> in<00:01:49.520> Premiere<00:01:49.879> to<00:01:50.119> sync<00:01:50.450> up<00:01:50.599> the<00:01:50.660> actual

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
here in Premiere to sync up the actual

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.229 
here in Premiere to sync up the actual
audio<00:01:51.530> production<00:01:52.220> audio<00:01:52.459> I<00:01:52.520> wanted<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.030> use

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.239 
audio production audio I wanted to use

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.169 
audio production audio I wanted to use
from<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.289> field<00:01:54.500> recorder<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.190> another<00:01:55.970> note

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
from the field recorder so another note

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.210 
from the field recorder so another note
here<00:01:56.209> is<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:56.750> you'll<00:01:57.259> notice<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.709> recorded

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
here is that you'll notice I recorded

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.460 
here is that you'll notice I recorded
from<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.520> field<00:01:58.729> recorder<00:01:59.179> at<00:01:59.360> 48<00:01:59.989> Hertz<00:02:00.289> or

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
from the field recorder at 48 Hertz or

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.430 
from the field recorder at 48 Hertz or
48<00:02:00.860> kilohertz<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.899> reason<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.229> did<00:02:03.410> that

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
48 kilohertz and the reason I did that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.380 
48 kilohertz and the reason I did that
is<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.800> my<00:02:04.069> particular<00:02:04.340> camera<00:02:04.910> records

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
is that my particular camera records

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.029 
is that my particular camera records
audio<00:02:05.539> at<00:02:05.840> 48<00:02:06.200> kilohertz<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.830> want<00:02:06.979> to

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
audio at 48 kilohertz and you want to

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.830 
audio at 48 kilohertz and you want to
make<00:02:07.160> sure<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.640> line<00:02:07.879> those<00:02:08.149> up<00:02:08.179> it's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
make sure you you line those up it's

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.570 
make sure you you line those up it's
called<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.110> sampling<00:02:09.560> rate<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.340> reason

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
called a sampling rate and the reason

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.740 
called a sampling rate and the reason
you<00:02:10.670> want<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.849> do<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.390> will<00:02:11.510> prevent

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
you want to do that is it will prevent

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.410 
you want to do that is it will prevent
drift<00:02:12.200> over<00:02:12.890> time<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.180> longer

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
drift over time so if you have a longer

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.660 
drift over time so if you have a longer
clip<00:02:14.890> sometimes<00:02:15.890> there's<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.160> tendency<00:02:16.430> for

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
clip sometimes there's a tendency for

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.430 
clip sometimes there's a tendency for
some<00:02:16.879> devices<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.629> get<00:02:18.050> out<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.260> sync

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
some devices to get out of sync

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.780 
some devices to get out of sync
especially<00:02:18.980> if<00:02:19.099> you're<00:02:19.220> recording<00:02:19.489> at<00:02:19.730> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
especially if you're recording at a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.119 
especially if you're recording at a
different<00:02:20.150> sampling<00:02:20.569> rate<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.620> want<00:02:22.069> to

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
different sampling rate so you want to

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.350 
different sampling rate so you want to
try<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.370> keep<00:02:22.459> those<00:02:22.610> sampling<00:02:23.060> rates<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
try and keep those sampling rates the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.770 
try and keep those sampling rates the
same<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.970> check<00:02:26.120> on<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.420> manual<00:02:26.690> for

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
same now just check on the manual for

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.970 
same now just check on the manual for
your<00:02:26.840> camera<00:02:27.200> if<00:02:27.290> you're<00:02:27.410> not<00:02:27.530> sure<00:02:27.739> what<00:02:27.860> your

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
your camera if you're not sure what your

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.040 
your camera if you're not sure what your
camera<00:02:28.250> shoots<00:02:28.520> most<00:02:28.820> cameras<00:02:29.210> will<00:02:29.360> shoot<00:02:29.600> 48

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
camera shoots most cameras will shoot 48

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.720 
camera shoots most cameras will shoot 48
kilohertz<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.830> that's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
kilohertz so that's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.550 
kilohertz so that's
be<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.940> norm<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.480> right<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.080> if<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.319> want<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
be the norm all right so if I want to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.559 
be the norm all right so if I want to
sync<00:02:33.769> these<00:02:33.920> up<00:02:34.129> all<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.370> need<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.909> oh<00:02:35.000> another

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
sync these up all I need to oh another

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.780 
sync these up all I need to oh another
note<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.080> we've<00:02:37.069> talked<00:02:37.310> about<00:02:37.459> this<00:02:37.640> before

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
note and we've talked about this before

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.759 
note and we've talked about this before
as<00:02:38.120> well<00:02:38.269> at<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.780> start<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.110> each<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.349> my<00:02:39.440> clips

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
as well at the start of each of my clips

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.710 
as well at the start of each of my clips
once<00:02:40.129> I<00:02:40.280> have<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.459> camera<00:02:40.849> rolling<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
once I have a camera rolling and the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.610 
once I have a camera rolling and the
audio<00:02:42.080> rolling<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.739> will<00:02:43.610> do<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.819> clap<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.659> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
audio rolling I will do a clap and the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.350 
audio rolling I will do a clap and the
purpose<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.040> clap<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.970> makes<00:02:47.209> it

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
purpose of that clap is it makes it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.580 
purpose of that clap is it makes it
super<00:02:47.810> easy<00:02:47.840> for<00:02:49.090> premiere<00:02:50.090> or<00:02:50.269> me<00:02:51.080> if<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.500> have

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
super easy for premiere or me if I have

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.530 
super easy for premiere or me if I have
to<00:02:51.709> do<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.920> manually<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.640> sync<00:02:53.030> up<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.180> audio

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
to do it manually to sync up the audio

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.020 
to do it manually to sync up the audio
and<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.680> video<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.190> in<00:02:55.489> fact<00:02:55.700> that's<00:02:55.849> why

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
and the video and in fact that's why

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.369 
and the video and in fact that's why
there<00:02:56.299> are<00:02:56.330> clapper<00:02:56.870> boards<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.290> they've

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
there are clapper boards and they've

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.440 
there are clapper boards and they've
been<00:02:57.500> used<00:02:57.680> for<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.040> many<00:02:58.099> years<00:02:58.459> in<00:02:58.700> film

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
been used for so many years in film

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.440 
been used for so many years in film
production<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:00.769> nowadays<00:03:01.579> we<00:03:01.819> just<00:03:02.269> put<00:03:02.420> that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
production so nowadays we just put that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.880 
production so nowadays we just put that
in<00:03:02.659> there<00:03:02.810> for<00:03:02.840> safety<00:03:03.379> and<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.560> makes<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.829> a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
in there for safety and it makes it a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.259 
in there for safety and it makes it a
little<00:03:04.069> bit<00:03:04.220> easier<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.549> think<00:03:04.610> for<00:03:04.819> premiere

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
little bit easier I think for premiere

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.180 
little bit easier I think for premiere
to<00:03:05.420> line<00:03:05.599> them<00:03:05.750> up<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:05.900> all<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.769> do<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.160> I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
to line them up so all I do is I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.160 
to line them up so all I do is I
highlight<00:03:07.610> my<00:03:07.640> two<00:03:07.790> clips<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.390> right-click<00:03:08.660> I

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
highlight my two clips I right-click I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.920 
highlight my two clips I right-click I
choose<00:03:09.650> merge<00:03:09.980> clips<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:11.239> brings<00:03:11.660> up<00:03:11.810> this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
choose merge clips that brings up this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.110

you're going to shoot 800 clips in a in
a<00:05:02.730> gig<00:05:03.050> yeah<00:05:04.050> maybe<00:05:04.290> it's<00:05:04.500> going<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.680> be<00:05:04.740> a

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
a gig yeah maybe it's going to be a

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.050 
a gig yeah maybe it's going to be a
problem<00:05:05.160> then<00:05:05.340> if<00:05:05.610> you're<00:05:05.760> going<00:05:05.850> to<00:05:05.970> be

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
problem then if you're going to be

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
problem then if you're going to be
shooting<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.390> many<00:05:06.630> Clips<00:05:06.960> then<00:05:07.170> probably

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
shooting that many Clips then probably

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.940 
shooting that many Clips then probably
recording<00:05:10.080> into<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.380> camera<00:05:10.650> may<00:05:10.770> be<00:05:10.830> a

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
recording into the camera may be a

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.130 
recording into the camera may be a
better<00:05:11.160> choice<00:05:11.400> but<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.030> my<00:05:12.510> case<00:05:12.720> here<00:05:12.960> when

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
better choice but in my case here when

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.720 
better choice but in my case here when
