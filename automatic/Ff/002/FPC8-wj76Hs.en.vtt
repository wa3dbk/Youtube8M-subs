noise cancelling boom the only thing

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.240

that<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.560> people<00:01:34.740> don't<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that some people don't like about the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.850 
that some people don't like about the
snooze<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> width<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> neck<00:01:36.860> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
snooze is the width of the neck and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
snooze is the width of the neck and
actually<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> width<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> strings<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
actually the width of the strings the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.130 
actually the width of the strings the
neck<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> believe<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> same<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:42.140> 335

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
neck with I believe is the same as 335

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.859 
neck with I believe is the same as 335
but<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:45.270> nut<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.020> slotted<00:01:47.090> slightly<00:01:48.090> closer

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
but the nut is slotted slightly closer

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.030 
but the nut is slotted slightly closer
together<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.790> probably<00:01:51.390> what

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
together so I think that's probably what

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.310 
together so I think that's probably what
gives<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.820> everyone<00:01:54.630> thinks<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.960> it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
gives it it's everyone thinks that it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.980 
gives it it's everyone thinks that it's
a<00:01:55.439> very<00:01:55.619> easy<00:01:55.710> cool<00:01:56.189> guitar<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.729> cord<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.780> open

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
a very easy cool guitar to cord for open

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.469 
a very easy cool guitar to cord for open
chords<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.409> things<00:02:00.380> probably<00:02:01.380> because

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
chords and things probably because

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.560 
chords and things probably because
that's<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.810> slotting<00:02:04.560> me<00:02:05.149> if<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.299> bothered

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that's like slotting me if it bothered

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.819 
that's like slotting me if it bothered
you<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.719> think<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.079> could<00:02:07.229> probably<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
you I think you could probably have the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.760 
you I think you could probably have the
nut

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
nut

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.800 
nut
replaced<00:02:09.770> with<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> more<00:02:10.550> typical<00:02:10.729> open<00:02:11.420> slot

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
replaced with a more typical open slot

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.210 
replaced with a more typical open slot
that's<00:02:11.960> closer<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> edges<00:02:12.710> but<00:02:13.010> done

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
that's closer to the edges but done

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.240 
that's closer to the edges but done
anyway<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.020> bridge<00:02:18.290> obviously<00:02:19.040> not

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
anyway and then the bridge obviously not

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.570 
anyway and then the bridge obviously not
really<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.820> mellow<00:02:20.270> tone<00:02:20.600> not<00:02:21.380> as<00:02:21.470> mellow<00:02:21.680> but

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
really a mellow tone not as mellow but

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:31.270 
really a mellow tone not as mellow but
I'm<00:02:22.700> good<00:02:22.880> for<00:02:23.060> Freddie<00:02:23.630> King<00:02:30.160> that's<00:02:31.160> what

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
I'm good for Freddie King that's what

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.890 
I'm good for Freddie King that's what

these been these pickups were this
bridge<00:02:33.140> pickup<00:02:33.440> was<00:02:33.560> kind<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.800> supposed<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.370> be

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
bridge pickup was kind of supposed to be

bridge pickup was kind of supposed to be
the<00:02:34.670> early<00:02:34.940> Freddie<00:02:35.180> King<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.760> you're<00:02:37.880> not

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
gonna probably get out of a solid state

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.040
