00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
the shaft of where the handle was gonna

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.970 
the shaft of where the handle was gonna
be<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.959> was<00:02:15.049> actually<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.709> actually

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
be and that was actually a that actually

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.040 
be and that was actually a that actually
went<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.700> little<00:02:17.239> smoother<00:02:17.599> than<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.840> thought

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
went a little smoother than I thought

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.080 
went a little smoother than I thought
because<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:19.160> seemed<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.580> me<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.000> was

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
because I this seemed to me like it was

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.410 
because I this seemed to me like it was
going<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.300> be<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> very<00:02:20.629> intricate

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
going to be a very intricate

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.740 
going to be a very intricate
process<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.819> took<00:02:23.970> me<00:02:24.120> about<00:02:24.270> an<00:02:24.420> hour<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
process and it took me about an hour to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.380 
process and it took me about an hour to
kind<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.200> from<00:02:25.470> from<00:02:25.500> when<00:02:25.920> uh<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.400> started

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
kind of from from when uh I started

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.880 
kind of from from when uh I started
working<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> wood<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.319> attaching<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
working with the wood to attaching to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.400 
working with the wood to attaching to
the<00:02:28.980> handle<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.180> like<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.750> said<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.959> split<00:02:31.290> down

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the handle so like I said I split down

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.440 
the handle so like I said I split down
the<00:02:31.560> wood<00:02:31.739> put<00:02:32.130> put<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.400> two<00:02:32.670> sections<00:02:33.209> on

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the wood put put the two sections on

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.900 
the wood put put the two sections on
there<00:02:34.080> then<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.349> used<00:02:34.560> pine<00:02:34.860> pitch<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.459> heated

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
there then I used pine pitch a heated

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.390 
there then I used pine pitch a heated
pine<00:02:36.150> pitch<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:37.140> kind<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.440> glue<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
pine pitch to kind of glue that on and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
pine pitch to kind of glue that on and
then<00:02:38.850> once<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.120> had<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.360> glued<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.110> had<00:02:40.709> some

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
then once I had that glued on I had some

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.820 
then once I had that glued on I had some
goat<00:02:41.250> rawhide<00:02:41.760> from<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> leather<00:02:42.390> guy<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.989> I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
goat rawhide from the leather guy and I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.680 
goat rawhide from the leather guy and I
took<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.100> took<00:02:44.520> about<00:02:44.760> probably<00:02:45.180> I'm<00:02:45.300> gonna<00:02:45.420> say

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
took a took about probably I'm gonna say

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.190 
took a took about probably I'm gonna say
maybe<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.110> ten<00:02:46.290> foot<00:02:46.470> section<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.510> just<00:02:48.510> boiled

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
maybe a ten foot section and just boiled

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.650 
maybe a ten foot section and just boiled
that<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.709> salt<00:02:50.069> water<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.550> heated<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that in salt water and heated that up to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.750 
that in salt water and heated that up to
where<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.050> was<00:02:52.140> almost<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:53.160> say<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.640> was

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
where it was almost I would say it was

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.410 
where it was almost I would say it was
like<00:02:53.790> spaghetti<00:02:54.420> noodle<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:56.250> would<00:02:57.060> just

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
like spaghetti noodle and I would just

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.970 
like spaghetti noodle and I would just
kind<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.660> wrap<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.590> tied<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.890> on

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
kind of wrap that on and tied it on

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.059 
kind of wrap that on and tied it on
there<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.340> tightly<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.620> kind<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.680> said<00:03:01.920> it

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
there really tightly and kind of said it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.130 
there really tightly and kind of said it
kind<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.549> set<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.060> how<00:03:03.239> how<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.600> needed<00:03:03.989> it

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
kind of set it on how how I needed it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
kind of set it on how how I needed it
and<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.470> kind<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.650> gave<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:04.980> extra

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
and it kind of gave it that extra

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.880 
and it kind of gave it that extra
reinforcement<00:03:05.670> over<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:07.080> pine<00:03:07.319> pitch<00:03:07.620> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
reinforcement over that pine pitch and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.160 
reinforcement over that pine pitch and
then<00:03:08.069> once<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.400> did<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:09.000> set<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.959> dry

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
then once I did that I set it out to dry

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.309 
then once I did that I set it out to dry
for<00:03:10.200> about<00:03:10.709> probably<00:03:11.069> about<00:03:11.760> 24<00:03:12.239> hours<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
for about probably about 24 hours and it

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.380 
for about probably about 24 hours and it
set<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.650> really<00:03:13.799> well<00:03:14.040> really<00:03:14.819> tightened<00:03:15.299> up

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
set up really well really tightened up

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.449 
set up really well really tightened up
bunched<00:03:15.870> up<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.260> then<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.890> kind<00:03:17.069> of<00:03:17.100> gave<00:03:17.280> it

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
bunched up and then it kind of gave it

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.670 
bunched up and then it kind of gave it
this<00:03:17.640> really<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.480> get<00:03:18.870> obviously<00:03:19.049> authentic

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
this really I get obviously authentic

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.890 
this really I get obviously authentic
look<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.100> then<00:03:20.519> finally<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:20.970> finished<00:03:21.390> up<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
look and then finally I finished up the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.259 
look and then finally I finished up the
the<00:03:22.170> pieces<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.620> wood<00:03:22.769> with<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.610> Danish<00:03:23.940> oil

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the pieces of wood with the Danish oil

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.390 
the pieces of wood with the Danish oil
and<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.470> preserve<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.070> case<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.370> ever

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
and just to preserve it in case I ever

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.550 
and just to preserve it in case I ever
ended<00:03:26.880> up<00:03:26.970> taking<00:03:27.239> this<00:03:27.570> out<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.320> field

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
ended up taking this out in the field

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.400 
ended up taking this out in the field
and<00:03:28.910> just<00:03:29.910> kind<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.120> using<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:30.870> just

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
and just kind of using it or just just

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.319 
and just kind of using it or just just
preserving<00:03:31.769> against<00:03:32.100> time<00:03:32.340> itself<00:03:32.760> honestly

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
preserving against time itself honestly

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.090 
preserving against time itself honestly
and<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:34.440> really<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.310> turned<00:03:35.549> out<00:03:35.700> great

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
and I really think it turned out great

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.060 
and I really think it turned out great
the<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.820> NAP<00:03:39.030> blade<00:03:39.420> Dane<00:03:40.410> always<00:03:40.890> does

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
the the the NAP blade Dane always does

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.949 
the the the NAP blade Dane always does
it<00:03:41.190> does<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> fantastic<00:03:41.640> job<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.570> gorgeous

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
it does a fantastic job it's gorgeous

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.310 
it does a fantastic job it's gorgeous
got<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> good<00:03:43.590> good<00:03:44.540> coloration<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.170> can

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
got a good good coloration as you can

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.099 
got a good good coloration as you can
tell<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.500> mean<00:03:46.769> it's<00:03:46.920> not<00:03:47.070> perfect<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.900> side

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
tell I mean it's not perfect this side

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.449 
tell I mean it's not perfect this side
dips<00:03:49.410> down<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> little<00:03:49.920> more<00:03:50.040> than<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> other

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
dips down a little more than the other

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.430 
dips down a little more than the other
but<00:03:51.239> really<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.630> mean<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.900> think<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.290> just

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
but really I mean I think that just

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.590 
but really I mean I think that just
helps<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.769> authenticity<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.420> tell

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
helps the authenticity you can tell

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.420 
helps the authenticity you can tell
there's<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.810> twist<00:03:55.140> in<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.440> handle<00:03:55.829> which<00:03:56.280> i
