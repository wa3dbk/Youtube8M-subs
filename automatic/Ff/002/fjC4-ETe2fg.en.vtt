car we have mounted several LED ambient
lighting<00:01:10.770> modules<00:01:11.630> what<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
lighting modules what I can do here is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.580 
lighting modules what I can do here is
basically<00:01:14.159> by<00:01:14.610> pushing<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.150> button<00:01:15.409> sending<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
basically by pushing a button sending a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.090 
basically by pushing a button sending a
command<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> limbus<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:19.350> command

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
command over the limbus and this command

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130 
command over the limbus and this command
now<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.729> telling<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.479> modules<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
now here is telling all the modules to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.620 
now here is telling all the modules to
change<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> different<00:01:22.890> color<00:01:23.330> like<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
change to a different color like you can

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.530 
change to a different color like you can
see<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.790> change<00:01:27.060> from<00:01:27.299> red

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
see over here so you can change from red

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
see over here so you can change from red
to<00:01:27.750> green<00:01:27.900> any<00:01:28.590> color<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.670> would<00:01:29.759> like

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to green any color that you would like

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.080 
to green any color that you would like
to<00:01:30.150> make<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.650> that's<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.250> done<00:01:32.460> via

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
that the lin master communicates with

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.589 
that the lin master communicates with
only<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> first<00:02:29.040> ambient<00:02:30.000> lighting<00:02:30.150> module

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
only the first ambient lighting module

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.819 
only the first ambient lighting module
because<00:02:31.200> all<00:02:31.439> switches<00:02:32.010> are<00:02:32.310> open<00:02:33.829> during

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
because all switches are open during

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.860 
because all switches are open during
this<00:02:35.040> communication<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:36.060> first<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.689> with

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
address once that has been done the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.360 
address once that has been done the
switch<00:02:42.090> will<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.420> closed<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:43.769> means<00:02:43.829> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
switch will be closed that means that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.490 
switch will be closed that means that
communication<00:02:44.909> now<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.180> also<00:02:45.359> happen<00:02:46.349> with

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
communication now can also happen with

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.599 
communication now can also happen with
the<00:02:46.680> second<00:02:47.280> slave<00:02:48.120> module<00:02:49.189> and<00:02:50.189> you<00:02:50.310> do<00:02:50.459> that

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
the second slave module and you do that

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.420 
the second slave module and you do that
one<00:02:51.000> after<00:02:51.389> another<00:02:51.419> until<00:02:51.870> every<00:02:52.620> ambient

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
one after another until every ambient

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.970 
one after another until every ambient
lighting<00:02:53.609> module<00:02:54.139> receives<00:02:55.139> its<00:02:55.650> unique

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
lighting module receives its unique

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.129 
lighting module receives its unique
address<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.519> it's<00:02:56.879> ready<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.359> communication

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
address and it's ready for communication

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.670 
address and it's ready for communication
and<00:02:58.379> now<00:02:59.189> the<00:02:59.969> lin<00:03:00.150> master<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.689> say<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.530> this

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
and now the lin master can say to this

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.729 
and now the lin master can say to this
module<00:03:01.919> go<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.760> red<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:04.019> one<00:03:04.200> go<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.409> green

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
module go to red this one go to green

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.069 
module go to red this one go to green
here<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.489> have<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.819> dim<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.900> all

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
here you have to dim that is all

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.679 
here you have to dim that is all
possible<00:03:07.290> now<00:03:07.650> after<00:03:08.219> configuration<00:03:08.939> of<00:03:09.209> this

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
possible now after configuration of this

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.920 
possible now after configuration of this
whole<00:03:09.870> system<00:03:10.519> so<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:11.669> a<00:03:11.760> very<00:03:12.000> nice<00:03:12.329> way<00:03:12.689> to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
whole system so it's a very nice way to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.199 
whole system so it's a very nice way to
keep<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.950> logistics<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.700> manufacturing

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
keep the logistics and manufacturing

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.069 
keep the logistics and manufacturing
cost<00:03:15.450> simple<00:03:17.000> still<00:03:18.000> having<00:03:18.299> full<00:03:18.510> control

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
cost simple still having full control

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.309 
cost simple still having full control
over<00:03:19.340> eating<00:03:20.340> each<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.090> individual<00:03:21.510> module

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
over eating each and individual module

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.509 
over eating each and individual module
in<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.620> car<00:03:24.829> what<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.949> see<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> screen

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
in the car what you see on the screen

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.250 
in the car what you see on the screen
here<00:03:26.729> I<00:03:26.909> can<00:03:27.060> also<00:03:27.180> demonstrate<00:03:27.449> here<00:03:28.079> and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
here I can also demonstrate here and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.520 
here I can also demonstrate here and
this<00:03:28.739> in<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.280> car<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.760> we<00:03:29.909> have<00:03:30.260> what<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.290> can

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
this in this car that we have what I can

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.759 
this in this car that we have what I can
do<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.889> basically<00:03:32.519> do<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.659> configuration<00:03:33.959> by

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
do is basically do the configuration by

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.800 
do is basically do the configuration by
pushing<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.459> button<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:36.030> will<00:03:36.329> do<00:03:36.419> that<00:03:36.540> here

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
pushing one button I will do that here

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.030 
pushing one button I will do that here
right<00:03:37.109> now<00:03:37.939> what<00:03:38.939> you<00:03:39.060> will<00:03:39.209> see<00:03:39.449> now<00:03:39.659> is<00:03:39.930> that

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
right now what you will see now is that

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.330 
right now what you will see now is that
each<00:03:41.040> module<00:03:41.760> will<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.810> unique<00:03:43.199> color<00:03:43.530> so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
each module will have a unique color so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.280 
each module will have a unique color so
what<00:03:44.459> happens<00:03:44.849> in<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> meantime<00:03:45.359> is<00:03:45.689> all

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
what happens in the meantime is all

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.699 
what happens in the meantime is all
these<00:03:47.359> assignments<00:03:48.359> have<00:03:48.810> taken<00:03:49.139> place<00:03:49.349> so

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
these assignments have taken place so

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.849 
these assignments have taken place so
every<00:03:50.129> module<00:03:50.310> now<00:03:50.609> has<00:03:50.909> its<00:03:51.150> own<00:03:51.299> address<00:03:51.859> and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
every module now has its own address and

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.580 
every module now has its own address and
you<00:03:52.979> can<00:03:53.099> also<00:03:53.250> see<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:54.629> fire<00:03:55.109> different

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
you can also see that fire different

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.580 
you can also see that fire different
colors<00:03:55.909> so<00:03:56.909> here<00:03:57.150> in<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.359> back<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:58.079> have<00:03:58.349> a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
colors so here in the back you have a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.659 
colors so here in the back you have a
red<00:03:59.129> colored<00:03:59.970> module<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:01.139> have<00:04:01.379> a<00:04:01.669> yellow

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
red colored module and you have a yellow

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.240 
red colored module and you have a yellow
colored<00:04:02.939> module<00:04:03.269> but<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.019> now<00:04:04.199> can<00:04:04.439> do<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.739> take

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
colored module but I now can do is take

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.490 
colored module but I now can do is take
out<00:04:05.489> these<00:04:05.759> modules<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.540> I'll<00:04:06.659> take<00:04:06.870> out<00:04:07.079> this

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
out these modules so I'll take out this

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.729 
out these modules so I'll take out this
one<00:04:07.709> here<00:04:08.009> this<00:04:08.699> one<00:04:08.939> is<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.239> yellow<00:04:09.629> one<00:04:09.739> this

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
one here this one is the yellow one this

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.330 
one here this one is the yellow one this
was<00:04:10.949> the<00:04:11.250> red<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:13.069> red<00:04:14.069> one

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
was the red one and the red one

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.770 
was the red one and the red one
I<00:04:14.459> bring<00:04:14.639> now<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.359> position<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:17.659> if<00:04:18.659> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
I bring now to this position and if the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.770 
I bring now to this position and if the
yellow<00:04:19.019> one<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.440> bring<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.250> position

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.420 

and<00:04:23.780> what<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.050> can<00:04:24.199> see<00:04:24.229> is<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.129> caller

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
and what you can see is that the caller

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.239 
and what you can see is that the caller
moves<00:04:26.030> with<00:04:26.569> the<00:04:26.749> module<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.289> that<00:04:27.349> is

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:28.249 
moves with the module and that is

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.580 
moves with the module and that is
because<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:29.449> module<00:04:29.749> is<00:04:29.840> unique<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.319> has<00:04:30.349> its

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
because the module is unique it has its

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.200 
because the module is unique it has its
own<00:04:30.710> address<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.310> has<00:04:31.430> received<00:04:31.729> a<00:04:31.909> comment

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
own address and has received a comment

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.749 
own address and has received a comment
to<00:04:32.749> turn<00:04:32.960> yellow<00:04:33.529> its<00:04:33.919> received<00:04:34.219> a<00:04:34.310> comment<00:04:34.490> to

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
to turn yellow its received a comment to

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.469 
to turn yellow its received a comment to
turn<00:04:34.909> red<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:35.749> can<00:04:35.990> bring<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:36.770> along<00:04:37.639> if

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
turn red so you can bring that along if

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.950 
turn red so you can bring that along if
I<00:04:39.439> now<00:04:39.560> do<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.740> reconfiguration<00:04:40.639> basically<00:04:41.360> the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
I now do a reconfiguration basically the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.409 
I now do a reconfiguration basically the
lane<00:04:42.110> master<00:04:42.469> tells<00:04:42.710> now<00:04:42.949> to<00:04:43.310> reconfigure<00:04:44.120> all

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
lane master tells now to reconfigure all

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.429 
lane master tells now to reconfigure all
modules<00:04:45.219> by<00:04:46.219> pushing<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:46.699> button<00:04:47.259> then<00:04:48.259> what

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
modules by pushing this button then what

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.920 
modules by pushing this button then what
you<00:04:48.560> can<00:04:48.650> see<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:49.039> that<00:04:49.219> it<00:04:49.520> turns<00:04:49.969> back<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.659> red

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
you can see is that it turns back to red

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.989 
you can see is that it turns back to red
