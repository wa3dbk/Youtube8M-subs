know blog comparing the ipad with the
microsoft<00:00:05.520> surface<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.180> just<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
microsoft surface this is just a

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.470 
microsoft surface this is just a
unscientific<00:00:08.189> size<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:09.000> dimensions

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
unscientific size and dimensions

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.030 
unscientific size and dimensions

notice<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> bezel<00:00:13.830> they're<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.880> same

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
notice the bezel they're about the same

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.510 
notice the bezel they're about the same
on<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.080> edge<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> surface<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
on the edge of the surface in on the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.540 
on the edge of the surface in on the
edge<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.000> ipad<00:00:18.390> 3<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> ipad<00:00:20.070> 3<00:00:20.369> so

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
edge of the ipad 3 this is the ipad 3 so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.420 
edge of the ipad 3 this is the ipad 3 so
the<00:00:20.670> bezel<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.140> fairly<00:00:22.140> similar<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.279> both

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the bezel is fairly similar to on both

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.340 
the bezel is fairly similar to on both
you<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> home<00:00:24.330> buttons<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.869> both<00:00:25.050> devices

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
you have a home buttons on both devices

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.439 
you have a home buttons on both devices
one<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.189> capacitive<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.970> course<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
one is capacitive of course with the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
one is capacitive of course with the
surface<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.260> mechanical<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
surface and one is mechanical with the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.959 
surface and one is mechanical with the
ipad<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:31.019> width<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.980> i<00:00:32.040> guess<00:00:32.460> that's<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
ipad and the width or i guess that's the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.450 
ipad and the width or i guess that's the
length<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.840> surface<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.190> it's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
length of the surface you can see it's

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.170 
length of the surface you can see it's
much<00:00:35.670> longer<00:00:36.030> than<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> ipad<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.969> screen<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
much longer than the ipad the screen is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
much longer than the ipad the screen is
and<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> device<00:00:39.840> itself<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.620> longer<00:00:41.070> than<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and the device itself is longer than the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.720 
and the device itself is longer than the
ipad<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> ipad<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.290> wider<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
ipad but then the ipad is wider than the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.110 
ipad but then the ipad is wider than the
surface<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> trade-off<00:00:46.440> there

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
surface so they kind of trade-off there

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.619 
surface so they kind of trade-off there
notice<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.739> see<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:49.890> much<00:00:50.610> wider<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.239> ipad

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
notice this see how much wider the ipad

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
notice this see how much wider the ipad
is<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.020> general<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:53.160> far<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.460> screen<00:00:53.760> size

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
is in general in as far as screen size

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.799 
is in general in as far as screen size
is<00:00:54.030> concerned<00:00:54.719> there<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.370> wider

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
is concerned there is a much wider

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.080 
is concerned there is a much wider
screen<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> ipad<00:00:58.710> 3<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.820> shot<00:01:00.059> right

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
screen on the ipad 3 and this shot right

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.700 
screen on the ipad 3 and this shot right
here<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.930> gives<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> good<00:01:01.559> indication

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
here really gives you a good indication

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
here really gives you a good indication
as<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> how<00:01:02.430> skinny<00:01:02.940> these<00:01:03.210> surfaces<00:01:03.719> compared

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
as to how skinny these surfaces compared

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810 
as to how skinny these surfaces compared
to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> ipad<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.799> how<00:01:04.860> tall<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> surface<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to the ipad and how tall the surface is

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.960 
to the ipad and how tall the surface is
compared<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> ipad<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.460> quite

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
compared it to the ipad so there's quite

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.160 
compared it to the ipad so there's quite
a<00:01:09.000> bit<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> difference<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.689> course<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
a bit of difference of course the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.859 
a bit of difference of course the
surface<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.070> 16<00:01:11.430> by<00:01:11.610> 9<00:01:11.850> aspect<00:01:12.060> ratio<00:01:12.659> as

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
surface has a 16 by 9 aspect ratio as

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.649 
surface has a 16 by 9 aspect ratio as
well<00:01:13.250> when<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.340> comes<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.760> weight<00:01:15.119> people

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
well when it comes to weight people

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.480 
well when it comes to weight people
automatically<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> surface<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
automatically think that the surface is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.760 
automatically think that the surface is
this<00:01:17.759> huge<00:01:18.150> hulking<00:01:18.570> device<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.619> just

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
this huge hulking device that is just

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.530 
this huge hulking device that is just
too<00:01:19.950> heavy<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.400> hold<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.330> not

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
too heavy to hold but really that's not

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.070 
too heavy to hold but really that's not
the<00:01:21.600> truth<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.530> ipad<00:01:22.860> 3<00:01:23.189> ways<00:01:23.659> 1.44<00:01:24.659> pounds

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the truth the ipad 3 ways 1.44 pounds

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.010 
the truth the ipad 3 ways 1.44 pounds
and<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.530> surface<00:01:25.770> weighs<00:01:26.130> 1.5<00:01:26.490> pounds<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and the surface weighs 1.5 pounds so the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
and the surface weighs 1.5 pounds so the
difference<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> negligible<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.700> fact

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
difference really is negligible in fact

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
difference really is negligible in fact
it<00:01:30.509> almost<00:01:30.630> seems<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> surface<00:01:31.710> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it almost seems like the surface is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
it almost seems like the surface is
about<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.340> same<00:01:32.610> weight<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.170> way

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
about the same weight because of the way

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.340 
about the same weight because of the way
the<00:01:34.530> weight<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> distributed<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:36.390> holding

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the weight is distributed now holding

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
the weight is distributed now holding
the<00:01:37.470> device<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.950> how<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.280> was<00:01:38.340> able<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the device you see how i was able to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.580 
the device you see how i was able to
hold<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.210> hand<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> ipad<00:01:40.380> i

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
hold that in one hand with the ipad i

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
hold that in one hand with the ipad i
really<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.430> struggle<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> hold<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> i

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
really have to struggle to hold it i

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
really have to struggle to hold it i
have<00:01:42.780> big<00:01:43.020> hands<00:01:43.229> obviously<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.070> really

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
have big hands obviously but I really

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.859 
have big hands obviously but I really
have<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> struggle<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> try<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> hold<00:01:45.630> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
have to struggle to try to hold that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
have to struggle to try to hold that
with<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.619> hand<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.490> fairly<00:01:48.329> easy

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
with one hand with this it's fairly easy

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
with one hand with this it's fairly easy
I<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.649> hold<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.310> hand

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
I can just hold this up with one hand

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.010 
I can just hold this up with one hand
with<00:01:50.640> no<00:01:50.759> problem<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.479> total

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
with no problem and have total

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.539 
with no problem and have total
confidence<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> won't<00:01:52.920> drop<00:01:53.130> out<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> my

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
confidence that it won't drop out of my

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.190 
confidence that it won't drop out of my
hand<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> had<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> pull<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> digital

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
hand so I had to pull out the digital

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
hand so I had to pull out the digital
caliper<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.680> obviously<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.759> isn't

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
caliper and obviously this isn't

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.209 
caliper and obviously this isn't
scientific<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.659> didn't<00:01:57.960> meticulously<00:01:58.740> make

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
scientific I didn't meticulously make

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.100 
scientific I didn't meticulously make
sure<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.939> measurements<00:02:00.390> were<00:02:00.479> correct<00:02:00.719> but

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
sure the measurements were correct but

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.670 
sure the measurements were correct but
it's<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:01.829> ballpark<00:02:02.610> figure<00:02:03.380> 9.8<00:02:04.380> 3

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
it's a good ballpark figure 9.8 3

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.819 
it's a good ballpark figure 9.8 3
millimeters<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> surface<00:02:06.469> let's<00:02:07.469> hop

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
millimeters for the surface let's hop

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.150 
millimeters for the surface let's hop
over<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.399> iPad<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.209> let's<00:02:10.200> measure<00:02:10.530> here

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
over to the iPad and let's measure here

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.540 
over to the iPad and let's measure here
so<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.150> getting<00:02:12.450> about<00:02:12.690> nine

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
so I'm getting about nine

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.480 
so I'm getting about nine
points<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:15.470> again<00:02:15.710> this<00:02:15.860> isn't<00:02:16.100> scientific

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
points and again this isn't scientific

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.210 
points and again this isn't scientific
I've<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.240> loosely<00:02:17.690> measured<00:02:18.560> at<00:02:18.710> nine<00:02:18.860> point

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
I've just loosely measured at nine point

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.550 
I've just loosely measured at nine point
five<00:02:19.430> six<00:02:19.850> millimeters<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.960> haven't<00:02:21.410> checked

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
five six millimeters I haven't checked

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.890 
five six millimeters I haven't checked
the<00:02:21.740> actual<00:02:22.160> stats<00:02:22.760> on<00:02:22.940> apples<00:02:23.300> website<00:02:23.330> in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the actual stats on apples website in

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.410 
the actual stats on apples website in
Microsoft's<00:02:24.710> website<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.310> as<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.210> see

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
Microsoft's website but as you can see

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.410 
Microsoft's website but as you can see
they're<00:02:26.750> not<00:02:27.020> too<00:02:27.410> different<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:28.190> far<00:02:28.790> as<00:02:28.820> the

they're not too different as far as the

they're not too different as far as the

that matter the main difference you're

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.010 
that matter the main difference you're
going<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.730> here<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.750> size

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
going to have here is just the size

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.670 
going to have here is just the size
differences<00:02:36.860> as<00:02:37.070> far<00:02:37.310> as<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.790> height<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
width of each device they're just

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.290

drastically<00:02:41.720> different<00:02:42.620> proportions<00:02:43.490> know

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
drastically different proportions know

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.420

whether<00:02:44.570> or<00:02:44.690> not<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.830> better<00:02:46.130> than<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
whether or not one is better than the

dimensions of each device is concerned

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.060 
dimensions of each device is concerned
well<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.630> think<00:02:50.990> that's<00:02:51.140> really<00:02:51.410> kind<00:02:51.980> of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
well I think that's really kind of

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.850 
well I think that's really kind of
subjective<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:53.150> mean<00:02:53.630> Microsoft<00:02:53.960> made<00:02:54.590> their

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
subjective I mean Microsoft made their

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.700 
subjective I mean Microsoft made their
device<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.850> way<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.210> because<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:57.410> more

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
device the way it is because it's more

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.700 
device the way it is because it's more
of<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.920> laptop<00:02:58.490> hybrid<00:02:59.000> tablet<00:02:59.900> than<00:03:00.230> anything

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
of a laptop hybrid tablet than anything

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.540 
of a laptop hybrid tablet than anything
via<00:03:01.340> ipad<00:03:02.330> obviously<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.620> pure<00:03:03.920> tablet

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
via ipad obviously is just a pure tablet

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.210 
via ipad obviously is just a pure tablet
in<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.940> pure<00:03:05.390> sense<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.900> form<00:03:06.220> so

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
in the pure sense of the form so

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.250 
in the pure sense of the form so
microsoft<00:03:08.180> felt<00:03:08.360> they<00:03:08.480> needed<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.930> make<00:03:09.080> their

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
microsoft felt they needed to make their

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.430 
microsoft felt they needed to make their
dimensions<00:03:09.740> wider<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.730> skinnier<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.990> fit

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
dimensions wider and skinnier to fit

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.680 
dimensions wider and skinnier to fit
their<00:03:12.710> purpose<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.310> apple<00:03:14.060> has<00:03:14.210> their<00:03:14.480> thing

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
their purpose and apple has their thing

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.970 
their purpose and apple has their thing
going<00:03:14.990> on<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.260> course<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.710> they're<00:03:15.830> very

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
going on of course and they're very

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.460
