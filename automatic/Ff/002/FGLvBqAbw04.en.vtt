 [Music] 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.750
 [Applause] 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.000
 [Music] 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.760
 the traffic of the strongest we are going to 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.800
 work a tip with the bar curio to 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.880
 do for men for women the 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.250
 women always have the fear of 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.270
 work the top that are going to 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.820
 make wide or they will develop 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.880
 too much muscle mass and then when 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.980
 the truth is they are not as they are 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.960
 hormonally endowed for a development 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.210
 muscular as they sometimes think 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 let's do the biceps course of the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.760
 correct way the elbow if you have to 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.269
 be pointing on the floor as you see 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.269
 I like it 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.120
 the only joint that should move 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.260
 in this exercise is the articulation of 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.820
 elbow 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.289
 if I start to move the shoulder of a 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.289
 wrong way to the pool 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.559
 I 'm already giving up the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.600
 shoulder joint obviously 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.430
 then if we do a company do not 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.810
 we can talk about eight repetitions of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.990
 the machine is not going to start tricking a 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 little but you have to do it as much 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.090
 strict that you can under slowly 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 he had space here and it's always time 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 what do I do uploading I do it going down already 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.830
 be two seconds up two 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.330
 seconds down 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.780
 I try to make the contraction up 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.220
 always with my back straight without doing 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.220
 a neo- trap field 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.490
 she is swinging whether it's 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.420
 do it as strictly as possible 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.520
 affecting up and down slowly 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.710
 They can be men or women women 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.210
 do not be afraid that they are going to put 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.330
 too strong 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.690
 this is a tip for biceps kurt only 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.860
 the strongest 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.860
