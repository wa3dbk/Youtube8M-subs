hi this is Marty with advanced
automation<00:00:16.920> today<00:00:17.369> I'm<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> discuss

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
automation today I'm going to discuss

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.810 
automation today I'm going to discuss
how<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.710> set<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.039> toggle<00:00:20.340> assembly

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
how to set up a toggle assembly

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.660 
how to set up a toggle assembly
correctly<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.510> 105's<00:00:22.320> cell<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.920> lot<00:00:23.550> of

correctly on the 105's cell a lot of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.330 
correctly on the 105's cell a lot of
calls<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.660> print<00:00:25.019> quality<00:00:25.439> issues<00:00:25.769> or<00:00:26.039> when

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
calls about print quality issues or when

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
calls about print quality issues or when
I'm<00:00:26.430> on-site<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:27.449> servicing<00:00:27.900> printers

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
I'm on-site for servicing printers

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.589 
I'm on-site for servicing printers
I'm<00:00:29.400> always<00:00:29.609> looking<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> toggle

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
I'm always looking at the toggle

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.910 
I'm always looking at the toggle
assemblies<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> first<00:00:31.289> thing<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.529> look<00:00:31.710> at

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
assemblies the first thing I look at

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.819 
assemblies the first thing I look at
when<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> comes<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.030> print<00:00:33.270> quality<00:00:33.630> issues<00:00:33.989> as

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
when it comes to print quality issues as

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.290 
when it comes to print quality issues as
you<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.910> 105<00:00:36.210> SL<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:38.760> toggle

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you can see here this 105 SL the toggle

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.030 
you can see here this 105 SL the toggle
assembly<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> cranked<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> way<00:00:40.500> down<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
assembly is cranked all the way down you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.970 
assembly is cranked all the way down you
might<00:00:41.780> see<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.079> normal<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.710> your

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
might see that as normal on your

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.279 
might see that as normal on your
printers<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:45.210> what's<00:00:45.750> happening<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
printers but what's happening is that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.569 
printers but what's happening is that
you're<00:00:46.469> putting<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:46.950> pressure<00:00:47.250> down<00:00:47.550> on

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you're putting so much pressure down on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
you're putting so much pressure down on
this<00:00:47.789> printhead<00:00:48.360> mechanically<00:00:49.050> because

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this printhead mechanically because

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
this printhead mechanically because
you're<00:00:49.829> shortening<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.520> life<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.059> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you're shortening the life of that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.590 
you're shortening the life of that
printhead<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.590> optimal<00:00:53.190> distance<00:00:54.059> or

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
printhead the optimal distance or

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.290 
printhead the optimal distance or
pressure<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.500> toggle<00:00:56.100> assembly<00:00:56.670> should

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
pressure on this toggle assembly should

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.950 
pressure on this toggle assembly should
be<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> quarter<00:00:58.020> inch<00:00:58.199> from<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> top<00:00:59.480> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
be a quarter inch from the top to the to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
be a quarter inch from the top to the to
the<00:01:01.079> top<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.620> thumb<00:01:01.949> wheel<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.579> going

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the top of this thumb wheel so I'm going

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.500 
the top of this thumb wheel so I'm going
to<00:01:02.940> adjust<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to adjust this right now to get all that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.080 
to adjust this right now to get all that
extra<00:01:06.960> pressure<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.000> I'm

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
extra pressure off there and then I'm

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
extra pressure off there and then I'm
going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> reset<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.830> see

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
going to reset this up so you can see

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.870 
going to reset this up so you can see
exactly<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:15.750> should<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.229> best

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
exactly what I think should be the best

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.710 
exactly what I think should be the best
pressure<00:01:17.880> okay<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:20.150> as<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.390> tell

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
pressure okay and then as you can tell

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.109 
pressure okay and then as you can tell
I'm<00:01:22.590> trying<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.430> toggle<00:01:23.640> assembly
