00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 dad I think we'll be able to see you soon 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:09.050
 go out a contest where it's going 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 how are we going to see how to create 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.210
 candlesticks for fishing and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.760
 that bars of obstacles there are two 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.250
 methods for the bars we will start 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.140
 by making people of those heuliez 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 here you will need the piece of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.720
 cardboard found in boxes in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.960
 so pool of a drug and you'll 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.360
 also need silver paint and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 of a piece of course and then 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.780
 possibly a schleich bar 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.790
 as a model and a pair of scissors 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.450
 to start you to cut them out 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.280
 part of the middle and once these the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 obstacles and candlesticks I mean 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 are necessarily a bit high and so me 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.600
 what I did was I got them 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.219
 cut in half to make a height 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.149
 perfect notter 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.270
 but you have to know that there is 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.940
 several sizes of two boxes 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.790
 during hen and so the cartons are 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.350
 of different sizes also once from 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.820
 more what we will be able to pass to 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.070
 rabbits 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.780
 then then to create your bars there 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.820
 so has two methods as I said 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.420
 you will need paper and he will 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.080
 also need markers and he you 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:31.240
 also need scissors a rule a 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:36.070
 scotch pencil and sticky paper 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.610
 alesi first method you go 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.710
 so start by drawing your pattern 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.619
 of bach and then you're going to have to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.570
 coiled up your little bit of pep and so for 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.660
 color 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.690
 especially do not color all the band that 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.680
 is useless and then to maintain the 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:03.310
 all you will put the sticky paper 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.170
 the little plasticized tone all around and 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.570
 then I added some tips 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.630
 of Scotch and so you have finished your 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.850
 bar if I can add something 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.459
 it will be a little trick for for 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.739
 butcher the lÃ©bous if you want it 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.830
 so just add a little bit of 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.900
 glue despite the glue on the ends 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 for the second method you will have 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.120
 need straw 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.220
 you will also need tape 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.220
 of color you will start with 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.740
 cut out your not take there ribbon and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.480
 to surround your foot there was 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.490
 thankfully so and you and do so 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.990
 patterns to plug the holes 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.790
 if you want the obvious butchers 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.060
 because we are not obliged you can 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.440
 to do as the methods one so to 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.210
 roll a paper and slip it into the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.140
 straw and put some glue be 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.140
 masters of glue 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.470
 wow, we'll have to 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.470
 there my coconut
