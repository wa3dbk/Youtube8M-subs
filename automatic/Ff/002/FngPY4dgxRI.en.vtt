00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.710
 Both employees show us where the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 Doner was made 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.600
 at a company in berlin the two 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 other concerned thinner of it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.200
 do not want to be in front of the camera with us 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.750
 talk but we miss something 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.540
 they all seem to be the same 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.729
 Manufacturer supplies the name is different 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.490
 but delivery notes and invoices are 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 always on the same address 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.830
 we will contact you by phone and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.210
 We can receive an invitation 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.210
 because they can still visit them today 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.140

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.120
 the presumed manufacturer of the kebab with 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.130
 pork we come with two 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.990
 expert of our testing laboratory 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.980
 We want the responsible ones 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.840
 to confront 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.160
 Here you pass the blame to the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.160
 Suppliers from poland 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.190
 if somehow today they are aware of it 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.500
 buy and let in there 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.480
 They also go back first was from the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200
 month comes and we have to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.959
 follow 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.880
 october siko we drive now to catch up 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.620
 and then we still leave 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.530
 do not explain that's us 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.240
 Buy pretty much every day now 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.220
 daughter base head this is the consultant 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.170
 the company he now owns 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.790
 through checks 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.080
 background a doner maker is indeed 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.830
 committed to hygiene 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.050
 check 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.060
 but which meatballs delivered to you 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.220
 that gets not checked 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.900
 we can not recognize here 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.150
 anyone springbock or drive or 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.010
 made something clean because we 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.230
 can and must assume 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.580
 inform us for the only thing that 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.950
 what he delivers to us 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.450
 but the truth corresponds because also 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.450
 there belonged the thing 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.950
 1 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.780
 quality is processed frozen 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.490
 we squander 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.130
 meat is where then to the conclusion 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.930
 come 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.609
 great what do you think 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.609
 too expensive and 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.569
 yes work 50 to 100 such blocks 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.569
 then the countries became 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.680
 after all, we are given the opportunity 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.410
 to take a sample and again in the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.640
 laboratory 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.390
 these results will be a few more 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.390
 take days
