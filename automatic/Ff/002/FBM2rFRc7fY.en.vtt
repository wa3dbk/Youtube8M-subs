00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:17.689
 we said a lot of things a lot of fantasies and about the mafia but before 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.839
 everything is a business one does not do in feeling where the emotional 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:27.110
 even though the family is very important when my job has retired on 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.960
 offered me to go back to troubled New York 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 to become the domain the investigated 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.530
 another family managed to take control of some of our 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.630
 shops 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 free competition sharp 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.160
 boss of the ump these manage a business live at a hundred an hour 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.690
 to be everywhere at once 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.280
 when a competing business is working well you are negotiating hard for 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 get a share of the profits 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.930
 the hardest 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.180
 and succeed in convincing the boss 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.880
 sometimes you have to take the time to understand what really motivates them 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.520
 the things that the terminal is sensitive to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.620
 jean can not refuse 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.880
 we go beyond the limits 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940
 and we can not conclude the deal anymore 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.950
 we must find new axes to put a spoke in the wheels 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.680
 your competitors' business 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.840
 small rivers make big rivers 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.410
 he every new business that falls under your couple 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.420
 allows you to sit down 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.650
 when you own the monopoly of a particular business 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.979
 you then enjoy more in kind 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.280
 which makes everyday work easier 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.650
 especially when it comes to protecting its resources because this is an area where 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.060
 the competition is tough 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.320
 placing a few guards will ensure that our competitors are not 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.090
 not tempted to come back 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.620
 what you took from them 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.530
 we can never say enough it is essential to have collaborators 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.790
 in whom you can trust 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.990
 people who associate 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.470
 who can help you when you feel a little weak 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 but who finds a way to doubt it 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.329
 clear message to the competition 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.569
 that's why they need to be trained regularly and promoted in 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 the organization without this 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.829
 but what is true for you it is also for your competitors 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.150
 sometimes you have to be persuasive 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.030
 make sure that they will never come back to meddle in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.219
 family 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.019
 nothing personal 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:31.970
 what about the business
