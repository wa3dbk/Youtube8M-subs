00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.030
 are seeing the effort required to 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.649
 a final without the effort and effort 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.600
 of the whole team but in the second 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.969
 time the team is going to see better that 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.680
 We are sure that I do know that she 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.540
 It is strong and we invite you to celebrate 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.540
 together here I will be with you 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.270
 and very happy for all our people 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.390
 all the people who traveled and who were today 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.190
 just encouraging at all times the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.420
 team and especially for all 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.460
 pressures that he was always living 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.530
 our coaching staff and the staff that 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.300
 all ghosts were exorcised 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.570
 were all demons because I would have 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.520
 to say yes 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.290
 but for that you needed not only 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 good players that we had it and the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.040
 confidence and the temper to impose 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.720
 impose on the rival because he never drops 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.120
 arms despite moments 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.880
 difficult to draw the one that the character the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.130
 temper each one of us and follow 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.740
 working day by day despite the fact that 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.930
 things have not gone as we would like 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.160
 the team has joined more and more and that 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.160
 formally it was achieved 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.400
 and so it's blue cross breaks the hex of 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.830
 new account lifts a new cup 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.500
 the Olympic lap counts the most beautiful 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.930
 of all 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.450
 but they are still more than 15 years without 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.250
 win a league title from Cancun 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.620

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.090
