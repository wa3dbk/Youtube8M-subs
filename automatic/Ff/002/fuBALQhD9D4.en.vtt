I<00:00:19.670> expect<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.849> expected<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.599> it's<00:00:22.349> guaranteed

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I expect I expected that it's guaranteed

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.010 
I expect I expected that it's guaranteed
that<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:23.789> GPS<00:00:24.449> will<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
that the you know GPS will be the

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.159 
that the you know GPS will be the
standard<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> future<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> think<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.079> a

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
standard in the future so I think it's a

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.460 
standard in the future so I think it's a
big<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:29.220> an<00:00:29.340> advantage<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> having<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.539> even

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
big it's an advantage to having it even

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.130 
big it's an advantage to having it even
if<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.970> knows<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.629> you<00:00:33.690> turn<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> on

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
if one knows the way and you turn it on

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
if one knows the way and you turn it on
even<00:00:34.500> occasionally<00:00:35.129> especially<00:00:35.400> when<00:00:35.879> a<00:00:35.910> guy

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
even occasionally especially when a guy

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.650 
even occasionally especially when a guy
has<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> delivery<00:00:37.110> into<00:00:38.570> into<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
has to make a delivery into into the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.720 
has to make a delivery into into the
bigger<00:00:39.839> cities<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.220> one-shot<00:00:41.430> deal

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
bigger cities and it's a one-shot deal

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.570 
bigger cities and it's a one-shot deal
and<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.600> don't<00:00:42.750> want<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.050> caught<00:00:43.580> you
