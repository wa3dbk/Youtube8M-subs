00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.680
 since when Uncle Pedro contributed for these 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.419
 lands 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.769
 there are reports about the strange 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.180
 phenomena occurring in forests 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.699
 brazilian 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.939
 this phenomenon described as an immense 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.250
 floating ball of fire emerges from the earth 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.840
 in the middle of the forest and chases men 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.430
 who risk venturing into these 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.860
 places 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.360
 according to the testimonies despite being 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.820
 apparently the fire 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.770
 the entity does not burn any plant or 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.489
 leaves any trace of carbonization 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.920
 caused by the temperature all advance in 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.890
 direction to people as if they were 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.230
 wanting to scare them away in their 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.610
 expeditions of the Bandeirantes lotava the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.940
 your records and letters 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.190
 these bizarre encounters collao barreto 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.369
 wrote about his fear to explore 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.200
 certain regions of tietÃª avoids rumors of 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.600
 disappearances of other groups 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.810
 after the appearance of this pioneers 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.560
 fireball and as they said they consumed without 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.979
 burn 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.170
 in other words the phenomenon did with 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.200
 that the men would disappear in a 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.149
 eyes, however, nothing is set on fire. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.369
 around you 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.110
 with the passing of time this fireball 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.590
 by gaining form and characteristics 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.560
 to become the legend of the mother of 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.390
 gold there are some 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.259
 scientific explanations for this 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.599
 phenomenon 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.250
 scholars say that fireballs 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.140
 emerged from the earth 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.810
 is nothing more than methane deposits 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.270
 that burns others speak 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.950
 about condensed energy phenomena that 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.009
 would be very similar to a ray 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.470
 globular which has many stories but 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.069
 not yet reproduced in the laboratory 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.610
 proof with another type of proof 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.720
 and you've heard of these mysterious 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.679
 fire balls 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.360
