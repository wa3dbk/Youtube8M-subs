I<00:05:40.610> saw

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
I saw

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.880 
I saw
and<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.870> think<00:05:44.050> at<00:05:44.110> this<00:05:44.170> point<00:05:44.260> blancas<00:05:44.740> has

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
and I think at this point blancas has

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.470 
and I think at this point blancas has
brought<00:05:45.130> up<00:05:45.250> his<00:05:45.400> canister<00:05:46.030> shot<00:05:46.150> so

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
brought up his canister shot so

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.170 
brought up his canister shot so
theoretically<00:05:46.990> we<00:05:47.170> brought<00:05:47.380> up<00:05:47.500> are<00:05:47.680> both<00:05:48.180> of

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
theoretically we brought up are both of

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.400 
theoretically we brought up are both of
our<00:05:49.270> horse<00:05:49.450> artillery<00:05:49.690> to<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:49.990> center<00:05:50.230> of<00:05:50.290> the

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
our horse artillery to the center of the

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.650 
our horse artillery to the center of the
map<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:51.340> split<00:05:51.760> our<00:05:51.790> opponents<00:05:52.180> apart<00:05:52.420> but

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
map to split our opponents apart but

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.750 
map to split our opponents apart but
when<00:05:52.870> they<00:05:52.960> keep<00:05:53.230> trying<00:05:53.500> to<00:05:53.760> relocate

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
when they keep trying to relocate

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.640 
when they keep trying to relocate
together<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.690> makes<00:05:55.900> it<00:05:55.990> quite<00:05:56.140> hot<00:05:56.320> quite

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
together and makes it quite hot quite

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.340 
together and makes it quite hot quite
difficult<00:05:57.450> this<00:05:58.450> is<00:05:58.570> also<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.810> second<00:05:59.140> medal

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
difficult this is also the second medal

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.810 
difficult this is also the second medal
we<00:05:59.410> had<00:05:59.530> against<00:05:59.920> them<00:06:00.100> i'm<00:06:00.220> posting<00:06:00.550> this<00:06:00.580> one

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
we had against them i'm posting this one

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.760 
we had against them i'm posting this one
because<00:06:00.970> it<00:06:01.240> was<00:06:01.360> much<00:06:01.510> shorter<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:02.470> second

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
because it was much shorter the second

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.950 
because it was much shorter the second
one<00:06:02.860> went<00:06:03.010> for<00:06:03.130> very<00:06:03.340> long<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:03.820> i'm<00:06:04.780> quite

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
one went for very long and i'm quite

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.040 
one went for very long and i'm quite
reluctant<00:06:05.410> to<00:06:05.530> post<00:06:05.710> it<00:06:05.830> not<00:06:05.950> a<00:06:05.980> long<00:06:06.160> one<00:06:06.190> and

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
reluctant to post it not a long one and

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.510 
reluctant to post it not a long one and
here's<00:06:08.050> where<00:06:08.380> there's<00:06:08.590> some<00:06:08.770> anomalies<00:06:09.400> i

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
here's where there's some anomalies i

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.280 
here's where there's some anomalies i
believe<00:06:09.760> this<00:06:09.880> took<00:06:10.120> place<00:06:10.180> in<00:06:10.450> 1.3<00:06:10.780> and

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
believe this took place in 1.3 and

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.130 
believe this took place in 1.3 and
there's<00:06:12.040> been<00:06:12.160> two<00:06:12.310> patches<00:06:12.520> since<00:06:12.850> then<00:06:13.140> so

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
there's been two patches since then so

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.200 
there's been two patches since then so
some<00:06:14.590> things<00:06:14.620> happen<00:06:15.100> which<00:06:15.280> an<00:06:15.610> actual<00:06:16.030> game

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
some things happen which an actual game

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.180 
some things happen which an actual game
didn't<00:06:16.510> that<00:06:16.780> walking<00:06:17.650> line<00:06:17.770> imagery<00:06:18.100> was

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
didn't that walking line imagery was

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.440 
didn't that walking line imagery was
actually<00:06:18.460> routing<00:06:18.820> which<00:06:18.880> is<00:06:19.030> why<00:06:19.240> it's

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
actually routing which is why it's

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.820 
actually routing which is why it's
walking<00:06:19.780> but<00:06:20.170> it's<00:06:20.290> not<00:06:20.380> going<00:06:20.470> to<00:06:20.560> go<00:06:20.620> just

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
walking but it's not going to go just

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.220 
walking but it's not going to go just
yet<00:06:21.330> there's<00:06:22.330> not<00:06:22.390> much<00:06:22.510> line<00:06:22.720> imagery<00:06:22.990> left

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
yet there's not much line imagery left

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.890 
yet there's not much line imagery left
or<00:06:23.530> enemy<00:06:23.860> at<00:06:24.010> all<00:06:24.160> at<00:06:24.610> this<00:06:24.700> point<00:06:24.970> because<00:06:25.540> of

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
or enemy at all at this point because of

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.980 
or enemy at all at this point because of
a<00:06:26.230> couple<00:06:26.710> of<00:06:26.770> very<00:06:26.920> small<00:06:27.190> attacks<00:06:27.810> so<00:06:28.810> as<00:06:28.900> I

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
a couple of very small attacks so as I

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.090 
a couple of very small attacks so as I
said<00:06:29.050> before<00:06:29.170> it<00:06:29.590> doesn't<00:06:29.830> take<00:06:29.920> much<00:06:30.040> for

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
said before it doesn't take much for

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.040 
said before it doesn't take much for
these<00:06:30.490> battles<00:06:30.880> to<00:06:30.970> end<00:06:31.150> only<00:06:31.360> set<00:06:31.750> on<00:06:31.930> these

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
these battles to end only set on these

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.840 
these battles to end only set on these
settings<00:06:32.350> a<00:06:32.590> couple<00:06:33.220> of<00:06:33.310> mistakes<00:06:33.430> and<00:06:33.760> it's

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
settings a couple of mistakes and it's

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.660 
settings a couple of mistakes and it's
over<00:06:33.940> we<00:06:34.240> saw<00:06:34.420> Blancas<00:06:35.110> attack<00:06:35.710> on<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.550> light

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
over we saw Blancas attack on the light

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.540 
over we saw Blancas attack on the light
returns<00:06:36.820> that<00:06:37.240> pushed<00:06:37.450> them<00:06:37.570> away<00:06:38.070> at<00:06:39.070> you

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
returns that pushed them away at you

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.980 
returns that pushed them away at you
could<00:06:39.850> chase<00:06:40.210> the<00:06:40.360> light<00:06:40.510> goons<00:06:40.780> although

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
could chase the light goons although

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.600 
could chase the light goons although
that<00:06:41.110> wouldn't<00:06:41.290> be<00:06:41.440> a<00:06:41.470> big<00:06:41.650> payoff<00:06:41.860> so<00:06:42.400> we<00:06:42.490> just

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
that wouldn't be a big payoff so we just

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.860 
that wouldn't be a big payoff so we just
went<00:06:42.730> straight<00:06:42.850> for<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.090> line<00:06:43.300> disrupted

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
went straight for the line disrupted

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.860 
went straight for the line disrupted
their<00:06:44.050> his<00:06:44.890> entire<00:06:45.190> left<00:06:45.460> one<00:06:46.330> maintain<00:06:46.630> fire

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
their his entire left one maintain fire

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.700 
their his entire left one maintain fire
and<00:06:47.670> my<00:06:48.670> attack<00:06:48.940> was<00:06:49.240> mounted<00:06:49.930> with<00:06:50.170> an<00:06:50.410> attack

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
and my attack was mounted with an attack

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.630 
and my attack was mounted with an attack
on<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:50.950> lifeguard<00:06:51.510> with<00:06:52.510> my<00:06:52.660> logic<00:06:52.990> room<00:06:53.640> and
