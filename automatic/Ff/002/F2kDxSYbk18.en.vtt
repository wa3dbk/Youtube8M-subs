personal opinions on the sniper rifle is
it's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.379> good<00:00:40.590> sniper<00:00:40.800> rifle<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.730> are

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it's a very good sniper rifle if you are

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
it's a very good sniper rifle if you are
going<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.570> headshots<00:00:42.690> only<00:00:43.320> other<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.129> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
going for headshots only other than that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040

you<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> spray<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.270> pray<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you have to spray and pray just like the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.810 
you have to spray and pray just like the
dragon<00:00:46.410> off<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> watch<00:00:47.129> okay<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
dragon off or the watch okay in the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.490 
dragon off or the watch okay in the
previous<00:00:48.239> pass<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.719> Cod's<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> SVU<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.870> very

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
previous pass to Cod's the SVU is a very

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.069 
previous pass to Cod's the SVU is a very
accurate<00:00:53.329> sniper<00:00:54.329> rifle<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> head

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
accurate sniper rifle to the head

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
accurate sniper rifle to the head
because<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> hit<00:00:55.680> detection<00:00:55.949> box<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.489> much

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
because a hit detection box is much

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
because a hit detection box is much
larger<00:00:57.120> than<00:00:57.270> any<00:00:57.420> other<00:00:57.510> sniper<00:00:57.899> rifle<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
larger than any other sniper rifle and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
larger than any other sniper rifle and
you<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:58.980> multiple<00:00:59.280> attempts<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> head

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you have multiple attempts at the head

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
you have multiple attempts at the head
obviously<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:01.559> recoil<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.100> low<00:01:02.460> which

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
obviously the recoil is very low which

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.399 
obviously the recoil is very low which
makes<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.059> easy<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.019> straight

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
makes it very easy to have your straight

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.580 
makes it very easy to have your straight
shots<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.220> fire<00:01:05.460> rapidly<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> noscoping

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
shots and to fire rapidly the noscoping

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.090 
shots and to fire rapidly the noscoping
on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> gun<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.369> sporadic<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.240> no

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.350 

now<00:01:30.620> listen<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:31.130> my<00:01:31.280> personal<00:01:31.730> custom<00:01:32.120> class

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
now listen to my personal custom class

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.750 
now listen to my personal custom class
for<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.750> weapon<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.770> SVU<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.250> like<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.640> use

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
for this weapon the SVU I like to use

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.420 
for this weapon the SVU I like to use
the<00:01:34.880> CPU<00:01:35.090> because<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:35.990> prefer<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.890> less<00:01:37.040> way<00:01:37.400> a

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
the CPU because I prefer the less way a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.920 
the CPU because I prefer the less way a
long<00:01:37.790> distance<00:01:38.030> because<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.570> is<00:01:38.750> a

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
long distance because this is a

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.930 
long distance because this is a
hardscoping<00:01:39.680> gun<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.370> will<00:01:40.490> do<00:01:40.700> no

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
hardscoping gun you will do no

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.580 
hardscoping gun you will do no
quickscoping<00:01:41.630> x'<00:01:41.690> with<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.170> gun

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
quickscoping x' with this gun

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.219 
quickscoping x' with this gun
but<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.550> hardscoping<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.210> less<00:01:44.420> way<00:01:44.720> it'll<00:01:45.080> be

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
but the hardscoping so less way it'll be

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.260 
but the hardscoping so less way it'll be
easier<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.500> get<00:01:45.770> locked<00:01:46.369> on<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.760> your<00:01:46.880> headshot

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
easier to get locked on to your headshot

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.570 
easier to get locked on to your headshot
next<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:48.200> like<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.470> use<00:01:48.619> extend<00:01:48.979> mags<00:01:49.160> because

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
next I like to use extend mags because

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.580 
next I like to use extend mags because
of<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> low<00:01:50.150> recoil<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.810> could<00:01:51.110> spray<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.500> pray

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
of the low recoil I could spray and pray

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.910 
of the low recoil I could spray and pray
all<00:01:51.860> day<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.430> sweetly<00:01:53.000> my<00:01:53.330> motto<00:01:53.650> next<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.740> like

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
all day and sweetly my motto next I like
