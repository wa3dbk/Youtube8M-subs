00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.120
 numerous paths of every length and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.880
 difficulties run through the oasis on both 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.330
 the slopes of the mountains always indicated by 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.910
 wood panels this for example is the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.580
 path of the pink that winds along 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.400
 the harsh valsessera with a grandiose one 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.859
 view of the monte rosa massif e 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.380
 along which they are observed at the beginning 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.109
 of the summer the unusual blooms 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.970
 buttercups of clematis and gods 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.219
 rhododendrons on TV 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:39.390
 the latter is very widespread 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.550
 in the area sometimes along a path a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.500
 unexpected happy encounter 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.629
 here is a curious young chamois 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.969
 or a buzzard that with 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.640
 the unmistakable cry high in the sky 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.280
 continue his rounds or this one 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 baudelaire shrub on whose ears 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 flowering in the color of lavender it rests 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.810
 and flourish amazing number of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.240
 multicolored butterflies 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.150
 for us it is difficult instead to meet with 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.300
 the rare iridescent beetle become 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:17.650
 the dear olympic bus is the symbol of the oasis 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:17.650
 saddle we continue along the ridge 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.410
 here and there the small orchids of the Alps 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.560
 the last narcissism the most numerous 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.560
 blue gentians 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.940
 on the way here is the real escape or stone 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.700
 pierced a real window on the plain 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.570
 everywhere around our eyes 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.660
 it embraces vast panoramas we arrive 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.580
 in sight of the naga alpe arti meeting 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.680
 first to the small rustic buildings in 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 stone that once served as a shelter 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.850
 temporary for their pastors 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.520
 cattle are all juxtaposed of lunar 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.550
 the others and facing south to capture 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.040
 As the huts much sun as possible of 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.410
 village have been almost restored 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.360
 all and both in winter and in summer are 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.320
 destination of every type of excursion of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.150
 living room 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.370
 given their happy position 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.430
 in the enchanting valley of the arts denies 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.470
 which still serves as a mountain pasture and where 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.470
 we too linger a long time 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.820
 walking around all these paths 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.240
 we have often met so many 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.430
 directions and even a memorial stone yes 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.490
 refer to fra chick 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.640
 but who was he was contemporary of 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.760
 who gave him two triplets 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.730
 in the twenty-eighth song of hell and it was 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.350
 head of the apostolic sect 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.480
 they refused all authority 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.880
 religious preached the return to the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.920
 evangelical poverty in times when the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.100
 church pursued wealth and power 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.440
 he was then persecuted as a heretic and 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.840
 after a long march I arrive with a 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.720
 thousand of followers just on these 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.880
 mountains where he was captured as his 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.300
 faithful companion daisy in March of 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.140
 1300 7 later both came 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.140
 condemned to the stake 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.410
 on the one hand the valsesia with the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.180
 monte rosa massif 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.360
 on the other side the Biella with the wild 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.850
 dale of dall that from time to time 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.370
 you meet wooden panels that 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.980
 tell details of the vicissitudes of 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.870
 between dolcino which passed from here with the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.180
 very high snow 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.850
 instead we after a long crossing a 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.190
 half coast between the meadows we add 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.880
 finally , our goal is to reach our destination 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.250
 of the first day this the pasture more 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.380
 vast of everything from Biella and everywhere 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.380
 graze cows and donkey horses 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.330
 you know 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.670
 some of us will sleep in other huts 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:27.820
 in the tent and in the evening we also close a 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:30.910
 nice shower the next morning 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.830
 we continue the journey at the bottom of the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.960
 the valley of Lake appears very soon 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.010
 mix with the dam built 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.380
 always from zegna in the thirties the 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.300
 torrent sessera accompanies us by flowing 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.270
 further down most of the route 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.520
 and we play to refresh ourselves in his 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.560
 cold waters 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.380
 finally we arrive at the ancient bridge of the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.150
 bavaria or between dolcino which 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.830
 probably passed by here like us now 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.840
 crossed the bridge starts the last one 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.760
 long climb with a great heat 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.760
 despite the shadow of the beech forest 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.270
 finally we come to the destination the square of 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.639
 table where there was the capture of 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.460
 dolcino 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.189
 up there from that hill or already in between 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.129
 green the sanctuary of san bernardo la 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:27.300
 whose original structure dates back to immediately 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:29.729
 after the end of dolcino but these are 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.319
 distant stories 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.080
 most of the people who come 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.240
 up here maybe you care little about 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.680
 vicissitudes of the friar and his 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.749
 tragic end 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.819
 today we come here especially to enjoy 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:46.650
 of the nature of the flowers of the panoramas of the 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.550
 mountains 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.550
 of the good
