00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 there are really interesting topics like 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.799
 we always say technology 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.420
 has definitely come to change us 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.880
 life completely suddenly for 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.130
 well and suddenly for bad but 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.049
 you definitely knew that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
 Try a router in the house could 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.840
 be polluting your family like this is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 by that constant radiation that bounces the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.320
 router that although it is true what 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.630
 we need because we want to have wifi 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.820
 in the whole house we want to have internet 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.619
 wireless and attached to the boat or 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.240
 have to call because say close the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.710
 phone how does internet connect 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 the cable everything else but 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 definitely that radiation that emanates 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.469
 the routers are not good for those 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 we lived in the houses we went to look 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.200
 an expert to compose a little more 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.820
 about that topic and what are the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.510
 measures that we must take in this regard 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.969
 let's see 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.100
 today there are more radiations inside 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.289
 of the house office that on the street the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.350
 risks are many although it may not seem 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.420
 because it does not smell you do not notice it and its effects 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.879
 they are medium and long term and the sun is 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.089
 due to the appearance of many 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.100
 appliances and appliances 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.710
 electronic that many of them 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.909
 They work without cable easily entering 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.280
 to our lives 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.960
 Needless to say, change houses 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.479
 in the house that would be wrong but 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.789
 It is simply discovering the way 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.860
 how to put it together to make it 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.300
 valid for the human body and not from 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.679
 the examples of the phones is a 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.619
 most important detail no doubt what doubt 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:29.569
 but every time we are more technified and 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.789
 the human being moves away a little from that 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.190
 most primitive man who touched feet 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.220
 to the ground and that he built his houses 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.020
 after the healer of the tribe 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.240
 he said this is the right place and not what 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.280
 he said because if he said it because there is a 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.860
 energy that was good and to this day only 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.450
 we sign with the economy and we look for a 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.580
 nice place in a place to do 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.530
 our house and we do not realize that a 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.460
 the best is unhealthy that is not good 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.200
 for our health 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.350
 but who affects more often 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.640
 those radiations inside a house are 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.280
 really bad and especially for the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.830
 extreme ages of adults or 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.740
 children who are in growth because 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.530
 they alter the dynamics of the human body 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.810
 causing the immune system 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.200
 can weaken and the endocrine system 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.960
 may proliferate more or less according to 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.570
 hormones to the human body this is not 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.440
 well we have to be focused on a 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.160
 certain figure not and the pollutions 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.350
 electromagnetic than what we are 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.900
 speaking and we are referring the are not 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.640
 good for health we can get sick or 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.980
 start a really serious illness 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.800
 the devices that emit radiation 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.560
 Inside the house are wifi phones 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.200
 wireless and mobile phones 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.600
 laptop laser printer 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.270
 desktop smart tablets and 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.820
 of videogame console alarms and 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.920
 micro more when you talk to him about the wifi 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.930
 or of these cables that are made we leave the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.790
 window we will see some light cables that 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.790
 they are going like this electric or high 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.470
 This voltage is demostradÃ­simo and 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.830
 antennas that exists in the radius of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.420
 television and others provoke some fields 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.490
 electromagnetic in the body that does not 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.390
 they are compatible for them and they can 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.350
 and I always say that maybe they can 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.570
 influence 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.830
 I am not restrictive because the great 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.170
 difference is that in some cases 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.490
 occurs and in others not and we are still 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.170
 investigating why I think 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.930
 depends on the perception of each person 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.460
 we live a crazy life all then 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.590
 it can not be that every time we have 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.810
 less time to live life what 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.330
 we find it looks like with a rocket behind 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.220
 we are not finishing one thing that 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.260
 we started another one and we forgot 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390
 a little bit of living and caring that I 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.850
 lately this rocket also came from 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.830
 back but at least I know the 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.440
 existence that I have that time that 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.540
 I say good I will do this determined 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.130
 in this period but then at least I'm going 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.110
 to continue living as I have to live 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.090
 which is enjoying life if not the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.310
 you enjoy and not to live in a way is 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.680
 the beginning of the disease this class 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.900
 of equipment, equipment and machines are a 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.720
 risk from too close proximity to the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.910
 excess or too much exposure so 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.620
 It is advisable to make a measurement of 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.990
 housing and applied hygiene 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.299
 electrical installations and peripherals 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.299
 to avoid problems in the future
