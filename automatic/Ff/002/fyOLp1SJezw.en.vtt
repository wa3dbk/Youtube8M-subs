00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.250
 What 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.250
 Christmas Keychain 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:20.470
 Once upon a time there was a big church in a certain city of America 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:26.480
 Towering strange in church 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:35.900
 Has been suspended the fine gold was high when the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:44.130
 That the gold there was reportedly no section that only made on Christmas night 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:52.370
 However, no one has ever heard this bell ring 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:52.370
 As Christmas approaches, people in town look up and discuss 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:05.190
 I can hear the sound of the bell ringing this year 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 I have lived for 80 years but I have never heard of it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:15.610
 Anything but so old man's eagle is heard as a child 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.250
 It seems that it was a great tone 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:25.970
 How will that bell ring 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.970
 It is a story that if you give God a gift 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:39.720
 Well, there was a boy named Peter and a younger brother in a small village outside this town 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.490
 One day I told Pedro brother 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.770
 Christmas constant reinforcement 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.670
 But the bustling do Datte Sir 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.350
 Then my brother made eyes brighter and was equal 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.240
 Hmm 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.900

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.909
 Pedro promised with my brother 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:16.709
 According And of before Christmas that awaited 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.709
 Pedro Toto went to the city when he held hands firmly 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:30.670
 When we went to the entrance of the city, they found that a woman was falling 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.260
 I wonder what happened this guy won't move 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.550
 What shall I do with my brother 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.420
 If you leave it as it is , it will be a small voice 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.420
 Naa trouble 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:51.960
 There is no one around 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:55.870
 Pedro offered his brother his silver coin out of his pocket 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:02.270
 This silver coin is a chestnut to God 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:05.650
 I eh is allowed to go alone because help this person 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.860
 I go alone 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.190
 Even my brother might not have wanted to come 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.170
 it's alright 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:22.550
 Come on and see 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.550
 Went Ya entered in the city alone without at last how the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:35.880
 There were many people in the church 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:40.069
 Everybody is good at having a great gift for God 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.240
 A bright and sparkling gem 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.430
 Mountain- like gold coin 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:53.790
 Flower Representative Shaky 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:57.580
 Everyone wanted to give a great gift and to ring the bell 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:02.130
 But I will not make money 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.720
 I will ring the bell this year 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:10.210
 And to cherish the sin of the last king like even life 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.590
 Dedicated a crown of gold 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:19.070
 This will be a bell with this 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.070
 Everyone listened closely 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.650
 But the top of the tall tower remains calm and quiet 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:38.360
 What a the useless even in the crown of the king of gold 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:41.490
 I wonder if that bell will not last forever 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:47.870
 Yes it must be 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.870
 It is the time when people gave up and went home 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:07.440
 You may have heard a beautiful bell sound from your head 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:11.330
 That's it! 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:18.600
 Nante beautiful timbre What 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:24.650
 Even so, who is the one who made a gift to ring the bell 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.650
 The king and others looked back at once 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.140
 Then Peter's brother stood embarrassed there 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:40.460
 1 sheet of silver coins was entrusted from the back brother 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.460
 I just dedicated it to God 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:50.990
 My brother is after that 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:54.250
 That woman was raised to help your brother is Naa would be all right 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.250
 I thought 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:05.129
 Great gifts are not good because they are expensive 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:09.930
 Even if it is not a big deal 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:12.700
 It is good if the heart of the person giving the gift is clear 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.870
 Masu green toys 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.870
