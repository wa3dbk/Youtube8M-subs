so<00:03:52.380> you'll<00:03:53.380> have<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.800> fingering<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.690> you

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
so you'll have the fingering and you

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.870 
so you'll have the fingering and you
know<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.740> have<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.040> fingering<00:03:57.520> under<00:03:57.760> your

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
know you have you fingering under your
