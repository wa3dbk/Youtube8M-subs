00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.490
 Look, I'm going to say in this calculation these days. 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.350
 more or less over 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.600
 I think for decades it did not work 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.600
 I believe that around 20 thousand reais 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.349
 A little while with Paul is going to go 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.680
 Come on in. I'll take out Grandpa. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.070
 adding in my account does not leave home 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 has a tactic which is to expect that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 money he 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 add up to a quantity to make the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.829
 I'll transfer waiting for me 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
 I began to frequent the law by buying and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.870
 selling was not a necessity of 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 sell the pieces he had in the cabinet that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.550
 I do not want to know what to do, sister. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.280
 said today that our knees have 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.619
 now a place that is really cool because 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.049
 you can sell what's new that is 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.000
 old man that you do not use there I started to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.060
 put my things and gave a supercerto 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.250
 so sells selling sells 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 to get excited 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.560
 the first products I uploaded on 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.689
 knee and were very different this way 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.659
 because today is much faster there 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.180
 was liking application and we as a 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.890
 application was quiet without much 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.439
 that I only with the expectation of making a 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 photo with white background after trying the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.060
 data that we saw did not even get sick 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.009
 a mount so on the bottom of wood 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.409
 get to go to the beach several times to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 hit the purpose of morning by 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.509
 example is the time that I always 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.060
 photographing josÃ© couso now in the beginning 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.060
 not only was everything back true 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.890
 now just this glue congress 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.490
 I think it's important that the products they 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.280
 have a value is worth not only for the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:13.160
 historical but also a new product 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.560
 if it is not a new product since the idea 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.390
 is to have the money then also what I 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.489
 I received from the knee I'll leave it to 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.900
 buy the beautiful things did not need 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.610
 take a trip 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.730
 So this is money I have. 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.730
 taking reserved the thing only and future 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.800
 cool, we win more every year than I do 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.840
 My goodness, then I will not be able to 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.130
 take a trip with everything to do 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.050
 the other because everyone works together 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.769
 to explain did not even care that 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.510
 douglas is from there with awepa reliable 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.140
 in an environment that has more to do with 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.910
 with you will you sell more and will you 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.739
 also buy the way people 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.390
 communicates with you the way the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.700
 site communicates with customers 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.840
 This generated the entity's path with 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.180
 my clothes with myself why 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.549
 I spoke there 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.380
 logic is not perfect people 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.170
 begin to follow every time you 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.570
 puts the new one the person will be there and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.180
 You'll get it for him if he's there. 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.489
 in that day then my very tip is 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.579
 dedication sometimes has many 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.530
 questions that we are traveling or 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.920
 for work other than the time of 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.349
 answer then put in the description of the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.620
 apple product 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:38.099
 I'm an Indian, not even a baby step. 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.500
 I'll buy it then I'll get it, I liked it. 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.080
 from the beginning it was all right I never had 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.770
 problem I think today for me he 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.810
 It's part of my life, it 's a very 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.720
 different fun and their brains 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.060
 You are very cute, I think at the same time 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.280
 that there is an informality in the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.959
 communication and professionalism yes very 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.860
