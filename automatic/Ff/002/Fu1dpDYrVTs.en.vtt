00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello dear friends we are today with 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.240
 you talk about such kitchen knives 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.730
 which were provided for review 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.920
 Novosibirsk stores knives blade will 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.030
 these are knives 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.289
 the brand name is frost 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.359
 kitchen knives from the manufacturer 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.240
 look here so here you can see yes 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.580
 this is actually a Swedish company 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.680
 mura 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.439
 so their trademark under which is not 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.609
 produces exactly kitchen knives 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.769
 Honestly Background 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.790
 something like this 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:39.570
 once received a review knife 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.129
 companies murok neff loin me 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.540
 tried to do that job for 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.579
 which was just meant 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.910
 amazed at how cleverly he does it and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.070
 so I wanted to really look 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.629
 on 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.399
 it is kitchen knives specialized 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.530
 Well, this manufacturer should say 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 how they surprised me a little 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.370
 they were not a game at all than I thought 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.440
 honestly but let's probably by 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.850
 all in order on the subject of this one 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.290
 an example of this knife here we all see 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.020
 more detail the rest of the voids so 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.640
 briefly show because here like u 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.200
 most kitchen knives are their essence 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.430
 manufacturing from item to item 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.920
 especially that does not change here in the first place 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.420
 interesting here is made of rubber 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.500
 the handle that is, it is really straight 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.790
 rubber 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.290
 and it was necessary and fault on such sticking 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.759
 rubber 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.189
 also as is usually done on 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.979
 workers pressing mura that is like inside 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.810
 on the shank planted such plastic 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.180
 the base which is outside the sunset 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.909
 novelty letters warm and then pull 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 Uzam fasteners secured gum hand 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.570
 nice knife will not slip out then 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.369
 there is a similar solution exist on 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.170
 all sorts of professional exactly 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.710
 kitchen knives ie when to work 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710
 need a lot 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.910
 cook on a large number of people then 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.530
 there are professional chefs there big 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.970
 messes i.e. it is not an error 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 who are in the restaurant and cook and on those 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.930
 people who are willing to constantly big 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.990
 the volume of the same dishes from a similar 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.550
 knives designed for such tasks 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.970
 frankly, I wanted to see in this 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.140
 a knife 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.210
 and it was not that I expected 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.040
 Marine kitchen knives will also be 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.590
 midpoint to zero as reduced 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.350
 Well, they say you work ohotnichki 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.940
 pushkarsky knives but it was not there 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.280
 turned up here by pressing r 'us all 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.930
 traditionally quite that is quite 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 good neat carts 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.960
 amass of course very cool cut 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.150
 you won't say anything 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.140
 here we are we are dealing with you with kitchen 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.510
 knives so that they do not cut here 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.950
 but nevertheless, as if that's the point 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.819
 I was somewhat disappointed because 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.540
 honestly i thought i would get 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.459
 kitchen knives with this one 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.110
 incredible cutting properties which 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.630
 You can see there Marat knives such more 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.640
 Ordinary as it should be said that these 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.410
 knives cuts too great here to nothing 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.330
 you can't say this just accomplished it 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.300
 more traditional methods and not with 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.260
 empty to zero it usually happens that is 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.770
 in this respect, everything is fine such here 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.370
 polished from them in this case 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.900
 table poppy blades are always not indicated on 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.519
 how much do I understand that this is a sandwich 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.170
 all the same 1227 here well if it is not 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.190
 so I need to correct me in any 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.660
 case I put the link he 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.420
 tactical and technical characteristics 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.790
 But such knives here are grasping handles 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.590
 let's start like this 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.570
 show all other knives 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.800
 grips in this respect all 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.540
 nice i would say that pretty controversial 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.280
 in terms of the fireplace European knives 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.370
 Geometries are encountered i.e. this one 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.140
 Here's a knife. I may not even know how very 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.310
 short boss somehow very short already 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.810
 really that's how a knife that well 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.670
 let's say so intended for cutting 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.370
 some sort of vegetables 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.870
 stick knife and this one I don't know 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.850
 short shield enough for me this 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.000
 incomprehensible definition well how was it 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.380
 i don't understand maybe in the end i 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.209
 not a professional chef 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.799
 I hardly know the issue 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.440
 how would set these knives seem 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.900
 somewhat incomprehensible here such here 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.519
 there is more chef well yes this chef 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.260
 this traditional size is enough 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.090
 then performs bathing traditional 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.980
 woolen i have a similar knife from 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.359
 tramontina company professional 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.450
 series of professional series with anyone 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.970
 white plastic and these here mora in 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.140
 This respect is not worse and it is necessary 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.750
 say that of course these here 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.520
 rubber handles for people who us 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.830
 the utilitarian purpose of knives so more 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.080
 love they surely will certainly come by 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.840
 it tastes so well done big 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.460
 here let's say my spouse and I like 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.380
 at home we do not prepare any large volumes 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.240
 of course we prefer all products 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.400
 same knives with wooden handles here 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.040
 we are so weak and both have 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.500
 here the arms are good 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.200
 he so let's say my preferences are not 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.020
 fall but plus there is one more 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:06.910
 such it is such a huge boss I'm 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:08.500
 I think that 22 centimeter will start well 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.320
 that is, such here are huge enough 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.000
 apparatuses some of them give them away 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.740
 so oh when I will decompose so that you will be more 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.870
 less clear that here I have here 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.660
 in general, in principle, it was but nonetheless 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.450
 i will say so knives frost 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.190
 turned out to be weak in general enough for 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.560
 workmanship for some 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.200
 their internal content differ 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.040
 from most of these relatively 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.430
 inexpensive 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.170
 but the less produced by some 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.650
 famous manufacturers of kitchen 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.230
 knives 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.210
 That is, in the expensive series, you understand 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.460
 You can find all sorts of different delights 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.760
 on boats the rule is not expensive knives they 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.070
 just some good ones 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.260
 stainless steel is very thin 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.940
 compound 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.070
 how would a wonderful wood of these knives such 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.270
 impressive in china or rubber coated 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.740
 either plastic handles on 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.230
 professional earrings like ours 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.860
 here we do the same thing but for 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.080
 big fans of knives mura mura myths 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.940
 It seems to me that but somehow, at least 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.850
 take at least one knife into the kitchen 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.190
 I see production for just say so 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.080
 just to like yourself 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.180
 amuse with the fact that I have here and kitchen 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.830
 knives then live the same 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.740
 we manufacturer seems to me quite 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.840
 can be comfortable here but nonetheless 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.840
 of course 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.550
 some kind of something incredibly new in 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.199
 sensations from working with these knives 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.550
 you have normal kitchen knives there 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.979
 they knew the cheapest to 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.479
 then most likely you are most likely not 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.919
 I will at least have such 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.020
 impressions remained on in principle these 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.520
 knives and are relatively inexpensive then 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.889
 there is a price for them a mistake like them 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.690
 inexpensive professional kitchen 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.130
 a knife which is usually never change 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.110
 which time to cook them really 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.820
 so many have remained so 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.530
 impressions about these knives company frost 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.760
 on it that you were interested in a big 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.760
 thanks for watching bye
