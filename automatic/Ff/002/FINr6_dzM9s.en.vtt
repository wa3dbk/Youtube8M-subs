00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
there are two main reasons why when I

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.890 
there are two main reasons why when I
bought<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.949> nobody<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.820> YouTube<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.449> believe

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
bought this nobody on YouTube I believe

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680 
bought this nobody on YouTube I believe
has<00:00:31.769> ever<00:00:32.219> bought<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.090> these<00:00:33.270> things<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
has ever bought one of these things and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.950

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.729 
cover the cover is a beautiful
masterpiece<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.710> better

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
masterpiece I think it is way better

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.360 
masterpiece I think it is way better
than<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> on<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:01.140> 7<00:01:01.500> disc<00:01:01.710> set<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
than the on the 7 disc set that was just

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.770 
than the on the 7 disc set that was just
released<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.660> like

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
released and that that's just like

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
released and that that's just like
a-tryin<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.589> triangular<00:01:05.189> box<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
a-tryin a triangular box that's it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.190 
a-tryin a triangular box that's it
that's<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.869> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that's all that it is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
that's all that it is
this<00:01:07.530> covers<00:01:07.950> beautiful<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:08.850> if

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
this covers beautiful and I think if

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
this covers beautiful and I think if
they<00:01:09.299> would<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.570> released<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.710> 7<00:01:11.130> disc<00:01:11.310> set

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
they would have released that 7 disc set

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
they would have released that 7 disc set
when<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:11.970> something<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.080> would

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
when it's something like this I would

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
when it's something like this I would
have<00:01:13.439> definitely<00:01:13.710> wanted<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> buy<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.689> but

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
have definitely wanted to buy that but

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.740 
have definitely wanted to buy that but
um<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.340> other<00:01:17.460> reason<00:01:17.790> why<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> bought<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
um the other reason why I bought this is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.960 
um the other reason why I bought this is
because<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.500> thought<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.790> first

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
because I thought that the for the first

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.219 
because I thought that the for the first
few<00:01:21.210> films<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.780> there<00:01:21.930> were<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> be

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
few films that there were going to be

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
few films that there were going to be
