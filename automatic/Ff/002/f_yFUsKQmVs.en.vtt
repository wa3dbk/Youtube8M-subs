each<00:01:03.660> fold<00:01:04.049> here's<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> house<00:01:05.119> now<00:01:06.119> take<00:01:06.450> one

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
each fold here's the house now take one

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
each fold here's the house now take one
of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> center<00:01:07.439> folds<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> bottom<00:01:08.400> middle

of the center folds in the bottom middle

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.969 
of the center folds in the bottom middle
and<00:01:08.850> formed<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> triangle<00:01:09.630> inward<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and formed a triangle inward like this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.550 
and formed a triangle inward like this
to<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.400> same<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> second<00:01:13.260> corner

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
to there same with the second corner

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.990 
to there same with the second corner
anyway<00:01:15.290> open<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> triangle<00:01:17.100> fold<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.700> made

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
anyway open the triangle fold just made

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.510 
anyway open the triangle fold just made
and<00:01:18.450> stretch<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.990> toward<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> center<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> roof

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and stretch it toward the center of roof

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.899 
and stretch it toward the center of roof
of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.180> house<00:01:21.390> shake<00:01:21.869> open<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.159> second<00:01:23.640> fall

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of the house shake open the second fall

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.630 
of the house shake open the second fall
to<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.600> pinned<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> hold<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> back

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to and pinned to hold this is the back

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179 
to and pinned to hold this is the back
of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> butterfly<00:01:27.479> at<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.840> stage<00:01:28.290> fold<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
of the butterfly at this stage fold the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.179 
of the butterfly at this stage fold the
center<00:01:29.430> triangle<00:01:30.210> downwards<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.140> pin<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
center triangle downwards and pin it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.830 
center triangle downwards and pin it
would<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:32.610> better<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> matching

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
would be better to use the matching

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.770 
would be better to use the matching
color<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> complementing<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.150> made
