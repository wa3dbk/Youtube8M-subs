00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.140
 so interesting 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.230
 Today, the coalition of ordinary governments has ceased to exist 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.120
 Chairman prize money he left us some time ago 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.020
 the cows are no longer a policy or a government 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 everything started on the 4th 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.810
 the Locust appeared to us overrun 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.100
 we wanted to leave her with the hammer of the brand church 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.460
 our own cities 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.010
 kill millions of our people 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 Heynckes made it 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.170
 the survivors of the hammer blow the stranded 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.080
 I did not want to deal with a government that civilians have voiced 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.010
 would have 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.710
 us after 15 years of struggle 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.710
 like her even the 11th 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.659
 we sink the statistics as well as Lucas army on 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 be finally over 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.570
 we would just get a few refugees and found an island on the new one 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.790
 given 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 but you can not rebuild some things 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 then his pursued 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 Scientists out 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 the detained so long way 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.790
 our last hope is to leave the island and split up 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.710
 some want to live from the rest of the cities 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.710
 others want to go back to the mainland 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 with the help of a guard 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.109
 Dollars on 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.219
 for everyone 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:19.919
 aground
