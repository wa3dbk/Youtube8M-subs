00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.210
 hello everyone with you alexander birds 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.100
 channel author in the form of cancer by 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.870
 animations every make-of 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.449
 try a variety somehow a lot 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.000
 angle to show how he created it 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.530
 also did not become an exception and so behind 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.839
 me you see how the scene is built 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.809
 chromatid two side light sources 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.489
 and one now because she lights me 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.780
 the protagonist of a living person either 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.969
 the character is now like this 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.430
 mood we qualify hromakey 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.000
 but from this light source can 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.800
 get shadow on hromakey which 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.069
 undesirable because its difficult later 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.060
 remove therefore the task lighting which 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.030
 highlights hromakey 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.490
 it is firstly illuminated so that you can 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.590
 about the case and secondly bring down the shadow 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.720
 get from our character on chromakey 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.429
 This is the second point I wanted 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.649
 tell it how it was created 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.229
 smooth movements of the character inside are darker 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.659
 a tripod with such a disgust 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.729
 disgust and ball construction which 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.520
 allows you to rotate it in fact as you like 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.460
 and see the muscles for example we remove 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.710
 the forward movement of the boat took off before 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.229
 of the moment then passed into the second Finn 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.020
 invert and time and got a roller in 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.939
 the reverse side hereby we created 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.679
 full cycle of character movement 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.530
 which further we can 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.399
 hook and so let's see us 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.399
 same as it was 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.930
 and she 10 and 1 became clear basic 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.209
 the moment of creation of this video and this 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.519
 meetings you liked the description of the video 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.769
 can find detailed lessons on chromatin 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.769
 King and all that we are also here 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.480
 by the way we are already 100 people so 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.019
 join us with you was 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.430
 Alexander 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.430
