you just isolate just that area or do I
need<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:19.990> something<00:02:20.290> different<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.740> them

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
well if you have a section of piping

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.540 
well if you have a section of piping
that's<00:02:23.290> getting<00:02:23.590> clogged<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:24.040> little<00:02:24.310> pressure

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
that's getting clogged a little pressure

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.510 
that's getting clogged a little pressure
or<00:02:24.850> rust<00:02:25.120> or<00:02:25.630> leaking<00:02:26.200> more<00:02:26.860> than<00:02:27.010> likely<00:02:27.220> your

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
or rust or leaking more than likely your

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.890 
or rust or leaking more than likely your
whole<00:02:27.700> network<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.210> going<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.630> problems

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
whole network is going to have problems

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.480 
whole network is going to have problems
someday<00:02:29.320> it's<00:02:29.530> kind<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.190> look<00:02:30.370> at

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
someday it's kind of like if you look at

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.760 
someday it's kind of like if you look at
your<00:02:30.670> roof<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.660> get<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> leak<00:02:32.080> at<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.470> side<00:02:32.740> of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
your roof you get a leak at one side of

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.170 
your roof you get a leak at one side of
the<00:02:32.950> house<00:02:33.130> or<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.550> other<00:02:33.640> side<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> house

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the house or the other side of the house

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.240 
the house or the other side of the house
eventually<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.260> whole<00:02:35.440> roof<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:35.890> going<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.130> go

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
eventually the whole roof is going to go

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.280 
eventually the whole roof is going to go
on<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.970> don't<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.240> patch<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:37.990> part

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
on you you don't just patch one part

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.170 
on you you don't just patch one part
sure<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.860> could<00:02:39.130> but<00:02:39.670> eventually<00:02:39.970> you're

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
sure you could but eventually you're

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.640 
sure you could but eventually you're
going<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.360> replace<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.900> roof<00:02:41.020> same<00:02:41.440> thing

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
going to replace the roof same thing

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.470 
going to replace the roof same thing
with<00:02:41.740> your<00:02:41.890> water<00:02:42.100> pipes<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.670> best<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.450> just

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
have the whole system done at once then

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.070
