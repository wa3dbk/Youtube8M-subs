opted to go with soul this was really

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
opted to go with soul this was really
effective<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.650> finer<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.159> he<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:20.580> able<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
effective from a finer on he was able to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.070 
effective from a finer on he was able to
play<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.509> much<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.810> entire

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
play so pretty much do the entire

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
play so pretty much do the entire
tournament<00:01:22.380> he<00:01:22.619> only<00:01:22.740> had<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> switch<00:01:23.250> versus

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.929 
tournament he only had to switch versus
marlinpie<00:01:24.080> finally<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.229> his<00:01:25.350> Chi<00:01:25.790> which<00:01:26.790> was

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
marlinpie finally to his Chi which was

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.399 
marlinpie finally to his Chi which was
looking<00:01:27.180> even<00:01:27.420> more<00:01:27.450> strong<00:01:27.810> than<00:01:27.840> soul

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
looking even more strong than soul

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.100 
looking even more strong than soul
worker<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.150> my<00:01:30.270> opinion<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.780> actually

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
worker so in my opinion this is actually

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
worker so in my opinion this is actually
a<00:01:31.140> good<00:01:31.290> matchup<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.680> josh<00:01:32.009> we'll<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.119> he

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
a good matchup for josh we'll see if he

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.429 
a good matchup for josh we'll see if he
