first episode of my series on growing
habanero<00:00:07.980> peppers<00:00:08.719> so<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.860> seed

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
habanero peppers so this is just a seed

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.820 
habanero peppers so this is just a seed
packet<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.610> bought<00:00:11.910> at<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.750> local<00:00:13.139> store<00:00:13.440> it

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
packet that I bought at a local store it

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.430 
packet that I bought at a local store it
was<00:00:13.950> cheap<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:15.299> decided<00:00:15.690> why<00:00:15.929> not<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.379> know

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
was cheap and I decided why not you know

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.609 
was cheap and I decided why not you know
I<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:17.010> lots<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.580> pots<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.000> soil<00:00:18.300> why<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.380> try

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I have lots of pots and soil why not try

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.260 
I have lots of pots and soil why not try
to<00:00:19.650> grow<00:00:19.830> peppers<00:00:20.039> I've<00:00:20.550> seen<00:00:20.880> other<00:00:21.210> people

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
to grow peppers I've seen other people

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.109 
to grow peppers I've seen other people
grow<00:00:21.630> peppers<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> foliage<00:00:23.820> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
grow peppers and I like the foliage it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.259 
grow peppers and I like the foliage it
looks<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.750> pretty<00:00:25.410> easy<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.769> maintain

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
looks like it's pretty easy to maintain

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.929 
looks like it's pretty easy to maintain
so<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.539> should<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.930> relatively

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
so this should be a relatively

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.700 
so this should be a relatively
trouble-free<00:00:29.939> assignment<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.349> then<00:00:31.470> again

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
trouble-free assignment but then again

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.389 
trouble-free assignment but then again
every<00:00:31.920> time<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> say<00:00:32.790> things<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.380> things

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
every time I say things like that things

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
every time I say things like that things
manage<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> find<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.149> wrong<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
manage to find a way to go wrong so

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.720 
manage to find a way to go wrong so
these<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> seeds<00:00:37.829> look<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.250> they

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
these are what the seeds look like they

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
these are what the seeds look like they
look<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.270> typical<00:00:39.649> pepper<00:00:40.649> seeds<00:00:41.040> from

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
look like your typical pepper seeds from

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.680 
look like your typical pepper seeds from
inside<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> non<00:00:42.930> hot<00:00:43.230> peppers<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.539> also<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
inside the non hot peppers and also the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.470 
inside the non hot peppers and also the
hot<00:00:45.870> peppers<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.620> they're<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.219> wrinkly<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
hot peppers so they're all wrinkly and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
hot peppers so they're all wrinkly and
desiccated<00:00:49.170> looking<00:00:49.649> that's<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> way

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
desiccated looking that's just the way

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.569 
desiccated looking that's just the way
they<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.620> macro<00:00:52.980> footage<00:00:53.399> up

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
they are and this is a macro footage up

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.860 
they are and this is a macro footage up
close<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.270> table

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
close on my table

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
close on my table
this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> way<00:00:55.920> too<00:00:55.980> many<00:00:56.219> seeds<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.120> these

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this is way too many seeds I think these

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.990 
this is way too many seeds I think these
grow<00:00:57.600> basically<00:00:58.320> kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.430> large<00:00:59.699> weeds

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
grow basically kind of like large weeds

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.569 
grow basically kind of like large weeds
or<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.469> even<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.859> size<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> small

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
or you know not even the size of a small

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.609 
or you know not even the size of a small
bush<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:04.850> I'll<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.090> take<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.869> five<00:01:07.260> seeds

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
bush so I'll just take like five seeds

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.820 
bush so I'll just take like five seeds
these<00:01:08.070> five<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.880> randomly<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> I'll

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
these five you know randomly and I'll

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
these five you know randomly and I'll
plant<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.000> happens<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.450> don't

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
plant them and see what happens I don't

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
plant them and see what happens I don't
have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> very<00:01:12.900> large<00:01:13.110> pot<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.430> I'll<00:01:14.549> place<00:01:14.729> one

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
have a very large pot so I'll place one

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.620 
have a very large pot so I'll place one
in<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> center<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:16.590> say<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> bury<00:01:17.580> 1/4<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> an

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
in the center they say to bury 1/4 of an

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.890 
in the center they say to bury 1/4 of an
inch<00:01:18.810> deep<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.070> inch<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.900> 2.54

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
inch deep so one inch is 2.54

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.320 
inch deep so one inch is 2.54
centimeters<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:24.080> 1/4<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.290> would<00:01:25.799> be

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
centimeters and 1/4 of that would be

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.050 
centimeters and 1/4 of that would be
let's<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:29.960> 0.63<00:01:30.960> 5<00:01:31.909> centimeters<00:01:32.909> or

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
let's see 0.63 5 centimeters or

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.410 
let's see 0.63 5 centimeters or
something<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:35.060> yeah<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.210> just

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
something like that so yeah I'm just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.069 
something like that so yeah I'm just
going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> bury<00:01:37.470> them<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.659> kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.780> square

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
going to bury them in a kind of a square

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.630 
going to bury them in a kind of a square
pattern<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.130> center<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
pattern with one in the center and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.289 
pattern with one in the center and
that's<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.640> gentle<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
that's it you know just be gentle of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.850 
that's it you know just be gentle of
course<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> distance<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.229> completely

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
course the distance is completely

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.280 
course the distance is completely
estimated<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> could<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.420> off<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
estimated so it could be off but that

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
estimated so it could be off but that
doesn't<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.799> matter<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.340> my<00:01:50.460> experience

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
doesn't really matter in my experience

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.310 
doesn't really matter in my experience
they're<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.659> giving<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> general

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
they're just giving you general

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.889 
they're just giving you general
guidelines<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.100> there's<00:01:53.310> no<00:01:53.520> way<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.939> farmer

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
guidelines and there's no way a farmer

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.810 
guidelines and there's no way a farmer
or<00:01:55.170> anyone<00:01:55.649> else<00:01:55.829> could<00:01:56.070> plant<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
or anyone else could plant these on a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.469 
or anyone else could plant these on a
large<00:01:57.060> scale<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.990> exactly<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.799> same<00:01:59.040> depth

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
large scale at exactly the same depth

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.499 
large scale at exactly the same depth
each<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.520> then<00:02:02.520> I'll<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.360> actually

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
each so then I'll do it this is actually

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.649 
each so then I'll do it this is actually
a<00:02:04.079> pot<00:02:04.500> from<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.189> failed<00:02:06.090> root<00:02:06.450> growing

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
a pot from a failed root growing

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.100 
a pot from a failed root growing
experiment<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.680> American<00:02:08.280> ginseng<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.149> those

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
experiment for American ginseng so those

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
experiment for American ginseng so those
American<00:02:10.590> ginseng<00:02:10.920> roots<00:02:11.190> were<00:02:11.430> exposed<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
American ginseng roots were exposed to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.030 
American ginseng roots were exposed to
moisture<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.690> added<00:02:13.140> water<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.590> water

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
moisture I added water in the water

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.429 
moisture I added water in the water
from<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.310> bottom<00:02:14.780> everything<00:02:15.780> got<00:02:15.930> wet<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
from the bottom everything got wet and

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.729 
from the bottom everything got wet and
over<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:18.299> know<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> few<00:02:18.689> weeks<00:02:18.810> time<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.590> all

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
over you know a few weeks time they all

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.979 
over you know a few weeks time they all
just<00:02:20.069> rotted<00:02:20.670> away<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.939> that's<00:02:21.569> kind<00:02:21.959> of

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
just rotted away so that's kind of

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.869 
just rotted away so that's kind of
irrelevant<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:23.189> experiment<00:02:23.640> because

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
irrelevant to this experiment because

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.300 
irrelevant to this experiment because
they're<00:02:24.090> never<00:02:24.239> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> come<00:02:24.599> back<00:02:24.840> but

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
they're never going to come back but

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.399 
they're never going to come back but
they're<00:02:26.310> basically<00:02:27.170> functioning<00:02:28.170> as

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
they're basically functioning as

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.099 
they're basically functioning as
additional<00:02:28.950> fertilizer<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.989> I'm<00:02:31.079> just

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
additional fertilizer so here I'm just

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.770 
additional fertilizer so here I'm just
smoothing<00:02:32.569> with<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.599> camera<00:02:34.079> airbrush<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.780> you

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
smoothing with a camera airbrush and you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.960 
smoothing with a camera airbrush and you
know<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.109> I<00:02:37.140> put<00:02:37.409> sand<00:02:37.739> over<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.609> I<00:02:38.640> just

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
know that I put sand over what I just

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.619 
know that I put sand over what I just
buried<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:41.819> know<00:02:41.909> nothing<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.359> grow<00:02:42.510> in

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
buried and you know nothing can grow in

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.599 
buried and you know nothing can grow in
there<00:02:42.810> sand<00:02:43.409> doesn't<00:02:43.709> really<00:02:43.829> retain<00:02:44.400> all

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
there sand doesn't really retain all

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.940 
there sand doesn't really retain all
that<00:02:44.909> much<00:02:45.120> moisture<00:02:45.599> but<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.170> helps<00:02:46.530> prevent

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
that much moisture but it helps prevent

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.020 
that much moisture but it helps prevent
a<00:02:47.280> drying<00:02:48.120> out<00:02:48.299> of<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.659> topsoil<00:02:49.170> surface<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
a drying out of the topsoil surface and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.839 
a drying out of the topsoil surface and
all<00:02:51.209> water<00:02:51.659> with<00:02:51.989> some<00:02:52.349> 0.5<00:02:53.250> hydrogen

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
all water with some 0.5 hydrogen

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.759 
all water with some 0.5 hydrogen
peroxide<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.689> I've<00:02:54.900> been<00:02:55.200> doing<00:02:55.409> with<00:02:55.560> many

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
peroxide like I've been doing with many

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.849 
peroxide like I've been doing with many
of<00:02:55.889> my<00:02:56.010> other<00:02:56.159> plants<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.900> has<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> watering

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
of my other plants this has a watering

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.259 
of my other plants this has a watering
tray<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.189> bottom<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.909> it's<00:03:00.060> better<00:03:00.180> to

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
tray at the bottom so it's better to

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.240 
tray at the bottom so it's better to
water<00:03:00.599> from<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> bottom<00:03:01.260> your<00:03:01.889> water<00:03:02.129> from

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
water from the bottom your water from

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.819 
water from the bottom your water from
the<00:03:02.430> top<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.840> causes<00:03:04.169> a<00:03:04.200> massive<00:03:04.650> upheaval

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
the top that causes a massive upheaval

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.179 
the top that causes a massive upheaval
so<00:03:05.819> this<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.269> just<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.659> typical<00:03:07.189> cheapo

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
so this is just a typical cheapo

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.520 
so this is just a typical cheapo
hydrogen<00:03:08.939> peroxide<00:03:09.389> solution<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.989> get<00:03:10.290> from

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
hydrogen peroxide solution I get from

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.599 
hydrogen peroxide solution I get from
Target<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.879> know<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.650> 3%<00:03:13.650> solution<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.579> I

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
Target you know it's a 3% solution so I

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.610 
Target you know it's a 3% solution so I
dilute<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:16.069> with<00:03:17.069> one<00:03:17.340> part<00:03:17.609> of<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.909> into

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
dilute that with one part of this into

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.839 
dilute that with one part of this into
five<00:03:19.620> parts<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:20.069> water<00:03:20.340> or<00:03:21.229> yeah<00:03:22.229> so<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.579> have

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
five parts of water or yeah so I have

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.930 
five parts of water or yeah so I have
water<00:03:24.629> distilled<00:03:25.290> water<00:03:25.409> mixed<00:03:25.889> in<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.819> know

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
water distilled water mixed in you know

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.610 
water distilled water mixed in you know
up<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.329> 20<00:03:27.629> mark<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.139> I<00:03:28.199> fill<00:03:28.409> it<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
up to the 20 mark and I fill it to the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.430 
up to the 20 mark and I fill it to the
24<00:03:29.129> mark<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:29.669> hydrogen<00:03:30.180> peroxide<00:03:30.299> 3%<00:03:30.780> it

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
24 mark with hydrogen peroxide 3% it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.759 
24 mark with hydrogen peroxide 3% it
gives<00:03:31.650> me<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.829> 0.5%<00:03:32.780> then<00:03:33.780> I'm<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.049> water

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
gives me a 0.5% then I'm going to water

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.000 
gives me a 0.5% then I'm going to water
in<00:03:34.979> the<00:03:35.069> bottom<00:03:35.370> until<00:03:36.239> it's<00:03:36.389> full<00:03:36.629> and<00:03:37.010> repeat

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
in the bottom until it's full and repeat

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.789 
in the bottom until it's full and repeat
this<00:03:38.159> process<00:03:38.370> as<00:03:38.819> needed<00:03:39.269> until<00:03:39.449> water<00:03:40.349> stops

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
this process as needed until water stops

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.979 
this process as needed until water stops
absorbing<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:42.449> I<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.659> just<00:03:42.810> leave<00:03:42.930> it

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
absorbing and then I can just leave it

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.479 
absorbing and then I can just leave it
alone<00:03:43.260> for<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.530> really<00:03:43.769> long<00:03:43.949> time<00:03:44.220> because

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
alone for a really long time because

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.629 
alone for a really long time because
it'll<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:46.560> soil<00:03:46.829> will<00:03:46.919> be<00:03:46.949> saturated<00:03:47.609> with

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
it'll the soil will be saturated with

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.800 
it'll the soil will be saturated with
moisture<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:48.690> day<00:03:48.900> nine<00:03:49.139> I<00:03:49.940> got<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.269> so

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
moisture so on day nine I got this so

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.479 
moisture so on day nine I got this so
it's<00:03:52.019> my<00:03:52.199> first<00:03:52.530> seedling<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:55.069> so<00:03:56.069> far<00:03:56.340> it's

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
it's my first seedling and so far it's

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.409 
it's my first seedling and so far it's
just<00:03:56.549> like<00:03:56.819> many<00:03:57.030> other<00:03:57.209> plants<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:58.829> leaves

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
just like many other plants the leaves

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.759 
just like many other plants the leaves
cotyledons<00:04:00.419> are<00:04:00.689> a<00:04:00.870> little<00:04:01.079> different<00:04:01.560> from

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
cotyledons are a little different from

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.140 
cotyledons are a little different from
what<00:04:02.129> I'm<00:04:02.310> used<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.609> seeing<00:04:02.819> with<00:04:03.000> other

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
what I'm used to seeing with other

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.640 
what I'm used to seeing with other
plants<00:04:03.599> on<00:04:03.859> day<00:04:04.859> 11<00:04:05.720> here's<00:04:06.720> my<00:04:06.870> setup<00:04:07.169> it's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
plants on day 11 here's my setup it's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.619 
plants on day 11 here's my setup it's
elevated<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.280> little<00:04:08.489> bit<00:04:08.639> because<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.239> have

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
elevated a little bit because I have

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.199 
elevated a little bit because I have
this<00:04:09.900> clamp<00:04:10.229> clamp<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.859> I<00:04:11.639> put<00:04:11.849> my<00:04:11.970> most

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
this clamp clamp and I put my most

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.119 
this clamp clamp and I put my most
powerful<00:04:12.449> light<00:04:12.989> bulb<00:04:13.259> minute<00:04:13.560> that's<00:04:13.859> giving

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
powerful light bulb minute that's giving

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.890 
powerful light bulb minute that's giving
off<00:04:14.659> 1680<00:04:15.659> lumens<00:04:16.259> and<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.449> seedling

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
off 1680 lumens and this is the seedling

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.800 
off 1680 lumens and this is the seedling
that<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.109> showed<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.680> on<00:04:19.949> day<00:04:20.220> 9<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:21.449> foliage

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
that I showed you on day 9 the foliage

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.969 
that I showed you on day 9 the foliage
is<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.260> very<00:04:22.860> healthy<00:04:23.310> green<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.860> know<00:04:25.950> I

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
is a very healthy green and you know I

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.800 
is a very healthy green and you know I
don't<00:04:26.250> know<00:04:26.310> if<00:04:26.430> these<00:04:26.580> light<00:04:26.820> levels<00:04:27.210> will<00:04:27.389> be

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
don't know if these light levels will be

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.530 
don't know if these light levels will be
off<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:28.200> these<00:04:28.860> pepper<00:04:29.100> plants<00:04:29.639> but<00:04:29.940> I'll

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
off for these pepper plants but I'll

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.240 
off for these pepper plants but I'll
monitor<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.139> situation<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.740> can<00:04:31.889> always<00:04:32.010> take

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
monitor the situation I can always take

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.300 
monitor the situation I can always take
this<00:04:32.550> pot<00:04:32.940> outside<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> second

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
this pot outside and this is a second

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.000 
this pot outside and this is a second
seedling<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.510> there's<00:04:36.900> two<00:04:37.230> different<00:04:37.260> colors

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
seedling so there's two different colors

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.400 
seedling so there's two different colors
of<00:04:38.310> peppers<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.360> packaging<00:04:39.840> red<00:04:40.200> and

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
of peppers on the packaging red and

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.830 
of peppers on the packaging red and
yellow<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:41.520> planted<00:04:41.910> five<00:04:42.150> seeds<00:04:42.480> because

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
yellow and I planted five seeds because

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.400 
yellow and I planted five seeds because
I<00:04:42.870> want<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.320> have<00:04:43.730> at<00:04:44.730> least<00:04:44.910> one<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.450> each<00:04:45.720> so

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
I want to have at least one of each so

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.890 
I want to have at least one of each so
the<00:04:46.650> other<00:04:46.800> three<00:04:47.010> seeds<00:04:47.370> haven't<00:04:48.210> germinated

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
the other three seeds haven't germinated

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.500 
the other three seeds haven't germinated
yet<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.550> I'll<00:04:50.550> have<00:04:50.730> to<00:04:50.880> decide<00:04:51.210> whether<00:04:51.389> I'm

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
yet and I'll have to decide whether I'm

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.260 
yet and I'll have to decide whether I'm
going<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.720> plant<00:04:51.960> new<00:04:52.139> seeds<00:04:52.169> or<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:53.820> let

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
going to plant new seeds or just let

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
going to plant new seeds or just let
these<00:04:54.419> two<00:04:54.600> grow<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.280> Gamble
