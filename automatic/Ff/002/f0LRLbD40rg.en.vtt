gonna do a demo but while I do a demo
I'm<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> tell<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:41.309> more

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
I'm just going to tell you a bit more

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.700 
I'm just going to tell you a bit more
about<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.329> right<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> guess<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.559> can

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
about this right now so I guess you can

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.000 
about this right now so I guess you can
judge<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.100> yourself<00:00:44.719> now<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.079> reason<00:00:46.559> it's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
judge for yourself now the reason it's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
judge for yourself now the reason it's
cool<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.030> pass<00:00:48.680> is<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:51.050> it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
cool but one pass is because it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.910 
cool but one pass is because it's
supposed<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:55.140> pass<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
supposed to when you go do one pass on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
supposed to when you go do one pass on
your<00:00:56.070> hair<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:57.180> supposed<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.050> stick

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
your hair it's supposed to make it stick

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
your hair it's supposed to make it stick
straight<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
straight in just that one go so you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.479 
straight in just that one go so you
don't<00:01:00.300> need<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> keep<00:01:00.690> repeating<00:01:01.460> over<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
don't need to keep repeating over and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.030 
don't need to keep repeating over and
over<00:01:02.640> again<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
over again but the thing is I think that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.649 
over again but the thing is I think that
would<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> same<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> hell<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.510> lot

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
would be the same with a hell of a lot

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.240 
would be the same with a hell of a lot
of<00:01:06.780> straightener<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.100> go

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
of straightener so I think if you go

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.050 
of straightener so I think if you go
slowly<00:01:08.580> enough<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.260> passes<00:01:11.250> pretty

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
slowly enough then one passes pretty

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.749 
slowly enough then one passes pretty
much<00:01:12.299> enough<00:01:15.500> yeah<00:01:16.500> by<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:16.979> way<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.310> doesn't

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
much enough yeah by the way this doesn't

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
much enough yeah by the way this doesn't
come<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> bought<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.840> separately<00:01:19.470> it's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
come with it I bought it separately it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.880 
come with it I bought it separately it's
just<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.509> heat<00:01:21.509> protecting<00:01:22.080> case<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.680> case

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
just like a heat protecting case in case

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.109 
just like a heat protecting case in case
you<00:01:23.040> need<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> pack<00:01:23.460> two<00:01:23.610> straightener<00:01:24.000> in

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you need to pack two straightener in

heat<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.300> you<00:01:57.690> please<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.460> always<00:01:59.460> stick<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.270> 205

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
heat as you please I always stick to 205

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.300 
heat as you please I always stick to 205
degrees<00:02:01.730> Celsius<00:02:03.080> now<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.440> strain<00:02:05.100> in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
degrees Celsius now I don't strain in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.670 
degrees Celsius now I don't strain in
the<00:02:05.400> conventional<00:02:05.910> way<00:02:06.120> because<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.720> lazy<00:02:07.260> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the conventional way because I'm lazy so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.350 
the conventional way because I'm lazy so
I<00:02:08.610> don't<00:02:09.570> go<00:02:09.869> slow<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.670> they're<00:02:11.880> pretty<00:02:12.060> fast

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
I don't go slow so they're pretty fast

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.630 
I don't go slow so they're pretty fast
and<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:12.810> tug<00:02:13.350> on<00:02:13.500> my<00:02:13.680> hair<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.490> do

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and I just tug on my hair and so I do

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.850 
and I just tug on my hair and so I do
have<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.180> go<00:02:15.300> over<00:02:15.540> my<00:02:15.570> head<00:02:15.720> more<00:02:16.350> than<00:02:16.620> once

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
have to go over my head more than once

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.100 
have to go over my head more than once
but<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.880> think<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.510> straight<00:02:18.840> now<00:02:18.870> is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
but I think that this straight now is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.280 
but I think that this straight now is
pretty<00:02:19.830> fast<00:02:20.480> given<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.600> fact<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.230> don't

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
pretty fast given the fact that I don't

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.200 
pretty fast given the fact that I don't
even<00:02:22.920> use<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.490> proper<00:02:23.790> way<00:02:24.710> this<00:02:25.710> has<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
even use it the proper way this has I

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.390 
even use it the proper way this has I
don't<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.080> see<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.280> it's

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
don't know if you can see it but it's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.920 
don't know if you can see it but it's
got<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:31.640> line<00:02:32.640> down<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.450> there's<00:02:33.750> another

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
got like line down there there's another

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.590 
got like line down there there's another
line<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.470> other<00:02:34.710> side<00:02:35.270> not<00:02:36.270> sure<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.480> you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
line on the other side not sure if you

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.260 
line on the other side not sure if you
can<00:02:36.720> see<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.110> they<00:02:37.590> actually<00:02:37.670> silicon<00:02:38.670> speed

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
can see it they actually silicon speed

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.190 
can see it they actually silicon speed
strips<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:41.190> actually<00:02:41.460> allows<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.450> faster

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
strips so it actually allows for faster

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.140 
strips so it actually allows for faster
straightening<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.040> increased<00:02:44.520> shine<00:02:44.880> in

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
straightening and increased shine in

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.560 
straightening and increased shine in
your<00:02:45.270> hair

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
your hair

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.710 
your hair
um<00:02:46.470> another<00:02:47.100> thing<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:48.650> nano<00:02:49.650> ceramic

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
um another thing is it's nano ceramic

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.020 
um another thing is it's nano ceramic
straightening<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:53.160> means<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.790> less

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
straightening so it means that it's less

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.720 
straightening so it means that it's less
time<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.380> machine<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.980> heat<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.550> it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
time for this machine to heat up so it's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.620 
time for this machine to heat up so it's
pretty<00:02:57.060> quick<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.170> heat<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.880> finally

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
pretty quick like to heat up and finally

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.570 
pretty quick like to heat up and finally
like<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:00.990> got<00:03:01.170> negative<00:03:01.680> ions<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.280> far

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
like it's got negative ions and far

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.740 
like it's got negative ions and far
infrared<00:03:03.180> energy<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:05.100> gives<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.610> hair<00:03:06.360> a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
infrared energy so it gives your hair a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.390 
infrared energy so it gives your hair a
really<00:03:07.110> smooth<00:03:07.440> look<00:03:09.800> so<00:03:10.800> I'm<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.310> showing

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
really smooth look so I'm just showing

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.850 
really smooth look so I'm just showing
me<00:03:11.790> now<00:03:12.030> how<00:03:12.540> fast<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.320> get<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.739> pretty

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
me now how fast I can get it pretty

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.180 
me now how fast I can get it pretty
straight<00:03:14.340> just<00:03:14.880> doing<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.360> dodgy<00:03:15.570> way<00:03:16.190> by

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
straight just doing it the dodgy way by

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.660 
straight just doing it the dodgy way by
covering<00:03:17.989> reviews<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.260> people<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.739> all<00:03:20.400> this

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
covering reviews and people and all this

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
covering reviews and people and all this
right<00:03:20.940> now<00:03:21.120> because<00:03:21.300> it's<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.250> fast<00:03:24.950> like

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
right now because it's just so fast like

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.110 
right now because it's just so fast like
you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.280> already<00:03:26.459> start<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
you can already start to see the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.850 
you can already start to see the
difference<00:03:27.480> between<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.050> two<00:03:28.200> sides<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
difference between the two sides and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.820 
difference between the two sides and
that<00:03:29.640> was<00:03:29.820> just<00:03:30.030> me<00:03:30.209> being<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.840> lazy<00:03:31.290> if

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
that was just me being really lazy if

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.160 
that was just me being really lazy if
you're<00:03:32.100> having<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.489> go<00:03:32.640> over<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.239> number<00:03:33.959> of

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
you're having to go over it a number of

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:46.449 
you're having to go over it a number of
times

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.979 

getting<00:03:47.459> them<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.640> here<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:48.450> don't<00:03:48.569> usually

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
getting them to here we don't usually

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:57.619 
getting them to here we don't usually
get<00:03:49.410> some<00:03:49.680> kinks<00:03:55.879> if<00:03:56.879> you<00:03:57.030> want<00:03:57.239> I'll<00:03:57.420> through

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
get some kinks if you want I'll through

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.460 
get some kinks if you want I'll through
the<00:03:57.810> section<00:03:58.170> really<00:03:58.560> slow<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.489> see

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
the section really slow so you can see

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.360 
the section really slow so you can see
have<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> one<00:04:01.890> pass<00:04:02.569> part<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:03.780> with<00:04:04.230> title<00:04:05.220> of

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
have a one pass part of with title of

have a one pass part of with title of
this<00:04:05.549> bio<00:04:06.330> ionic<00:04:07.019> straightener<00:04:07.500> works<00:04:07.830> so

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
this bio ionic straightener works so

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.270 
this bio ionic straightener works so
I'll<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.910> do<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.360> section<00:04:10.290> really<00:04:10.860> slow<00:04:11.099> on

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
I'll just do a section really slow on

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.970 
I'll just do a section really slow on
this<00:04:11.459> side<00:04:11.700> after<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.690> just<00:04:12.870> not<00:04:13.440> be<00:04:13.620> spring

this side after I just not be spring
Galilei<00:04:14.580> is<00:04:14.849> it's<00:04:15.060> annoying<00:04:15.540> me

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.010

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
I don't just go ahead and use the

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:36.830 
I don't just go ahead and use the
straightener

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
straightener

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.950 
straightener
it's<00:04:37.349> best<00:04:37.590> practice<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:38.069> always<00:04:38.490> use<00:04:38.849> a<00:04:39.120> heat

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
it's best practice to always use a heat

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.050 
it's best practice to always use a heat
