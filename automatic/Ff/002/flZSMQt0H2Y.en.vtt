00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.050 
it because it's a novel but it was
written<00:04:11.540> with<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.610> Aristotelian<00:04:13.610> principle

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
written with that Aristotelian principle

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.150 
written with that Aristotelian principle
that<00:04:14.180> every<00:04:14.480> scene<00:04:14.690> should<00:04:14.990> advance<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.039> plot

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
that every scene should advance the plot

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.560 
that every scene should advance the plot
and<00:04:16.459> reveal<00:04:16.700> something<00:04:16.910> about<00:04:17.030> character

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
and reveal something about character

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.250 
and reveal something about character
always<00:04:18.140> advance<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.590> portrait<00:04:18.890> or<00:04:18.979> something

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
always advance the portrait or something

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.380 
always advance the portrait or something
character<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.800> so<00:04:19.950> there<00:04:20.460> are<00:04:20.550> not<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:21.030> hope

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
character and so there are not I hope

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.150 
character and so there are not I hope
very<00:04:21.690> many<00:04:22.140> moments<00:04:22.320> where<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.740> think<00:04:22.770> at<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
very many moments where you think at the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.620 
very many moments where you think at the
end<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.790> don't<00:04:24.120> even<00:04:24.180> think<00:04:24.330> more<00:04:24.540> about

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
end of it I don't even think more about

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.930 
end of it I don't even think more about
what's<00:04:25.380> happening<00:04:25.830> what<00:04:26.220> has<00:04:26.400> happened<00:04:26.790> or

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
what's happening what has happened or

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.910 
what's happening what has happened or
who's<00:04:27.210> talking<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.600> me<00:04:27.630> than<00:04:28.230> I<00:04:28.320> did<00:04:28.470> before<00:04:28.560> I

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
who's talking to me than I did before I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.680 
who's talking to me than I did before I
hope<00:04:29.130> right<00:04:29.700> I<00:04:29.760> don't<00:04:30.000> think<00:04:30.210> there<00:04:30.510> are<00:04:30.540> any

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
hope right I don't think there are any

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.300 
hope right I don't think there are any
extraneous<00:04:31.260> words<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.890> think<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.100> use<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
extraneous words I think you use the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
extraneous words I think you use the
right<00:04:32.610> amount<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:32.970> words

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
right amount of words

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.420 
right amount of words
yeah<00:04:33.450> actually<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:34.290> wished<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:35.100> few<00:04:35.250> more

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430
