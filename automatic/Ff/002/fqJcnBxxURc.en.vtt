00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.320
 very cross 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.590
 Welcome to the live here I bring you 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.940
 another tutorial this time is about how 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.260
 get easy diamond and how 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.820
 find it and well many of you 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.949
 you asked me so here 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.710
 I bring that we're going to need a peak one 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.599
 shovel some torches and tnt is worth so 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.699
 well I will choose a random site for 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.259
 look for it and I'll tell you the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.720
 more or less guidelines that I follow I'm worth 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.669
 I'm going to take for example this site and what 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.829
 what I'm going to do is chop down on 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.750
 straight line is worth chopping down on 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.340
 Straight line is not a good option anymore 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.920
 I do not like it personally but for 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.360
 find easy diamonds is very good 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.890
 but it's very complicated because you can 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 die you can fall on lava or 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.880
 an impressive and good fall we have 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.790
 come to what I was looking for 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.200
 that it was a natural grotto worth what 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.120
 usually done in these natural grottos 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.360
 when I find them quickly it is 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.490
 fill in everything from tnt so we can 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 make a pretty big hole and from 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.900
 there we have a much better view of the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.430
 area in which we have entered and from there 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.810
 to be able to choose where we are going to continue 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.479
 digging vale to find these 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.909
 diamonds I'm going to take advantage of this water that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.280
 is here to try to go down without 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.090
 kill me but good if we could not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.070
 some stairs so good as os 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.260
 I say the diamond was deep 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.869
 big so what I'm going to do is go 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.000
 going down through the natural grotto to areas 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.470
 that there is lava that we say that the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 areas where there is lava is easier 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.220
 find the diamond so good I'll 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 to continue taking advantage of these areas of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.420
 water to find the diamond and good 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.549
 look look is already directly already has 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710
 found a diamond zone there 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.180
 you see those natural grottoes that's why you 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.880
 I say I like those caves so much 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.320
 natural that I always tell you and good 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.590
 there we have already found directly 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.090
 diamond that is why this one for this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.259
 already we could find more 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.690
 so now let's continue exploring 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.570
 equally and good as you see we have already 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.270
 found diamond it seems that it is not no 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.480
 it's a lot of diamond I think 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.940
 that there are only three blocks 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.670
 or if I think they are if they are just three 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.290
 blocks but well there you see the way 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.330
 and here's a lot of amount of 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.100
 materials as you see I will go starting 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.210
 to light with torches there is red stone 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.190
 to juiÃ  and there would be some crazy a block of 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.200
 lapis lazuli out there and good as you see is 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.230
 area of large lava areas 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.520
 depth and as I say you have to 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.840
 follow the natural caves are 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.640
 perfect and are the ones that are going to give us 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.800
 these materials most of the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.260
 times if we do not have to open holes 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.060
 with the tnt as I tell you and good to wait 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.590
 wait a moment because I think that 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.500
 I just found another area with 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.100
 Diamond there you see as I say the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.930
 depth that you have to look at is to the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.190
 height where there is more lava and above all 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.470
 through these natural caves the caves 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.020
 natural are the best and good 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.850
 do this little tutorial kim ya me what 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.370
 he asked a lot of people because there are people who 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.890
 on certain maps and there has not 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.570
 found has not found diamonds and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.490
 Well what I'm going to do is get closer 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.280
 towards that area of diamonds to see the 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.350
 how much we have of diamond in this 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.760
 case so good I'm putting stones 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.690
 As you can see, you have to be very careful 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.090
 with the lava 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.180
 so I warn you because if we do not 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.280
 we can kill in a false step like that 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.900
 Well, I'm just going to carefully 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.140
 see how many more diamonds and good to give 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.260
 a few more tips 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.180
 and good as I say you have to first 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.980
 step that I would always explain to 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.110
 down and find a natural route like 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.480
 I say to you there you see that there in the background 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.430
 there is even more diamond and as I say 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.380
 a natural grotto and try to make a 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.060
 gap with tnt to make a good 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.850
 opening and we can see is what I say 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.190
 the entrances of the natural caves and 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.780
 good as you see practically in a 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.270
 minute to find a diamond 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.190
 I also tell you that it is random and there 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.110
 have to be lucky equally but with 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.930
 this little trick of tnt we can make some 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.670
 pretty fast digs see a lot 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.160
 hollow and find most of 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.140
 natural fruits that we can so 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.690
 well there you see that there seems to be 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.459
 pretty block pretty enough 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.890
 blocks in this part that I found 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.110
 there on the other side it seems that only 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.880
 there were three but on this site it seems that 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.950
 there is more I would say that at least there are eight or 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.069
 nine let's say 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.610
 I would not say there are about 8 because it is 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.310
 look at it here there is no more so I would have 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.620
 like about 8 blocks and well there you see the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.459
 so easy way to get it 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.650
 simply go opening holes 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.360
 with TNT and to find those caves 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.910
 natural and go down to a depth in 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.919
 that we can observe the lava as 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.350
 you see and well I just wanted to bring you 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.169
 this tutorial in plan for people who 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.370
 since it starts new and good and that you 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.960
 it costs a little more has seen the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.030
 quantity of materials of all 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.400
 types that are in this grotto as I say 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.960
 is is the best and good brought this 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400
 tutorial especially for new people 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.290
 who has been asking me about this 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.820
 topic so well I hope you have 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.650
 liked to share the video with you 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.910
 friends who will thank you and good 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.280
 soon we will see more videos 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.680
 tutorials so nothing like it if you 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.700
 liked and su for more videos and nothing a 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.700
 I welcome you and see you later
