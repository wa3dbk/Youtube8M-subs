00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
okay right here we have a TK a thermo

compressors<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> Left<00:00:10.110> they<00:00:10.800> are<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
compressors on the Left they are the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
compressors on the Left they are the
engine<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.090> obviously<00:00:14.150> unlike<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> other<00:00:15.420> one

the<00:00:15.960> batteries<00:00:16.379> actually<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the batteries actually on the right and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.420 
the batteries actually on the right and
it's<00:00:18.210> very<00:00:18.300> exposed<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.250> get

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
it's very exposed right so you can get

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.620 
it's very exposed right so you can get
to<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:20.730> easily

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
to it very easily

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.099 
to it very easily
we've<00:00:22.470> got<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.279> oil<00:00:24.180> filter<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.869> there

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
we've got the the oil filter right there

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109 
we've got the the oil filter right there
the<00:00:25.350> fuel<00:00:25.650> filter<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:25.980> actually<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> top

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the fuel filter is actually on the top

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.859 
the fuel filter is actually on the top
up<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:28.820> there's<00:00:29.820> no<00:00:30.060> real<00:00:30.359> point<00:00:30.689> in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
up there there's no real point in

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.200 
up there there's no real point in
opening<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.180> ahead

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
opening this up and so we can go ahead

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.440 
opening this up and so we can go ahead
and<00:00:36.540> close<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.200> oh<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.370> dipstick<00:00:38.790> Don<00:00:39.149> these

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and close this oh the dipstick Don these

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
and close this oh the dipstick Don these
are<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:40.110> bit<00:00:40.320> different<00:00:40.559> dipstick<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
are a little bit different dipstick is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.569 
are a little bit different dipstick is
right<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:41.940> built<00:00:42.149> into<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> motor<00:00:43.579> all

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
right here it's built into the motor all

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.900 
right here it's built into the motor all
right<00:00:44.850> yes<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:46.399> here<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
right yes and then here we have the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
right yes and then here we have the
controls<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> contest<00:00:50.809> start<00:00:51.809> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
controls we have a contest start and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
controls we have a contest start and
stop<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.890> means<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> reaper<00:00:53.640> will<00:00:53.789> start

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
stop which means the reaper will start

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
stop which means the reaper will start
and<00:00:54.239> turn<00:00:54.329> off<00:00:54.510> by<00:00:54.690> itself<00:00:54.890> we<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and turn off by itself we have a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
and turn off by itself we have a
continuous<00:00:56.789> where<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.510> shut<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
continuous where it will not shut off a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.549 
continuous where it will not shut off a
manual<00:00:58.530> defrost<00:00:58.850> which<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.059> used<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
manual defrost which is used you know to

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.210 
manual defrost which is used you know to
defrost<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.699> case<00:01:02.969> there's<00:01:03.180> any<00:01:03.739> any<00:01:04.739> ice

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
defrost the in case there's any any ice

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.300 
defrost the in case there's any any ice
buildup<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.659> start<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
buildup we can start it up here but on

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.070 
buildup we can start it up here but on
these<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.210> start<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.659> stop<00:01:09.840> right

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
these if it's in start and stop right

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.570 
these if it's in start and stop right
here<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.500> start<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.890> stop<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> try<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
here you see start and stop and I try to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.110 
here you see start and stop and I try to
start<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.180 

but<00:01:19.120> just<00:01:19.480> like<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.660> other<00:01:19.810> one<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.440> won't<00:01:20.890> it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
but just like the other one it won't it

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.480 
but just like the other one it won't it
won't<00:01:21.400> keep<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.910> temperature<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:23.740> so

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
won't keep that temperature and also so

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.770 
won't keep that temperature and also so
let's<00:01:24.670> say<00:01:24.850> we<00:01:25.000> start<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.420> up

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
let's say we start it up

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.110 
let's say we start it up
you<00:01:26.260> have<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.530> preheat<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.850> hear<00:01:28.030> that

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
you have to preheat it you hear that

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.390 
you have to preheat it you hear that
noise<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.690> then<00:01:29.500> in<00:01:29.710> order<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.980> change<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
noise and then in order to change the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.830 
noise and then in order to change the
temperature<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.120> would<00:01:31.240> just<00:01:31.480> do<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.630> from

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
temperature you would just do it from

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.310 
temperature you would just do it from
here

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
here

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.100 
here
down<00:01:32.770> down<00:01:33.040> you<00:01:33.370> would<00:01:33.490> enter<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:34.840> want<00:01:35.050> to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
down down you would enter if you want to

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.840 
down down you would enter if you want to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
see a code on top clear the code right

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.370 
see a code on top clear the code right
here<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.320> go<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:43.240> order<00:01:43.480> to<00:01:43.540> do<00:01:43.810> a

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
here there we go and in order to do a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.300 
here there we go and in order to do a
pre-trip<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:46.180> would<00:01:46.330> actually<00:01:46.930> turn<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.310> turn

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
pre-trip you would actually turn on turn

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.050 
pre-trip you would actually turn on turn
on<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.730> unit<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:50.530> just<00:01:50.830> hold<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.610> TK

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
on the unit and then just hold the TK

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.970 
on the unit and then just hold the TK
button<00:01:52.420> right<00:01:52.570> here<00:01:52.600> usually<00:01:53.590> people<00:01:53.890> don't

know about that and here you can get

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.040 
know about that and here you can get

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
your hours your oil pressure your water

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.110 
your hours your oil pressure your water
temperature<00:01:59.380> your<00:01:59.980> amps<00:02:00.520> all<00:02:00.730> that<00:02:00.910> good

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
temperature your amps all that good

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.820 
temperature your amps all that good
stuff<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.730> a<00:02:03.760> tour<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.480> nes<00:02:05.110> b<00:02:05.410> unit

stuff so that is a tour of a nes b unit

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.450 
stuff so that is a tour of a nes b unit
well<00:02:06.100> as<00:02:06.370> long<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.060> it's<00:02:07.390> less<00:02:07.660> than<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.460> 190
