Lego<00:00:16.049> desert<00:00:16.619> eagle<00:00:17.040> blowback<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:21.380> looking

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
Lego desert eagle blowback so looking

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.179 
Lego desert eagle blowback so looking
triggered<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.550> actual<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:25.189> functions

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
triggered and that actual the functions

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.990 
triggered and that actual the functions
the<00:00:26.720> blowback<00:00:27.720> system<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> trigger<00:00:29.759> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the blowback system so the trigger is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
the blowback system so the trigger is
connected<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:32.300> these<00:00:33.300> hold<00:00:34.079> big<00:00:34.950> long

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
connected to a these hold big long

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.460 
connected to a these hold big long
pieces<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.059> then<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:37.170> pull<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.380> trigger

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
pieces and then you pull the trigger

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.400 
pieces and then you pull the trigger
back<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.399> pulls<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.720> rubber<00:00:39.899> band<00:00:40.200> which

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
back it pulls on the rubber band which

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.500 
back it pulls on the rubber band which
is<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> top<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
is up on the top and and in in the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.050 
is up on the top and and in in the
inside<00:00:45.930> ones<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.650> then<00:00:46.830> keep<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.820> down

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
inside ones and then keep it up and down

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.510 
inside ones and then keep it up and down
and<00:00:48.390> then<00:00:49.130> so<00:00:50.130> that's<00:00:50.880> it<00:00:51.120> here's<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.600> site

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
and then so that's it here's the site

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.840 
and then so that's it here's the site
might<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> hard<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.450> I<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:56.160> didn't<00:00:56.700> get

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and then let me pull the trigger oh and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.830 
and then let me pull the trigger oh and
it<00:02:07.890> needs<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.159> be<00:02:08.220> inside<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.119> gun<00:02:09.450> because

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
it needs to be inside the gun because

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710 
it needs to be inside the gun because
otherwise<00:02:10.259> it'll<00:02:10.530> flap<00:02:11.519> around<00:02:11.700> inside<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
otherwise it'll flap around inside and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.070 
otherwise it'll flap around inside and
out

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
out

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.979 
out
so<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.580> needs<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> be<00:02:14.879> covered<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.569> it

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
so and it needs to be covered up so it

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.589 
so and it needs to be covered up so it
can't<00:02:16.230> go<00:02:16.379> off<00:02:16.560> either<00:02:17.299> that's<00:02:18.299> why<00:02:18.450> this

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
can't go off either that's why this

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.310 
can't go off either that's why this
covers<00:02:19.049> on
