00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
so here's what I got so far I've got

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.020 
so here's what I got so far I've got
this<00:00:05.279> tea<00:00:05.549> put<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:06.500> which<00:00:07.500> brings<00:00:08.250> cold<00:00:08.670> water

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
this tea put in which brings cold water

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.030 
this tea put in which brings cold water
to<00:00:09.300> my<00:00:09.420> mixing<00:00:09.870> valve<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.620> can<00:00:10.800> mix

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
to my mixing valve so that I can mix

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.390 
to my mixing valve so that I can mix
this<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.790> hot<00:00:12.150> water<00:00:12.480> coming<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.110> down<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this this hot water coming in down to a

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.420 
this this hot water coming in down to a
radiant<00:00:15.059> floor<00:00:15.509> temperature<00:00:16.039> 125<00:00:17.039> degrees

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
radiant floor temperature 125 degrees

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.580 
radiant floor temperature 125 degrees
these<00:00:18.359> zones<00:00:18.840> are<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.890> radiant<00:00:20.340> floor<00:00:20.640> zones

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
these zones are my radiant floor zones

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.380 
these zones are my radiant floor zones
this<00:00:22.590> hot<00:00:22.859> water<00:00:23.130> here<00:00:23.580> will<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.880> coming<00:00:24.240> from

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
this hot water here will be coming from

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.290 
this hot water here will be coming from
the<00:00:24.539> boiler<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.140> I'll<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> zone<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:27.000> for

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the boiler and I'll have a zone here for

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.870 
the boiler and I'll have a zone here for
my<00:00:27.420> Modine<00:00:27.869> heaters<00:00:28.380> which<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.400> haven't<00:00:29.699> showed

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
my Modine heaters which I haven't showed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.970 
my Modine heaters which I haven't showed
you<00:00:30.000> yet

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
you yet

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.319 
you yet
that'll<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.099> full<00:00:32.309> temperature<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.969> boiler

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that'll be full temperature of boiler

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.920 
that'll be full temperature of boiler
water<00:00:33.450> high<00:00:33.989> 160<00:00:34.800> hundred<00:00:35.040> 70<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> I'll<00:00:36.750> get

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
water high 160 hundred 70 so I'll get

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
water high 160 hundred 70 so I'll get
that<00:00:36.960> put<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.559> got<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.460> slowly<00:00:39.030> building

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that put in got this I'm slowly building

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
that put in got this I'm slowly building
my<00:00:39.600> way<00:00:39.750> back<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.290> boiler<00:00:40.649> once<00:00:40.890> I've<00:00:41.040> got

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
my way back to the boiler once I've got

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.500 
my way back to the boiler once I've got
everything<00:00:41.399> exactly<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
everything exactly where I want it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.139 
everything exactly where I want it
Oh<00:00:42.540> solder<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:46.940> once<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> got

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
Oh solder it down I do that once you got

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.190 
Oh solder it down I do that once you got
to<00:00:48.239> put<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.480> back<00:00:48.629> together

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to put it all back together

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.600 
to put it all back together
I<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.649> solder<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:51.590> yeah<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.280> here's<00:00:53.460> where

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
I will solder it so yeah so here's where

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.939 
I will solder it so yeah so here's where
I<00:00:53.670> am<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.329> mixing<00:00:54.750> valve<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.199> I've<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.649> my<00:00:55.770> hot

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
I am the mixing valve in I've got my hot

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.260 
I am the mixing valve in I've got my hot
water<00:00:56.129> header<00:00:56.489> done<00:00:56.989> cap<00:00:58.070> drain<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.460> don't

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
water header done cap drain I don't

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.189 
water header done cap drain I don't
really<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.690> how<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.109> ends<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.829> bought<00:01:02.489> these

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
really like how this ends I bought these

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.760 
really like how this ends I bought these
integral<00:01:04.339> valves<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> drains<00:01:06.170> very<00:01:07.170> fancy

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
integral valves and drains very fancy

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.969 
integral valves and drains very fancy
very<00:01:08.610> expensive<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:10.409> trying<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> do

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
very expensive I was trying to do

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
very expensive I was trying to do
something<00:01:11.280> different<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.390> really

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
something different but I don't really

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.870 
something different but I don't really
like<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.020> either<00:01:13.490> basically<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> want

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
like this either basically what you want

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
like this either basically what you want
to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> leave<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.350> header

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
to do is you want to leave your header

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.960 
to do is you want to leave your header
so<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.689> expand<00:01:19.259> later<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.520> don't

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so that you can expand later and I don't

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
so that you can expand later and I don't
really<00:01:21.240> feel<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.600> I've<00:01:21.900> done<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.619> mean<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
really feel like I've done that I mean I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
really feel like I've done that I mean I
would<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> heat<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.780> pull<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
would have to heat that up and pull this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.740 
would have to heat that up and pull this
thing<00:01:25.380> off<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.130> add<00:01:26.310> another<00:01:26.549> T<00:01:26.880> which

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
thing off and then add another T which

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.740 
thing off and then add another T which
is<00:01:27.780> doable<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.700> whole<00:01:30.000> thing<00:01:30.420> it's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
is doable but with this whole thing it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.030 
is doable but with this whole thing it's
just<00:01:32.810> what<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> should<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.229> cap<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.740> right

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
just what I should do just cap it right

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.560 
just what I should do just cap it right
there<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.460> done<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.119> figure<00:01:36.450> I'll

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
there and be done but I figure I'll

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.080 
there and be done but I figure I'll
throw<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> drain<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.470> way<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
throw a drain and that way I can you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
throw a drain and that way I can you
know<00:01:39.210> drain<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.810> money<00:01:40.079> too<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.590> guess

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
know drain this money too I guess

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.910 
know drain this money too I guess
I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:42.740> looking<00:01:43.740> somebody<00:01:44.360> positive

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
I don't know looking somebody positive

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.460 
I don't know looking somebody positive
anyway<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:48.060> put<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.750> thumb<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.110> here

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
anyway so I'm gonna put a thumb on here

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.700 
anyway so I'm gonna put a thumb on here
and<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:50.100> valve<00:01:51.259> my<00:01:52.280> flange<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.259> then<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.290> should

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and my valve my flange and then I should

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.990 
and my valve my flange and then I should
be<00:01:55.740> ready<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> solder<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:57.509> I'm<00:01:57.689> gonna<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
be ready to solder so I'm gonna do that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.039 
be ready to solder so I'm gonna do that
okay<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:01.670> everything<00:02:02.670> done<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
okay so I have everything done to a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.359 
okay so I have everything done to a
valve<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.780> stops<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.350> valve<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.920> stops

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
valve so that stops a valve that stops

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.040 
valve so that stops a valve that stops
involved

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
involved

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.740 
involved
that's<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.940> leads<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.990> things<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.180> have

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
that's that leads to things so I have

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.640 
that's that leads to things so I have
the<00:02:15.490> opportunity<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:17.090> ability<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.810> pressure

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the opportunity the ability to pressure

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.340 
the opportunity the ability to pressure
test<00:02:19.030> why<00:02:20.030> should<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.240> call<00:02:20.390> about<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.170> not

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
test why should I call about I have not

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.280 
test why should I call about I have not
soldered<00:02:21.680> any<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.190> these<00:02:22.310> yet<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.140> had<00:02:24.140> that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
soldered any of these yet I had that

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.430 
soldered any of these yet I had that
left<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.650> do<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:27.080> our<00:02:27.200> going<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.380> do

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
left to do so that's our going to do

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.790 
left to do so that's our going to do
next

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
next

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.480 
next
solder<00:02:28.700> all<00:02:28.880> these<00:02:29.060> joints<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:30.130> then<00:02:31.130> put

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
solder all these joints and then put

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.090 
solder all these joints and then put
some<00:02:31.640> air<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.360> with<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.710> little<00:02:33.710> battle

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
some air to it with this little battle

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.230 
some air to it with this little battle
buddy<00:02:34.250> put<00:02:34.430> on<00:02:38.350> anyway<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.850> I'm<00:02:40.850> gonna<00:02:40.970> solve

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
buddy put on anyway so I'm gonna solve

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.460 
buddy put on anyway so I'm gonna solve
them<00:02:41.420> all<00:02:41.510> pressure<00:02:41.780> that's<00:02:41.990> it<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.350> then<00:02:42.410> I

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
them all pressure that's it and then I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.580 
them all pressure that's it and then I
need<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.830> go<00:02:42.950> reassemble<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.610> house<00:02:44.560> then<00:02:45.560> I

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
need to go reassemble the house then I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.870 
need to go reassemble the house then I
can<00:02:45.860> hook<00:02:45.950> these<00:02:46.190> two<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.190> then<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.430> can<00:02:49.700> see

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
can hook these two up and then I can see

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.630 
can hook these two up and then I can see
if<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.060> get<00:02:50.240> heat<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.600> house<00:02:51.910> that's<00:02:52.910> right

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
if I get heat to the house that's right

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.990 
if I get heat to the house that's right
check<00:02:55.640> this<00:02:55.880> out<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:57.410> there's<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.650> leak<00:02:58.000> right

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
check this out so there's a leak right

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
check this out so there's a leak right
here<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:01.250> could<00:03:02.000> barely<00:03:02.240> hear<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.710> I<00:03:03.830> can

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
here so I could barely hear it and I can

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.280 
here so I could barely hear it and I can
almost<00:03:04.190> not<00:03:04.490> hear<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.820> now<00:03:05.000> but<00:03:05.870> if<00:03:05.960> you<00:03:06.110> go

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
almost not hear it now but if you go

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.380 
almost not hear it now but if you go
around<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.490> you<00:03:07.580> put<00:03:07.610> your<00:03:07.880> hands<00:03:08.180> around

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
around and you put your hands around

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:17.370 
around and you put your hands around
each<00:03:08.720> joint<00:03:10.600> here<00:03:11.600> that

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.560 

you<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.130> hear<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> leak<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:22.330> want<00:03:22.510> to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
you can hear a leak so I just want to

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.760 
you can hear a leak so I just want to
round<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.810> put<00:03:22.960> my<00:03:23.050> hand<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.350> every<00:03:23.530> other

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
round and put my hand on every other

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.430 
round and put my hand on every other
joint<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.120> only<00:03:28.270> leak<00:03:28.510> now

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
joint and this is the only leak now

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.510 
joint and this is the only leak now
what's<00:03:29.590> interesting<00:03:29.740> is<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.190> don't<00:03:30.400> even

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
what's interesting is that I don't even

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.640 
what's interesting is that I don't even
remember<00:03:30.700> soldering<00:03:31.360> this<00:03:31.570> one<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:34.500> when<00:03:35.500> it's

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
remember soldering this one so when it's

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.910 
remember soldering this one so when it's
weakened<00:03:37.770> okay<00:03:38.770> so<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:40.530> have<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.710> all<00:03:41.860> soldered

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
weakened okay so I have it all soldered

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.270 
weakened okay so I have it all soldered
everything<00:03:45.570> put<00:03:46.570> everything<00:03:46.750> back<00:03:46.930> together

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
everything put everything back together

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.780 
everything put everything back together
and<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:49.060> put<00:03:49.950> see<00:03:50.950> what<00:03:51.160> I'm<00:03:51.250> at<00:03:51.400> ah<00:03:53.610> six<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.760> a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
and I put see what I'm at ah six and a

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.610 
and I put see what I'm at ah six and a
half<00:03:54.850> seven<00:03:55.320> on<00:03:56.320> T<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:56.830> seven<00:03:57.250> pounds<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.820> air

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
half seven on T so seven pounds of air

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.240 
half seven on T so seven pounds of air
in<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.740> system<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.190> don't<00:04:00.250> hear<00:04:01.590> any<00:04:02.590> leaks

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.860 

generally<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.370> can<00:04:06.550> right<00:04:07.000> away<00:04:07.030> here<00:04:08.850> so

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
generally you can right away here so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.720 
generally you can right away here so
question<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.130> will<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.250> hold<00:04:12.960> seven<00:04:13.960> pounds

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
question is will it hold seven pounds

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.680 
question is will it hold seven pounds
over<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.760> day<00:04:16.030> well<00:04:16.390> I'm<00:04:16.930> gonna<00:04:17.200> find<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:18.690> base

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
over a day well I'm gonna find a base

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.900 
over a day well I'm gonna find a base
I'm<00:04:19.870> not<00:04:19.989> gonna<00:04:20.140> wait<00:04:20.520> I'm<00:04:21.520> gonna<00:04:21.670> fill<00:04:21.880> with

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
I'm not gonna wait I'm gonna fill with

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.220 
I'm not gonna wait I'm gonna fill with
water<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:24.210> that'll<00:04:25.210> be<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.300> lot<00:04:25.420> faster<00:04:26.020> to

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
water and that'll be a lot faster to

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.340 
water and that'll be a lot faster to
find<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.100> leaks<00:04:27.310> but<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.510> usually<00:04:28.780> fill<00:04:29.260> it

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
find the leaks but I usually fill it

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.520 
find the leaks but I usually fill it
with<00:04:29.440> air<00:04:29.620> once<00:04:30.540> that<00:04:31.540> way<00:04:31.720> it's<00:04:31.900> way<00:04:32.080> easier

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
with air once that way it's way easier

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.290 
with air once that way it's way easier
to<00:04:32.680> fix<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.190> leak<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.520> open<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.910> valve<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.270> you

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
to fix a leak you open a valve and you

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.320 
to fix a leak you open a valve and you
start<00:04:34.570> soldering<00:04:35.850> instead<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.120> have<00:04:37.210> to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
start soldering instead of you have to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.690 
start soldering instead of you have to
dry<00:04:37.570> all<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.050> pipes<00:04:38.320> out<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.890> have<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.100> you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
dry all the pipes out you have to you

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
dry all the pipes out you have to you
have<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.850> try<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.210> drain<00:04:40.360> all<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.600> water

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
have to try and drain all the water

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.080 
have to try and drain all the water
which<00:04:41.140> is<00:04:41.260> nearly<00:04:41.740> impossible<00:04:42.160> it's<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.850> very

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
which is nearly impossible it's a very

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.980 
which is nearly impossible it's a very
lengthy<00:04:43.960> task<00:04:44.380> so<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:46.150> seems<00:04:46.390> to<00:04:46.450> be<00:04:46.570> holding<00:04:46.720> I

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
lengthy task so it seems to be holding I

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.300 
lengthy task so it seems to be holding I
think<00:04:47.170> I'm<00:04:47.290> gonna<00:04:47.410> take<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.800> air<00:04:47.920> and<00:04:48.100> put<00:04:48.190> it

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
think I'm gonna take the air and put it

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.240 
think I'm gonna take the air and put it
back<00:04:48.490> up<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.820> ten<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.300> then<00:04:50.290> go<00:04:50.890> move<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.190> along

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
back up to ten and then go move it along

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.700 
back up to ten and then go move it along
because<00:04:51.880> it's<00:04:52.560> unbelievable

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
because it's unbelievable

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.810 
because it's unbelievable
the<00:04:54.040> middle<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.370> October<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.750> it's<00:04:56.710> like<00:04:57.250> 75

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
the middle of October and it's like 75
