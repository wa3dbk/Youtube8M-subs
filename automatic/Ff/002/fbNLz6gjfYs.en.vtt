00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.620
 with the rolli or inliners you have the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.059
 possibility very close to the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.829
 actual ski techniques too 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.030
 work out 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.079
 Thus we can already in the summer the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.000
 improve technology 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.649
 We start with the step by step 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.390
 without stock liner are a good 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.159
 training means for a feeling for the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.890
 weight shifting with the rhythm 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.780
 to get the long run from Rollski 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.820
 with additional advantage that that 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.909
 lateral conclusion behavior he the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.890
 completion on cross-country skis ends at 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.140
 Repulsion always takes place exclusively from the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.720
 inner edge, whether with liners or 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.040
 Rollski training is important is that 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.990
 after each at the repulsion of 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.369
 main focus on the stand area 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.460
 of the broadband is shifted 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.430
 so be sure to slip on one 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.900
 leg possible on inliners and poldi 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.670
 should always be with the imagination 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.159
 be trained that a ski at 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.840
 foot has this idea also helps the 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.180
 to execute the leg correctly 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.729
 this will be the leg after the repulsion 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.410
 glide flat over the ground 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.940
 brought 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.950
 Now we add the pieces of 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.340
 All skating techniques will be skating 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.590
 21 very often applied this technique 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.620
 suitable for awarded slopes and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 Curves and will be in the execution of 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.750
 speed adjusted 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.850
 The stock insert takes place with each one 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.130
 second when repelling two pieces 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.540
 should be depending on the speed 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.920
 at the same time at the height of the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.890
 be attached 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.990
 The arms are initially slightly bent 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.560
 and then actively back through 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.320
 pushed 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.259
 The upper part of the body supports the beginning 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.659
 stock relapsing 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.519
 the skating 21 with active downturn 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.310
 is one of the fastest skating techniques 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.980
 in cross-country skiing takes one first 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 stock to the active downturn too 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.730
 work out 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.640
 after the explosive conclusion of the poor 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.140
 this is actively brought forward the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.069
 Arm swing takes place approximately up 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.989
 shoulder height and is then braked 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.209
 The view is when gliding to the horizon 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.290
 The goal is a high one 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.120
 position during the glide phase 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.069
 will increase depending on the steepness of the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.550
 ground the floor further behind 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.830
 Skates put on 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.210
 the skating 11 is particularly high 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.490
 Claims to the balance 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.650
 ability to change each leg 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.890
 a resounding success by a 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.390
 will be supported by patrons 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.830
 This technique especially when sprinting 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.140
 flatten out quickly 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.700
 accelerate 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.090
 Also this technique can start with 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.290
 Only one floor can be trained 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.480
 weight shifting over the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.380
 Body emphasis must now be very precise 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.570
 be executed 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.210
 important here is a high glide 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.720
 position and then the indicated leg 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.570
 ending 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.580
 The pieces will be close to the same time 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.580
 inliners at the height of the foot tips 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.830
 put on when the movements 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.150
 the training can be automated 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.640
 rollski and inliners also to 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.330
 Improve endurance 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.530
 For this we need heavy terrain 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.930
 try the individual techniques too 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.170
 connect and terrain adapted to 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.330
 to run 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.740
 the way of inliners over the rollski 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.930
 Cross-country skiing is a good thing 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.810
 Possibility to learn skating 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.940
 but also to facilitate technology 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.980
 benefit advanced or professionals 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.920
 from the training transfer with inland and 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.480
 Rollski can do the skating techniques 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.480
 also be refined in the summer 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.870
 you will find more expert tips in the 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.530
 other videos of german 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.020
 Ski 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.200
 have fun watching and 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.200
 try out
