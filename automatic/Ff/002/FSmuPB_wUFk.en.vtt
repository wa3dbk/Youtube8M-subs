00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.370
 hi all users spaceshames are 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.610
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.039
 episode dedicated to m2k 15 we are 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.650
 continuing our career with the 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.720
 never gm you know we are doing with i 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
 detroit pistons we are in the second year 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.099
 we have made various changes you can 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 find them in previous episodes that 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.210
 are inserted in the playlist of m 2 k 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.310
 then he says found on the canal and today 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.919
 we faced the champions 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.500
 in office in the royal nba the san antonio 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.590
 spurs super holy without theirs 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.290
 player of the last 15 years 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.600
 tim duncan who retired in this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.790
 mode of his second year gino dress 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 which again surprised me a little 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.170
 thought they would retire together 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.880
 I don't know if they duncan whether to withdraw at the end 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.640
 this season there are rumors that 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.830
 they see him and the Argentine 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 however, retiring in any case 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.610
 spurs are not a poor team because 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.400
 however they have the various parkers have 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.439
 especially leonard so it was one 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.869
 difficult team especially schools 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.590
 of the west you know they are very very strong 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.790
 and it wasn't a great game 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.190
 really low percentages 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 I had complained about the sliders in the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.710
 previous episodes I have now done 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 read changes lowered following the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.220
 last patch so I tried to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.260
 change the values ​​and the game a bit 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.770
 I was not saying ugly though anymore 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.490
 realistic then without maybe doing 130 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.100
 points are lower scores so they are 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.229
 satisfied with the result for now 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.990
 we were talking, I'm not a team 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.420
 easy helped me a lot to have a 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 drama does not make the centers laugh anyway 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.670
 very very strong and I exploited 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.940
 the absence of duncan because surely 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.260
 god and splitter if not height of the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.330
 so I preferred my centers 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.700
 rather than playing on exteriors like 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.159
 I usually play then with roses and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.930
 World Cup I preferred to bet a lot on 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.340
 drummond and headlights of the result then it 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.780
 you will see at the end of the video 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.800
 today we wanted to talk about the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.230
 the Italians in NBA because after a couple 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.459
 of years in which practically there has been 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.410
 only bellinelli because in the end 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.600
 barneyani always injured gallinari 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.610
 he was fine then he got injured and then 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.590
 seriously injured again as a 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.640
 detroit has never ever ever found 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.770
 space 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.110
 now they are coming up well let's say 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.180
 all four because obviously 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.940
 belinelli maybe that's what he puts on 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.920
 a little more scarce figures though 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.260
 let us consider that he plays san antonio 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.019
 therefore in a system practically 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.730
 perfect in which he must do his part e 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.510
 there is always when it comes 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.090
 called into question 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 gallinari and bargnani are coming up 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.769
 well va beh bargnani plays in one 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.989
 team quite in disarray even though 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.760
 I have to say a few victories lately 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.280
 they made it vannelli is not playing 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.800
 not even very bad even a double 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.510
 double in the last games you know 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.269
 it's not really in the strings of bargnani 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.150
 gallinari instead if quite taken up 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.510
 from the nuggets they started their ex 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.790
 coach and they understood the vice e 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.100
 they are playing fairly well indeed 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.540
 they do not point to anything because they are now playing 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.410
 off west they went however in 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.760
 prospect could build e 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.920
 let's go back to good levels 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.360
 that when the nova george karl had 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.850
 a great team went into the playoffs 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.489
 quietly in gallinari you are 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.870
 recovering from the injury I have to say 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.760
 that we see that it is not yet 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.000
 perfectly one hundred percent why 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.290
 alternate matches maybe by 25 points like 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.989
 he tried to do maybe others 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.660
 games in which he barely pulls 67 points 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.489
 so anyway there is still a little something from 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.459
 fix the real surprise though could 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.900
 to be a datome that we saw afterwards 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.880
 detroit that never finds patient 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.730
 I don't know how many games it has 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.410
 played in his detroit experience 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.150
 now in boston after lyskamm and the 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.700
 January is cutting out a baby 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.489
 space and is showing that I am in nba 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.750
 however, he may certainly not have it 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.090
 some problems in defense especially 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.430
 why 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.340
 it's a little slow to mark the three 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.349
 type lebron type of rent, however, is that 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.660
 may be a common problem however in 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.280
 attack is proving to be there 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.190
 still understand the game intelligence 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.870
 basketball very high and I have to say not 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.520
 is playing very badly boston is one 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.590
 interesting and very young team e 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.699
 paradoxically it has earned us from the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.190
 cession of rondo 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.080
 no maybe they will go to the alcohol playoffs 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.199
 catching the last place in the east 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.330
 in any case a good other project 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.280
 high picks in the draft anyway 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.110
 and maybe next year they will succeed in 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.669
 improve even more 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.030
 we are seeing in the end of the 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.850
 convincing victory match against the 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.250
 san antonio spurs not great 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.950
 game there for some players 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.200
 I'm thinking about parker which it is practically 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.550
 only 11 points were absent for him 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.039
 understand that when your best 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.660
 player sucks so hard is difficult 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.430
 win from us great performances like 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.030
 I said of the centers so excellent 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.860
 victory 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.860
 we'll see you soon, hello to everyone
