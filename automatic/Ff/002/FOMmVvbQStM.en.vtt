00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.129
 well what we have to do will be 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.860
 well does this trick is very old like this 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.059
 that I do not give a damn what 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.040
 we will have to download the 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.370
 4 child application that is what I have 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.280
 here is to be here and we will find it 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.180
 totally free on the place thor 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.070
 we go here and we put four chalets and it's 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.950
 made of 4 since we have it 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.479
 downloaded we're going to get into the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.180
 application and will ask us to 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.880
 register we will have to register 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.700
 and ready 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.460
 now we since we have registered 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.560
 we have to go 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.270
 well we do not have to have the pool what 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.090
 we have to erase everything before me 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.640
 forget we do not have to erase pop and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.210
 something we will look for here and we will put 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.210
 yes 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.399
 and well here we see several 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.710
 we have to download them not all but 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.060
 only some 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.500
 and we're going to just click on the file 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 we apply in the monkey and we will give it 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.420
 to download 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.979
 and having ready is downloading and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.979
 now we go to our downloads 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.360
 and we are going to open them to see 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.830
 let's put here 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.920
 A) Yes 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.790
 approaching 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.790
 because these errors 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.420
 and what we have to do is good 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.010
 it will be a way of knowing what the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.099
 true because some are this 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.859
 lie or are another application is it 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.409
 we are going to give we are going to apply and we are 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.969
 It should appear the monkey PU and is not 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.430
 we should appear the aft mount 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.090
 let's give to the next one and we're going to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.140
 install 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.519
 this takes no longer or 5 minutes as 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.420
 maximum 1 minute depends on your cell phone and 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.420
 see why I exist 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.050
 let's give ready 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.330
 to see that approach because I do not know why 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.330
 what was the damn blue 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.870
 since we have it we will have to look 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.959
 the bowl 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.430
 here is or this trick is easy but 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.430
 we will get to poe 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.540
 how can you see 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.540
 we already have all the infinite coins 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.260
 that's right i 'm going to try to leave you is the link 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.390
 good of 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.600
 and leave them in the freckle in the description 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.920
 so they do not have to be looking 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.620
 the apk so good try and good 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.160
 Now we can buy everything for free 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.890
 let's go to the truth 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.770
 and there were some things like that 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.990
 when we have the infinite and we can 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.990
 buy what wins us the win 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.500
 to see why you do not want to eat damn 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.500
 pop 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.030
 let's give it to 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.770
 quarter of cows to cook 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.770
 as christ eats eats 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.660
 and now we will have to bathe 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.570
 and I also do not like it very little but 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.800
 I brought you this video because my cousin 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.900
 well, my niece, rather my cousin, this one 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.460
 he loves pop and wanted 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.250
 they chose this trick and I looked in 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.080
 internet and good I took a lot in 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.230
 find one and when when 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.070
 I found, I do not know, I do not know, it explains very 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.900
 alright so I'm going to make one so that 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.720
 explaining the best and we will have only the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.720
 updated games like the sky job 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.110
 is 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.110

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.840

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.840
 and I'm sorry I did not upload a video 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.240
 but it was because they were vacation without 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.270
 vacation nobody uploads good video to 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.599
