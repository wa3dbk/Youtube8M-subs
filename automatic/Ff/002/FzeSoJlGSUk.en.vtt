00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.760
 so we want to expand the front wheel around 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.680
 The front wheel must be removed here too 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.799
 the schools are jacked up 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.639
 already exists on a stand forms 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.639
 we will do that too 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.510
 First, it offers to the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.680
 unscrew brake pistons are the 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.750
 here they will screw here with two 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.859
 I screwed it on now 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.839
 fast, yes, if you have the calipers on 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.019
 both sides have screwed off here 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.489
 the screw pull out 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.229
 then he drops your caliper already 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.550
 against the simple please careful 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.069
 pull from the fire and at the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.609
 best hang somewhere that here no 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:56.710
 purchase of the brake line is so 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.100
 decreased by the general government 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.180
 so my motorbike is here 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.290
 the two screws screw in the front 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.880
 screws will solve 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.390
 on the other side please let go 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.390
 Go on better now 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.659
 just screw it off to turn it out 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.759
 then there is this special den 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.950
 special inside in the bus in different 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.549
 sizes to a to a part 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 There are the known harder 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:42.079
 1022 fits and I go with the 19 - 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.079
 on it myself my ratchet on 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.909
 I'm still pretty much into it 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.909
 renewal 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.899
 and then I have the inside axis already 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.899
 solved 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.720
 so she's on the other side already 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.420
 Turned out now she is not coming 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.549
 more because he too and so is the axis 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.459
 de facto already solved if I now 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.769
 pull out 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.099
 To do this , the wheel must raise slightly again 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.630
 to relieve the eight 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.510
 and then the front wheel comes to me 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.489
 already precaution also fall here 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.730
 as at the rear wheel spacers out 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.380
 on both sides and the plug share 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.329
 do not lay on the floor because of 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.209
 Pollution that you one 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.100
 half way to the plants broken 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.180
 the struggling fight should take off immediately 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.180
 forest on the brake 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.140
 Please be extra special on the front wheel rim 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.060
 so take care of the brake disc 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.040
 Do not place the rim on the brake discs 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.960
 that you do not care about the brake discs 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.590
 you do not make crooked either 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.330
 here 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.190
 otherwise I have the strong axis here 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.830
 the two distances now everything sword 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.690
 like the new field worth of old contracts 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.930
 do it and then it goes back to 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:08.320
 to install so now it's back 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.870
 to the installation of the front wheel rim please 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.310
 Wake up during installation where to go 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.959
 the rim is one 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.760
 directional statement with me it is here 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.080
 ahead 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.670
 the case is pointing to the right direction 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.080
 motorcycle is wrong and instructions 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.000
 the wheel is not running 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.700
 that's it 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.959
 infos with me the case pointing forward 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.440
 then I can do the wheel first 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.110
 insert 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.640
 but that is always on the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.280
 Take care that nothing breaks 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.510
 makes all the moving parts 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.310
 I cleaned and 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.140
 smeared at the city axis forms 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.330
 not the thread and not here 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.330
 Lubricate at the front of the clamp 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.980
 in the 57 the two distance shots like the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.360
 use the left and right 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.250
 right, please, but you have to 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.650
 in the expansion we have already seen 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.150
 us then I take my plug 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.250
 Axis and put me here before 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.250
 Be careful about the Tehran 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.620
 that is the quasi handy to have 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.739
 Now the rim has to be raised 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.110
 the spacers are inserted 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.140
 all this is of course better for two 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.830
 again alone on the brake 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.810
 move rim and bet now it is 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.180
 even a little bit here I am in it 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.350
 the left side of the right side now 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.350
 still find the exit 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.440
 I take mine here 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.150
 adapter as a bit think too 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.750
 even before that is not right in it 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.380
 that was the whole point on the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.650
 I am the other side now 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.470
 19 - unscrew represent only times a 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:19.590
 two three and three 1 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:21.449
 those are the rims set me from now 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.380
 I ask for the calipers on please 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.380
 between the brake shoes 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:36.739
 is there ever 12 wood in here ? 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.829
 so the brake does not stop me somewhere 

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:41.809
 around the world and need flying 

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:44.649
 so different to be the there on the 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.649
 other side too 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:14.669
 now i can make the due something firmer 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:16.919
 In the holidays I think and how beautiful 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:22.370
 that the arm of the clamp 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.370
 it almost disappears now it is fixed 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.050
 already becomes 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.450
 in the front the clamping device like the train 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.450
 screwed 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.360
 the brake is screwed down again 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.149
 here with two gold are please on each 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:54.569
 side so after the wheel is back in it 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:58.029
 all screws are in there all 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:07:00.879
 after-control are turned 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:09.849
 wonderful still the brake 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:13.259
 Pre-pumping is blocked 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.259
 pass on
