00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.950
 snow men the ids of justine city 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.450

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.340

 or you can find it directly 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 american cooking.de we start with 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:24.180
 the cookie dough makes her brutal 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:26.070
 with sugar and vanilla sugar then creamy 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 Give her yours and bring her for so long 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.150
 until I have connected everything well 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.250
 The next step will be the flour with 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.600
 salt and baking powder mixed and added to the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.600
 remaining ingredients given 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.850
 The whole thing has to be kneaded for so long now 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.760
 until a more even dough 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.470
 was created by the team then best 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.480
 to roll and grab the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.860
 individual portions to just how big 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.490
 you make the biscuits at the end you can 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.490
 choose you 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 if that is done you push the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.860
 single portions quite simply with the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 hands the biscuits should afterwards 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.880
 protect your appearance 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.450
 afterwards they become with something 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.000
 distance to a paper backed with baking paper 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.100
 Baking tray placed and circulated at 180 degrees 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.170
 Baked for 10 to 15 minutes 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.150
 After baking, let it after 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.190
 five minutes on the tin and put it 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.740
 afterwards on a cake or back rost 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.479
 where they need to cool completely when it does 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.850
 as far as the glaze is prepared 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.320
 will be beaten egg white stiff 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.979
 and then sifted powdered sugar 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.690
 given if you like raw egg 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.640
 you can also do without white 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.060
 chocolate or regular frosting 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.060
 to take 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.880
 afterwards the glaze was distributed to the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.720
 biscuits what's best with a teaspoon 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.720

 machos on how you have cookies 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.709
 two to three minutes in the oven until 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.230
 they start to get soft 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.120
 afterwards the marshmallows set as a head 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.810

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.810
 something in shape 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.190
 before it should be able to continue 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.540
 dried up as scarf for three quarters of an hour 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.460
 and nose you can afterwards 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.060
 colored fondant or marzipan 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.060
 to take 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.620
 to decorate dark sugar is suitable 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.620
