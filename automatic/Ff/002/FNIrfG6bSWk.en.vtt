 very good everyone is worth here is for jim 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.330
 furyk omo having a brief 2 and the 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.269
 back and we are here as is living 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.309
 in gta 5 in the new dirty money dlc 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.919
 part 2 and I come to show you the new 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.539
 motorcycle the tinka vindicator as already 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.799
 you know previously has taught all 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.689
 the prices but now I'm going to buy 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.820
 all vehicles are worth where we are going 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.009
 to buy here we go to ball 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.109
 internet travel and transportation and we 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.369
 we will get into legend and motorsport or we 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.230
 will appear all the new ones are worth 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.820
 exclusive news as links beautiful 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.710
 previously taught all prices 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.469
 but here if we give the dinka 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.329
 vindicator we read is worth the bike with 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.489
 advanced pedals you thought 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.500
 daring and futuristic when they dress 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.149
 the animes of the 80s means that 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.309
 have to put what is worth as 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.680
 next there chromate okay but let's 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.260
 let's go down a little bit more and what 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.510
 is what it puts equipped with the system 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.300
 Brake energy recovery 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.100
 kinetic regenerative uses the 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.089
 power of the axes to generate 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.070
 energy for the hyper cell battery 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.079
 this can be sent to the rear wheel to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.840
 through the brushless motor of 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.450
 direct drive giving the motorbike 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.159
 of power you remember the prince 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.530
 you remember the robberies 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.960
 banks we have a new motorcycle with 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.780
 the system that is worth you want 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.579
 say that we are going to be able to have a small 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.500
 tube calling us let's call it turbo 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.369
 that when we generate and when we brake 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.899
 giving him to l3 in play is worth in team 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.340
 I do not know that I owe nonsense but I 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.229
 you can leave in the comments 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.380
 we have here a system as you are going to see 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.759
 now it's worth we put ourselves here to accelerate and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.649
 like having there is a yellow bar 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.840
 ok there is a yellow bar when 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.509
 we remove the brake when we stop 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.310
 accelerate as you are seeing 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.069
 fill the yellow bar and when 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.469
 we press again the e3 here as 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.890
 you are watching we have the new turbo 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.289
 OK 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.119
 if we continue accelerating , the 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.649
 bar but if we stop accelerating as 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.899
 I'm going to see now look let's accelerate 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.780
 and the yellow bar is loading 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.819
 ferial the regenerative braking that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.489
 what it would be is to accumulate a little 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.259
 energy in a small battery that has 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.750
 what to have inside the motorcycle is worth 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.700
 as you are seeing it is worth here we throw 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.150
 two banks in very many I will make a 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.519
 speed test against 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.829
 electro prince the electro that they put 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.379
 in the dlc of bank robberies and how 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.030
 Motorcycle mola see much the 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.590
 braking us very good voucher how are you 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.209
 seeing after the turbo the braking does not 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.189
 It can be very good but good here 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.650
 we have the new turbo the new 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.870
 motorcycle with the system that is worth 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.510
 Here you know , regenerative system comes out 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.489
 of electricity what it does is 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.290
 increase it in a battery and we have a 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.939
 small turbo when we press the e3 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.810
 so I hope you liked it already 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.010
 you know 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.379
 I'm going to do a speed test 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.420
 but before I will bring everything all all 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.310
 the vehicles the bikes the clothes I go to 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.290
 bring everything everything everything so that so that 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.579
 you have it on the channel a greeting to everything 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.590
 I hope you liked this new 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.000
 motorcycle surely everything 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.859
 you buy because the motorcycle in mode 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.079
 it's pretty much how you're seeing when 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.790
 the character accelerates puts his feet in the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.349
 footrest valley pretty cool and a 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.810
 motorcycle that we can tune and 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.250
 can change a lot of style a 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.840
 I salute everything to burst this button 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.840
 like until later 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.030
 Y 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.890
