 imortalize is a very cool game of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.509
 Judging has many that if you have to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.450
 solve in several different ways with 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.110
 acting with objects 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.320
 I walk your own portals this game of 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 xbox that its not cheating call me 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 portal'm not sure 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 in a cool cool game zin was made in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 unity 3d same way as the last one 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.050
 video and hit like and will need the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 plugin to play it but it 's a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.880
 Well, it's worth playing. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 For those who like puzzle games 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 or those games of the type that do not obey 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.830
 very much the laws of physics will like this 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.000
 game 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.650
 and it was only a little bit of the game that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.040
 I managed to realize in that time I 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 I did not even play as you 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.430
 using a slow-motion type has as 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.479
 interacts with objects by pressing is the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.970
 slow motion with the key you have after 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.160
 more ahead of the game is what creates the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:50.270
 portal of the power to solve the crises 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:52.640
 And I think that's all I've seen. 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.960
 In the game until now I have not played much is 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.960
 because I did not have much time 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.330
 and I hope you like I will leave 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.640
 he in the description of the video for you 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.790
 could be playing 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.800
 Then one more thing the game has a system 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.650
 check point that as long as you do not 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.730
 puzzle with preferred back in the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.890
 beginning of the phase there 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.340
 while you have not resolved to give 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.180
