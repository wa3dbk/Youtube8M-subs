00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.409
 main focus to disable the entire team 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.440
 adversary

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.220
 malignant rare to speak a little here of the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.290
 her magic to passive them up 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.720
 she does what is the probability 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.120
 his sandra has no demand cost 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.610
 after a certain time and if you have 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.980
 someone with the magic that grants 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.440
 said you will reduce the flow time 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.330
 From this passive we have what is hers 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.400
 what is the name of ice shard 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.990
 alexandre forward ship there a 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.150
 spear that hits the first enemy 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.410
 also causes some of the wolves that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.420
 have behind him 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.570
 the second more than the circle call 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.090
 Arctic she conjures and around her a 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.550
 circle and the players that are 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.530
 inside this circus I'm going to take damage and I'm going 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.190
 take kinds of too i'll get stuck 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.979
 there his third skill called 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.770
 glacial truck I believe it will be the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.650
 great difference of this champion since 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.350
 It will serve as gap crosses you will play 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.560
 a straight line ice bottle will give 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.770
 Everybody that she passes you can 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.900
 reactivate the place where 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.780
 you are going to have a scheme of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.410
 escape or else by the gap bake you go 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.870
 have a great differential with this magic 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.370
 we have to utis her the spain call 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.400
 frozen tubule 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.220
 you can use it on yourself or in 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.160
 some adversary and there we also have 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 to finish as I expect her to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.960
 last call frozen tomb 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.510
 You'll be able to use it and you'll 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.540
 serve as the role of escape as 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.270
 also expects aggressiveness 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.340
 you will be able to stay vulnerable for 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.830
 few seconds for some time some 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.320
 period of time meanwhile the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.210
 enemies will not be able to go there you serve 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.390
 more or less with this role of the 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.930
 of the keio or also the jump of the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.050
 craft where you stay there unattainable 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.330
 and then you also cause slowness and damage 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.610
 to the enemies that are close to you 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.460
 then this is a great differential of the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.770
 ute's intention defensively speaking 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.959
 on the offensive issue 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.810
 you can freeze the bingo champion and 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.570
 will cause damage was stun him too 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:41.170
 will give damage and slowness in area ie 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:43.850
 she is all the more a great champion and escape 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.570
 reworked in the turn of the 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:51.290
 frozen particles and clear I never 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.560
 like that a lot and now we staff 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.830
 talk a little bit about the new came out 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:03.260
 here nothing of very impressive them 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.260
 did what I thought I did not have 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.350
 Necessity but okay let's analyze 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.900
 now you see that all her magic 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.850
 changed as a 5 the graphic effects 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 have changed. 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.770
 tendency to change new 15 are 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.770
 doing this gets really cool 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.080
 see there it was very show and also 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.030
 An important detail that I found was 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.950
 when she dies 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.440
 also changed a little hard the egg 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.570
 was blown 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.150
 also another effect I found very 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.010
 Very cool, that's it. I think it's worth it. 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.600
 Worth buying She saw 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.030
 And then everyone to finish here. 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.280
 talk about the last change that 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.980
 happened in the champion threw that his 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.690
 ice pillar more kim than he is 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.870
 baseball batter 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.730
 Now it's the trophy, man, look what a thing. 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.150
 craziest of all 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.680
 I'm just going to play detran, I give a hug. 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.570
