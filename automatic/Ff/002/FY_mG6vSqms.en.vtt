thing<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.400> want<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.730> with<00:02:17.450> Isis<00:02:17.960> Cutlass

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
thing you want and with Isis Cutlass

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.830 
thing you want and with Isis Cutlass
doesn't<00:02:18.920> really<00:02:19.010> matter<00:02:19.250> with<00:02:19.970> Isis<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.720> need

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
doesn't really matter with Isis you need

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.530 
doesn't really matter with Isis you need
to<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.080> spacer<00:02:21.970> spacer<00:02:22.970> goes<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.239> first

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
to have a spacer spacer goes on first

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.170 
to have a spacer spacer goes on first
before<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.260> crank<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.730> put<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.970> crank

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
before the crank when you put the crank

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.890 
before the crank when you put the crank
on<00:02:26.590> when<00:02:27.590> you've<00:02:27.709> just<00:02:27.890> pushed<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.190> crank<00:02:28.459> on

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
on when you've just pushed that crank on

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.420 
on when you've just pushed that crank on
this<00:02:29.900> gap<00:02:30.290> between<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.680> spacer<00:02:31.069> as<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.310> can

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
this gap between the spacer as you can

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.420 
this gap between the spacer as you can
see<00:02:31.610> here<00:02:31.880> needs<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.810> be<00:02:32.959> approximately<00:02:33.830> three

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
see here needs to be approximately three

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.790 
see here needs to be approximately three
mil<00:02:34.670> if<00:02:35.150> you've<00:02:35.390> got<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.569> bigger<00:02:35.930> gap<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.650> need

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
mil if you've got a bigger gap you need

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.400 
mil if you've got a bigger gap you need
a<00:02:36.830> bigger<00:02:37.130> spacer<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.360> get<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.690> right<00:02:38.900> spacer

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
a bigger spacer so get the right spacer

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.500 
a bigger spacer so get the right spacer
to<00:02:39.530> match<00:02:39.680> your<00:02:39.860> cranks<00:02:40.190> when<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.120> before<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
to match your cranks when you before you

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.420 
to match your cranks when you before you
put<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.660> crank<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.349> well<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:43.099> want<00:02:43.220> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
put that crank on as well you want to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.339 
put that crank on as well you want to
grease<00:02:43.730> inside<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.209> crank<00:02:44.480> because<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.200> is

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
grease inside the crank because this is

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.150 
grease inside the crank because this is
my<00:02:45.470> unicycle

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
my unicycle

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.490 
my unicycle
they've<00:02:46.340> already<00:02:46.459> been<00:02:46.670> greased<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.500> on

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
they've already been greased that on

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.350 
they've already been greased that on
there<00:02:48.709> like<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.310> then<00:02:50.060> it's<00:02:50.180> basically

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
there like that and then it's basically

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.170 
there like that and then it's basically
a<00:02:50.709> reversal<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.860> how<00:02:52.100> he<00:02:52.160> took<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.489> off<00:02:52.610> bolt

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
a reversal of how he took it off bolt

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.570 
a reversal of how he took it off bolt
back<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:57.730> put<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.980> give<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.549> a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
back in put that back in and give that a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.979 
back in put that back in and give that a
nip<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.880> you're<00:03:02.239> gonna<00:03:02.360> want<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.600> tighten<00:03:02.870> that

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
nip up you're gonna want to tighten that

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.530 
nip up you're gonna want to tighten that
a<00:03:03.140> lot<00:03:03.440> more<00:03:03.980> than<00:03:04.220> what<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.670> I'd<00:03:04.970> put<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
a lot more than what that is I'd put the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.509 
a lot more than what that is I'd put the
unicycle<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.110> floor<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.680> give<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.459> a

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
unicycle on the floor and give that a

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.140 
unicycle on the floor and give that a
nipple<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.030> donk<00:03:08.239> or<00:03:08.420> careers<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.959> with<00:03:09.080> that

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
and there we got my unicycles back

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.610 
and there we got my unicycles back
