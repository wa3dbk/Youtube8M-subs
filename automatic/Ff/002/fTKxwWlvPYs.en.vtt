00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.110
 I am 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.380
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.880
 tutorial we will teach how to fix 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.329
 the problem of need for speed most 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.449
 wanted in windows 8 good 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:43.070
 you have to that the problem of 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.839
 guideline 9.0 points where the need for 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.789
 speed most wanted asks them what 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.399
 install but you already have it 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.920
 installed but still the system does not 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.780
 he recognizes and keeps asking him do not let him 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.109
 install very well I have them the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.920
 solution we know that in windows 8 they do not 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.859
 they let the author change ok they do not let him 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.490
 change then I have them the 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:10.220
 solution for that and I think not only 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.110
 it's in windows 8 I think it creates one I think 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.780
 this also happens in windows 7 that does not 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.170
 they let them change the author but good 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.119
 let's start if in your case they have windows 7 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.149
 windows 8 that do not let them change the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.600
 author um let's do the following 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.880
 Steps 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.509
 we go where we have the folder 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 of the last gloves ok 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.250
 we headed our cousins ​​gloves 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.560
 we run the installer 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.680
 that's what happens 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.649
 this is rather the problem that each 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.530
 one of us have that we have ok 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.560
 we execute 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.060
 rather we do an installation that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 we could not ok we give it to install and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.790
 he asks us for the code ok we wrote it 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.280
 we give next below we 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.920
 this box will appear from the license 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.090
 where it says directive 9.0 point c 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.849
 here it says that if we do not have it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.560
 we will give you no but we already 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.260
 we have installed but still the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.519
 system does not recognize it we give it 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.310
 that if we see the following problem 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.630
 we see this following box where 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.519
 says that the installation can not 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.209
 continue because the game requires the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.880
 guideline 9.0 point co superior has been 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.910
 installed on your system and here gives us the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:54.120
 microsoft page to download 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.120
 very good many videos that I have watched 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.340
 they go in the unit rum and send bus 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.459
 already has author hum 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.680
 you change this in guideline version les 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.930
 they change this they take away the 9 they take away 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.920
 the 6 remove the point 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.439
 and only 0 but in those systems 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.900
 operatives let them change this in a 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.670
 windows 8 does not let us change so 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.640
 when we give it close and we give it to erase 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.819
 do not let him save here very well 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.340
 I have the solution for this 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.340
 once been here, guys 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.450
 in the rum 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:47.360
 we are going to give you copy all this ok 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.360
 we copy all this control ce 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.920
 and on desk hear on desk 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:57.299
 let's create a new folder in my 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.299
 I will call him 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.100
 okay 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:08.240
 once created we open it 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.710
 and here we are going to hit them ok ok 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.270
 I can use the video so it does not 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.380
 delay is 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.630
 well once the copy has finished we 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.280
 we said where we have copied it then in 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.080
 your case they will have bought it in the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.410
 desk and it's okay to occupy it in 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.320
 the writer 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.150
 this is the folder that we copied that the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.350
 we copied on the desk 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.780
 we go here where author says ok and 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.560
 we select we see permissions you 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.560
 we will say yes 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.550
 here we will give you install and write the 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.550
 code 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.289
 very well we give in following one time 

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:00.320
 that we have finished writing the 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.530
 code 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.660
 and as you can see, the 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.050
