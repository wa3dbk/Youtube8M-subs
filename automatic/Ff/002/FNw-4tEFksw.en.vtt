00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
one is that they are movable I can take

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
one is that they are movable I can take
that<00:01:52.740> triplet<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.270> did<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> two

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that triplet that I just did the two

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.980 
that triplet that I just did the two
drop<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.860> draw<00:01:56.210> three<00:01:57.210> draw<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.689> take

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
drop and to draw three draw and take

drop and to draw three draw and take
that<00:01:58.200> same<00:01:58.439> pattern<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> move<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.579> anywhere

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that same pattern and move it anywhere

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.679 
that same pattern and move it anywhere
on<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> harp<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:02.729> will<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> whole<00:02:03.630> new

on the harp and I will have a whole new

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.249 
on the harp and I will have a whole new
triplet<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.770> let's<00:02:05.189> move<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.899> four

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
triplet so let's move it up to the four

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.600 
triplet so let's move it up to the four
draw<00:02:07.500> Bend<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.160> draw<00:02:08.429> five<00:02:08.729> drop<00:02:09.030> another

draw Bend for draw five drop another
very<00:02:09.729> popular<00:02:10.080> triplet<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:11.380> we<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.590> a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
very popular triplet and then we have a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.520 
very popular triplet and then we have a
whole<00:02:11.860> new<00:02:12.010> triplet<00:02:12.400> check<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.850> out<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
whole new triplet check it out so the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.050 
whole new triplet check it out so the
idea<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> keep<00:02:21.220> working<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:21.760> them<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
idea is to keep working on them and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.580 
idea is to keep working on them and
practicing<00:02:22.630> them<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.140> point<00:02:23.380> where<00:02:23.500> you

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
practicing them to the point where you

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.980 
practicing them to the point where you
can<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:24.040> know<00:02:24.130> get<00:02:24.370> them<00:02:24.490> playing<00:02:25.060> playing

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
can you know get them playing playing

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.240 
can you know get them playing playing
them<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:26.440> fast<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.780> they're<00:02:28.960> movable<00:02:29.320> and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
them really fast so they're movable and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.040 
them really fast so they're movable and
another<00:02:30.760> cool<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.210> about<00:02:31.330> them<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.930> can

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
another cool thing about them is you can

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.320 
another cool thing about them is you can
play<00:02:32.290> them<00:02:32.440> backwards<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.160> as<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> matter<00:02:34.240> of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
play them backwards and as a matter of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.090 
play them backwards and as a matter of
fact<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.660> recommend<00:02:34.960> playing<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.620> backwards

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
fact I recommend playing the backwards

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.640 
fact I recommend playing the backwards
because<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:37.720> only<00:02:37.750> really<00:02:38.140> have<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> whole<00:02:38.530> new

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
because not only really have a whole new

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.740 
because not only really have a whole new
triplet<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:39.280> you'll<00:02:39.490> just<00:02:39.550> you'll<00:02:40.270> it's

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
triplet but you'll just you'll it's

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.210 
triplet but you'll just you'll it's
better<00:02:41.140> practice<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:41.920> you'll<00:02:42.040> be<00:02:42.160> able

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
better practice because you'll be able

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.270 
better practice because you'll be able
to<00:02:42.400> play<00:02:43.200> play<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.350> same<00:02:44.530> triplet<00:02:44.980> different

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
to play play the same triplet different

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.430 
to play play the same triplet different
ways<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.160> good<00:02:48.310> practice<00:02:48.459> so

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
ways and it's just good practice so

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.190 
ways and it's just good practice so
we'll<00:02:50.440> go<00:02:50.590> back<00:02:50.620> down<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:52.150> draw<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
we'll go back down to the to draw the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.780 
we'll go back down to the to draw the
very<00:02:53.470> first<00:02:53.739> triplet<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.280> we<00:02:54.400> did<00:02:54.610> and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
very first triplet that we did and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.930 
very first triplet that we did and
instead<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.080> draw<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.130> draw<00:02:57.520> three

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
instead of to draw and to draw three

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.530 
instead of to draw and to draw three
draw<00:02:57.970> I'll<00:02:58.720> go<00:02:58.959> -<00:02:59.020> draw<00:02:59.530> -<00:02:59.770> draw<00:03:00.070> Bend<00:03:00.610> one<00:03:01.360> draw

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
draw I'll go - draw - draw Bend one draw

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:13.110 
draw I'll go - draw - draw Bend one draw
and<00:03:09.900> okay<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:10.959> they're<00:03:11.410> movable<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.850> can<00:03:12.970> play

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
and okay so they're movable you can play

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.340 
and okay so they're movable you can play
them<00:03:13.270> backwards<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:13.989> get<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> whole<00:03:14.320> new

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
them backwards and you get a whole new

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.860 
them backwards and you get a whole new
triplet<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.700> next<00:03:15.940> thing<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.600> string

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
triplet the next thing is you can string

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.020 
triplet the next thing is you can string
them<00:03:16.989> together<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:18.340> when<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.610> string<00:03:18.880> them

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
them together and when you string them

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.330 
them together and when you string them
together<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.600> start<00:03:19.989> playing<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:21.040> bunch<00:03:21.190> of

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
together and start playing a bunch of

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.120 
together and start playing a bunch of
triplets<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.060> row<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.799> will<00:03:23.799> sound<00:03:24.010> like

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
triplets in a row it will sound like

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.220 
triplets in a row it will sound like
you're<00:03:24.340> doing<00:03:24.580> this<00:03:24.700> complicated<00:03:25.420> blues<00:03:25.930> riff

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
you're doing this complicated blues riff

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.840 
you're doing this complicated blues riff
when<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.680> fact<00:03:26.890> you're<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.190> playing<00:03:27.760> a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
when in fact you're just playing a

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.240 
when in fact you're just playing a
couple<00:03:28.060> triplets<00:03:29.049> strung<00:03:29.500> together<00:03:29.650> which<00:03:30.100> is

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
couple triplets strung together which is

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.729 
couple triplets strung together which is
much<00:03:30.430> easier<00:03:31.320> actually<00:03:32.320> Paul<00:03:32.500> Butterfield

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
much easier actually Paul Butterfield

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.940 
much easier actually Paul Butterfield
did<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.310> quite<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.580> bit<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:34.360> let's<00:03:35.019> go<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.620> draw

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
did this quite a bit so let's go to draw

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.400 
did this quite a bit so let's go to draw
bend<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.580> draw<00:03:36.880> three<00:03:37.209> draw<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.720> then<00:03:38.200> we'll

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
bend to draw three draw and then we'll

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.560 
bend to draw three draw and then we'll
just<00:03:38.590> string<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.130> net<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.549> blossom<00:03:40.239> we<00:03:40.390> just

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
just string the net the blossom we just

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:53.430 
just string the net the blossom we just
did<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.870> two<00:03:41.080> draw<00:03:41.350> -<00:03:41.620> draw<00:03:41.650> been<00:03:42.070> one<00:03:42.280> draw<00:03:52.440> so

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
did the two draw - draw been one draw so

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.420 
did the two draw - draw been one draw so
there<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.709> go<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:53.860> just<00:03:54.010> string<00:03:54.400> them

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
there you go you just string them

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.340 
there you go you just string them
together<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.970> then<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.120> have<00:03:55.360> kind<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.200> like

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
together and then you have kind of like

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.190 
together and then you have kind of like
your<00:03:56.500> own<00:03:56.530> new<00:03:57.040> little<00:03:57.340> riff<00:03:57.549> so<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.660> idea<00:03:58.989> is

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
your own new little riff so the idea is

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.810 
your own new little riff so the idea is
to<00:03:59.230> play<00:03:59.590> around<00:03:59.860> with<00:04:00.010> them<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.700> know

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
to play around with them to you know

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.449 
to play around with them to you know
just<00:04:01.180> kind<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.690> mix<00:04:02.350> them<00:04:02.560> up

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
just kind of mix them up

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.440 
just kind of mix them up
another<00:04:04.360> cool<00:04:05.489> triplet<00:04:06.489> er<00:04:06.519> a<00:04:06.610> popular

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
another cool triplet er a popular

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.020 
another cool triplet er a popular
triplet<00:04:07.900> made<00:04:08.500> famous<00:04:08.980> by<00:04:09.160> Sonny<00:04:09.850> Boy

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
triplet made famous by Sonny Boy

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.860 
triplet made famous by Sonny Boy
Williamson<00:04:10.060> -<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:12.280> three<00:04:12.610> draw<00:04:12.910> 4<00:04:13.540> blow<00:04:13.840> 4

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
Williamson - is the three draw 4 blow 4

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.930 
Williamson - is the three draw 4 blow 4
draw<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.980> this<00:04:15.519> one's<00:04:15.730> good<00:04:15.910> because<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:18.459> one

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
draw and this one's good because you one

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.699 
draw and this one's good because you one
you<00:04:19.120> don't<00:04:19.270> have<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.450> bent<00:04:19.750> note<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.169> it<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:20.560> it's

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
you don't have a bent note in it so it's

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.539 
you don't have a bent note in it so it's
probably<00:04:21.160> pretty

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
probably pretty

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.110 
probably pretty
easier<00:04:21.819> to<00:04:21.849> play<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.479> two<00:04:23.199> you<00:04:23.830> have<00:04:24.099> a<00:04:24.520> blow

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
easier to play and two you have a blow

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.059 
easier to play and two you have a blow
note<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.840> you're<00:04:26.020> getting<00:04:26.289> all<00:04:26.470> your<00:04:26.590> air<00:04:26.830> back

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:27.069 
note so you're getting all your air back

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.760 
note so you're getting all your air back
and<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.759> can<00:04:27.970> really<00:04:28.229> when<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:29.319> practice

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
and you can really when you practice

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.170 
and you can really when you practice
this<00:04:29.889> you<00:04:30.069> can<00:04:30.190> get<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.400> going<00:04:30.580> fast<00:04:30.819> and<00:04:31.060> you

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
this you can get it going fast and you

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.899 
this you can get it going fast and you
can<00:04:31.330> keep<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.870> going<00:04:31.930> forever<00:04:32.639> not<00:04:33.639> saying

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
can keep it going forever not saying

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.719 
can keep it going forever not saying
that<00:04:34.000> that'd<00:04:34.180> be<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.440> much<00:04:35.800> fun<00:04:36.400> for<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
that that'd be so much fun for the

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.680 
that that'd be so much fun for the
listener<00:04:37.120> but<00:04:37.360> check<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.229> out<00:04:39.539> Sonny<00:04:40.539> Boy

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
listener but check it out Sonny Boy

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:51.119 
listener but check it out Sonny Boy
Williamson<00:04:47.849> like<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:50.020> taking<00:04:50.409> that<00:04:50.560> same<00:04:50.830> one

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
Williamson like so taking that same one

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.029 
Williamson like so taking that same one
and<00:04:51.659> we<00:04:52.659> can<00:04:52.930> another<00:04:53.379> thing<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.830> can<00:04:53.919> do

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
and we can another thing that you can do

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.159 
and we can another thing that you can do
with<00:04:54.129> triplets<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:55.030> can<00:04:55.240> exchange<00:04:55.599> notes

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
with triplets is you can exchange notes

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.379 
with triplets is you can exchange notes
and/or<00:04:58.710> interchange<00:04:59.710> notes<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:00.729> let's<00:05:01.090> take

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
and/or interchange notes so let's take

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.290 
and/or interchange notes so let's take
those<00:05:01.569> same<00:05:01.900> three<00:05:02.199> notes<00:05:02.469> and<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:03.729> guess<00:05:04.120> what

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
those same three notes and I guess what

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.520 
those same three notes and I guess what
I'm<00:05:04.389> trying<00:05:04.599> to<00:05:04.629> say<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:04.960> can<00:05:05.110> start<00:05:05.349> and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
I'm trying to say is you can start and

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.499 
I'm trying to say is you can start and
end<00:05:05.710> on<00:05:05.800> different<00:05:06.250> notes<00:05:06.400> within<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.300> same

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
end on different notes within the same

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.059 
end on different notes within the same
triplet<00:05:07.960> which<00:05:08.440> will<00:05:08.590> give<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.860> whole<00:05:09.009> new

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
triplet which will give you a whole new

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.730 
triplet which will give you a whole new
triplet<00:05:09.669> but<00:05:10.090> with<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.389> same<00:05:10.599> three<00:05:10.870> notes<00:05:11.080> so

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
triplet but with the same three notes so

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.339 
triplet but with the same three notes so
the<00:05:11.919> sonny-boy<00:05:12.250> triplet<00:05:13.000> was<00:05:13.150> three<00:05:13.509> draw<00:05:13.810> 4

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
the sonny-boy triplet was three draw 4

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.279 
the sonny-boy triplet was three draw 4
blow<00:05:14.710> 4<00:05:14.740> draw<00:05:15.389> let's<00:05:16.389> take<00:05:16.629> those<00:05:16.780> same<00:05:17.020> three

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
blow 4 draw let's take those same three

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.499 
blow 4 draw let's take those same three
notes<00:05:17.440> but<00:05:17.979> start<00:05:18.310> on<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.460> different<00:05:18.879> different

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
notes but start on a different different

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.659 
notes but start on a different different
note<00:05:19.690> we'll<00:05:19.990> start<00:05:20.259> on<00:05:20.379> the<00:05:20.409> floor<00:05:20.680> draw<00:05:21.009> so

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
note we'll start on the floor draw so

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.839 
note we'll start on the floor draw so
we'll<00:05:21.819> go<00:05:21.940> for<00:05:22.300> draw<00:05:22.599> three<00:05:23.319> draw<00:05:23.550> four<00:05:24.550> blow

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
we'll go for draw three draw four blow

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.059 
we'll go for draw three draw four blow
and<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.690> will<00:05:25.840> sound<00:05:26.259> as<00:05:26.409> though<00:05:26.590> I'm<00:05:26.770> playing

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
and it will sound as though I'm playing

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.689 
and it will sound as though I'm playing
three<00:05:27.370> totally<00:05:27.880> different<00:05:28.199> notes<00:05:29.279> but<00:05:30.279> I'm

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
three totally different notes but I'm

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.459 
three totally different notes but I'm
really<00:05:31.240> just<00:05:31.419> playing<00:05:31.719> the<00:05:31.840> same<00:05:31.870> three<00:05:32.259> no

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
really just playing the same three no

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.529 
really just playing the same three no
it's<00:05:32.650> just<00:05:32.800> in<00:05:32.979> a<00:05:33.069> different<00:05:33.360> starting<00:05:34.360> and

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
it's just in a different starting and

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.930 
it's just in a different starting and
ending<00:05:34.779> on<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.930> different<00:05:35.289> note<00:05:35.500> or

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
ending on a different note or

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.969 
ending on a different note or
emphasizing<00:05:36.940> different<00:05:37.300> notes<00:05:37.740> so<00:05:38.740> I'll<00:05:38.830> play

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
emphasizing different notes so I'll play

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.529 
emphasizing different notes so I'll play
the<00:05:39.099> sunny<00:05:39.310> one<00:05:39.490> first<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.000> then<00:05:40.060> I'll<00:05:40.360> play

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
the sunny one first and then I'll play

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:46.769 
the sunny one first and then I'll play
the<00:05:40.690> new<00:05:40.840> one<00:05:41.020> Sonny<00:05:42.009> Boy<00:05:45.330> now<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.389> new<00:05:46.599> one

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
the new one Sonny Boy now the new one

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:53.610 
the new one Sonny Boy now the new one
starting<00:05:47.469> on<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.650> four<00:05:47.889> draw<00:05:52.409> and<00:05:53.409> you<00:05:53.500> know

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
starting on the four draw and you know

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.019 
starting on the four draw and you know
because<00:05:53.979> there's<00:05:54.190> that<00:05:54.340> blow<00:05:54.550> note<00:05:54.759> in<00:05:54.909> there

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
because there's that blow note in there

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.550 
because there's that blow note in there
you<00:05:55.150> can<00:05:55.270> go<00:05:55.389> fast<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:55.990> can<00:05:56.169> just<00:05:56.440> keep

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
you can go fast and you can just keep

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.469 
you can go fast and you can just keep
them<00:05:56.740> going

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.589 

so<00:06:03.479> something<00:06:03.810> like<00:06:03.840> that<00:06:04.190> and<00:06:05.190> as<00:06:06.150> I<00:06:06.419> was

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
so something like that and as I was

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.689 
so something like that and as I was
about<00:06:06.840> to<00:06:06.960> say<00:06:07.080> earlier<00:06:07.440> another<00:06:08.220> good<00:06:08.669> thing

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
about to say earlier another good thing

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.330 
about to say earlier another good thing
about<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:09.150> triplets<00:06:09.509> is<00:06:09.750> you<00:06:09.990> can<00:06:10.340> exchange

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
about the triplets is you can exchange

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.360 
about the triplets is you can exchange
or<00:06:11.879> interchange<00:06:12.750> notes<00:06:13.289> so<00:06:13.770> let's<00:06:14.009> go<00:06:14.220> with

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
or interchange notes so let's go with

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.960 
or interchange notes so let's go with
the<00:06:14.460> four<00:06:14.729> draw<00:06:15.000> three<00:06:15.539> draw<00:06:15.569> four<00:06:16.139> blow<00:06:16.440> and

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
the four draw three draw four blow and

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.309 
the four draw three draw four blow and
instead<00:06:17.970> of<00:06:18.030> I'll<00:06:18.509> play<00:06:18.750> about<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:18.960> couple

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
instead of I'll play about a couple

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.230 
instead of I'll play about a couple
times<00:06:19.530> through<00:06:19.919> and<00:06:20.129> then<00:06:20.699> what<00:06:20.879> we'll<00:06:20.970> do<00:06:21.120> is

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
times through and then what we'll do is

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.909 
times through and then what we'll do is
I'll<00:06:21.360> take<00:06:21.629> the<00:06:21.840> four<00:06:22.110> draw<00:06:22.349> out<00:06:22.560> and<00:06:22.800> I'll

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
I'll take the four draw out and I'll

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.610 
I'll take the four draw out and I'll
substitute<00:06:23.360> substitute<00:06:24.360> in<00:06:24.509> sorry<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:25.349> four

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
substitute substitute in sorry the four

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:36.589 
substitute substitute in sorry the four
draw<00:06:25.800> Bend<00:06:26.099> so<00:06:26.789> have<00:06:27.300> a<00:06:27.360> listen<00:06:27.569> for<00:06:27.810> that<00:06:35.599> so

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
draw Bend so have a listen for that so

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.300 
draw Bend so have a listen for that so
just<00:06:36.870> gives<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.259> listener<00:06:37.440> you<00:06:37.860> know<00:06:37.979> a<00:06:38.009> new

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
just gives the listener you know a new

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.550 
just gives the listener you know a new
something<00:06:39.300> new<00:06:39.449> to<00:06:39.690> listen<00:06:39.990> to<00:06:40.139> and<00:06:40.259> it's<00:06:40.379> less

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
something new to listen to and it's less

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.800 
something new to listen to and it's less
boring<00:06:40.860> for<00:06:40.979> their<00:06:41.250> ear<00:06:41.460> so<00:06:42.240> you<00:06:42.330> can<00:06:42.569> string

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
boring for their ear so you can string

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.909 
boring for their ear so you can string
them<00:06:42.930> together<00:06:43.080> you<00:06:43.500> can<00:06:43.620> play<00:06:43.800> them

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
them together you can play them

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.020 
them together you can play them
backwards<00:06:44.190> you<00:06:45.030> can<00:06:45.180> interchange<00:06:45.449> notes

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
backwards you can interchange notes

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.300 
backwards you can interchange notes
they're<00:06:48.030> very<00:06:48.330> versatile<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.199> if<00:06:49.379> you<00:06:49.590> keep

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
they're very versatile and if you keep
