00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 good at the very thing that's what you have for 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.799
 my shoulders already here and binary options i'm here 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.719
 I myself trade options including 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.030
 options I can show this construction 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.400
 which I now have on options 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 but this is not the abs he traded 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.930
 binary options have nothing to do with 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.210
 this option does not have what they 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.510
 traded for three months and binary options 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.090
 there 20 minutes live in what for the forceps he is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.679
 the real receipt did not trade five 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 minutes and minutes what is the first nitration 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.320
 horror how come we walk I 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.239
 I will show you how you can get a real option. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.760
 told to show us on the map too 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.030
 at the start like binary options there 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 slightly non- binary such 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:01:03.149
 well this is how he design now i 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:01:07.740
 I will show here for example the position well for example 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.580
 here's the next contract for example 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.650
 here i am in april 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.020
 put this current position on 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.420
 current contract that is calculated on the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 that the price will fall in whether in the left 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 the parties that is this here this 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 option this is design options if we 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.220
 take well let's know even how often 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.579
 a knife to another that was easier for you 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.619
 perceive the optional board is not that 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.840
 what are you moving averages throw it out 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.290
 all from the head that you are no sliding 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.470
 medium 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.110
 do not need only cold calculation optional 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.670
 the board here is how you see these options 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:56.000
 What if we take on futures rts 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.000
 evening with RTS Well, for example, let's 615 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.860
 and start for example throwing positions 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.890
 which I chose now is running 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:16.050
 say on kalah so here is 95 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.050
 purchase and in this still close 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.540
 an hour is now a flaw and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:48.070
 85 and we take one sell omit 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:49.390
 heel period from 5 sell about 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.670
 positions here so line up 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.190
 the position is formed that is, if I 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.090
 the price will now fall on futures rts 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.340
 over so again this is not 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.920
 the challenge of our current course is bad luck 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.840
 option especially not to climb axes now 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.420
 I did not give you, I just showed this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.810
 this is combinatorics i guess what if 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.519
 the price will go down here horizontal then 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.760
 my account will grow like this 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.410
 way up to the level here here is 85 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.430
 and then I will get a loss 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.810
 accordingly what do i need to do a 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.790
 Here I have a calculation that the price will fall to 85 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.010
 yaffs2 live on futures rts say yes 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.450
 give dear problems this level up 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.380
 it drops to 85 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.930
 and at this point I will be fixing 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.459
 your profit and that depends on 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.049
 volatility she is shown how well how is she 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.880
 will appear here or not appear 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.579
 such it is just one of the strategies 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.090
 strategies can be built like this 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.090
 the same thing is designed for a price drop 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.870
 more option boards so here still 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.329
 this position 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.609
 for example, this is something for example 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:14.430
 that the price will fall but if 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.430
 farther than 85 fly 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.629
 now of course a little bit i 'm afraid that there is 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.879
 with these real options you 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.460
 scare because in binary options 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.460
 show that everything is so simple there too 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.430
 I calculated that the price will go down 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.520
 to the left but when passing 85 I have here 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.409
 there will be a loss, but if the price goes further 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.979
 then I will start to appear 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.780
 profit than good such a design so 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.360
 what if I was mistaken 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.419
 and the price will not go to 80-ki fall here in 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.270
 this side will appear here 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.710
 profit i mean one way or 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.590
 the other side is important that the price at least 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.360
 would go somewhere for such moments 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.130
 this is the work of the sapsana 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.960
 at the stage let's say this when you haven't 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.860
 You know how to determine the price. 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.139
 useless and even more useless 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.389
 apply it just over trading 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.310
 signals to trade 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.370
 options minutes because the option is 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.130
 position trades need to know how 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.810
 accumulating liquidation is already forming 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.849
 such bigger bigger more global 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.009
 topics that are in the know 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.319
 bases discuss formation 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.180
 professional such positions here 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.940
 on this course we will work with you 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.909
 only speculative strategies bought 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.860
 sold and remember don't meddle now 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.210
 no options even in simple options 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.719
 don't need to lay out yet 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.330
 learn 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:45.360
 what you need to give now 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.849
 binary especially i see now century like u 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.500
 your eyes lit up at the sight of options 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.690
 but notice how complicated 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.150
 design i'm here i'm here so here abbas 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.060
 I did not see you in this porridge 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.919
 when i will erase binary options 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.289
 when it shows up here now and you 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.740
 win there 10 dollars or lose 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.800
 100 dollars or down and all this is not 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.110
 then this is a divorce scam and do not need to 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.599
 binary options play real 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.750
 binary real option and traded 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:18.060
 three months a month there are monthly 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.039
 segments will contract this month 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.590
 contract may contract same dream a 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.110
 here's the June contract and if its already 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.750
 You can now trade that is, until June at 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.849
 we still have more than three months already 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.550
 trade 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.349
 future and there will be formed and theta 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.159
 decay and the Greeks will work there and so 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:38.740
 further there it is not plowed him by 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:42.110
 options so now 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.999
 dream that you will be right away with 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.990
 the course on starting options is not unnecessary 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:47.719
 especially in the binary and 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.819
 binary team down but it's a scam but 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:52.249
 ok option this here is the formation 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:54.289
 designs for this need to know for 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.490
 this is not to build for that they need 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.709
 calculate and know how to work 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.939
 volatility a but it gives you more 

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:05.179
 do exactly this, they will not let 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:07.159
 so I have to calm down a little 

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:11.029
 I understand that my eyes are on fire 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:12.369
 on options but this but yes you can 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:15.379
 forgive for the site 

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:17.419
 binary options we have been there already 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:23.149
 of consciousness, too, can tell but 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:25.580
 look wonderful male here 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:26.059
 I think the saying is useful to everyone 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.509
 trader 

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:31.909
 no need to stick your bill where to 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.800
 the dog will thrust if you don't 

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:36.110
 Know the cards that worked principle. 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.759
 work and analyze binary options us 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.289
 one of the following I will show 

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.509
 why they work why no no 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:43.189
 works and so there need to win and how 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:44.449
 no need to survive and elder and all there 

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:46.459
 All the arguments naturally will not be with me 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.199
 against because i'm a principle 

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:50.569
 will not return events about they are and 

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:53.659
 forex opponent especially since it is not 

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:56.149
 implemented in our countries and cis countries 

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:59.059
 so if you teacher says no 

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:01.999
 meddle take it easy do not meddle and first 

00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:04.039
 study the price movement realizing the joy and 

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:07.659
 wish I would like to get tomorrow 

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:07.659
 a million quieter
