00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.819
 are some of the tricks of the best 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.819
 chile skateboarder 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.670
 braulio sagas already more than 10 years in his 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.470
 friendship with skateboarding and although 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.340
 He has always been a fan of all kinds of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 sports has never abandoned his skateboard 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.630
 in the course of the guide were the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.090
 first three years doing all the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.770
 sports after the third year I already had 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 13 years and I spent 100 percent 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.279
 I found it and I found it very 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.160
 entertaining since all my friends in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.449
 the neighborhood they were engaged then was 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.610
 super sexy for me was super 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.610
 entertaining my mom liked then 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.199
 he always knew it was very difficult 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.970
 succeed in Chile so from small 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.500
 He took his bags and party to try 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.839
 luck abroad when I was 15 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.089
 years I left because a life from europe to 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.030
 malmÃ¶ sweden I went to run to a 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.790
 world and it was his own to try his luck 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.560
 truth was how 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.720
 see what I can do is that where 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.880
 I can get there then that was my first 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.770
 goal and if he did not meet much help 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.000
 a lot of friends because this one to know that 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.170
 it was the main one that he was the one who 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.540
 insisted is that it is decided 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.810
 then thanks to him I can continue and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.550
 could continue what I am the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.229
 good performances of recent years 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.790
 have made the national skater 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.160
 get the 10th place in the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.650
 world ranking of 2011 the year 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.540
 last I went up sixth place because it counts 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.830
 that this 2013 ends the three 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.350
 first always all damage all 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.650
 year I gave my best to give a 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.990
 better ranking in the world as in the 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.350
 2002 is acting in 11 places now the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.550
 2012 I got in sixth place in the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.290
 world and in 2011 I had the tenth place 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.330
 then every year I'm improving then 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.830
 for me I want to be more and more 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.680
 training is that they were two months in 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.119
 skate to reach higher than 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.340
 live audio in california for two 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.170
 years and for him it was an important step in 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.360
 his development as a professional although the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.070
 22-year-old girl knows that the advance in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.750
 structure has made the sport 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.820
 grow in the country 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.550
 when it was in 2007 first part of 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.990
 cement so that the kings there where 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.710
 everybody started practicing is that 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.570
 began to feel as real is that she 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.040
 that could go in one place and practices that 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.650
 safe and sound that nobody should bother 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.330
 nobody is going to run over there then 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.640
 where yes I think it started more than 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 stronger in 2007 thanks to the first 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.820
 bar and now in 2013 we have a lot 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.070
 of skype and I want there to be more escape 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.209
 to be able to much more people share and 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.550
 ahead 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.770
 challenges for the Chilean sportsman is 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.270
 so clear the horizon has some 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.790
 World Championships to be played 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:56.970
 next year in usa and france between 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.380
 others what comes next year are 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.810
 the worlds also that I'm going to 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.940
 continue competing representing 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.500
 chile also that in the end did not represent 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.270
 I represent chile, I think it's my 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.890
 name my brand but now go 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.600
 we incorporated that what Chile already 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.700
 I do not know if you have given me support as 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.690
 for example the government a pod of 0 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.910
 support in that sense 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.310
 but if we take that Chilean and be 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.110
 representing outside in the history of 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.480
 a compatriot who does patio in the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.430
 USA that has taken the name of Chile to 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.080
 the highest of the world sport and that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.080
 still waiting to continue rising 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.000
 or yes
