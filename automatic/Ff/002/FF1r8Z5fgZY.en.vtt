00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 About

 so what are you doing sector you have to have there a little more 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.269

 why are you crying 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.310
 but the hard part is knowing something else 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.910
 so you're starting with pokerstars bronze 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.290

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.960
 I prepared white knight 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.140
 here is a previous film in parentheses cgt 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.930
 in the sky a little bit of salt the descent or a portability motorcycle 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.370
 one of his sons 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.310
 4 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.400
 not so far his timber withdrawal thirty second chance at 34 seconds 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.580
 separate you can repeat the duration whatsoever for the om 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 she finds herself facing 30 shots on goal 5-4 you can in 30 seconds 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.229
 you can leave more feathers like that by his star 1000 seconds 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.220
 if we could scroll 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.500
 and in fact salah does not know how to get out from the left side of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.270
 the screen 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.420
 on the right side so all that so that's what what 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.910
 the 30 seconds pixi plus 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.550
 so here's me I do not do any more colors could not predict how 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.380
 do when possible 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.490
 today 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730
 how do you explain it because I like it 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.980
 so the first hen we do not know anymore 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.490
 this track like that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490
 you have love will it be 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.750
 yet flow then the fact is what is it to say simply if you 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 little ones start slowly it was a little jar 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.720
 so laurent joffrin little consecration at any time on this 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.890
 day the principle 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.500
 What does it give 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.510
 this hairdresser 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.840
 the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.729
 but the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.629
 miguel press throughout the trial 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.440
 4 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.379
 Why 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.120
 especially as the floor of water and the text which means all the harm of 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.089
 returning officer 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.579
 so when only a few pockets of personal resistance remain 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.589
 the notion of europe with its superb explain the problem 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:35.779
 but why I hang work that I find it distorts the sound but 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.429
 after each his tastes 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.249
 so the women you're ready to you're done you say it's good there 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.230
 I go 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.319
 it is safe to export 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 so on the export at the base you got a little club like that 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.369
 especially since I could do these little beasts 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.729
 on the phone you made your ticket directly expert all and 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:55.939
 all 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.839
 this story 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:05.749
 so ap m if we could no longer the title of the soup mug it's true it's 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:06.599
 a little bit 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.599
 do not do it do not touch the worst either we are happy 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.349
 here to put it I mean more but it's not serious or in place 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.719
 superb 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
 there they put her in action 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.429
 nb may 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:29.029
 it can be very useful besides the song is irreproachable for 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.469
 you must accept 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.439
 but hey you have to find your only current title song and the 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.279
 sacrosanct and not very fan 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.059
 the 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.059
 I may have surprised and you're done here you go 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.549
 so as you like it's super simple 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.539
 that is, without blinking 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:50.359
 this is the fault of other feet to move to twists analysis 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.359
 absent since 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.069
 this guy c see them 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.449
 it was absolutely great too 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.719
 that's what happens
