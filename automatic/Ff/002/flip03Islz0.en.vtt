bronze brick and today I've just noticed

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.790 
bronze brick and today I've just noticed
that<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.680> new<00:00:49.949> green<00:00:50.610> shoots<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.800> poking

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
out if you haven't done it you can still

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.299 
out if you haven't done it you can still
do<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.830> tell<00:00:56.070> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
difference between the canes because the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.189 
difference between the canes because the
new<00:01:00.540> growth<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:02.010> lighter<00:01:02.670> brown<00:01:03.000> than<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
old growth so just go down to the base

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.540 
old growth so just go down to the base
of<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:06.960> old<00:01:07.080> growth<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.890> cut<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> out

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.270 
of the old growth and just cut it out
and<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> summer<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.890> I've<00:01:11.009> beautiful

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and in the summer when I've beautiful

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.560 
and in the summer when I've beautiful
raspberries<00:01:12.860> now<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.039> little<00:01:14.250> tip<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.759> you<00:01:14.880> if

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you find it difficult to be organized

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.719 
you find it difficult to be organized
with<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.700> seeds<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:19.310> one<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> plot

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
with your seeds then one of the plot

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.200 
with your seeds then one of the plot
holes<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> done<00:01:21.300> here<00:01:21.649> they<00:01:22.649> save<00:01:23.070> these

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.290 

washing<00:01:27.210> powder<00:01:27.690> little<00:01:28.470> boxes<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.100> I've<00:01:30.060> got

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
washing powder little boxes and I've got

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.809 
washing powder little boxes and I've got
about<00:01:30.479> 12<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.680> find<00:01:32.009> because<00:01:32.610> they

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
about 12 and what I find because they

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.730 
about 12 and what I find because they
come<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.090> different<00:01:33.209> sizes<00:01:33.500> there's<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
come in different sizes there's that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
come in different sizes there's that
size<00:01:35.039> which<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:35.819> would<00:01:35.970> say<00:01:36.149> is<00:01:36.179> small<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.229> then

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
size which I would say is small and then

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.660 
size which I would say is small and then
there's<00:01:38.039> another<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:43.160> there's<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.399> one

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
there's another one there's this one

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.660 
there's another one there's this one
which<00:01:44.849> is<00:01:45.000> slightly<00:01:45.599> bigger<00:01:46.470> size<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:49.640> what<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
which is slightly bigger size and what I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.219 
which is slightly bigger size and what I
do<00:01:50.819> is<00:01:51.179> I<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.560> box<00:01:52.979> per<00:01:53.340> month<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
do is I have one box per month and I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.320 
do is I have one box per month and I
just<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.679> through<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:55.890> my<00:01:55.950> seeds<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> put

where<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.899> need<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.229> sown<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
where they need to be sown so if this

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.240

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
heat certainly worked I'm going to keep

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.920 
heat certainly worked I'm going to keep
my<00:05:16.600> potatoes<00:05:17.110> covered<00:05:17.880> because<00:05:18.880> we're<00:05:19.780> gonna

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
my potatoes covered because we're gonna

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.710 
my potatoes covered because we're gonna
have<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.350> cold<00:05:21.100> snap<00:05:21.370> for<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:22.090> few<00:05:22.360> days<00:05:22.540> I

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
have this cold snap for a few days I

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.950 
have this cold snap for a few days I
think<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.200> as<00:05:23.980> long<00:05:24.130> as<00:05:24.190> I<00:05:24.370> come<00:05:24.700> over<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.180> just

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
think so as long as I come over and just

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.380 
think so as long as I come over and just
make<00:05:26.170> sure<00:05:26.200> that<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.830> heater<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:27.970> done<00:05:28.180> I

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
make sure that the heater is done I

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.450 
make sure that the heater is done I
think<00:05:28.810> that's<00:05:29.110> all<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:29.290> can<00:05:29.440> do<00:05:29.710> there's<00:05:30.340> no

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
think that's all I can do there's no

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.020 
think that's all I can do there's no
point

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.750 

well<00:06:31.380> there's<00:06:31.710> nothing<00:06:31.950> else<00:06:32.040> to<00:06:32.250> do<00:06:32.370> today<00:06:32.550> so

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
well there's nothing else to do today so

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.850 
well there's nothing else to do today so
it's<00:06:33.030> a<00:06:33.090> very<00:06:33.270> short<00:06:33.330> program<00:06:33.870> as<00:06:34.350> you<00:06:34.500> can<00:06:34.650> see

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
it's a very short program as you can see

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.280 
it's a very short program as you can see
the<00:06:35.460> snow<00:06:35.520> is<00:06:35.940> really<00:06:35.970> throwing<00:06:36.630> it<00:06:36.870> down<00:06:37.080> now

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290

I think it's actually getting a lot
worse<00:06:39.360> than<00:06:39.440> getting<00:06:40.440> better<00:06:40.850> but<00:06:41.850> hopefully

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
worse than getting better but hopefully

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.660 
worse than getting better but hopefully
by<00:06:42.330> next<00:06:42.540> week<00:06:42.930> the<00:06:43.140> Sun<00:06:43.530> will<00:06:43.710> be<00:06:43.740> out<00:06:43.980> and<00:06:44.220> we
