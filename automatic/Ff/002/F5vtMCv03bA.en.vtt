that<00:03:14.320> folds<00:03:14.799> up<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:17.530> I'm<00:03:17.590> gonna<00:03:17.709> have<00:03:17.890> to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040

that folds up I think I'm gonna have to
just<00:03:18.640> take<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.970> camera<00:03:19.750> off<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.049> stand

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.319
