00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
game called the plan in which i believe

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.270 
game called the plan in which i believe
you<00:01:41.240> play<00:01:41.480> a<00:01:41.510> fly<00:01:42.050> they've<00:01:42.650> just<00:01:42.830> released<00:01:43.010> a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
you play a fly they've just released a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.700 
you play a fly they've just released a
gameplay<00:01:43.730> trailer<00:01:44.150> but<00:01:44.420> i<00:01:44.870> think<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:45.410> somebody

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
gameplay trailer but i think to somebody

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.290 
gameplay trailer but i think to somebody
who<00:01:45.860> wasn't<00:01:46.130> really<00:01:46.550> paying<00:01:46.700> attention<00:01:46.850> you'd

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
who wasn't really paying attention you'd

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.970 
who wasn't really paying attention you'd
be<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.900> was<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.290> cinematic<00:01:48.830> that

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
be like that was just a cinematic that

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.460 
be like that was just a cinematic that
wasn't<00:01:49.220> an<00:01:49.310> actual<00:01:49.460> gameplay<00:01:50.390> trailer<00:01:50.930> but<00:01:51.440> i

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
wasn't an actual gameplay trailer but i

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.960 
wasn't an actual gameplay trailer but i
believe<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:51.980> actually<00:01:52.100> like<00:01:52.430> control<00:01:52.940> a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
believe that you actually like control a

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.150 
believe that you actually like control a
fly<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.660> it<00:01:53.810> does<00:01:53.990> an<00:01:54.110> exploration<00:01:54.440> of<00:01:54.860> life

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
fly and it does an exploration of life

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.940 
fly and it does an exploration of life
and<00:01:55.400> death<00:01:55.580> etc<00:01:55.820> etc<00:01:56.180> for<00:01:56.810> me<00:01:56.930> i<00:01:56.960> really<00:01:57.560> like

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
and death etc etc for me i really like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.010 
and death etc etc for me i really like
when<00:01:58.490> game<00:01:58.700> development<00:01:59.060> companies<00:01:59.480> do<00:01:59.780> this

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
when game development companies do this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.510 
when game development companies do this
when<00:02:00.470> they<00:02:00.590> have<00:02:00.770> one<00:02:01.040> game<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.250> they're

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
when they have one game that they're

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.220 
when they have one game that they're
