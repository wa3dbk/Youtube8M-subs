00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
comfy fit there we'll come back to these

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.479 
comfy fit there we'll come back to these
in<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.640> second<00:03:08.380> come<00:03:09.380> right<00:03:09.560> down<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.010> waist

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
in a second come right down to the waist

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.580 
in a second come right down to the waist
belt<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.209> stay<00:03:11.420> together<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.380> this<00:03:12.440> is

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
belt and you stay together and this is

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.420 
belt and you stay together and this is
why<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.739> keep<00:03:12.890> everything<00:03:13.130> as<00:03:13.280> loose<00:03:13.400> as

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
why you keep everything as loose as

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.610 
why you keep everything as loose as
possible<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.150> can<00:03:14.299> simply<00:03:14.569> put<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.500> that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
possible so you can simply put on that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.160 
possible so you can simply put on that
like<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.310> get<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.489> best<00:03:16.610> fit<00:03:16.790> for<00:03:16.819> you<00:03:17.170> come

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
comfortable you're sure that it's not so

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.220

comfy fit again this does want to be

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.920 
comfy fit again this does want to be
around<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.000> chest<00:03:47.209> area<00:03:47.359> so<00:03:47.630> you're<00:03:47.780> just

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
around the chest area so you're just

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.620 
around the chest area so you're just
like<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.160> as<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:49.970> see<00:03:50.180> here<00:03:50.329> there<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.510> it

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
like so and as you see here there is it

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.500 
like so and as you see here there is it
a<00:03:50.660> loop<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.500> is<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.980> safety<00:03:52.370> measure<00:03:52.819> so<00:03:53.389> it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
a loop that is a safety measure so it

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.849 
a loop that is a safety measure so it
shouldn't<00:03:53.750> be<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.230> tight<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.709> it's

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
shouldn't be so tight that it's

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.199 
shouldn't be so tight that it's
tightening<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.310> like<00:03:55.489> so<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.880> should<00:03:56.030> always

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
tightening that like so it should always

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.789 
tightening that like so it should always
have<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.660> loop<00:03:56.870> system<00:03:57.049> there<00:03:57.380> that's<00:03:57.620> just<00:03:57.739> to

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
have a loop system there that's just to

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.110 
have a loop system there that's just to
let<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.040> know<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.489> fitting<00:03:58.819> you<00:03:58.910> well

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
let you know that it is fitting you well

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.110 
let you know that it is fitting you well
that's<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.500> simple<00:04:00.920> just<00:04:01.430> turn<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:02.030> the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
that's it that simple just turn to the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.569 
that's it that simple just turn to the
side<00:04:02.299> you<00:04:02.359> can<00:04:02.540> see<00:04:02.720> again<00:04:02.959> see<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.650> free

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
side you can see again see that free

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.819 
side you can see again see that free
flow<00:04:04.790> back<00:04:05.329> system<00:04:05.720> there<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.290> ensure<00:04:06.530> there's

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
flow back system there to ensure there's

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.250 
flow back system there to ensure there's

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
and get inside then you see nice and fit

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.620 
and get inside then you see nice and fit
all<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.680> way<00:04:09.709> around<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.329> please<00:04:11.329> take<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.569> look
