00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.459 
training we call it so if anybody
starting<00:01:54.310> from<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.670> scratch<00:01:54.789> will<00:01:55.569> know<00:01:56.319> they

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
starting from the scratch will know they

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.050 
starting from the scratch will know they
have<00:01:56.499> to<00:01:56.710> go<00:01:56.859> through<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.249> restroom<00:01:57.609> basics

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
have to go through the restroom basics

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.029 
have to go through the restroom basics
and<00:01:58.240> food<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.659> safety<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.200> begin<00:01:59.710> with<00:01:59.859> and

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
and food and safety to begin with and

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.069 
and food and safety to begin with and
then<00:02:00.490> we'll<00:02:00.700> put<00:02:01.060> them<00:02:01.179> in<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.479> training<00:02:01.869> for

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
then we'll put them in the training for

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.260 
then we'll put them in the training for
any<00:02:02.649> particular<00:02:02.890> station<00:02:03.490> for<00:02:03.670> example<00:02:04.090> for

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
any particular station for example for

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.380 
any particular station for example for
the<00:02:04.329> dough<00:02:04.479> making<00:02:05.109> so<00:02:05.679> they'll<00:02:05.859> be

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the dough making so they'll be

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
the dough making so they'll be
training<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:06.810> first<00:02:07.080> one<00:02:07.350> month<00:02:07.590> therefore

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
training for first one month therefore

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.669 
training for first one month therefore
making<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.330> dough<00:02:09.479> once<00:02:10.080> they're<00:02:10.259> certified

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
making the dough once they're certified

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.860 
making the dough once they're certified
then<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.250> move<00:02:11.490> them<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> next<00:02:12.240> station

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
then we move them to the next station

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.380 
then we move them to the next station
could<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.470> make<00:02:14.250> station<00:02:16.400> yeah<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.730> very

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
could be make station yeah it is very

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.590 
could be make station yeah it is very
simple<00:02:18.690> process<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.060> next<00:02:21.240> thing<00:02:21.450> we're

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
simple process so the next thing we're

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.199 
simple process so the next thing we're
going<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> do<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.140> oil<00:02:22.650> some<00:02:22.980> pens<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.820> simply

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
going to do is oil some pens so simply

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.800 
going to do is oil some pens so simply
we<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.600> put<00:02:24.810> two<00:02:25.560> pumps<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.400> oil<00:02:26.810> into

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
we have to put two pumps of oil into

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.650 
we have to put two pumps of oil into
each<00:02:28.020> end<00:02:28.290> right<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.010> then<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.520> stick<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
each end right and then just stick it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
each end right and then just stick it
like<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:31.080> once<00:02:31.650> they<00:02:31.830> are<00:02:31.950> trained<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
like that once they are trained on the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.580 
like that once they are trained on the
one<00:02:32.580> station<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.060> call<00:02:33.239> them<00:02:33.420> expert<00:02:33.780> once

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
one station we call them expert once

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.190 
one station we call them expert once
they<00:02:34.830> are<00:02:35.130> trained<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.880> all<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> station

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
they are trained on all of the station

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.100 
they are trained on all of the station
we<00:02:37.860> call<00:02:38.040> them<00:02:38.190> expert<00:02:38.610> good<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.959> an

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
we call them expert good so on an

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.740 
we call them expert good so on an
average<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.620> takes<00:02:40.860> about<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.430> month<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.300> clean

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
average it takes about a month to clean

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.500 
average it takes about a month to clean
them<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.080> one<00:02:43.290> station<00:02:44.180> when<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.330> dough<00:02:45.480> is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
them on one station when the dough is

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.080 
them on one station when the dough is
ready<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:46.530> cut<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.130> correct<00:02:47.280> weight<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
ready it's cut to the correct weight and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.229 
ready it's cut to the correct weight and
then<00:02:48.720> rolled<00:02:49.050> into<00:02:49.350> patties<00:02:49.920> okay<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.030> feed

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
then rolled into patties okay so feed

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.380 
then rolled into patties okay so feed
the<00:02:51.360> ferry<00:02:51.570> from<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.930> top<00:02:52.080> over<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.209> this

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the ferry from the top over and so this

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.970 
the ferry from the top over and so this
is<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> length<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
is for the length and this is for the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.090 
is for the length and this is for the
width<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> exact<00:02:58.200> wrong<00:02:58.380> shape<00:02:58.650> James

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
width to get the exact wrong shape James

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.190 
width to get the exact wrong shape James
so<00:02:59.280> that's<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.610> reason<00:02:59.940> why<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.019> make

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
so that's a reason why we have to make

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.320 
so that's a reason why we have to make
it<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:02.130> know<00:03:02.250> complete<00:03:02.640> ground<00:03:02.910> channel

high motivation good actually

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.660 
high motivation good actually
communication<00:03:43.570> skills<00:03:43.870> obviously<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.010> the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
communication skills obviously the the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.730 
communication skills obviously the the
personal<00:03:46.480> presentation<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.200> hygiene<00:03:47.650> are

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
personal presentation and hygiene are

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.460 
personal presentation and hygiene are
important<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.580> because<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.630> reason<00:03:49.870> why<00:03:49.990> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
important and because the reason why the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.260 
important and because the reason why the
thing<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.800> we<00:03:50.980> do<00:03:51.160> our<00:03:51.190> own<00:03:51.550> training<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.090> job

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
thing is we do our own training on job

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.450 
thing is we do our own training on job
so<00:03:52.870> that's<00:03:53.020> why<00:03:53.200> they<00:03:53.350> are<00:03:53.530> not<00:03:53.980> required<00:03:54.160> to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
so that's why they are not required to

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.330 
so that's why they are not required to
have<00:03:54.550> any<00:03:54.910> specific<00:03:55.480> education<00:03:56.050> yeah<00:03:56.770> hold<00:03:57.220> it
