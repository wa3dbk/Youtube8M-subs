Albert Kraus

00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:07.517
---Tell us about the match.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:16.814
I'm happy I won. I was confident.

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:30.525
---You really used those low kicks.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:01:01.544
I used punches too, but I got a good low kick in at the beginning.

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:12.993
Then I felt kicks were better to go for.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.800
---It must be hard to fight someone who is retiring.

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:27.774
It was different than usual. I respect him so it's too bad he's retiring.

00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:51.517
I tried to make sure it was a good fight for him to retire with.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:39.542
---Why did you bring your kids?

00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:55.784
They just happened to be out of school.

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.716
---Did you talk to Takeda after the match?

00:04:41.794 --> 00:04:47.381
I said "Kozo Takeda is number one! Ichiban!"
