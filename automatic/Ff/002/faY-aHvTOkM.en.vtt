exploded and realized that we're all
just<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.530> ball<00:00:55.830> of<00:00:55.860> energy<00:00:56.160> waiting<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> explode

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
just a ball of energy waiting to explode

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.900 
just a ball of energy waiting to explode
we<00:00:58.710> played<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.070> first<00:00:59.280> show<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.700> it<00:00:59.790> was

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
just chaos like none of us had ever

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.110 
just chaos like none of us had ever
known<00:01:01.769> in<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> band<00:01:02.370> before<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:02.970> just

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
known in a band before and it was just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.230 
known in a band before and it was just
completely<00:01:03.690> natural<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.290> stage<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.240> got

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
completely natural and stage like I got

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.999 
completely natural and stage like I got
what's<00:01:06.450> happening<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> thing<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.530> it's

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
what's happening kind of thing and it's

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.010 
what's happening kind of thing and it's
just<00:01:08.160> always<00:01:08.369> been<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.240> same<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.750> there

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
just always been the same from there

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
just always been the same from there
really<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.470> kind<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.400> just

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
really it's kind of I think it's just

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820 
really it's kind of I think it's just
you<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> certain<00:01:12.720> chemistry<00:01:12.930> between<00:01:13.380> four

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
you get a certain chemistry between four

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:40.969 
you get a certain chemistry between four
people

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.380 

it's<00:01:41.979> generally<00:01:42.340> great<00:01:42.610> shows<00:01:42.880> all<00:01:43.090> about<00:01:43.300> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
it's generally great shows all about the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.080 
it's generally great shows all about the
atmosphere<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.110> like<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:45.040> that's<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.880> thing

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
atmosphere and like it that's the thing

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.230 
atmosphere and like it that's the thing
that<00:01:46.869> can<00:01:47.080> be<00:01:47.650> instantly<00:01:48.070> kind<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.030> buzzing

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
that can be instantly kind of buzzing

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.350 
that can be instantly kind of buzzing
from<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.020> offset<00:01:50.170> due<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.979> crowd<00:01:51.280> or<00:01:51.700> it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
from the offset due to the crowd or it

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.109 
from the offset due to the crowd or it
can<00:01:52.540> be<00:01:52.660> something<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.500> kind<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.130> slowly

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
can be something that is kind of slowly

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.950 
can be something that is kind of slowly
kind<00:01:56.050> of<00:01:56.259> cooked<00:01:57.220> up<00:01:57.490> from<00:01:58.360> us<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.869> know

like<00:03:30.680> i<00:03:30.799> can<00:03:30.950> think<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.190> most<00:03:31.310> important

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
like i can think the most important

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.860 
like i can think the most important
thing<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.030> everybody<00:03:32.450> has<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.599> feel

thing is that everybody has to feel

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.479 
thing is that everybody has to feel
invested<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.860> like<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.129> part<00:03:34.370> of

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
invested in it and like this part of

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.399 
invested in it and like this part of
them<00:03:34.640> in<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.909> and<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.140> means<00:03:36.290> something

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
them in it and that it means something

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.710 
them in it and that it means something
to<00:03:36.799> them<00:03:36.920> as<00:03:37.129> well<00:03:39.700> it's<00:03:40.700> been<00:03:41.299> great<00:03:41.330> because

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
to them as well it's been great because

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.900 
to them as well it's been great because
it's<00:03:41.959> just<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.560> like<00:03:43.129> no<00:03:43.310> other<00:03:43.519> tool<00:03:43.760> we've
