00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.640
 or the one of our tablet I am and access 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.890
 exists here to sell us the bike with 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.740
 a game called author and bass violins 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.839
 perfect that basically good comes 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.429
 perfect and good violence and you will say and 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.450
 why are you coming to sell us the motorcycle? 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.789
 I have been paid 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.660
 they do not pay me godin they do not pay me 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.260
 they 're going to pay, come on, if they pay me 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.150
 Welcome be but basically the game 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.439
 came to sell oslo because it is not 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.910
 too well known you have seen the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.410
 some big youtuber but in plan 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 running that one and I do not think it's a 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.770
 game that deserves to laugh at him because I 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.770
 it looks like a bestial game 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.520
 basically beastly or not good to be 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.990
 radiant difficult what you want bestial 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.700
 and they came whole because of that because 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.810
 I would like you to see it 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.950
 at least I'll try it because it's a 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.770
 free game 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.240
 you download it weighs almost nothing and nothing 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.650
 throw some little games to see how it is 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.120
 gives you first in free play because it's going 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.640
 to cost a lot to do the tutorial yes 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.990
 sure to do it because it's already going 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.220
 to like when you see another you're going to 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.590
 be freaking out with the things you know 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.810
 do then you will see that it is not true 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.580
 but good and good as you see has free 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.680
 play multiplayer 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.510
 this beast is very good is how you are going 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.190
 winning tory credits that is like the 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.570
 game currency and with which you are going 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.850
 buying new clothes to see here this 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.080
 it is not anything pro this is the one that comes 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.670
 precisely except for the ghost 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.310
 green and because if I get blood and I 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.600
 blood comes out green 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.399
 and good some little thing if there is nothing 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.920
 you see this and well they have multiplayer 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.930
 here with the other rooms the mod 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.149
 because there are so many styles of 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.960
 game I like the most is aikido 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:37.179
 but there are many there, well sir 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.220
 there is a brutality and even of parkour 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.659
 because there are you can do careers seen 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.340
 what's in the boats are very 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.159
 ok but they are very difficult because I 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.689
 I say it is very difficult to learn to walk 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.049
 because the combat I will explain how 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.459
 you see this little ghost that there is here the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.869
 ghostly is the movement to see 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.420
 for seven rounds all in turns 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.250
 the shifts do not go to one and then book yes 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.319
 we do not win at the same time you have a time to 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.990
 choose all the movements for it 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.909
 so in the project all this and you see that 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.060
 the ghost has changed now if it comes out 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.649
 if it comes out but okay then this has 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 that activate muscles in a way or 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.610
 another to do one thing or another 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.260
 you see that a single change of muscle looks 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.420
 you see right now he does this but if something 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.250
 well and I directly kick a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.990
 only change affects a lot 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.250
 so good as you are watching here 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:31.310
 to give it up is not a game , I'm telling you 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.890
 very difficult to fight for my taste 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.470
 It's great, what I would highlight 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.610
 this game is that for my taste not in a 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.380
 principle does not seem like a game to me 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.450
 it looked more like a combat engine 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.550
 because I think it really is very 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.070
 well the graphic aspect right now 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.810
 I have a minimum quality but it's nothing 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.420
 especially not me that's fine 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.590
 like it but it's nothing awful 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.450
 the shadows yes that is very cool in 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.310
 good reality 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.540
 I really do not think it's the look 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.430
 It emphasizes in appearance that this 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.930
 game is that you can do 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.370
 exactly the movement you want 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.709
 right now I do not know how to do exactly 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.950
 movement that wants or joke'm very 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.620
 I am bad in the online I am already a belt 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.319
 green if you do not know the belts or 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.379
 stream and good I teach you some replay 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.060
 if I wanted to teach some so that 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.709
 You said good reason to play 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.900
 will not because he will not sell the motorcycle 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.269
 Well look at this would be what it is capable 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.700
 to do with a time to play either 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.750
 I say that if you want a lot but from 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.250
 then now I can not 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.769
 do this this would be three people 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.720
 playing in this case are the same but 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.939
 oblivion and oblige by series of points 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.269
 it's worth people can qualify if there 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.980
 falls and these things but you the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.269
 combats itself if nobody was disqualified 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.669
 or by points the one that gets the most points 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.230
 wins in this case I think none of 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.459
 the two were disqualified chooses picked 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.500
 because this is one of the most 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.719
 I like it because they fight the two as you see 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.180
 great as well as you see the texture of 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.650
 these are different because good to a 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.980
 series textures you can buy with the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.629
 toriles that I have told you and also for a 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.010
 series of thor crisis and credits that 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.810
 I find it much more profitable thus make 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.480
 your own texture 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.870
 that would be like to see if I remember any 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.870
 from here 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.740
 could this be for example so there 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.260
 many look you see this is a texture 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.570
 of the green ones there, as you see 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.150
 it's horrendous but the fact is that you're still 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.710
 in a phobic texture and you see a piece of 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.880
 crack that tears the head a blow 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.890
 Well basically that's a game 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.890
 very violent but you have to think that 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.840
 I have seen that this few people and that 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.030
 like to know how to do more adjust and do 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.370
 for you a moment I'm not going to 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.370
 do first I want you to try it 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.320
 tell me if you have tried please 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.210
 try it seriously you will like it 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.810
 not everyone if you do not like it is that 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.990
 You are a panda of Spanish person os 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.760
 may not like but good 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.670
 I would love that you too 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.800
 will like it because if it were like that and if I 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.330
 improve a bit the same I do a series 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.360
 of tutorials if it improves a little bit 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.060
 I would give a series of tutorials 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.550
 in Spanish there are not any are in 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.259
 English some that neither much and in 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.370
 Portuguese do not ask me why but 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.960
 in Spanish there is none so 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.360
 I would like to be the first to do it 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.639
 here in the Spanish food if not you 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.419
 like and if I'm not able to do it 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.040
 I do not do it but if you like it 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.540
 was able to do it safe I wanted to 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.300
 the occasional tournament with the odd occasion 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.160
 prize that is very good here in the 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.380
 multiple since we have it so nothing 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.360
 I'm going to stop rolling 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.800
 quite a lot has talked about today 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.590
 thanks I hope all this video 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.820
 random that can stop being random if 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.420
 you want it if you want more 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.850
 more stories you say below 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.030
 It would be advisable not to say no 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.010
 you want more without trying the game but if 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.020
 you think it is not necessary to prove what 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.290
 place you have seen we look like a half 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.490
 of the game so I'm happy for you 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.590
 tell me what they do to me 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.030
 I really like it so nothing thank you very much 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.440
 I already said goodbye before but you turn me 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.970
 ask wait we liked it if it's like that 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.090
 remember to give like favorites 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.610
 subscribe and until next time 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.940
 misguided to tell you one thing in the game 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.400
 it has sound obviously but with my 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.260
 piece of computer you know you do not 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.410
 he could get the sound out so I'll put him 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.210
 I put the bottom music oo low 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.180
 I do not put anything I leave my voice quietly 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.650
 so without further delay 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.650
 see you guys bye bye bye
