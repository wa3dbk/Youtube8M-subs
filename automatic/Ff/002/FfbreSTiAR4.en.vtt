00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
sounding I don't know why it sounds very

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.620

bright<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:22.000> you're<00:01:22.090> gonna<00:01:22.179> find<00:01:22.450> out<00:01:22.570> how

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
bright and you're gonna find out how

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.389 
bright and you're gonna find out how
bright<00:01:23.109> but<00:01:23.380> it's<00:01:23.560> not<00:01:23.770> right<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.280> point

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
bright but it's not right to the point

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.160 
bright but it's not right to the point
where<00:01:24.670> it's<00:01:24.820> ridiculous<00:01:25.420> it's<00:01:25.600> bright<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.079> the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
where it's ridiculous it's bright to the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
where it's ridiculous it's bright to the
point<00:01:26.380> where<00:01:26.500> it's<00:01:26.619> oh<00:01:26.799> yeah<00:01:27.130> crunchy

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.820 

so<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.390> does<00:01:55.630> sound<00:01:55.870> a<00:01:55.900> little<00:01:55.930> bright<00:01:56.320> right

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
so it does sound a little bright right

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.220 
so it does sound a little bright right
like<00:01:57.130> I'm<00:01:57.340> not<00:01:57.520> completely<00:01:58.030> deaf<00:01:58.450> or<00:01:58.930> anything

like I'm not completely deaf or anything
I<00:01:59.440> find<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.130> these<00:02:00.340> pickups<00:02:00.790> don't<00:02:00.970> have

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
I find that these pickups don't have

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.170 
I find that these pickups don't have
that<00:02:01.420> much<00:02:01.690> bass<00:02:02.400> which<00:02:03.400> is<00:02:03.460> important<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.060> me

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
that much bass which is important to me

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.060 
that much bass which is important to me

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
and in a previous couple of reviews I've

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.870 
and in a previous couple of reviews I've
been<00:02:08.590> able<00:02:08.680> to<00:02:08.890> get<00:02:09.010> those<00:02:09.100> low<00:02:09.340> notes<00:02:09.580> really

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
been able to get those low notes really

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.240 
been able to get those low notes really
easily<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.300> sound<00:02:10.690> like<00:02:10.930> like<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.500> big<00:02:11.710> growling

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
easily to sound like like a big growling

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
demons so for me it's a little bit weird

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.010 
demons so for me it's a little bit weird
but<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.070> its<00:02:15.220> feature<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> brighter

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
but because of its feature as a brighter

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.410 
but because of its feature as a brighter
instrument<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.250> means<00:02:18.400> its<00:02:18.550> leads<00:02:18.850> kick<00:02:19.240> ass

takes a lot of ass so right now we're
gonna<00:02:25.120> switch<00:02:25.270> channels<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.110> clean

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
gonna switch channels to the clean

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.630 
gonna switch channels to the clean
Channel<00:02:26.320> I'm<00:02:26.890> gonna<00:02:27.130> go<00:02:27.310> through<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
Channel I'm gonna go through the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.850 
Channel I'm gonna go through the
different<00:02:27.820> pickup<00:02:28.450> selections<00:02:29.290> here<00:02:29.680> and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
different pickup selections here and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.950 
different pickup selections here and
then<00:02:30.520> after<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.150> we're<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.720> talk

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
then after that we're going to just talk

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.060 
then after that we're going to just talk
a<00:02:31.990> bit<00:02:32.230> more<00:02:32.440> because<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.710> think<00:02:32.920> it's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
a bit more because I think it's

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.460 
a bit more because I think it's
important<00:02:33.550> all<00:02:34.210> right<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.750> here<00:02:34.990> we<00:02:35.020> are<00:02:35.140> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
important all right so here we are the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:03:00.640 
important all right so here we are the
clean<00:02:35.710> stuff

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:30.280 

you

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.949 

so<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.319> find<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.950> clean<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.959> dangerously

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
so I find that clean to be dangerously

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.619 
so I find that clean to be dangerously
cool<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:35.160> yeah<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.400> do<00:03:35.580> like<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:36.060> clean<00:03:36.299> channel

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
cool so yeah I do like the clean channel

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:37.970 
cool so yeah I do like the clean channel
most<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.049> neck<00:03:37.170> pickup<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.590> think<00:03:37.830> that's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
most on the neck pickup I think that's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.289 
most on the neck pickup I think that's
fair<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.370> think<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.700> other<00:03:38.819> ones<00:03:39.000> sound<00:03:39.239> a

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
fair I think the other ones sound a

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.240 
fair I think the other ones sound a
little<00:03:39.510> bit<00:03:39.599> too<00:03:39.750> thin<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.049> little<00:03:40.410> bit<00:03:40.500> too<00:03:40.709> too

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
little bit too thin a little bit too too

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.819 
little bit too thin a little bit too too
tiny<00:03:41.579> not<00:03:42.030> tinny<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:42.569> tiny<00:03:42.810> know<00:03:43.530> what<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.680> mean

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
tiny not tinny but tiny know what I mean

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.400 
tiny not tinny but tiny know what I mean
I<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.220> have<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.459> big<00:03:44.790> sound<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.810> just

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
I like to have that big sound and I just

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.630 
I like to have that big sound and I just
like<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.590> fact<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:46.980> Nik<00:03:47.160> pickup<00:03:47.459> has<00:03:47.610> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
like the fact that Nik pickup has a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.220 
like the fact that Nik pickup has a
little<00:03:47.849> bit<00:03:47.940> more<00:03:48.000> balls<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.630> guess<00:03:48.810> there's<00:03:49.170> a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
little bit more balls I guess there's a

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.870 
little bit more balls I guess there's a
little<00:03:49.440> bit<00:03:49.530> more<00:03:49.709> tone<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.430> little<00:03:50.760> bit

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
little bit more tone to it a little bit

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.319 
little bit more tone to it a little bit
more<00:03:51.030> oh<00:03:51.860> hunger<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.310> know<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:54.120> we're<00:03:54.239> gonna

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
switch over to a lead channel so I can

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.220

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
so thick is pretty good it's pretty

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.580 
so thick is pretty good it's pretty
convincing<00:05:43.410> only<00:05:44.340> channel<00:05:45.090> that<00:05:45.290> was<00:05:46.290> a<00:05:46.320> bad

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
convincing only channel that was a bad

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.590 
convincing only channel that was a bad
imitation<00:05:46.920> of<00:05:47.520> an<00:05:47.760> imitation<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.450> an

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
imitation of an imitation of an

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.250 
imitation of an imitation of an
imitation<00:05:48.960> I<00:05:49.950> do<00:05:50.640> like<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.420> sounds<00:05:51.960> off<00:05:52.080> this

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
imitation I do like the sounds off this

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.780 
imitation I do like the sounds off this
guitar<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:52.680> think<00:05:52.710> that's<00:05:53.040> putting<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.400> coils

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
guitar I think that's putting the coils

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.190 
guitar I think that's putting the coils
with<00:05:53.970> these<00:05:54.150> Duncan's<00:05:54.540> doesn't<00:05:54.900> really<00:05:55.020> work

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
with these Duncan's doesn't really work

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.410 
with these Duncan's doesn't really work
out<00:05:55.350> so<00:05:55.650> well<00:05:55.800> but<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.640> does<00:05:56.790> sound<00:05:57.060> really

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
out so well but it does sound really

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.920 
out so well but it does sound really
Leedy<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:57.840> really<00:05:58.410> Wheatley<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:59.870> action<00:06:00.870> on

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
Leedy and really Wheatley the action on

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.090 
Leedy and really Wheatley the action on
this<00:06:01.050> guitar<00:06:01.170> is<00:06:01.440> a<00:06:01.470> little<00:06:01.680> lower<00:06:01.830> than<00:06:01.980> I'm

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
this guitar is a little lower than I'm

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.490 
this guitar is a little lower than I'm
used<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.520> unfortunately<00:06:03.210> so<00:06:04.140> there<00:06:04.350> is<00:06:04.470> a

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
used to unfortunately so there is a

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.380 
used to unfortunately so there is a
little<00:06:04.950> bit<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.190> weirdness<00:06:05.790> when<00:06:06.150> I'm<00:06:06.240> playing

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
little bit of weirdness when I'm playing

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.980 
little bit of weirdness when I'm playing
it<00:06:06.920> but<00:06:07.920> it<00:06:08.040> is<00:06:08.160> what<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.610> man<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.300> think<00:06:09.870> that

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
it but it is what it is man I think that

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.810 
it but it is what it is man I think that
it's<00:06:10.140> still<00:06:10.230> a<00:06:10.350> really<00:06:10.620> great<00:06:10.860> studio<00:06:11.340> guitar

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
it's still a really great studio guitar

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.070 
it's still a really great studio guitar
actually<00:06:12.030> I<00:06:12.300> think<00:06:12.360> that<00:06:12.600> this<00:06:12.660> would<00:06:12.780> be<00:06:12.840> an

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
actually I think that this would be an

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.200 
actually I think that this would be an
amazing<00:06:13.410> thing<00:06:13.830> to<00:06:14.280> have<00:06:14.460> in<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.640> studio<00:06:15.030> if

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
amazing thing to have in the studio if

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.090 
amazing thing to have in the studio if
you<00:06:15.240> just<00:06:15.510> can't<00:06:15.780> get<00:06:15.930> that<00:06:16.140> chord<00:06:16.770> to<00:06:16.890> sound

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
you just can't get that chord to sound

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.140 
you just can't get that chord to sound
right<00:06:17.250> or<00:06:17.310> whatever<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:17.910> you<00:06:17.970> need<00:06:18.120> a

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
right or whatever and you need a

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.790 
right or whatever and you need a
brighter<00:06:18.450> instrument<00:06:18.990> this<00:06:19.140> is<00:06:19.290> totally

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
brighter instrument this is totally

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.370
