00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:23.670
 Pregnant is as cool as the guys 300 and even 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.250
 games everything with you I named car 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.119
 south editor of the transit magazine and now 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.850
 360 games columnist this area on the site 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 where will you talk about things that both the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 year that games but is because it has a channel 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 on youtube called youtube.com parra 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.700
 Ricardo playing and there I do game place 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 that is nothing more than to judge and comment 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.780
 about the game but before you access in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.960
 watch video because today I told 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.690
 you five independent games that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.430
 they would be indie games and it's cool and I think 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.020
 you will like it a lot over 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.020
 an action that we are going to 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.420
 For you who are tired of those games. 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.850
 conventional fps with graphics 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 lush where everything seems to reality 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.520
 violence is very real and at last 8-bit 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.680
 killer produced by it as breath is the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 game that completely changes that face 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.810
 with 8-bit style graphics giving 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.000
 enemy shots that look like ghosts of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.100
 technical branding districts of course this 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.110
 does not detract from its gameplay that even 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.110
 being simple is very objective 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.040
 and since we are talking in 8 bits who 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.000
 Can not remember pacman the nice 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.340
 ball eater in fat man is build 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 made by law with god gave a new 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.360
 angle to the board watching the game 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.160
 in a more 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.340
 graphics following the line of games 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.030
 made of sprite and animation frame a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.430
 frame 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.950
 He is much more beautiful. Revive the good ones. 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.950
 moments with this classic remastered 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.410
 is what sums up the game produced by each 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 atomic and bnb carnival ti is where you 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.620
 Incarnates a guy who has to run to 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.780
 be saved 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 Who knows what the guy from the building in 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.800
 building dodging boxes and rocks 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.430
 still having planes that make the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.380
 screen 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.880
 both hindering your vision and buildings 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.459
 old crumbling during the game 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.799
 make him even more frantic than 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.360
 if it knows it does not have an end then the 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.970
 goal is to reach as far as possible 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.970
 for I doubt you break my record 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:53.219
 that's maybe a little easier 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.219
 available for android pc and iphones 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.040
 I believe that all of us who played some 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.800
 super mario franchise game in 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.810
 we ask at least once why 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.880
 rays can not play two on the same 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.370
 super mario bros screen 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.310
 ex ti gives this opportunity beyond the game 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.410
 have super mario bros graphics 3 stages 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.410
 and songs from other Mario games 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:36.129
 the multiplayer mode works very well 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.040
 can play with mario luigi princess 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.499
 peach toadstool and even with the link the 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.719
 legend of zelda for sure a game that 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.989
 contains a great deal of nostalgia and 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:58.659
 which deserves a more detailed analysis 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:04:00.819
 later it was to finalize this 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.379
 Game for you that had that cell phone. 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:13.299
 diamond brick which does not break nor 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:15.699
 that the cousin cow saw there would only have 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.859
 more memorable than his resistance was the 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.320
 fun and snake to where 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.720
 we all called the snake game 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.330
 there were many versions of this game more 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.639
 what to show you guys is multiplayer 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.160
 on the board throw seven cobras 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.370
 you and your friends control in 4 on 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.080
 same pc in day care the graph is nice 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.090
 music does not leave anything to be desired and 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.490
 gameplay is the same as the classic game 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.740
 only in it you can shoot drop 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.169
 turn and pick up power ups during 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.220
 only games you collect for 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.220

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.169
