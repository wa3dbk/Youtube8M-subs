00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
more effective he becomes if you move

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.700 
more effective he becomes if you move
the<00:01:03.330> ball<00:01:03.510> around<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.990> try<00:01:04.109> to<00:01:04.170> stretch<00:01:04.439> it

the ball around and try to stretch it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.050 
the ball around and try to stretch it
out<00:01:04.859> it<00:01:05.729> gives<00:01:05.969> him<00:01:06.149> more<00:01:06.420> space<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.469> it

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
out it gives him more space to go get it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.730 
out it gives him more space to go get it
my<00:01:09.060> old<00:01:09.299> general<00:01:09.630> rule<00:01:09.749> is<00:01:09.899> one<00:01:10.140> pump<00:01:10.409> faking

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

right<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:11.130> face<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.359> go<00:01:12.570> right<00:01:13.229> at

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
right there face and if you go right at

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
right there face and if you go right at
their<00:01:13.560> face<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.179> more<00:01:15.179> difficult<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
their face it's more difficult for a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
their face it's more difficult for a
shot<00:01:16.140> blocker<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.399> give<00:01:17.609> him<00:01:17.759> space

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
shot blocker but if you give him space

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
shot blocker but if you give him space
where<00:01:18.420> he<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.539> see<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:18.929> ball<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.679> it's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
where he can see the ball and then it's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.870 
where he can see the ball and then it's
not<00:01:20.369> an<00:01:20.549> aggressive<00:01:20.729> act<00:01:21.179> you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.880> it's
