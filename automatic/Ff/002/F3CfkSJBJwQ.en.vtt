00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you pull it and you pull it in and out

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.600 
you pull it and you pull it in and out
and<00:02:17.700> there's<00:02:17.939> just<00:02:18.120> spinning<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.400> spikes<00:02:20.400> or

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and there's just spinning like spikes or

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.720 
and there's just spinning like spikes or
something<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.209> kind<00:02:21.420> of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730

see<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:30.569> see<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.629> spins<00:02:32.019> like<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.670> they

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
see that see it spins like that they

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.940 
see that see it spins like that they
look<00:02:33.819> like<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:35.319> know<00:02:35.440> they<00:02:35.620> spin

before the laser counts on the back also

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.490 
before the laser counts on the back also
and<00:03:36.010> all<00:03:36.130> these<00:03:36.250> other<00:03:36.780> laser<00:03:37.780> cannons<00:03:38.260> all

this cool weaponry come on let me show
you<00:03:48.010> up<00:03:48.100> how<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.400> put<00:03:48.609> this<00:03:48.730> back<00:03:48.940> together

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
you up how you put this back together

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.349 
you up how you put this back together
just<00:03:49.870> close<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:50.319> up<00:03:50.940> put<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.120> back<00:03:52.329> down

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
just close that up put that back down

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.349 
just close that up put that back down
and<00:03:52.930> close<00:03:53.139> them<00:03:53.319> all<00:03:53.410> up<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:55.000> know<00:03:55.090> kind

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
and close them all up so you know kind

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.819 
and close them all up so you know kind
of<00:03:55.389> like<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.630> Dimetrodon<00:03:56.230> with<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.440> surprise
