00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
ty directcu top arm this is a very small

ty directcu top arm this is a very small
video<00:00:44.239> card<00:00:44.570> this<00:00:44.720> is<00:00:44.780> supposed<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:45.320> be<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
video card this is supposed to be the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.100 
video card this is supposed to be the
550<00:00:46.670> is<00:00:46.850> pretty<00:00:47.149> much<00:00:47.270> an<00:00:47.420> upgrade<00:00:47.750> from<00:00:47.930> the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
550 is pretty much an upgrade from the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.710 
550 is pretty much an upgrade from the
450<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:48.920> it<00:00:49.040> keeps<00:00:49.220> most<00:00:49.850> kind<00:00:50.270> of<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.510> same

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
450 so it keeps most kind of the same

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.200 
450 so it keeps most kind of the same
technology<00:00:51.440> as<00:00:51.470> far<00:00:51.949> as<00:00:52.129> like<00:00:52.280> form<00:00:52.610> factor<00:00:53.089> in

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
technology as far as like form factor in

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.590 
technology as far as like form factor in
size<00:00:53.500> but<00:00:54.500> with<00:00:55.010> their<00:00:55.280> they<00:00:55.790> redesigned<00:00:56.449> a

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
size but with their they redesigned a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.049 
size but with their they redesigned a
lot<00:00:56.780> of<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.949> that<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.430> get<00:00:58.610> one<00:00:59.030> more

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
lot of it so that you get one more

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.710 
lot of it so that you get one more
memory<00:00:59.720> and<00:00:59.960> two<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:01.040> get<00:01:01.190> AB<00:01:01.430> much<00:01:02.269> increased

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
memory and two you get AB much increased

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.350 
memory and two you get AB much increased
performance<00:01:02.989> here<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.920> now<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.430> directcu

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
performance here and now the directcu

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.940 
performance here and now the directcu
version<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:07.369> sis's<00:01:07.820> thermal<00:01:08.720> solution<00:01:09.229> the

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
version is a sis's thermal solution the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.029 
version is a sis's thermal solution the
directcu<00:01:10.550> puts<00:01:11.270> 28<00:01:11.869> millimeter<00:01:12.470> flat<00:01:12.860> and

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
directcu puts 28 millimeter flat and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.400 
directcu puts 28 millimeter flat and
copper<00:01:13.399> heatpipes<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:14.450> contact<00:01:15.020> directly

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
copper heatpipes that contact directly

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.219 
copper heatpipes that contact directly
to<00:01:15.649> the<00:01:15.770> CPU<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:16.520> are<00:01:17.420> supposed<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.869> give<00:01:18.080> you

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
to the CPU that are supposed to give you

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.330 
to the CPU that are supposed to give you
about<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.500> twenty<00:01:18.920> percent<00:01:19.220> cooler

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
about a twenty percent cooler

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.790 
about a twenty percent cooler
performance<00:01:20.179> here<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.690> as<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:21.080> can<00:01:21.380> see<00:01:21.410> this

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
performance here and as you can see this

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.730 
performance here and as you can see this
nice<00:01:22.100> big<00:01:22.429> you<00:01:23.060> know<00:01:23.149> it's<00:01:23.450> very<00:01:23.630> sturdy<00:01:24.289> very
