00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
be a little bit warm you don't want it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.910 
be a little bit warm you don't want it
so<00:02:15.220> hot<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.180> tea<00:02:16.510> water<00:02:16.840> okay<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.770> do

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
so hot that is tea water okay so you do

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.280 
so hot that is tea water okay so you do
not<00:02:18.070> want<00:02:18.340> piping<00:02:18.820> hot<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.780> don't<00:02:20.020> want

it room-temperature either so you want a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.660 
it room-temperature either so you want a
little<00:02:22.690> hotter<00:02:22.990> than<00:02:23.140> room<00:02:23.440> temperature<00:02:23.670> but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
little hotter than room temperature but

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.780 
little hotter than room temperature but
a<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:25.300> cooler<00:02:25.600> than<00:02:26.140> tea<00:02:26.500> water<00:02:26.740> okay<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.580> i

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
a little cooler than tea water okay so i

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.550 
a little cooler than tea water okay so i
heated<00:02:28.000> some<00:02:28.120> up<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.570> pot<00:02:28.780> hang<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.410> a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
guys hang on all right so here we go so

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.250 
guys hang on all right so here we go so
you're<00:03:02.980> going<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.280> take<00:03:03.640> your<00:03:03.989> slightly<00:03:04.989> warm

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
you're going to take your slightly warm

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:15.610 
you're going to take your slightly warm
water<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.239> pour<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.510> quart<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.270 

and<00:03:16.700> then<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.880> want<00:03:18.090> two<00:03:18.390> teaspoons<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:19.280> sea

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
and then you want two teaspoons of sea

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.050 
and then you want two teaspoons of sea
salt<00:03:21.470> all<00:03:22.470> right<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.040> actually<00:03:23.670> not

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
salt all right so this is actually not

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.120 
salt all right so this is actually not
going<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:24.630> an<00:03:24.720> exact<00:03:25.140> science<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.740> I'm<00:03:25.830> just

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
going to be an exact science so I'm just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.730 
going to be an exact science so I'm just
going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.420> drop<00:03:27.420> some<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.900> here<00:03:30.620> well<00:03:31.620> it's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
going to drop some in here well it's

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.260 
going to drop some in here well it's
going<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:32.040> kind<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.459> an<00:03:32.610> exact<00:03:32.970> science

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
going to be kind of an exact science

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.150 
going to be kind of an exact science
because<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.900> guys<00:03:34.050> expect<00:03:34.530> me<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> drink<00:03:34.950> this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
because you guys expect me to drink this

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.699 
because you guys expect me to drink this
stuff<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.790> all<00:03:36.030> right<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.380> go

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
stuff so all right here we go

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.860 
stuff so all right here we go
I<00:03:37.740> did<00:03:37.950> pretty<00:03:38.100> good<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:39.330> didn't<00:03:39.570> see<00:03:39.690> that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
I did pretty good you didn't see that

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.260 
I did pretty good you didn't see that
all<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.800> here<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.340> go<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.970> we're<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
all right here we go so we're going to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.820 
all right here we go so we're going to
put<00:03:45.390> our<00:03:45.480> top<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.230> we're<00:03:46.350> going<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.500> shake

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
put our top on and we're going to shake

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.400 
put our top on and we're going to shake
it<00:03:46.970> now<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.030> want<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.360> shake<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:48.900> until

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
it now you want to shake this until

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.640 
it now you want to shake this until
there<00:03:49.590> are<00:03:49.800> no<00:03:50.070> granules<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:51.090> sea<00:03:51.660> salt<00:03:51.930> around

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
there are no granules of sea salt around

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.920 
there are no granules of sea salt around
the<00:03:52.860> bottom<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.280> your<00:03:53.400> jar<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.750> what

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
the bottom of your jar and this is what

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.380 
the bottom of your jar and this is what
happens<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.920> water<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> salt<00:03:56.940> fuse

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
happens the water and the salt fuse

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.540 
happens the water and the salt fuse
together<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.440> actually<00:03:58.709> ends<00:03:59.280> up<00:03:59.370> with

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
together and it actually ends up with

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.240 
together and it actually ends up with
the<00:03:59.670> gravity<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.330> same<00:04:00.570> gravity<00:04:01.140> as<00:04:01.290> blood<00:04:01.800> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the gravity the same gravity as blood so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.880 
the gravity the same gravity as blood so
when<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.610> drink<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.300> your<00:04:04.110> kidneys<00:04:04.620> are<00:04:04.830> not

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
when you drink this your kidneys are not

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.400 
when you drink this your kidneys are not
going<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.550> pull<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.940> water<00:04:06.180> out<00:04:06.570> of<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:07.230> sea
