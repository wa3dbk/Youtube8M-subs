00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
different right well this one is called

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.880 
different right well this one is called
the<00:00:23.189> shaders<00:00:23.760> mod<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.810> actually<00:00:25.439> two

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the shaders mod and it's actually two

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.839 
the shaders mod and it's actually two
mods<00:00:26.189> not<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> script<00:00:27.269> body<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.410> is

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
mods not a script body and this one is

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.060 
mods not a script body and this one is
quite<00:00:29.849> interesting<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.800> looks

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
quite interesting because it looks

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.330 
quite interesting because it looks
closely<00:00:32.969> related<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.079> shaders<00:00:34.530> modern<00:00:34.980> as

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
closely related to the shaders modern as

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.299 
closely related to the shaders modern as
you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you can see right here you can see the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
you can see right here you can see the
different<00:00:38.700> shade<00:00:39.030> here's<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.960> shade

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
different shade here's one shade

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.310 
different shade here's one shade
here's<00:00:41.040> another<00:00:41.250> shade<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> darker<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
here's another shade that is darker and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860 
here's another shade that is darker and
then<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.980> tree<00:00:44.370> looks<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:45.059> there's<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> light

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
then the tree looks like there's a light

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340 
then the tree looks like there's a light
emanating<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:48.270> coming<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> here

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
emanating from that way coming to here

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
emanating from that way coming to here
and<00:00:49.530> over<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.370> looks<00:00:50.700> different<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.329> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and over here looks different and as you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.790 
and over here looks different and as you
can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.899> grass<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.980> looks<00:00:53.160> brighter<00:00:53.699> in

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
can see the grass it looks brighter in

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
can see the grass it looks brighter in
down<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:57.270> looks<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:58.010> bright<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.690> let's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
down here it looks more bright and let's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
down here it looks more bright and let's
check<00:01:00.989> let's<00:01:01.230> check<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> ground<00:01:02.399> because

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
check let's check on the ground because

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.830 
check let's check on the ground because
I<00:01:02.879> haven't<00:01:03.090> seen<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> ground<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:08.280> course

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
I haven't seen on the ground of course

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.590 
I haven't seen on the ground of course
ok<00:01:09.840> let's<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.430> let's<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
ok let's go down and let's see how it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
ok let's go down and let's see how it
looks<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:15.740> okay<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> looks<00:01:17.009> darkest<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.670> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
looks so okay it looks darkest you can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.630 
looks so okay it looks darkest you can
see<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.500> this<00:01:19.500> side<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.250> side<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
see that this side and this side is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.050 
see that this side and this side is
starts<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.270> let's<00:01:21.509> try<00:01:21.840> using<00:01:22.140> glowstone<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
starts so let's try using glowstone or a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.429 
starts so let's try using glowstone or a
torch<00:01:24.439> torch<00:01:25.439> looks<00:01:26.220> nice<00:01:26.509> let's<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.780> where's

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
torch torch looks nice let's see where's

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.789 
torch torch looks nice let's see where's
the<00:01:29.960> look<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.259> looks<00:01:31.890> great<00:01:32.390> now<00:01:33.590> this<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the look at that looks great now this is

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.020 
the look at that looks great now this is
kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> shaders<00:01:36.450> mod<00:01:37.250> like<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> basic

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
kind of like a shaders mod like a basic

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.249 
kind of like a shaders mod like a basic
shaders<00:01:39.619> not<00:01:40.619> true<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.520> very<00:01:42.240> true<00:01:42.780> shaders

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
shaders not true not very true shaders

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.080 
shaders not true not very true shaders
but<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.799> shader<00:01:44.460> smart

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
but it is shader smart

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
but it is shader smart
aim<00:01:45.750> that's<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.130> only<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.460> oh<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> look

let's go to my world which is also
creative<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.830> look<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.610> blocks<00:02:08.880> are

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
creative and look at that the blocks are

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.050 
creative and look at that the blocks are
darker<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.400> having<00:02:11.670> night

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
darker but it is like having night

darker but it is like having night
vision<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.310> survival<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.430> or<00:02:14.970> nighttime<00:02:15.239> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
vision on survival and or nighttime and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.270 
vision on survival and or nighttime and
as<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.530> dark

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
as you can see it is dark

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.250 
as you can see it is dark
everything<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.910> darkened<00:02:18.450> here's<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
everything is darkened here's a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.259 
everything is darkened here's a
waterfall<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.130> let's<00:02:20.370> see<00:02:20.519> how<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> looks<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
waterfall and let's see how it looks I

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.470 
waterfall and let's see how it looks I
think<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.140> looks<00:02:22.319> even<00:02:22.890> better<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:24.120> flow

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
think it looks even better the flow

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
think it looks even better the flow
looks<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.980> clearness<00:02:26.720> makes<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.930> look<00:02:28.110> better

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
looks the clearness makes it look better

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.490 
looks the clearness makes it look better
as<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.069> can<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.810> not<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.260> only

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
as you can see and this is not the only

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.340 
as you can see and this is not the only
shaders<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.730> look<00:02:32.880> start<00:02:33.180> ok<00:02:34.250> let's<00:02:35.250> see

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
shaders in it look start ok let's see

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.250 
shaders in it look start ok let's see
yeah<00:02:37.519> ok<00:02:38.519> like<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.269> lights<00:02:39.569> up<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.049> like

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
yeah ok like it lights up it's like

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.160 
yeah ok like it lights up it's like

for no reason there's another zombie
over<00:02:47.519> there<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.680> let's<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.340> go<00:02:50.760> into<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
over there and let's just go into the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.270 
over there and let's just go into the
next<00:02:52.610> shaders<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.440> actually<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:56.010> mod

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
next shaders and it is actually a mod

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.850 
next shaders and it is actually a mod
you<00:02:56.580> can<00:02:56.790> use<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.420> servers<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.200> let's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
you can use this on servers and let's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.620 
you can use this on servers and let's
disable<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.820> this<00:02:59.910> one<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.359> soft

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
disable this and this one is the soft

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.490 
disable this and this one is the soft
graphic<00:03:01.230> plus<00:03:02.180> shader<00:03:03.180> saying<00:03:03.600> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
graphic plus shader saying the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.490 
graphic plus shader saying the
difference<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.160> no<00:03:06.150> table<00:03:06.359> as<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.900> can<00:03:07.049> see<00:03:07.230> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
difference is no table as you can see it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.229 
difference is no table as you can see it
looks<00:03:07.769> even<00:03:08.579> more<00:03:09.410> blueish<00:03:10.640> purple<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.820> don't

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
looks even more blueish purple I don't

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.349 
looks even more blueish purple I don't
know<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:13.769> looks<00:03:13.980> brighter<00:03:14.370> more<00:03:14.820> orange

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
know and it looks brighter more orange

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.110 
know and it looks brighter more orange
like<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.170> were<00:03:16.350> on<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> sunset<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.519> as<00:03:17.730> you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
like if it were on a sunset and as you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.440 
like if it were on a sunset and as you
can<00:03:18.299> tell<00:03:18.359> from<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:20.190> tree<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:21.150> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
can tell from the the tree that the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.099 
can tell from the the tree that the
leaves<00:03:22.079> they<00:03:22.440> look<00:03:22.620> gray<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:24.690> looks

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
leaves they look gray and that looks

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.539 
leaves they look gray and that looks
kind<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:25.920> like<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.459> on<00:03:26.700> sunset<00:03:27.329> if

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
kind of like if it's on sunset if

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.670 
kind of like if it's on sunset if
everything<00:03:29.549> looks<00:03:29.730> even<00:03:30.299> better<00:03:30.569> now<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.620> don't

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
everything looks even better now I don't

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.610 
everything looks even better now I don't
know<00:03:31.829> if<00:03:32.060> let's<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.299> let's<00:03:33.750> check<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.170> out

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
know if let's see let's check it out

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.059 
know if let's see let's check it out
the<00:03:34.799> glowstone<00:03:35.370> how<00:03:35.670> does<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.810> look<00:03:37.109> no<00:03:37.769> not

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
the glowstone how does this look no not

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.620 
the glowstone how does this look no not
there<00:03:39.170> mmm<00:03:40.170> looks<00:03:40.950> quite<00:03:41.310> quite<00:03:42.269> bright

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
there mmm looks quite quite bright

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.740 
there mmm looks quite quite bright
indeed<00:03:43.670> let's<00:03:44.670> take<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.030> out<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.600> looks

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
indeed let's take it out and it looks

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.490 
indeed let's take it out and it looks
blueish

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
blueish

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.870 
blueish
so<00:03:48.170> let's<00:03:49.170> now<00:03:49.470> check<00:03:49.889> out<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.400> nighttime

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
so let's now check out the nighttime

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.509 
so let's now check out the nighttime
because<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:52.260> nighttime<00:03:52.680> looks<00:03:52.920> even<00:03:53.340> better

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
because the nighttime looks even better

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.580 
because the nighttime looks even better
and<00:03:54.769> this<00:03:55.769> one<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.209> saving<00:03:57.209> chunks<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:58.290> look

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
and this one is saving chunks and look

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.949 
and this one is saving chunks and look
at<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:58.889> it<00:03:59.069> looks<00:03:59.250> even<00:03:59.609> better<00:04:00.299> looks<00:04:00.750> like

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
at that it looks even better looks like

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.250 
at that it looks even better looks like
if<00:04:01.109> it's<00:04:01.260> on<00:04:01.440> Twilight<00:04:02.040> or<00:04:02.250> something<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.870> it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
if it's on Twilight or something and it

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.490 
if it's on Twilight or something and it
just<00:04:04.470> looks<00:04:04.680> fantastic<00:04:05.329> overall<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:07.440> don't

like<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.460> type<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.030> shaders<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:11.200> don't<00:04:11.380> know

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440
