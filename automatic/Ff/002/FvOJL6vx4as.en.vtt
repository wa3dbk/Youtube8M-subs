head<00:00:14.849> Amex<00:00:15.089> now<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.080> puzzle<00:00:16.529> took<00:00:17.160> four

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
head Amex now this puzzle took four

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.640 
head Amex now this puzzle took four
hours<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.359> sticker<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.140> imagine<00:00:19.500> it's

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
hours to sticker and I imagine it's

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.890 
hours to sticker and I imagine it's
gonna<00:00:19.770> take<00:00:19.980> many<00:00:20.220> times<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.390> solve<00:00:21.720> it

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
gonna take many times that to solve it

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.439 
gonna take many times that to solve it
this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.920> strictly<00:00:23.220> speaking<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.970> super

this is not strictly speaking a super
pedo<00:00:24.660> mix<00:00:24.869> however<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.619> does<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:26.010> many

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
pedo mix however it does have many

pedo mix however it does have many
characteristics<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> traits<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.900> are

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
characteristics and traits that are

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
characteristics and traits that are
similar<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.650> puzzle<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.279> nature<00:00:29.550> first

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
similar to a puzzle of that nature first

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999 
similar to a puzzle of that nature first
of<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.300> does<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.660> center<00:00:31.260> orientation

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
of all it does have center orientation

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.220 
of all it does have center orientation
and<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.579> lot<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> pieces<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.480> very<00:00:33.750> specific

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and a lot of pieces have very specific

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.780 
and a lot of pieces have very specific
places<00:00:34.500> however<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:35.130> are<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.520> pieces

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
places however there are some pieces

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.810 
places however there are some pieces
that<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.020> swapped<00:00:37.530> position<00:00:38.280> for

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that can be swapped position for

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
that can be swapped position for
starters<00:00:39.149> these<00:00:39.360> three<00:00:39.629> pieces<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.230> they

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
starters these three pieces here they

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
starters these three pieces here they
can<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.890> swapped<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:41.879> three<00:00:42.210> pieces

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
can be swapped with these three pieces

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
can be swapped with these three pieces
here<00:00:42.800> these<00:00:43.800> edge<00:00:44.010> pieces<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.940> be

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
here these edge pieces here they can be

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
here these edge pieces here they can be
swapped<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.329> these<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:46.350> edge<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.190> be

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
swapped with these this edge here can be

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
swapped with these this edge here can be
flipped<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.270> these<00:00:48.360> pieces<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.930> be

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
flipped and all of these pieces can be

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
flipped and all of these pieces can be
swapped<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.250> pieces<00:00:50.489> so

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
swapped with all of these pieces so

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.060 
swapped with all of these pieces so
there's<00:00:51.239> quite<00:00:51.600> there's<00:00:52.289> quite<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> few<00:00:52.680> pieces

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
there's quite there's quite a few pieces

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850 
there's quite there's quite a few pieces
that<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.570> positions<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.379> there's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that can have two positions and there's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.979 
that can have two positions and there's
also<00:00:56.039> ones<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.520> these<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> edge<00:00:57.660> here

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
also ones like these in the edge here

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.619 
also ones like these in the edge here
that<00:00:58.140> only<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.070> position<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that only have the one position so a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
that only have the one position so a
little<00:01:01.050> care<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.710> needed<00:01:02.100> in

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
little care is going to be needed in

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.260 
little care is going to be needed in
actually<00:01:03.120> filling<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.110> these<00:01:05.030> centers<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
actually filling up these centers and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
actually filling up these centers and
building<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> center's<00:01:07.409> however<00:01:08.100> by<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> end

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
building the center's however by the end

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
building the center's however by the end
of<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> imagine<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> be

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
of it I imagine there's going to be

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.530 
of it I imagine there's going to be
quite<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.409> large<00:01:10.680> hefty<00:01:11.280> parody<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.790> some<00:01:12.210> sort

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
quite a large hefty parody of some sort

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
quite a large hefty parody of some sort
for<00:01:12.780> me<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> solve<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.610> I'm

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
for me to solve and that's what I'm

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160 
for me to solve and that's what I'm
looking<00:01:14.970> forward<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> most<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.720> solve<00:01:15.990> but

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
looking forward to most in the solve but

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
looking forward to most in the solve but
apart<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:17.280> doesn't<00:01:17.580> look<00:01:17.670> like

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
apart from that it doesn't look like

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
apart from that it doesn't look like
it's<00:01:18.030> gonna<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.299> too<00:01:18.479> difficult<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.049> just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's gonna be too difficult it's just

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
it's gonna be too difficult it's just
gonna<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.340> long<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> find

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
gonna take a very very long time to find

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.030 
gonna take a very very long time to find
each<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> colors<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.740> quite<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> few

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
each of the colors there are quite a few

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
each of the colors there are quite a few
colors<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> imagine<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.390> be

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
colors and I imagine there's going to be

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
colors and I imagine there's going to be
a<00:01:24.570> bit<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> misinterpretation<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> which

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
a bit of misinterpretation as to which

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.760 
a bit of misinterpretation as to which
one<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.759> which<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
one is this and which one is that this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
one is this and which one is that this
blue<00:01:29.070> looks<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:29.670> similar<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.240> blue

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
blue looks very similar to this blue

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.679 
blue looks very similar to this blue
this<00:01:31.439> blue<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.340> quite<00:01:32.579> dark<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.329> kind<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this blue was quite dark and kind of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.469 
this blue was quite dark and kind of
looks<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.140> purple<00:01:34.729> these<00:01:35.729> greens<00:01:36.150> look

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
looks like this purple these greens look

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.330 
looks like this purple these greens look
very<00:01:36.689> similar<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.979> forth

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
very similar and so on so forth

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.179 
very similar and so on so forth
issues<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.270> nature<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:40.979> take

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
issues of that nature so it's gonna take

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.440 
issues of that nature so it's gonna take
a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.460> time<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.270> need<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
a little time and it's gonna need a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
a little time and it's gonna need a
little<00:01:42.720> care<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> solve<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.890> certainly

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
little care to solve but I certainly

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
little care to solve but I certainly
can't<00:01:44.430> wait<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.060> start<00:01:45.119> solving<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.380> puzzle

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
can't wait to start solving this puzzle

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.590 
can't wait to start solving this puzzle
so<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.729> still<00:01:47.970> turns<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> regular

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so it still turns like a regular

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.850 
so it still turns like a regular
pediments<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.409> sure<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.710> obviously

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
pediments as I'm sure you're obviously

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.410 
pediments as I'm sure you're obviously
guessed<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:52.799> has<00:01:52.979> four<00:01:53.280> layers<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.820> each<00:01:54.030> face

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
guessed it has four layers on each face

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.490 
guessed it has four layers on each face
technically<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.100> nine<00:01:56.579> by<00:01:56.850> nine

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
technically this is a nine by nine

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.880 
technically this is a nine by nine
equivalent<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.000> dodecahedron<00:02:00.079> but<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
equivalent of a dodecahedron but it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.010 
equivalent of a dodecahedron but it
still<00:02:02.250> turns<00:02:02.490> fantastically<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.540> bought<00:02:03.899> this

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
haven't opened them yet because I don't

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.920

absolutely<00:03:45.170> adore<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:48.020> now<00:03:49.020> I'm<00:03:49.170> told<00:03:49.470> that

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
absolutely adore it now I'm told that

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.229 
absolutely adore it now I'm told that
there<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:49.950> going<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.250> be<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.430> parody<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.910> some

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
there is going to be a parody of some

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.880 
there is going to be a parody of some
sorts<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.750> don't<00:03:51.989> really<00:03:52.290> know<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:52.860> to

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
sorts but I don't really know what to

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.310 
sorts but I don't really know what to
expect<00:03:53.070> because<00:03:53.730> I've<00:03:53.970> never<00:03:54.209> really<00:03:54.750> solved

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
expect because I've never really solved

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.220 
expect because I've never really solved
a<00:03:55.470> puzzle<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:56.880> magnitude<00:03:57.540> before<00:03:58.020> I

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
a puzzle of this magnitude before I

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.520 
a puzzle of this magnitude before I
solved<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.040> 30<00:03:59.610> color<00:03:59.910> Giga<00:04:00.330> minx<00:04:00.600> once<00:04:00.840> however

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
solved a 30 color Giga minx once however

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.170 
solved a 30 color Giga minx once however
it<00:04:01.770> doesn't<00:04:02.010> really<00:04:02.370> have<00:04:02.700> any<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:02.970> these

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
it doesn't really have any of these

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.690 
it doesn't really have any of these
small<00:04:03.600> pieces<00:04:03.870> here<00:04:04.320> or<00:04:04.440> any<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.800> these<00:04:04.980> edges

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
small pieces here or any of these edges

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.490 
small pieces here or any of these edges
in<00:04:05.790> there<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.360> can't<00:04:06.660> imagine<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.110> parody

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
in there so I can't imagine the parody

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500 
in there so I can't imagine the parody
that<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.980> had<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.459> going<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.060> much<00:04:09.270> like

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
that that had is going to be much like

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.270 
that that had is going to be much like
the<00:04:09.540> parody<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.230> one<00:04:10.410> has<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> simply

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
the parody that this one has I simply

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.930 
the parody that this one has I simply
don't<00:04:11.430> know

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
don't know

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.699 
don't know
we'll<00:04:12.300> just<00:04:12.690> have<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.870> wait<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.290> see<00:04:13.470> I'm<00:04:13.620> not

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
we'll just have to wait and see I'm not

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.900 
we'll just have to wait and see I'm not
going<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:13.920> scramble<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.280> up<00:04:14.370> in<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.700> video

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
going to scramble it up in this video

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.909 
going to scramble it up in this video
but<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.570> will<00:04:15.690> scramble<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.230> up<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.530> another

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
but I will scramble it up in another

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.680 
but I will scramble it up in another
video<00:04:17.220> possibly<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.910> next<00:04:18.030> video<00:04:18.390> or<00:04:18.570> the
