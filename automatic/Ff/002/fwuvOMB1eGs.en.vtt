Buster toys out of the packaging and I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.930 
Buster toys out of the packaging and I
actually<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:07.679> say<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:08.160> they<00:01:08.429> have<00:01:08.610> cool

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
actually will say I think they have cool

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.910 
actually will say I think they have cool
scopes<00:01:09.270> over<00:01:09.539> here<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.410> a<00:01:10.440> big<00:01:10.649> fan<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
scopes over here I'm not a big fan of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
scopes over here I'm not a big fan of
this<00:01:11.220> scale<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.149> think<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.630> work<00:01:13.020> well

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
this scale but I think they do work well

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
this scale but I think they do work well
for<00:01:13.409> playsets<00:01:13.800> as<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.190> see<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.490> each

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
for playsets as you can see they each

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.279 
for playsets as you can see they each
have<00:01:14.970> their<00:01:15.090> own<00:01:15.149> peg<00:01:15.479> hole<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:16.050> over

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
have their own peg hole in the back over

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.870 
have their own peg hole in the back over
there<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.679> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.800> that's<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> playsets

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
there so I think that's for the playsets

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.130 
there so I think that's for the playsets
I<00:01:17.940> didn't<00:01:18.119> pick<00:01:18.240> up<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.450> Quinjet<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:19.020> not

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
I didn't pick up the Quinjet I'm not

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.480 
I didn't pick up the Quinjet I'm not
sure<00:01:19.319> if<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.470> gonna<00:01:19.590> open<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.190> review<00:01:20.429> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
sure if I'm gonna open that in review it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.190 
sure if I'm gonna open that in review it
or<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.940> it<00:01:21.060> does<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> cool<00:01:21.840> but

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
or not but it does look kind of cool but

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
or not but it does look kind of cool but
our<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.350> back<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
our way back to these I do think the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
our way back to these I do think the
height<00:01:23.819> difference<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.390> off<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.740> Hulk<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
height difference is off I think Hulk is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.679 
height difference is off I think Hulk is
just<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.579> bit<00:01:26.729> too<00:01:26.939> short<00:01:27.240> compared<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
just a little bit too short compared to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
just a little bit too short compared to
Hulk<00:01:27.930> Buster<00:01:28.320> over<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:29.189> small

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
Hulk Buster over there for how small

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
Hulk Buster over there for how small
this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.790> doesn't<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.149> too<00:01:30.270> bad<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.689> did

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this is it doesn't look too bad they did

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.359 
this is it doesn't look too bad they did
paint<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> teeth<00:01:31.439> white<00:01:31.829> over<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
paint the teeth white over there you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.280 
paint the teeth white over there you
cannot<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.850> any<00:01:32.970> paint<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> eyes<00:01:33.720> they

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
cannot see any paint for the eyes they

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.600 
cannot see any paint for the eyes they
gave<00:01:34.439> him<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> different<00:01:34.740> hair<00:01:35.009> color<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
gave him a different hair color for the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.609 
gave him a different hair color for the
hair<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.149> I<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:36.299> that's<00:01:36.570> pretty<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
hair so I think that's pretty good and I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.959 
hair so I think that's pretty good and I
think<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> musculature<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.399> everything<00:01:38.850> on

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
think the musculature and everything on

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.760 
think the musculature and everything on
this<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.360> pretty<00:01:39.570> damn<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.500> like

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this is pretty damn good I like it like

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.139 
this is pretty damn good I like it like
I<00:01:40.860> said<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> scoped<00:01:41.399> isn't<00:01:41.610> too<00:01:41.700> bad<00:01:41.880> they're

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
I said the scoped isn't too bad they're

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.789 
I said the scoped isn't too bad they're
missing<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> red<00:01:42.869> paint<00:01:43.140> though<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
missing all the red paint though for the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
missing all the red paint though for the
bottom<00:01:44.100> part<00:01:44.130> right<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.549> some<00:01:45.000> whole<00:01:45.180> toes

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
bottom part right there some whole toes

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.300 
bottom part right there some whole toes
but<00:01:45.810> what's<00:01:45.930> pretty<00:01:46.140> weak<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.469> articulation

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
but what's pretty weak is articulation

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.980 
but what's pretty weak is articulation
the<00:01:47.340> head<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.729> only<00:01:47.850> rotate<00:01:48.030> side<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.450> side<00:01:48.750> he

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the head can only rotate side to side he

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
the head can only rotate side to side he
can't<00:01:49.290> move<00:01:49.469> up<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.189> his<00:01:50.700> shoulders

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
can't move up and down his shoulders

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.539 
can't move up and down his shoulders
move<00:01:51.479> forward<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:51.990> back<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:52.829> his<00:01:53.130> legs

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
move forward and back and then his legs

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
move forward and back and then his legs
don't<00:01:53.880> even<00:01:54.119> move<00:01:54.240> forward<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.689> back<00:01:54.930> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
don't even move forward and back that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.249 
don't even move forward and back that
well<00:01:55.649> either<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.100> damn<00:01:56.909> yeah<00:01:57.329> five<00:01:57.810> points<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
well either so damn yeah five points of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.380 
well either so damn yeah five points of
articulation<00:01:58.380> man<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.700> weak<00:02:00.000> then

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
articulation man that's so weak then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.609 
articulation man that's so weak then
here's<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> closer<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> whole<00:02:01.259> Buster

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
here's a closer look at the whole Buster

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
here's a closer look at the whole Buster
sculpted<00:02:02.009> quite<00:02:02.250> nicely<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.119> have

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
sculpted quite nicely I think they have

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.609 
sculpted quite nicely I think they have
some<00:02:03.450> white<00:02:03.630> paint<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:04.049> there<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> eye

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
some white paint right there for the eye

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.529 
some white paint right there for the eye
sections<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.609> like<00:02:05.789> this<00:02:05.969> gold<00:02:06.240> paint

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
sections and I like this gold paint

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.749 
sections and I like this gold paint
right<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.469> he<00:02:07.590> has<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> decent<00:02:08.310> amount<00:02:08.429> of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
right there so he has a decent amount of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.279 
right there so he has a decent amount of
gold<00:02:09.000> paint<00:02:09.269> apps<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.720> figure<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
gold paint apps on the figure not a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.680 
gold paint apps on the figure not a
whole<00:02:10.590> ton<00:02:10.970> nothing<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.630> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
whole ton nothing really going on in the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.599 
whole ton nothing really going on in the
back<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.140> yeah<00:02:13.350> like<00:02:13.739> all<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.950> details<00:02:14.220> right

back but yeah like all the details right
here<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.000> looks<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.329> good<00:02:15.450> then

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
here I think I looks really good then

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.810 
here I think I looks really good then
you<00:02:15.989> can<00:02:16.019> open<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.650> up<00:02:16.709> as<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.459> explained

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
you can open this up as we explained

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.370 
earlier and you can see all kinds of
little<00:02:20.940> stuff<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.390> there<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.079> is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
little stuff in there I think that is

great<00:02:22.680> man

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
great man

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.740

right here though this thing is very
Hollow<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.709> mean<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:38.980> course<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.370> whole<00:02:39.579> top

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
Hollow I mean of course this whole top

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.339 
Hollow I mean of course this whole top
section<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:40.239> totally<00:02:40.569> empty<00:02:40.750> as<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.019> saw<00:02:41.200> but

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
section is totally empty as you saw but

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.839 
section is totally empty as you saw but
the<00:02:41.470> legs<00:02:41.680> feel<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.010> they're<00:02:42.220> hollow<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.640> me

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
the legs feel like they're hollow to me

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.059 
the legs feel like they're hollow to me
with<00:02:43.510> articulation<00:02:43.989> he<00:02:44.200> has<00:02:44.319> no<00:02:44.620> head

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
with articulation he has no head

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.280 
with articulation he has no head
articulation<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.360> arms<00:02:46.659> can<00:02:46.780> move<00:02:46.930> forward

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
articulation the arms can move forward

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.500 
articulation the arms can move forward
and<00:02:47.379> back<00:02:47.650> they<00:02:47.890> do<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.129> whole<00:02:48.310> full<00:02:48.640> 360<00:02:49.329> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
and back they do a whole full 360 and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.179 
and back they do a whole full 360 and
then<00:02:49.810> no<00:02:49.989> leg<00:02:50.200> articulation<00:02:50.859> so<00:02:50.980> you

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
then no leg articulation so you

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.500 
then no leg articulation so you
literally<00:02:51.489> get<00:02:51.760> two<00:02:52.030> points<00:02:52.299> of<00:02:52.390> articulation

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
literally get two points of articulation

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.229 
literally get two points of articulation
over<00:02:53.170> here<00:02:53.349> which<00:02:53.769> is<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.159> weird<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.730> me<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:55.090> was
