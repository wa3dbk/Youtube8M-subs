00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.860
 as your feet as a missed opportunity to hear in advance or maybe there 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.079
 nine points and with willem texel to get a bit extra now 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.249
 until was missed opportunity 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.249
 yes but for the form is having a lost 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.390
 it is not that 10 0 against psv but yes 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.789
 it is a bit 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.029
 valid for own country 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.689
 nothing in a hurry 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.939
 with the supplier Ron Vlaar, they are certainly in the field of 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.969
 integrity and professionalism, we still have to take the necessary steps 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.040
 yes with all due respect for a theme when you are in a playground 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.420
 lenie hit was enough and most certainly not mentally either 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.940
 where it went earlier it went wrong 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.520
 they have a daughter there was not much going on and i still have it 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.630
 possibilities to make the 2 0 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.220
 yes i miss you but were still grabbing a few minutes to go 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.060
 you then committed a violation 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.260
 afterwards was warned of and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.280
 which I do have many accidents at all 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.550
 yes I think I myself naturally went that let the trainer make it 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.530
 I have you yourself the youth maybe starts with you where you might have one 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.799
 second yellow card 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.200
 so maybe I'll go with that man anyway 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.480
 after a second yellow card it was two on the cross trainer first that at the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.570
 makes a yellow card 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.030
 offender 2 is just a ghost shortly thereafter for months I think you think the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.720
 so never give it a second yellow card 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.880
 and after that i also talk to the referee it would have nobody ada 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.250
 is that bad that is also the reason that mario leg your other side had the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.299
 mayor yes I think that is a bit of a shame that I was replaced 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.320
 points 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.350
 Yes 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.689
 I screamed him backwards and yes 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.689
 and I also know with this referee it is a bit difficult but still 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.730
 more was added 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.860
 C1000 one and then much more herbie mans must be terrible 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.060
 get a lot 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.020
 and only a few should receive a red card because it makes hands out of the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.799
 sixteen the neighborhood interpreted that conversation and to be honest 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.799
 i have i can not do much of this maybe no one 3 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.699
 against two yellow cards 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.329
 the remains
