his pacing right this time around seeing
as<00:02:34.400> there's<00:02:34.579> only<00:02:34.700> two<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.359> three<00:02:35.419> crying

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
as there's only two or three crying

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.650 
as there's only two or three crying
sessions<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.829> this<00:02:36.950> entire<00:02:37.340> thing<00:02:37.700> so

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.190 

yeah<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.320> think<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.730> has<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> large<00:02:45.600> part

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
yeah I think that has to do a large part

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.770 
yeah I think that has to do a large part
in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.440> fact<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.950> Peter<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.430> no<00:02:47.820> longer<00:02:48.300> like

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
in the fact that Peter is no longer like

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.470 
in the fact that Peter is no longer like

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
hates on himself it feels like he

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.350
