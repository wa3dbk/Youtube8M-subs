digital I would say about four years
back<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> might<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.920> been<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> twenty<00:01:50.400> percent

and<00:01:53.220> today<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.150> 5050

the<00:01:57.820> unique<00:01:58.240> ID<00:01:58.450> program<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:59.290> impossible<00:01:59.890> to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
the unique ID program is impossible to

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.040 
the unique ID program is impossible to
do<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.159> analog<00:02:00.580> because<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.120> has<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.659> complete

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
do it analog because it has a complete

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.410 
do it analog because it has a complete
variable<00:02:02.500> data<00:02:02.770> on<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.640> there's<00:02:04.360> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
variable data on it and there's a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.510 
variable data on it and there's a
photograph<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.140> person<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.890> document

photograph of the person in the document

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.699 
photograph of the person in the document
so<00:02:07.119> we<00:02:07.270> needed<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.080> high<00:02:08.289> quality

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
so we needed to have a high quality

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.740 
so we needed to have a high quality
picture<00:02:09.160> as<00:02:09.369> well<00:02:09.610> as<00:02:09.759> data<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.300> only<00:02:10.420> way

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
picture as well as data so the only way

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.140 
picture as well as data so the only way
to<00:02:10.780> produce<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> digital<00:02:13.000> platform

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
to produce it is on a digital platform

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.990 
to produce it is on a digital platform
like<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.840> Indigo<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:15.310> ended<00:02:15.520> up<00:02:15.580> doing<00:02:15.760> about

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
like the Indigo we ended up doing about

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.560 
like the Indigo we ended up doing about
34<00:02:16.990> million<00:02:17.380> unique<00:02:17.950> documents<00:02:18.640> with<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
34 million unique documents with the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.600 
34 million unique documents with the
three<00:02:19.870> Indigo<00:02:20.350> presses<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:20.980> about<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> three

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
three Indigo presses in about a three

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.370 
three Indigo presses in about a three
and<00:02:21.640> half<00:02:21.850> months<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.230> was

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
and half months and I think that was

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.740 
and half months and I think that was
really<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.739> good<00:02:24.070> output<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.970> traditional

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
really a good output the traditional

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.130 
really a good output the traditional
publishing<00:02:29.410> model<00:02:30.040> has<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.880> huge<00:02:31.600> amount<00:02:31.780> of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
publishing model has a huge amount of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.100 
publishing model has a huge amount of
waste<00:02:32.850> waste<00:02:33.850> not<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.390> from<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.780> perspective

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
waste waste not just from a perspective

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.770 
waste waste not just from a perspective
of<00:02:35.530> extra<00:02:36.310> copies<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:36.940> paper<00:02:37.150> being<00:02:37.450> wasted

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
of extra copies or paper being wasted

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.540 
of extra copies or paper being wasted
but<00:02:37.959> also<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.440> terms<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.830> money<00:02:39.040> because<00:02:39.430> you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
but also in terms of money because you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.640 
but also in terms of money because you

holding huge amounts of inventory using

holding huge amounts of inventory using
digital<00:02:42.010> foreign<00:02:42.700> demand<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.060> definitely<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
digital foreign demand is definitely the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.220 
digital foreign demand is definitely the
right<00:02:43.720> way<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.019> go<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.269> reasons<00:02:46.750> we

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
right way to go one of the reasons we

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.040 
right way to go one of the reasons we
work<00:02:47.470> with<00:02:47.650> HP<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.489> think<00:02:48.850> two<00:02:49.600> of<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
work with HP is that I think two of the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.560 
work with HP is that I think two of the
important<00:02:50.590> values<00:02:51.070> are<00:02:51.310> very<00:02:51.430> similar<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.150> us

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
important values are very similar for us

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.479 
important values are very similar for us
innovation<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> key<00:02:53.380> we<00:02:53.680> always<00:02:53.980> look<00:02:54.340> at

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
innovation is a key we always look at

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.240 
innovation is a key we always look at
what<00:02:54.760> value<00:02:55.300> we<00:02:55.480> can<00:02:55.690> create<00:02:56.050> beyond<00:02:57.010> what's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
what value we can create beyond what's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.710 
what value we can create beyond what's
currently<00:02:57.370> there<00:02:57.790> for<00:02:58.239> us<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.390> for<00:02:58.690> our

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
currently there for us and for our

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.080 
currently there for us and for our
customers<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.980> think<00:03:00.160> HP<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.700> also<00:03:00.940> very

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
customers and I think HP is also very

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.330 
customers and I think HP is also very
not<00:03:01.299> your<00:03:01.480> company<00:03:01.810> second<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.470> reliability

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
not your company second is reliability

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.850 
not your company second is reliability
I<00:03:03.459> think<00:03:03.730> HP<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.120> very<00:03:04.299> reliable<00:03:04.840> they<00:03:05.079> do<00:03:05.560> what

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
I think HP is very reliable they do what

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.069 
I think HP is very reliable they do what
they<00:03:06.040> say<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.459> we<00:03:06.970> are<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.180> same<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:07.959> think

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
they say and we are the same so I think

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.930 
they say and we are the same so I think
these<00:03:08.290> two<00:03:08.560> matching<00:03:08.980> values<00:03:09.130> make<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.790> good

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
these two matching values make a good

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.710 
these two matching values make a good

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
growth in the future and I think because

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.840 
growth in the future and I think because

of how the world is moving that
