00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.350 

but<00:00:10.010> my<00:00:10.160> favorite<00:00:10.760> slash<00:00:11.240> chord<00:00:11.799> has<00:00:12.799> to<00:00:13.070> be

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
but my favorite slash chord has to be

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.850 
but my favorite slash chord has to be
this<00:00:17.590> this<00:00:18.590> is<00:00:18.740> a<00:00:18.770> B<00:00:19.099> major<00:00:19.400> in<00:00:19.759> the<00:00:20.240> right<00:00:20.420> hand

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
this this is a B major in the right hand

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.480 
this this is a B major in the right hand
played<00:00:21.860> over<00:00:22.189> C<00:00:22.430> in<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.669> bass

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
played over C in the bass

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.200 
played over C in the bass
there's<00:00:25.490> such<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.820> nice<00:00:26.150> intriguing<00:00:27.019> chord<00:00:27.500> and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
there's such a nice intriguing chord and

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.269 
there's such a nice intriguing chord and
I<00:00:29.210> end<00:00:29.570> some<00:00:29.930> of<00:00:30.050> my<00:00:30.199> compositions<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.099> that

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
I end some of my compositions on that

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:44.340 
I end some of my compositions on that
chord

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.599 

so<00:00:44.980> this<00:00:45.160> is<00:00:45.370> f<00:00:45.879> major<00:00:46.300> in<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.989> right<00:00:47.140> hand

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
so this is f major in the right hand

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.000 
so this is f major in the right hand
I've<00:00:48.609> doubled<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.359> C<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:50.410> create<00:00:50.710> a<00:00:50.739> bigger

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
I've doubled the C to create a bigger

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.900 
I've doubled the C to create a bigger
sound

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
sound

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.000 
sound
and<00:00:53.770> then<00:00:54.770> I've<00:00:54.920> got<00:00:54.950> g-flat<00:00:55.790> in<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.510> base

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
and then I've got g-flat in the base

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
and then I've got g-flat in the base
doubled<00:00:58.010> for<00:00:58.400> a<00:00:58.460> bigger<00:00:58.610> sound

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.469 

so<00:01:04.989> it's<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.170> really<00:01:05.409> nice<00:01:05.680> intriguing<00:01:06.580> ending

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
so it's a really nice intriguing ending

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.719 
so it's a really nice intriguing ending

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
are in the base so it's like the right

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.490 
are in the base so it's like the right
hands<00:01:43.189> trying<00:01:43.429> to<00:01:43.490> have<00:01:43.609> a<00:01:43.640> good<00:01:43.820> time

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
chords but then the bass is just kind of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:11.960 
chords but then the bass is just kind of
