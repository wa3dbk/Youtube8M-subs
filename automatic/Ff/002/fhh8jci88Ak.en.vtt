noticed when I was moving from point A
to<00:00:14.700> point<00:00:14.849> B<00:00:15.150> when<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> was<00:00:15.630> heading<00:00:15.839> over<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
to point B when I was heading over to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.260 
to point B when I was heading over to
one<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> objectives<00:00:16.910> something<00:00:17.910> was

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
one of the objectives something was

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.529 
one of the objectives something was
moving<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.380> normally<00:00:20.039> isn't<00:00:20.279> moving<00:00:20.670> it's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
moving that normally isn't moving it's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.570

the trees I don't know if you guys have
noticed<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> gameplay<00:00:24.539> whenever<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.350> pass

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
noticed in the gameplay whenever I pass

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.650 
noticed in the gameplay whenever I pass
over<00:00:25.859> one<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> foliage<00:00:26.910> whenever<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.390> pass

over one of the foliage whenever I pass
over<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.289> these<00:00:28.380> palm<00:00:28.650> trees<00:00:28.680> there

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
over one of these palm trees there

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.749 
over one of these palm trees there
partying<00:00:30.330> away<00:00:30.449> from<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.679> helicopter<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
partying away from the helicopter I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
partying away from the helicopter I
thought<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.329> myself<00:00:33.480> has<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.260> been<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
thought to myself has this been in

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
thought to myself has this been in
battlefield<00:00:35.760> since<00:00:36.000> day<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.660> might<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
battlefield since day one it might is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.479 
battlefield since day one it might is
completely<00:00:37.410> oblivious<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:38.250> I'll<00:00:38.340> be

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
completely oblivious because I'll be

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.549 
completely oblivious because I'll be
honest<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.850> don't<00:00:38.969> fly<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.660> helicopters<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
honest I don't fly in helicopters out of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.319 
honest I don't fly in helicopters out of
all<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> often<00:00:41.100> I'll<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> gunner<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
all that often I'll be the gunner in the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
all that often I'll be the gunner in the
attack<00:00:42.660> helicopter<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.350> my<00:00:43.500> good<00:00:43.680> friend

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
attack helicopter if my good friend

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.010 
attack helicopter if my good friend
level<00:00:44.100> captain<00:00:44.370> wants<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.730> endure<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.840> pain

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
level captain wants to endure the pain

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
level captain wants to endure the pain
that<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> attack<00:00:46.829> helicopter<00:00:47.090> but<00:00:48.090> I've

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that is the attack helicopter but I've

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.170 
that is the attack helicopter but I've
never<00:00:48.809> noticed<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.890> trees<00:00:50.219> moving<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:51.059> we

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
never noticed the trees moving when we

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.430 
never noticed the trees moving when we
fly<00:00:51.390> over<00:00:51.690> something<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
fly over something like this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
fly over something like this
so<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.980> went<00:00:53.129> back<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> normal<00:00:53.579> server<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
so I went back to the normal server I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760 
so I went back to the normal server I
wanted<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> confirm<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:54.989> myself<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> jump

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
wanted to confirm for myself so I jump

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.040 
wanted to confirm for myself so I jump
back<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.280> Hainan<00:00:56.489> resorts<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.180> yep

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
back to on to Hainan resorts and yep

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
back to on to Hainan resorts and yep
they<00:00:58.440> don't<00:00:58.920> move<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> normal

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
they don't move on the normal

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
they don't move on the normal
battlefield<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.930> CTE<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.949> absolutely

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
battlefield but on CTE they absolutely

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.539 
battlefield but on CTE they absolutely
do<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> thought<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:04.830> further<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
do and what I thought about further I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
do and what I thought about further I
remembered<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.320> capability<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
remembered that this was a capability of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
remembered that this was a capability of
the<00:01:08.100> frostbite<00:01:08.580> 3<00:01:08.760> engine<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:09.689> dice

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the frostbite 3 engine like when dice

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
the frostbite 3 engine like when dice
was<00:01:10.140> promoting<00:01:10.560> pallet<00:01:10.830> before<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
was promoting pallet before one of the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.460 
was promoting pallet before one of the
ways<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.600> were<00:01:12.659> trying<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> promote<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
ways that they were trying to promote it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
ways that they were trying to promote it
was<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> these<00:01:14.460> trailers<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
was with some of these trailers and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.820 
was with some of these trailers and
remember<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.770> were

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
remember and one of them they were

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
remember and one of them they were
demonstrating<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.909> had<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
demonstrating that they had the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
demonstrating that they had the
capabilities<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> pushing<00:01:19.530> wind<00:01:19.860> through<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
capabilities of pushing wind through a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
capabilities of pushing wind through a
map<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.570> intervals<00:01:21.990> from

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
map at different intervals from

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
map at different intervals from
different<00:01:22.530> directions<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.820> environment

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
different directions and the environment

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
different directions and the environment
in<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> trees<00:01:24.659> would<00:01:25.140> sway<00:01:25.590> depending<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
in the trees would sway depending on

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
in the trees would sway depending on
where<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> wind<00:01:27.119> was<00:01:27.240> coming<00:01:27.390> from<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
where the wind was coming from and the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.210 
where the wind was coming from and the
intensity<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.770> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
intensity of it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
intensity of it
it<00:01:29.520> was<00:01:29.670> incredible<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it was incredible back then like this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.090 
it was incredible back then like this
was<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> features<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.950> was

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
was one of the features that I was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.499 
was one of the features that I was
really<00:01:32.400> excited<00:01:32.640> about<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
really excited about it was one of the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020 
really excited about it was one of the
things<00:01:34.079> about<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.650> frostbite<00:01:35.100> 3<00:01:35.280> engine<00:01:35.400> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
things about the frostbite 3 engine that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
things about the frostbite 3 engine that
was<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.450> next-gen<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.259> could<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.560> wait

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
was really next-gen and I could not wait

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.190 
was really next-gen and I could not wait
to<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> multiplayer<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.020> as

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to see that in the multiplayer but as

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
to see that in the multiplayer but as
you<00:01:40.500> guys<00:01:40.680> probably<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:41.579> noticed<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.119> was

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you guys probably have noticed that was

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.020 
you guys probably have noticed that was
never<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> game<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.979> while<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.820> haven't

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
never in the game and while they haven't

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.789 
never in the game and while they haven't
gone<00:01:45.210> into<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> specific<00:01:45.960> reasons<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> why

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
gone into the specific reasons as to why

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.460 
gone into the specific reasons as to why
they<00:01:47.490> removed<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.570> feature<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.170> paddle

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
they removed this feature when paddle

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
they removed this feature when paddle
before<00:01:49.740> launched<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:50.280> even<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.579> reasons<00:01:50.850> why

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
before launched or even the reasons why

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.429 
before launched or even the reasons why
they<00:01:51.240> added<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.570> back<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.899> in

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
they added it back on in

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.010 
they added it back on in
I<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:53.369> us<00:01:53.520> especially<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.270> when<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I have us especially in that when the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
I have us especially in that when the
game<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.799> launched<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> either<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:57.479> too

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
game first launched it either was too

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.209 
game first launched it either was too
buggy<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> glitchy<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> guys

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
buggy and glitchy like if you guys

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.010 
buggy and glitchy like if you guys
remember<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.700> battlefield<00:02:00.180> 4<00:02:00.390> first<00:02:00.780> came

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
remember when battlefield 4 first came

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.709 
remember when battlefield 4 first came
out<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:02.009> had<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> crashing<00:02:03.270> problems

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
out it had a lot of crashing problems

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.480 
out it had a lot of crashing problems
and<00:02:03.899> maybe<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.409> helicopters<00:02:05.070> were<00:02:05.219> flying

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
and maybe if helicopters were flying

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
and maybe if helicopters were flying
over<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> lot<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.270> trees<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.869> trees<00:02:07.049> were

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
over a lot of these trees and trees were

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.749 
over a lot of these trees and trees were
moving<00:02:07.380> around<00:02:07.619> maybe<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.459> one<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
moving around maybe that was one of the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.400 
moving around maybe that was one of the
reasons<00:02:09.030> why<00:02:09.209> people<00:02:09.239> were<00:02:09.899> experiencing

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
reasons why people were experiencing

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.710 
reasons why people were experiencing
these<00:02:10.530> problems<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:11.250> maybe<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.239> was<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
these problems or maybe it was just a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.140 
these problems or maybe it was just a
too

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
too

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.850 
too
much<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.329> a<00:02:13.420> load<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.959> had<00:02:14.200> too<00:02:14.409> many<00:02:14.530> problems

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
much of a load and had too many problems

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.789 
much of a load and had too many problems
with<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.700> netcode<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.930> could<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.590> more

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
with the netcode this could just be more

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.160 
with the netcode this could just be more
information<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.879> server<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.420> having<00:02:19.840> to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
information that the server is having to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.559 
information that the server is having to
you<00:02:21.129> know<00:02:21.220> send<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.819> players<00:02:22.090> like<00:02:22.420> when

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
you know send to the players like when

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.050 
you know send to the players like when
I'm<00:02:22.689> flying<00:02:23.049> my<00:02:23.290> helicopter<00:02:23.590> over<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> tree

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
I'm flying my helicopter over a tree

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.330 
I'm flying my helicopter over a tree
well<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.750> moving<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.409> everyone<00:02:26.860> around<00:02:27.159> me

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
well it's moving to everyone around me

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.729 
well it's moving to everyone around me
and<00:02:27.489> if<00:02:27.939> that<00:02:28.450> information<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.349> has<00:02:29.560> to

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
and if that information then has to

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.830 
and if that information then has to
bounce<00:02:29.890> not<00:02:30.129> only<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.459> me<00:02:30.609> but<00:02:30.640> also<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
bounce not only to me but also to the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.710 
bounce not only to me but also to the
enemies<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.470> also<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.799> everyone<00:02:33.280> around<00:02:33.519> me

maybe<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:35.470> was<00:02:35.680> causing<00:02:35.950> some<00:02:36.280> problems<00:02:36.430> I'm

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
maybe that was causing some problems I'm

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.339 
maybe that was causing some problems I'm
not<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> hundred<00:02:37.569> percent<00:02:37.629> certain<00:02:38.140> I'm<00:02:38.319> not

someone who works on video games I don't

someone who works on video games I don't
have<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.599> firm<00:02:40.989> grasp<00:02:41.290> as<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.890> how<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.069> netcode

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
have a firm grasp as to how the netcode

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.970 
have a firm grasp as to how the netcode
or<00:02:42.939> how<00:02:43.060> these<00:02:43.299> issues<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:43.989> arise<00:02:44.109> but<00:02:44.920> I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
or how these issues can arise but I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.009 
or how these issues can arise but I
would<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.430> would<00:02:45.639> assume<00:02:45.909> or<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.269> would<00:02:46.780> imagine

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
would I would assume or I would imagine

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.349 
would I would assume or I would imagine
that<00:02:47.470> those<00:02:47.950> would<00:02:48.310> be<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.549> two<00:02:48.700> reasons<00:02:49.120> why

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
that those would be the two reasons why

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.569 
that those would be the two reasons why
this<00:02:49.810> wasn't<00:02:50.109> added<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:50.920> game<00:02:50.950> at<00:02:51.310> least

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
this wasn't added into the game at least

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.849 
this wasn't added into the game at least
at<00:02:51.790> release<00:02:52.420> but<00:02:53.079> no<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.379> dice<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.680> sound

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
at release but no the dice to sound

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.430 
at release but no the dice to sound
almost<00:02:54.129> a<00:02:54.489> year<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.299> hammer<00:02:55.569> out<00:02:55.750> all<00:02:56.079> of<00:02:56.109> these

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
almost a year to hammer out all of these

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.869 
almost a year to hammer out all of these
issues<00:02:56.889> and<00:02:57.069> they<00:02:57.159> probably<00:02:57.370> had<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.609> lot<00:02:57.730> of

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
issues and they probably had a lot of

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.819 
issues and they probably had a lot of
time<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.239> fix<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.629> bugs<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.230> glitches<00:02:59.349> with

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
time to fix the bugs and glitches with

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.490 
time to fix the bugs and glitches with
the<00:02:59.920> frostbite<00:03:00.340> engine<00:03:00.569> maybe<00:03:01.569> just<00:03:02.260> maybe

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the frostbite engine maybe just maybe

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.339 
the frostbite engine maybe just maybe
this<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.549> now<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.760> time<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.599> they<00:03:04.840> felt<00:03:05.170> like

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
this is now the time that they felt like

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.020 
this is now the time that they felt like
it<00:03:05.500> was<00:03:05.620> appropriate<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:06.400> add<00:03:06.579> this<00:03:06.849> feature

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
it was appropriate to add this feature

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.059 
it was appropriate to add this feature
on<00:03:07.389> in<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.139> think<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.769> this<00:03:08.889> would<00:03:09.040> be

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
on in I think that this would be

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.440 
on in I think that this would be
incredible<00:03:09.579> like<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.849> am<00:03:09.970> crossing<00:03:10.239> my<00:03:10.389> fingers

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
incredible like I am crossing my fingers

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.020 
incredible like I am crossing my fingers
that<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.290> gets<00:03:11.620> added<00:03:11.829> back<00:03:12.159> into<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
that this gets added back into the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.910 
that this gets added back into the
normal<00:03:13.359> battlefield<00:03:14.109> servers<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.590> hope<00:03:14.739> that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
normal battlefield servers I hope that

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.649 
normal battlefield servers I hope that
this<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.189> one<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.730> one<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.329> features

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
this is one of the one of the features

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.180 
this is one of the one of the features
that<00:03:16.689> is<00:03:16.989> introduced<00:03:17.470> with<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.859> upcoming

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
that is introduced with the upcoming

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.039 
that is introduced with the upcoming
patch<00:03:18.609> because<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.269> think<00:03:19.569> that<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.810> is

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
patch because I think that this is

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.869 
patch because I think that this is
simply<00:03:20.410> amazing<00:03:20.620> sure<00:03:21.579> it's<00:03:21.760> not

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
simply amazing sure it's not

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.580 
simply amazing sure it's not
game-changing<00:03:22.569> like<00:03:22.750> let's<00:03:22.959> be<00:03:23.109> honest<00:03:23.470> like

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
game-changing like let's be honest like

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.750 
game-changing like let's be honest like
this<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:23.919> not<00:03:24.099> gonna<00:03:24.220> have<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.489> lot<00:03:24.730> of

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
this is not gonna have a lot of

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.699 
this is not gonna have a lot of
influence<00:03:25.030> on<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.389> battlefield<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:26.019> may<00:03:26.379> save

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
influence on the battlefield it may save

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.110 
influence on the battlefield it may save
you<00:03:26.889> every<00:03:27.250> once<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.639> while<00:03:27.699> when<00:03:28.030> you're

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
you every once in a while when you're

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.119 
you every once in a while when you're
flying<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.449> a<00:03:28.540> helicopter<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.680> normally

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
flying in a helicopter and like normally

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.740 
flying in a helicopter and like normally
you<00:03:30.159> may<00:03:30.489> have<00:03:30.609> just<00:03:30.819> slammed<00:03:31.180> right<00:03:31.329> into<00:03:31.480> a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
you may have just slammed right into a

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.830 
you may have just slammed right into a
tree<00:03:32.079> but<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.919> wind<00:03:33.159> blows<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:33.909> away<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.569> so

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
tree but the wind blows it away and so

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.780 
tree but the wind blows it away and so
you<00:03:34.900> skirt<00:03:35.440> on<00:03:35.590> by<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.280> doesn't<00:03:36.579> it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
you skirt on by and it doesn't it

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.490 
you skirt on by and it doesn't it
doesn't<00:03:37.090> cause<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.540> explode<00:03:38.139> in<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.349> nice

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
doesn't cause you to explode in a nice

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.280 
doesn't cause you to explode in a nice
fiery<00:03:38.859> ball<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.400> death<00:03:39.609> but<00:03:40.299> overall<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.230> is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
fiery ball of death but overall it is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.289 
fiery ball of death but overall it is
just<00:03:41.620> going<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.859> be<00:03:42.069> a<00:03:42.099> really<00:03:42.849> cool<00:03:43.030> aesthetic

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
just going to be a really cool aesthetic

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.569 
just going to be a really cool aesthetic
feature<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.379> gonna<00:03:44.500> add<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.739> further<00:03:45.159> layer

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
feature it's gonna add a further layer

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.089 
feature it's gonna add a further layer
of<00:03:45.909> immersion<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.659> I<00:03:47.049> think<00:03:47.379> like<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.799> said<00:03:48.069> I

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
of immersion and I think like I said I

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.789 
of immersion and I think like I said I
just<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.609> this<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:49.019> incredible<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.530> next

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
just think this is incredible the next

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.469 
just think this is incredible the next
thing<00:03:50.919> I<00:03:51.010> wanted<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.280> talk<00:03:51.430> about<00:03:51.459> quickly<00:03:51.849> was

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
thing I wanted to talk about quickly was

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.710 
thing I wanted to talk about quickly was
to<00:03:53.139> clear<00:03:53.379> up<00:03:53.590> some<00:03:53.620> misconceptions<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:55.419> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
to clear up some misconceptions on the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.649 
to clear up some misconceptions on the
way<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.440> CTE<00:03:56.829> servers<00:03:57.370> work<00:03:57.609> on<00:03:57.849> PC<00:03:58.359> I

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
way that the CTE servers work on PC I

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.689 
way that the CTE servers work on PC I
think<00:03:59.229> a<00:03:59.349> lot<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.590> console<00:04:00.099> users<00:04:00.489> out<00:04:00.669> there

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
think a lot of console users out there

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.089 
think a lot of console users out there
are<00:04:01.359> under<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.780> impression<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.440> when<00:04:03.040> I

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
are under the impression that when I

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.009 
are under the impression that when I
when<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.790> make<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> video<00:04:04.120> like<00:04:04.479> today<00:04:04.750> where<00:04:04.989> I

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
when I make a video like today where I

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.509 
when I make a video like today where I
talk<00:04:05.260> about<00:04:05.290> all<00:04:05.530> these<00:04:05.919> new<00:04:05.979> features<00:04:06.340> that

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
talk about all these new features that

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.159 
talk about all these new features that
are<00:04:06.819> coming<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.150> Battlefield<00:04:07.629> or<00:04:07.810> when<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:07.959> talk

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
are coming to Battlefield or when I talk

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.379 
are coming to Battlefield or when I talk
about<00:04:08.440> how<00:04:08.620> dice<00:04:08.919> is<00:04:09.190> going<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.639> be<00:04:09.790> changing

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
about how dice is going to be changing

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.360 
about how dice is going to be changing
some<00:04:10.930> weapon<00:04:11.319> balance<00:04:11.709> or<00:04:11.859> improving<00:04:12.250> the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
some weapon balance or improving the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.920 
some weapon balance or improving the
netcode<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.060> think<00:04:13.540> they're<00:04:13.629> under<00:04:13.840> the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
netcode I think they're under the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.339 
netcode I think they're under the
impression<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.590> this<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.459> going<00:04:15.699> out<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.849> all

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
impression that this is going out to all

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.680 
impression that this is going out to all
PC<00:04:17.349> users<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.039> not<00:04:18.430> just<00:04:18.789> to<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> hundred

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
PC users and not just to like a hundred

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.539 
PC users and not just to like a hundred
people<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.079> are<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.709> know<00:04:20.739> testing<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.459> out

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
people that are you know testing it out

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.209 
people that are you know testing it out
on<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.180> CTE<00:04:22.599> this<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.469> not<00:04:23.590> going<00:04:23.860> out<00:04:23.979> to

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:24.219 
on the CTE this is not going out to

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:26.320 
on the CTE this is not going out to
everyone<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:24.849> plays<00:04:25.120> Battlefield<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.900> the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
everyone that plays Battlefield on the

everyone that plays Battlefield on the
see<00:04:26.449> platform<00:04:26.990> like<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.319> is<00:04:27.439> just<00:04:27.620> simply

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
see platform like that is just simply

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.730 
see platform like that is just simply
not<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.370> case<00:04:29.150> at<00:04:29.210> any<00:04:29.629> given<00:04:29.780> moment<00:04:30.020> there

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
patches and give feedback to dice not

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.749 
patches and give feedback to dice not
all<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.509> patches<00:04:48.020> are<00:04:48.439> fantastic<00:04:49.370> at<00:04:49.520> one

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
all of the patches are fantastic at one

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.119 
all of the patches are fantastic at one
moment<00:04:49.969> dice<00:04:50.689> increase<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.259> movement<00:04:51.409> system

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
moment dice increase the movement system

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.800 
moment dice increase the movement system
so<00:04:52.550> where<00:04:52.759> it<00:04:52.969> was<00:04:53.150> like<00:04:53.300> everyone<00:04:53.689> was

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
so where it was like everyone was

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.409 
so where it was like everyone was
traveling<00:04:54.319> at<00:04:54.469> Mach<00:04:54.650> 5<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.789> sucked<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.300> get

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
traveling at Mach 5 and it sucked to get

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.640 
traveling at Mach 5 and it sucked to get
in<00:04:56.539> firefights<00:04:56.930> with<00:04:57.020> people<00:04:57.319> because<00:04:57.530> they

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
in firefights with people because they

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.959 
in firefights with people because they
were<00:04:57.740> just<00:04:57.889> strafing<00:04:58.189> back<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.580> forth<00:04:58.789> and

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:58.969 
were just strafing back and forth and

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.249 
were just strafing back and forth and
you<00:04:59.060> can<00:04:59.090> never<00:04:59.330> be<00:04:59.479> consistent<00:05:00.020> with<00:05:00.080> your

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
you can never be consistent with your

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.619 
you can never be consistent with your
shots<00:05:00.560> we<00:05:01.069> of<00:05:01.219> course<00:05:01.490> gave<00:05:01.729> our<00:05:01.940> feedback<00:05:02.419> we

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
shots we of course gave our feedback we

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.959 
shots we of course gave our feedback we
were<00:05:02.719> like<00:05:02.870> this<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.349> terrible<00:05:03.860> never<00:05:04.460> do<00:05:04.789> this

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
were like this is terrible never do this

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:06.939 
were like this is terrible never do this
again<00:05:05.330> or<00:05:05.360> never<00:05:05.629> push<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.139> this<00:05:06.229> far<00:05:06.469> they

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
again or never push it this far they

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.619 
again or never push it this far they
reeled<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.490> back<00:05:07.520> they<00:05:07.969> reeled<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.449> in<00:05:08.479> the

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
reeled it back they reeled it in the

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:10.540 
reeled it back they reeled it in the
movement<00:05:08.990> system<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.500> now<00:05:09.860> it's<00:05:10.099> in<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.340> better

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
movement system and now it's in a better

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.089 
movement system and now it's in a better
place<00:05:10.819> that<00:05:11.629> is<00:05:11.840> what<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.259> test<00:05:12.560> servers<00:05:12.949> are

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
place that is what the test servers are

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.399 
place that is what the test servers are
all<00:05:13.250> about<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.879> while<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:14.539> wish<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.990> consoles
