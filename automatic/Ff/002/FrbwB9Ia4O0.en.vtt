oh<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.710> didn't<00:01:14.250> even<00:01:14.310> mention<00:01:14.520> before<00:01:14.790> but

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
oh I didn't even mention before but

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
oh I didn't even mention before but

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
there were words you get an a/d scimitar

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.520 
there were words you get an a/d scimitar
which<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.340> worth<00:01:17.820> somewhere<00:01:18.509> around<00:01:18.570> 10k<00:01:18.990> at

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
which is worth somewhere around 10k at

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
which is worth somewhere around 10k at
the<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.369> making<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.700> video

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the time that I'm making this video

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.340 
the time that I'm making this video
which<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.689> quite<00:01:21.990> nice

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
which is quite nice

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
which is quite nice
and<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> also<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:22.890> 15k<00:01:23.520> thieving<00:01:23.909> experience

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and you also get 15k thieving experience

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
and you also get 15k thieving experience
which<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.439> quite<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> lot<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.880> actually

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
which is quite a lot that actually

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
which is quite a lot that actually
boosts<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> round<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> 437<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.950> believe<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
boosts you to round the 437 I believe I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.160 
boosts you to round the 437 I believe I
could<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:30.659> off<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.020> but

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
could be a little bit off or not but

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.690 
could be a little bit off or not but
it's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> experience<00:01:32.549> it's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
just made them to death and then you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.039 
just made them to death and then you
have<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:29.370> fight<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.640> next<00:02:29.970> boss<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.870> for

little bit and you can hit relatively

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.110 
little bit and you can hit relatively
high<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.340> shouldn't<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.700> doing<00:02:44.849> this

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
high so you shouldn't be doing this

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.680 
high so you shouldn't be doing this
without<00:02:45.359> any<00:02:45.690> good<00:02:45.959> food<00:02:46.370> trout<00:02:47.370> are<00:02:47.909> fine<00:02:48.329> as

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
made them over the chairs just fine so

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.110 
made them over the chairs just fine so
you'll<00:03:01.170> need<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.349> couple<00:03:01.560> trout<00:03:01.859> but<00:03:02.250> then<00:03:02.430> yeah

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
it works quite straightforwardly which

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.000 
it works quite straightforwardly which
isn't<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.329> word<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.530> that's<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.829> all

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
isn't a word and so that's really all

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.379 
isn't a word and so that's really all
that<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.159> want<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> show<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.639> this<00:03:08.760> video<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.060> hope

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389
