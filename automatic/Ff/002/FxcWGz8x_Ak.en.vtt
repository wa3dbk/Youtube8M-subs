00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
defense we also pride ourselves on our

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.080

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
last season we were really good i think

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.459 
last season we were really good i think
we're<00:00:34.710> over<00:00:34.950> seventy<00:00:35.340> five<00:00:35.370> percent

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
we're over seventy five percent

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.360 
touchdown ratio and we're in the red
zone<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.420> very<00:00:39.450> aggressive<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
zone so we are very aggressive and I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
zone so we are very aggressive and I
think<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> showed<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.210> today<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.780> obviously

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240 
I think for Jalen it's taken a little
bit<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> time<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.440> back<00:01:46.650> into<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.980> flow<00:01:47.220> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
bit of time to get back into the flow of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.400 
bit of time to get back into the flow of
things<00:01:47.400> get<00:01:47.850> back<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.240> flow<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.870> game

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
things get back in the flow of the game

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.890 
things get back in the flow of the game
the<00:01:50.370> tight<00:01:50.610> end<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.880> art<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.330> our<00:01:51.450> system<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
the tight end and art and our system is

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900 
the tight end and art and our system is
a<00:01:51.960> difficult<00:01:52.410> one<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.640> position<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.820> know

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
a difficult one that position you know

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.180 
a difficult one that position you know
where<00:01:54.150> we<00:01:54.360> ask<00:01:54.630> them<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> lot<00:01:55.410> in<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.010> run

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
where we ask them to do a lot in the run

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.830 
where we ask them to do a lot in the run
game<00:01:56.220> ask<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.850> lot<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> pass<00:01:57.360> game<00:01:57.630> whether

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
game ask a lot the pass game whether

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
game ask a lot the pass game whether
it's<00:01:58.050> running<00:01:58.830> routes<00:01:59.010> or<00:01:59.400> pass<00:01:59.670> protecting

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it's running routes or pass protecting

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
it's running routes or pass protecting
so<00:02:01.229> there's<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.410> lot<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> goes<00:02:01.800> into<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
so there's a lot that goes into it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.620 
so there's a lot that goes into it
different<00:02:02.940> than<00:02:03.030> maybe<00:02:03.210> some<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> other

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
different than maybe some of the other

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.930 
different than maybe some of the other
position<00:02:04.200> groups<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:04.650> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.130> Jalen's<00:02:05.610> been

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
position groups so I think Jalen's been

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.090 
position groups so I think Jalen's been
been<00:02:06.240> okay<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.869> free<00:02:07.350> practices<00:02:07.800> hopefully

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
been okay for free practices hopefully

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.499 
been okay for free practices hopefully
we<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.729> get<00:02:08.850> them<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> continue<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
we can we can get them to continue to

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.440 
we can we can get them to continue to
improve<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:10.380> next<00:02:10.619> week<00:02:11.209> one<00:02:12.209> more<00:02:12.330> question

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
improve the next week one more question

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.720 
improve the next week one more question
about<00:02:12.780> Bryce<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.050> he<00:02:13.530> out<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.220> spring<00:02:14.580> or

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
about Bryce is he out for the spring or

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.310 
about Bryce is he out for the spring or

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
is that a day to day we know other

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.920 
is that a day to day we know other
government<00:02:17.120> keep<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.270> seeing<00:02:18.480> or<00:02:18.630> seemed<00:02:18.810> like

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
government keep on seeing or seemed like

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.210 
government keep on seeing or seemed like
he<00:02:19.050> was<00:02:19.140> kind<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.380> all<00:02:19.530> over<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.770> place<00:02:19.860> today

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
he was kind of all over the place today

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.890 
he was kind of all over the place today
breaking<00:02:20.550> up<00:02:20.790> past<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.209> intercepting<00:02:21.780> them

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
breaking up past is intercepting them

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.240 
breaking up past is intercepting them
what<00:02:22.020> have<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> seen<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.560> him<00:02:22.650> yeah<00:02:22.860> well

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
what have you seen out of him yeah well

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.130 
what have you seen out of him yeah well
we<00:02:23.459> really<00:02:23.880> challenged<00:02:24.420> Kevon<00:02:24.720> after<00:02:25.050> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
we really challenged Kevon after the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.870 
we really challenged Kevon after the
first<00:02:25.350> practice<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.790> know

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
first practice that you know I you know

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.790 
first practice that you know I you know
even<00:02:27.120> though<00:02:27.180> he's<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> senior

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
even though he's going to be a senior

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.590 
even though he's going to be a senior
that<00:02:28.980> doesn't<00:02:29.280> mean<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.400> can't<00:02:29.700> continue<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
that doesn't mean we can't continue to

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.560 
that doesn't mean we can't continue to
improve<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.880> improve<00:02:32.880> our<00:02:33.330> competitiveness

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
improve and improve our competitiveness

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.530 
improve and improve our competitiveness
every<00:02:34.530> single<00:02:34.920> play<00:02:35.160> every<00:02:35.459> single<00:02:35.790> day<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.270> I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
every single play every single day and I

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.180 
every single play every single day and I
think<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.930> we're<00:02:37.440> starting<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.830> see<00:02:37.890> that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
think that we're starting to see that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.740 
think that we're starting to see that
more<00:02:38.459> with<00:02:38.640> Kevon<00:02:38.970> he's<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.239> really<00:02:39.720> talented

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
more with Kevon he's a really talented

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.650 
more with Kevon he's a really talented
guy<00:02:40.520> it's<00:02:41.520> keeping<00:02:42.030> him<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.360> getting<00:02:42.540> him

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
guy it's keeping him and getting him

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.449 
guy it's keeping him and getting him
getting<00:02:43.410> him<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.800> right<00:02:43.980> frame<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.310> mind

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
getting him in the right frame of mind

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.010 
getting him in the right frame of mind
and<00:02:44.820> then<00:02:44.940> keeping<00:02:45.330> him<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.780> playing

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
and then keeping him there and playing

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.650 
and then keeping him there and playing
with<00:02:46.170> an<00:02:46.290> edge<00:02:46.470> when<00:02:47.130> you're<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.820> there<00:02:47.850> at

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
with an edge when you're out there at

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.630 
with an edge when you're out there at
corner<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.320> you're<00:02:49.410> by<00:02:49.590> yourself<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.459> have

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
corner and you're by yourself you have

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.280 
corner and you're by yourself you have
to<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.150> edge<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.110> that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
to have that edge you have to have that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.800 
to have that edge you have to have that
ability<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.739> play<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.310> game<00:02:53.690> with<00:02:54.690> an

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
ability to play the game with an

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.710 
ability to play the game with an
intensity<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:56.010> with<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> real<00:02:57.090> quick<00:02:57.390> short

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
intensity and with a real quick short

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.259 
intensity and with a real quick short
memory<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.260> what<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.860> occurred<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.910> think

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
memory of what just occurred and I think

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.440 
memory of what just occurred and I think
Kevon<00:03:00.660> has<00:03:00.900> vastly<00:03:01.590> improved<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:03.360> it

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
Kevon has vastly improved there and it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.880 
Kevon has vastly improved there and it
showed<00:03:03.660> today<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.959> thought<00:03:04.230> he<00:03:04.380> played<00:03:04.410> really

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
guys do well again I've kind of held my

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.600 
guys do well again I've kind of held my
observation<00:03:33.650> some<00:03:33.890> after<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.220> first<00:03:34.490> two

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
observation some after the first two

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.340 
observation some after the first two
days<00:03:34.790> just<00:03:35.390> because<00:03:35.510> we<00:03:35.810> weren't<00:03:35.960> in<00:03:36.140> pad

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
days just because we weren't in pad

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.200 
days just because we weren't in pad
sometimes<00:03:36.770> it's<00:03:36.920> hard<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.130> tell<00:03:37.250> today

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
sometimes it's hard to tell today

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.200 
sometimes it's hard to tell today
obviously<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.780> first<00:03:38.960> full<00:03:39.500> day<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.940> know<00:03:41.030> in

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
obviously the first full day you know in

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.990 
obviously the first full day you know in
shoulder<00:03:41.690> pads<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:42.290> work<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:43.190> think<00:03:43.700> initially

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
shoulder pads to work I think initially

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.580 
shoulder pads to work I think initially
there<00:03:44.390> was<00:03:44.480> some<00:03:44.630> initial<00:03:44.810> shock<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.530> the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
there was some initial shock and the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.650 
there was some initial shock and the
first<00:03:45.830> team<00:03:46.070> period<00:03:46.490> were<00:03:46.640> getting<00:03:47.420> pushed

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
first team period were getting pushed

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.910 
first team period were getting pushed
around<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:48.020> little<00:03:48.170> bit<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.560> thought<00:03:48.770> the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
around a little bit I thought the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.220 
around a little bit I thought the
defensive<00:03:49.430> front<00:03:49.700> improved<00:03:50.360> as<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.780> practice

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
defensive front improved as the practice

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.430 
defensive front improved as the practice
went<00:03:51.470> on<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:52.630> bit<00:03:53.630> impressed<00:03:53.900> with<00:03:54.110> our<00:03:54.230> pass

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
went on a bit impressed with our pass

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.370 
went on a bit impressed with our pass
rush<00:03:54.470> has<00:03:54.860> been<00:03:55.040> good<00:03:55.990> first<00:03:56.990> three<00:03:57.230> days

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
rush has been good first three days

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.170 
rush has been good first three days
which<00:03:57.650> has<00:03:57.830> been<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.040> point<00:03:58.340> about<00:03:58.520> as<00:03:58.790> far<00:03:59.030> as

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
which has been a point about as far as

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.090 
which has been a point about as far as
an<00:03:59.300> area<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.660> our<00:03:59.840> of<00:04:00.020> our<00:04:00.170> team<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.560> we<00:04:00.800> think

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
an area of our of our team that we think

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.310 
an area of our of our team that we think
we<00:04:01.610> need<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.910> improve<00:04:02.150> upon<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.110> has

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
we need to improve upon so that that has

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.530 
we need to improve upon so that that has
been<00:04:03.470> impressive<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:04.100> me<00:04:04.250> but<00:04:04.459> beyond<00:04:05.390> that

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
been impressive to me but beyond that

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.540 
been impressive to me but beyond that

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
different way of looking with his range

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.330 
different way of looking with his range
in<00:05:26.039> terms<00:05:26.280> of<00:05:26.550> when<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.360> go<00:05:27.900> well<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:29.190> know<00:05:29.310> i

you know I'm you guys know me well
enough<00:05:34.229> I<00:05:34.590> think<00:05:34.860> that<00:05:35.400> after<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:36.090> year<00:05:36.360> we're

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
enough I think that after a year we're

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.950 
enough I think that after a year we're
going<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.289> be<00:05:37.440> really<00:05:37.830> aggressive<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.520> that's

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
going to be really aggressive and that's

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.779 
going to be really aggressive and that's
that's<00:05:39.960> just<00:05:40.530> kind<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.830> the<00:05:40.950> makeup<00:05:41.340> of<00:05:41.520> who<00:05:41.669> we

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
that's just kind of the makeup of who we

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:42.890 
that's just kind of the makeup of who we
are<00:05:41.820> as<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:42.090> team<00:05:42.120> we're<00:05:42.450> going<00:05:42.539> to<00:05:42.599> remain

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
are as a team we're going to remain

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.870 
are as a team we're going to remain
aggressive<00:05:43.229> when<00:05:43.620> we<00:05:43.770> when<00:05:44.070> we<00:05:44.099> cross<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.550> 50

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
aggressive when we when we cross the 50

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.060 
aggressive when we when we cross the 50
that's<00:05:45.030> that's<00:05:45.360> who<00:05:45.479> we<00:05:45.630> are<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:46.050> so<00:05:46.200> we<00:05:46.919> have

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
that's that's who we are and so we have

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.770 
that's that's who we are and so we have
a<00:05:47.099> tendency<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.610> go<00:05:47.760> for<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.090> may<00:05:48.210> be<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.570> little

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
a tendency to go for it may be a little

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.140 
a tendency to go for it may be a little
bit<00:05:48.990> more<00:05:49.169> than<00:05:49.380> some<00:05:49.560> other<00:05:49.710> teams<00:05:49.979> but<00:05:50.700> you

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
bit more than some other teams but you

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.450 
bit more than some other teams but you
have<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.450> have<00:05:51.570> an<00:05:52.050> identity<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.680> somewhere

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
have to have an identity of somewhere

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.580 
have to have an identity of somewhere
what<00:05:53.970> you<00:05:54.120> do<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:54.510> I<00:05:54.840> think<00:05:55.080> that's<00:05:55.260> something

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
what you do and I think that's something

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.640 
what you do and I think that's something
that<00:05:55.770> we<00:05:55.979> do<00:05:56.099> do<00:05:56.250> that<00:05:56.490> being<00:05:57.240> said<00:05:57.479> I<00:05:57.870> do<00:05:58.139> think

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
that we do do that being said I do think

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.969 
that we do do that being said I do think
matt<00:05:58.889> has<00:05:58.919> a<00:05:59.190> really<00:05:59.639> good<00:05:59.880> range<00:06:00.620> we<00:06:01.620> haven't

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
matt has a really good range we haven't

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.300 
matt has a really good range we haven't
really<00:06:02.310> tested<00:06:02.760> them<00:06:03.060> yet<00:06:03.210> this<00:06:03.690> this<00:06:04.310> this

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
really tested them yet this this this
