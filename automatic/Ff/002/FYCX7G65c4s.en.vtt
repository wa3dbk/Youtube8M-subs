00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
eye right now and they're bugging the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.319 
eye right now and they're bugging the
shit<00:01:33.479> out<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:35.030> downside<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
shit out of me it's the one downside and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
shit out of me it's the one downside and
then<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> other<00:01:36.840> downside<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.860> have

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
then the other downside is that you have

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.149 
then the other downside is that you have
to<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> two<00:01:38.700> step<00:01:38.970> process<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.950> do

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
to do like a two step process but I do

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.170 
to do like a two step process but I do
have<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> say<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.180> did<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
have to say I did do like one I with the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.240 
have to say I did do like one I with the
fiber<00:01:45.450> lash<00:01:46.170> thing<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
fiber lash thing and then I you know I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.580 
fiber lash thing and then I you know I
had<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> start<00:01:47.790> doing<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.570> manga<00:01:48.990> mascara<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
had to start doing the manga mascara and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.050 
had to start doing the manga mascara and
the<00:01:49.710> reason<00:01:50.040> why<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> told<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the reason why I told you I put like a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.179 
the reason why I told you I put like a
thick<00:01:51.360> coat<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> other<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
thick coat on the other I was because I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
thick coat on the other I was because I
wanted<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.689> actually<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
wanted to see if there was actually a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.130 
wanted to see if there was actually a
difference<00:01:55.500> between<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.790> fiber<00:01:57.149> lashes<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
difference between the fiber lashes and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.039 
difference between the fiber lashes and
this<00:01:58.740> by<00:01:58.950> itself<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.390> put<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> bunch<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
this by itself so i put like a bunch of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.410 
this by itself so i put like a bunch of
coats<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.409> top<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.969> side<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> see

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
coats on top of this on this side to see

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.880 
coats on top of this on this side to see
if<00:02:03.450> i<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.110> dramatic<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
if i can get it as dramatic with the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.830

my eye and it was like biome it looked
like<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.340> wearing<00:02:33.550> fake<00:02:33.820> eyelashes<00:02:34.360> like

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
like I was wearing fake eyelashes like

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.300 
like I was wearing fake eyelashes like
how<00:02:34.720> they<00:02:34.900> advertise<00:02:35.410> their<00:02:35.800> little<00:02:36.069> things

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310

be careful when you're putting on the
fiber<00:02:45.489> things<00:02:45.850> because<00:02:46.180> those<00:02:46.390> will<00:02:46.630> get<00:02:46.810> in

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
fiber things because those will get in

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.270 
fiber things because those will get in
your<00:02:47.080> eye<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.230> they're<00:02:47.739> really<00:02:47.980> annoying
