00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.769

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.830
 I will be using is to activate the 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.410
 charcon that is activated carbon can 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.260
 get in pills in capsules and 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.929
 open the capsules and take out the powder but 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.390
 I where I get it is on the internet and 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.460

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.369
 which you cut and I'm going to use it in a

 but you can get it in powder 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.710
 loose in a bottle as a pillbox or 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.470
 in the form of capsules any of the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.450
 forms is the same 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.010
 we will only be doing it in 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.520
 this stop to make it much easier 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.500
 access is very dusty or just have 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.079
 Beware of that which can stain the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.929
 things where it is put 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.339
 and once all the envelope is emptied 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.300
 beings putting the cap was like this for 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.300
 be able to have easy access 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.620
 let's start first with the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.650
 clean face freshly washed nothing 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.540
 makeup let's start I'm going to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.030
 pick up my hair to make it a 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.000
 little bit easier 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.860
 and using water and a paintbrush 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.560
 makeup that is for makeup 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.090
 liquid we will be using that 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.869
 brush so that the applied one is a bit 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.720
 easier 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.259
 we will be soaking enough 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.420
 brush since once you are well 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.890
 wet we will be using our top 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.540
 air with activated carbon we are going to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.310
 wetting the brush well and we are going to 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.380
 to be soaking in is being 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.170
 picking up some of the dust 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.690
 once it touches the water the coal will 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.000
 makes like sparkling and once it's 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.770
 so we will be applying it to the face and 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.869
 we will be doing it spliced ​​to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.360
 that is well soaked especially in the 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.890
 problem areas mine are the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.750
 cheeks and also in the nose if you like 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.300
 no more you can apply it where 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.909
 you need more help me usually 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.220
 almost I just do it on my nose since 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.220
 is where I have my pores open and 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.230
 in my forehead but I will be doing 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.180
 how can they apply on the whole face 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.409
 something easier to be able to also 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.049
 remove this is that the mask is 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.090
 can use before bathing like this 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.709
 so that when they wash their face they 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.170
 can wash more easily in the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.670
 shower as it can stain a little 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.069
 and it spreads all over the place 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.290
 and I'll be going past that wetting 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.870
 the brush and immersed in the powder and 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.700
 collecting more and sometimes even smoked it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.550
 will be applying on the face in palpadas 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.739
 it is enough to cover the whole face what the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.900
 carbon help is also to eliminate the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.239
 small black dots what it does is that it acts 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.650
 like a magnet and pull the whole society 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.349
 from inside the forum 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.450
 even if you're very oily skin 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.340
 this helps control the oil to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.460
 that your skin does not produce so much oil and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.860
 do not look greasy 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.050
 even when doing it with masks help 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.550
 close the pores open pores 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.510
 minimize them clean dirt and 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.700
 even in whites of your face 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.129
 if the first time you do it you're going to 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.599
 feel a sensation in your skin that is 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.790
 of what is activating your pores and 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.170
 even closing those already once you're 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.170
 dry we will be washing 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.909
 Once dry we will be drying 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.519
 our skin after this you can 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.519
 Apply your regular moisturizer and ready 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.920
 I hope you liked girls 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.769
