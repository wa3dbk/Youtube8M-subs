this<00:00:53.730> trots<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.390> forward<00:00:54.960> she's<00:00:55.710> running<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this trots to forward she's running a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.069 
this trots to forward she's running a
little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> forehand<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> need

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
little bit on the forehand so you need

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.439 
little bit on the forehand so you need
to<00:00:58.230> half<00:00:58.469> halt<00:00:58.859> keep<00:00:59.640> her<00:00:59.789> round<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> she

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to half halt keep her round and she

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.900 
to half halt keep her round and she
needs<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.840> rounder<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.609> horse

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
needs to be rounder because if a horse

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.789 
needs to be rounder because if a horse
is<00:01:03.030> only<00:01:03.449> 20%<00:01:03.809> round<00:01:05.810> before<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.049> transition<00:01:07.680> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
is only 20% round before a transition I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
is only 20% round before a transition I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
inside that's really important in a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.620 
inside that's really important in a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
shoulder is free because that will mean

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340

worked<00:02:08.970> for<00:02:09.330> half<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.929> circle<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.500> make<00:02:10.530> sure

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
worked for half a circle to make sure

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.250 
worked for half a circle to make sure
the<00:02:11.550> horse<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.330> where<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.599> needs<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the horse is right where it needs to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.710 
the horse is right where it needs to
so<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.069> transition<00:02:14.640> does<00:02:14.910> look<00:02:15.180> effortless

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so that transition does look effortless

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.509 
so that transition does look effortless
and<00:02:15.930> that's<00:02:16.319> what<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.650> need<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.310> can

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
and that's what you need to do you can

start<00:02:23.550> working<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.300> transition<00:02:24.900> when<00:02:25.530> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
start working on the transition when you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
start working on the transition when you
get<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> marker<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.879> go<00:02:27.030> ah<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.660> have<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:27.989> do

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
get to the marker and go ah I have to do

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.089 
get to the marker and go ah I have to do
a<00:02:28.260> transition<00:02:29.180> no<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.599> prepare<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.709> use<00:02:31.920> your

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
a transition no you prepare you use your

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.130 
a transition no you prepare you use your
corner<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.819> take<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.300> much<00:02:33.330> time<00:02:33.599> as<00:02:33.959> you

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
corner and you take as much time as you

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.830 
corner and you take as much time as you
need<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.980> make<00:02:35.130> sure<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:36.030> horse<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.480> round

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840

outside<00:02:39.510> rein<00:02:39.900> half<00:02:40.110> holtz<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.799> then<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.160> can

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
outside rein half holtz so then you can

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.000 
outside rein half holtz so then you can
use<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> light<00:02:41.790> aid<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.290> light<00:02:43.500> aid<00:02:43.769> is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
use a light aid and the light aid is

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.949 
use a light aid and the light aid is
obviously<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> scoop<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.540> your<00:02:45.720> seat

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
and if your horse isn't doing counter

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.120 
and if your horse isn't doing counter
transitions<00:02:48.959> from<00:02:49.140> your<00:02:49.319> light<00:02:49.470> aid<00:02:49.739> that's

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
transitions from your light aid that's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.860 
transitions from your light aid that's
what<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.489> need<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.700> practice<00:02:51.239> at<00:02:51.360> home<00:02:51.599> and

practice in your training so jion has

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.289 
practice in your training so jion has
always<00:02:55.680> been<00:02:55.860> pretty<00:02:56.040> good<00:02:56.280> listening<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.910> to

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
always been pretty good listening to to

always been pretty good listening to to
light<00:02:57.480> aides<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.140> let's<00:02:58.739> say<00:02:58.920> Montana<00:02:59.459> had

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
light aides but let's say Montana had

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.490 
light aides but let's say Montana had
sat<00:02:59.970> scooped<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.599> her<00:03:00.690> inside<00:03:01.019> seat<00:03:01.260> bone

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
sat scooped with her inside seat bone

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.289 
sat scooped with her inside seat bone
and<00:03:01.799> told<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> horse<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> canter<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
and told the horse to canter and the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.940 
and told the horse to canter and the
horse<00:03:03.450> had<00:03:03.569> ignored<00:03:03.930> her<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.650> would<00:03:04.860> have

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
horse had ignored her we would have

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.280 
horse had ignored her we would have
brought<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.250> horse<00:03:05.400> back<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.579> trot<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.810> know

brought the horse back to trot you know

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.780 
brought the horse back to trot you know
if<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.920> can't<00:03:07.980> because<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> horse<00:03:08.549> native

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
if I can't because the horse native

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.360 
if I can't because the horse native
trotted<00:03:09.060> faster<00:03:09.599> instead<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.049> cantered<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.340> a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
trotted faster instead of cantered so a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.819

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
can see the rider by preparing the horse

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.920 
can see the rider by preparing the horse
can<00:03:46.950> make<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.220> horse<00:03:47.400> look<00:03:47.639> like<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:48.000> can't<00:03:48.780> as

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
can make the horse look like it can't as

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.330 
can make the horse look like it can't as
effortlessly<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.130> horse<00:03:50.280> doesnt

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
effortlessly but the horse doesnt

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.610 
effortlessly but the horse doesnt
actually<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.299> there's<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.989> lot<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.290> has<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
actually and there's a lot that has to

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.039 
actually and there's a lot that has to
go<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.519> guess<00:03:54.329> that<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.780> biggest

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
go on so I guess that the biggest

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.900 
go on so I guess that the biggest
mistakes<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.560> see<00:03:55.590> riders<00:03:56.040> do<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.430> one<00:03:56.670> they

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
mistakes I see riders do is one they

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.830 
then believes that is how it does a trot
canter<00:05:22.530> transition<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.550> horse<00:05:23.759> believes<00:05:24.240> to
