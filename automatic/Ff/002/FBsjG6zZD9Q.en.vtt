her food drinks one night where they are
their<00:00:39.120> answer<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.980> think<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.340> deal<00:00:41.550> was

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
their answer and I think a deal was

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.479 
their answer and I think a deal was
struck<00:00:41.790> right<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.230> since<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.219> had

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
struck right and so since then it's had

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
struck right and so since then it's had
but<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.390> special<00:00:45.690> Eden<00:00:45.899> rebuilt<00:00:46.200> doesn't

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
but what special Eden rebuilt doesn't

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.709 
but what special Eden rebuilt doesn't
yeah<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.489> I've<00:00:47.610> had<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> tumult<00:00:48.360> solid

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
care analysis for it it was a bit of a
