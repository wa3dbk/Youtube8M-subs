hi<00:00:00.510> ash<00:00:00.719> in<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.140> tutorial<00:00:01.410> I'm<00:00:01.829> just<00:00:01.890> going

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hi ash in this tutorial I'm just going

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.390 
hi ash in this tutorial I'm just going
to<00:00:02.310> show<00:00:02.490> you<00:00:02.550> how<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.410> paint<00:00:04.410> on<00:00:04.710> your<00:00:04.890> texture

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
to show you how to paint on your texture

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.000 
to show you how to paint on your texture
onto<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.850> model<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.600> then<00:00:07.020> texture<00:00:07.529> Baker<00:00:07.770> to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
onto the model and then texture Baker to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.799 
onto the model and then texture Baker to
take<00:00:08.280> lighting<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.120> shadow<00:00:09.450> into

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
take lighting and shadow into

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.110 
take lighting and shadow into
consideration<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.099> your<00:00:11.280> model<00:00:11.849> look

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
consideration to make your model look

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660 
consideration to make your model look
more<00:00:12.330> three-dimensional<00:00:13.309> so<00:00:14.309> if<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.519> go<00:00:14.639> down

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
more three-dimensional so if you go down

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.910 
more three-dimensional so if you go down
first<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> all<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.929> split<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.260> screen<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.710> two

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.000 
go to unwrapped smart UV project and hit
okay<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.719> you've<00:00:46.899> just<00:00:46.930> basically<00:00:47.469> unwrapped

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
okay so you've just basically unwrapped

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.220 
okay so you've just basically unwrapped
the<00:00:48.160> model<00:00:48.430> into<00:00:48.610> two<00:00:48.910> dimensions<00:00:49.449> at<00:00:50.079> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.509 
the model into two dimensions at the
bottom<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:50.680> can<00:00:50.710> see<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.129> each<00:00:51.250> face

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
bottom you can see that each face

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.900 
bottom you can see that each face
represents<00:00:51.760> each<00:00:52.210> face<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.690> cube

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910

now<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.250> go<00:02:24.400> up<00:02:24.580> I'm<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.000> increase<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
now if I go up I'm going to increase the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.490 
now if I go up I'm going to increase the
radius<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:26.710> my<00:02:27.130> cursor<00:02:27.930> put<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.020> strength<00:02:29.290> to

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
radius of my cursor put the strength to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.630 
radius of my cursor put the strength to
one

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
one

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.610 
one
I'm<00:02:31.150> gonna<00:02:31.330> zoom<00:02:31.569> back<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.900> little<00:02:32.140> bit<00:02:32.410> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
I'm gonna zoom back a little bit and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.240 
I'm gonna zoom back a little bit and
they're<00:02:32.830> cute<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:34.410> move<00:02:35.410> my<00:02:35.590> cursor<00:02:35.800> over<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
they're cute and move my cursor over the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
they're cute and move my cursor over the
cube<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.760> left<00:02:37.060> hand<00:02:37.240> click<00:02:38.850> ok<00:02:39.850> you'll<00:02:40.030> see

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
cube and left hand click ok you'll see

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.640 
cube and left hand click ok you'll see
that<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.569> turned<00:02:40.840> blue<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.200> reason<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.500> is

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
that it's turned blue the reason that is

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.970 
that it's turned blue the reason that is
is<00:02:41.680> because<00:02:41.950> I've<00:02:42.430> got<00:02:42.580> blue<00:02:42.790> selected<00:02:43.240> here<00:02:43.510> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
is because I've got blue selected here I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.699 
is because I've got blue selected here I
want<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.160> be<00:02:45.900> white<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:46.930> color

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.440 

so<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.730> actually

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
so that it actually

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.229 
so that it actually
imposes<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:55.050> prince<00:02:55.680> puts<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.970> actual

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
imposes or prince puts on the actual

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.369 
imposes or prince puts on the actual
texture<00:02:57.660> image<00:02:58.560> itself

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
texture image itself

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.289 
texture image itself
so<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.159> give<00:03:01.310> me<00:03:01.400> two<00:03:01.549> seconds<00:03:01.969> here<00:03:02.120> while<00:03:02.269> I

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
so just give me two seconds here while I

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:18.070 
so just give me two seconds here while I
do<00:03:02.420> this

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.410 

okay<00:03:18.800> we've<00:03:19.280> pretty<00:03:19.490> much<00:03:19.580> got<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:19.940> now<00:03:20.180> you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
okay we've pretty much got it now you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.840 
okay we've pretty much got it now you
have<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.410> spend<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.160> bit<00:03:22.280> more<00:03:22.310> time<00:03:22.460> there

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
have to spend a bit more time there

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.370 
have to spend a bit more time there
being<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> little<00:03:23.270> more<00:03:23.360> careful<00:03:23.630> about<00:03:23.990> how

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
being a little more careful about how

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.850 
being a little more careful about how
you<00:03:24.440> actually<00:03:25.570> paint<00:03:26.570> on<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.990> texture<00:03:27.650> onto

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
you actually paint on the texture onto

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.520 
you actually paint on the texture onto
the<00:03:28.070> object<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.720> what<00:03:29.840> I'm<00:03:29.930> gonna<00:03:30.080> do<00:03:30.290> now<00:03:30.500> is

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
the object so what I'm gonna do now is

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.410 
the object so what I'm gonna do now is
down<00:03:30.950> here<00:03:31.280> I'm<00:03:31.400> going<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.640> go<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.790> image<00:03:32.030> and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
down here I'm going to go to image and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.510 
down here I'm going to go to image and
I'm<00:03:32.990> gonna<00:03:33.170> save<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.890> texture<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.460> I've

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
I'm gonna save this texture that I've

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.740 
I'm gonna save this texture that I've
just<00:03:34.670> created<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.480> image<00:03:36.340> save<00:03:37.340> as<00:03:37.550> image<00:03:37.880> I'm

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
just created so image save as image I'm

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.230 
just created so image save as image I'm
gonna<00:03:38.960> put<00:03:39.170> onto<00:03:39.290> my<00:03:39.470> desktop<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.370> just<00:03:41.060> call

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
gonna put onto my desktop and just call

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.050 
gonna put onto my desktop and just call
it<00:03:41.680> final

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
it final

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.290 
it final
texture

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
texture

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.190 
texture
and<00:03:46.810> save<00:03:47.260> it

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.570 

now<00:03:54.830> if<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:55.040> go<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.190> my<00:03:55.340> desktop

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
now if I go to my desktop

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.910 
now if I go to my desktop
I'll<00:03:58.120> see<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.960> image<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.320> just<00:03:59.350> saved<00:03:59.770> us

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
I'll see that the image I just saved us

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.410 
I'll see that the image I just saved us
here<00:04:00.190> I'm<00:04:00.370> gonna<00:04:00.550> put<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:00.850> next<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.270> other

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
here I'm gonna put it next to the other

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.670 
here I'm gonna put it next to the other
image<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:04.480> now<00:04:04.600> what<00:04:04.780> we<00:04:04.900> want<00:04:05.050> to<00:04:05.200> do<00:04:05.380> is<00:04:05.530> we

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
image so now what we want to do is we

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.280 
image so now what we want to do is we
want<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:05.920> physically<00:04:06.520> bake<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.750> texture<00:04:08.140> is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
want to physically bake the texture is

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.760 
want to physically bake the texture is
at<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.500> moment<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:10.060> know<00:04:10.240> it's<00:04:10.990> one<00:04:11.260> flat

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
at the moment you know it's one flat

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.290 
at the moment you know it's one flat
color<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.850> doesn't<00:04:13.150> look<00:04:13.270> very

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
color it doesn't look very

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.820 
color it doesn't look very
three-dimensional<00:04:13.660> so<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.320> want<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.620> bake

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
three-dimensional so you want to bake

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.860 
three-dimensional so you want to bake
shadows<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.760> lights<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.360> take<00:04:16.510> them<00:04:16.720> into

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
shadows and lights and take them into

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.190 
shadows and lights and take them into
consideration<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.940> what<00:04:19.570> I'm<00:04:19.660> gonna<00:04:19.810> do<00:04:20.020> now

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
consideration so what I'm gonna do now

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.100 
consideration so what I'm gonna do now
is<00:04:20.380> go<00:04:20.560> back<00:04:20.590> into<00:04:20.920> edit<00:04:21.070> mode

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
is go back into edit mode

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.040 
is go back into edit mode
go<00:04:24.099> to<00:04:24.159> image<00:04:24.990> new<00:04:26.370> okay<00:04:27.569> so<00:04:28.569> now<00:04:28.720> we<00:04:28.810> got<00:04:28.960> this

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
go to image new okay so now we got this

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.129 
go to image new okay so now we got this
black<00:04:29.349> background<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.919> game<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.780> now<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:31.960> want

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
black background the game and now I want

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.249 
black background the game and now I want
to<00:04:32.199> go<00:04:32.379> to<00:04:32.439> textures<00:04:33.039> here<00:04:33.990> remove<00:04:34.990> this

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
to go to textures here remove this

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.159 
to go to textures here remove this
original<00:04:35.800> texture<00:04:36.159> that<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:36.400> uploaded<00:04:37.169> by

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
original texture that we uploaded by

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.719 
original texture that we uploaded by
pressing<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.680> X<00:04:38.830> button<00:04:39.509> go<00:04:40.509> back<00:04:40.689> to<00:04:40.840> open

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.280 
desktop
final<00:04:45.060> texture<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.780> one<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:46.050> we<00:04:46.140> just

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
final texture the one that we just

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.020 
final texture the one that we just
created<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.940> put<00:04:47.940> onto<00:04:48.090> our<00:04:48.210> desktop

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.630 

now<00:04:51.600> it's<00:04:52.350> very<00:04:52.440> important<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.100> take<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.370> step

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
now it's very important to take the step

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.210 
now it's very important to take the step
go<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.180> coordinates<00:04:55.670> UV

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
go to coordinates UV

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.840 
go to coordinates UV
and<00:04:58.400> now

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
and now

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.450 
and now
I'm<00:05:01.720> just<00:05:02.050> gonna<00:05:02.200> go<00:05:02.440> into<00:05:02.710> edit<00:05:02.950> mode<00:05:02.980> for<00:05:03.310> one

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
I'm just gonna go into edit mode for one

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.310 
I'm just gonna go into edit mode for one
second<00:05:03.850> because<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:04.120> want<00:05:04.150> si<00:05:04.780> I'm<00:05:04.930> gonna<00:05:05.110> go<00:05:05.260> to

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
second because I want si I'm gonna go to

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.500 
second because I want si I'm gonna go to
object<00:05:05.530> mode<00:05:05.770> because<00:05:06.670> I<00:05:06.760> want<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.030> move<00:05:07.300> this

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
object mode because I want to move this

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.560 
object mode because I want to move this
light<00:05:07.810> put<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.650> bit<00:05:08.860> closer

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.659 

now<00:05:13.350> if<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.650> go<00:05:13.860> here<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:15.530> object<00:05:16.530> data<00:05:16.740> I<00:05:17.100> can

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
now if I go here to object data I can

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.280 
now if I go here to object data I can
actually<00:05:17.850> increase<00:05:18.389> the<00:05:18.540> intensity<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.199> the

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
actually increase the intensity of the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.840 
actually increase the intensity of the
light<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.470> little<00:05:19.650> bit<00:05:20.630> make<00:05:21.630> sure<00:05:21.870> that<00:05:22.850> ray

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
light a little bit make sure that ray

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.020 
light a little bit make sure that ray
shadows<00:05:24.270> selected<00:05:24.780> so<00:05:24.990> we'll<00:05:25.139> bake<00:05:25.740> on

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
shadows selected so we'll bake on

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.409 
shadows selected so we'll bake on
shadows<00:05:27.979> now<00:05:28.979> I'm<00:05:29.160> right<00:05:29.639> hand<00:05:29.850> click<00:05:30.060> on<00:05:30.270> the

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
shadows now I'm right hand click on the

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.390 
shadows now I'm right hand click on the
object<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.870> make<00:05:31.050> sure<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.260> selected

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
object to make sure I selected

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.920 
object to make sure I selected
go<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.720> render<00:05:34.900> type<00:05:35.230> here<00:05:36.210> down<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.240> bake

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
go to the render type here down to bake

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.999 
go to the render type here down to bake
open<00:05:38.440> up<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.680> tab<00:05:38.919> and

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
open up the tab and

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.290 
open up the tab and
first<00:05:41.669> of<00:05:41.849> all<00:05:41.939> go<00:05:42.300> just<00:05:43.289> to<00:05:43.409> check<00:05:43.619> it<00:05:43.770> out

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
first of all go just to check it out

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.429 
first of all go just to check it out
actually<00:05:45.300> doesn't<00:05:45.749> matter<00:05:45.869> just<00:05:45.960> just<00:05:46.319> hit

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:46.439 
actually doesn't matter just just hit

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.480 
actually doesn't matter just just hit
bait

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.620 

just<00:05:50.360> give<00:05:50.479> it<00:05:50.599> a<00:05:50.660> bit<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:50.840> time<00:05:51.139> to<00:05:51.440> render

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
just give it a bit of time to render

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:08.050 
just give it a bit of time to render
hopefully<00:05:53.630> it'll<00:05:54.050> be<00:05:54.289> a<00:05:54.319> bit<00:05:54.470> faster

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.670 

now<00:06:08.600> this<00:06:08.810> is<00:06:08.930> not<00:06:09.080> gonna<00:06:09.200> be<00:06:09.380> the<00:06:09.470> best

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
now this is not gonna be the best

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.380 
now this is not gonna be the best
texture<00:06:10.190> baked<00:06:10.460> but<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.880> gives<00:06:11.030> you<00:06:11.180> an<00:06:11.270> idea

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
texture baked but it gives you an idea

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.710 
texture baked but it gives you an idea
of<00:06:11.660> how<00:06:11.870> it<00:06:11.990> works<00:06:12.230> so<00:06:13.190> if<00:06:13.760> I<00:06:13.880> go<00:06:14.030> back<00:06:14.270> into<00:06:14.540> the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
of how it works so if I go back into the

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.000 
of how it works so if I go back into the
texture<00:06:15.050> paint<00:06:15.320> you<00:06:16.220> will<00:06:16.340> see<00:06:16.580> that<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:18.650> area

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
texture paint you will see that the area

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.670 
texture paint you will see that the area
that<00:06:19.130> the<00:06:19.190> light<00:06:19.370> is<00:06:19.520> shining<00:06:19.550> on<00:06:20.060> is<00:06:20.300> actually

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
that the light is shining on is actually

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.990 
that the light is shining on is actually
illuminated<00:06:21.680> and<00:06:21.920> you<00:06:22.280> can<00:06:22.430> see<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.730> sides

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
illuminated and you can see the sides

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.560 
illuminated and you can see the sides
here

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
here

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.870 
here
they're<00:06:24.230> dark<00:06:24.590> because<00:06:25.040> the<00:06:25.280> light<00:06:25.430> can't<00:06:25.730> get

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
they're dark because the light can't get

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.180 
they're dark because the light can't get
to<00:06:26.090> it<00:06:26.150> in<00:06:26.420> reality<00:06:26.990> some<00:06:27.470> light<00:06:27.650> will<00:06:27.830> get<00:06:28.010> to

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
to it in reality some light will get to

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.010 
to it in reality some light will get to
those<00:06:28.340> sides<00:06:28.640> because<00:06:29.240> you<00:06:29.390> need<00:06:29.690> to<00:06:29.840> fiddle

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
those sides because you need to fiddle

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.010 
those sides because you need to fiddle
with<00:06:30.170> some<00:06:30.500> more<00:06:30.650> settings<00:06:31.040> but<00:06:31.880> that<00:06:32.750> is<00:06:32.900> for

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
with some more settings but that is for

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.140 
with some more settings but that is for
another<00:06:33.110> day<00:06:33.470> so<00:06:34.160> once<00:06:34.370> you've<00:06:34.520> done<00:06:34.670> that<00:06:34.730> you

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
another day so once you've done that you

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.730 
another day so once you've done that you
can<00:06:35.300> go<00:06:35.450> to<00:06:35.510> image<00:06:36.730> save<00:06:37.730> as<00:06:37.880> image<00:06:38.030> and<00:06:38.740> save

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
can go to image save as image and save

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.230 
can go to image save as image and save
that<00:06:40.010> texture<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.640> you've<00:06:40.790> just<00:06:40.970> created

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
that texture that you've just created

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.560 
that texture that you've just created
the<00:06:41.540> baked<00:06:41.750> texture<00:06:42.230> and<00:06:43.240> save<00:06:44.240> it<00:06:44.390> somewhere

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
the baked texture and save it somewhere

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.410 
the baked texture and save it somewhere
on<00:06:44.990> your<00:06:45.560> computer<00:06:46.340> and<00:06:46.520> then<00:06:47.060> you<00:06:47.090> use<00:06:47.390> that

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
on your computer and then you use that

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.260 
on your computer and then you use that
baked<00:06:47.750> texture<00:06:48.260> with<00:06:48.830> the<00:06:48.860> obaid<00:06:49.370> obj<00:06:50.240> model

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
baked texture with the obaid obj model

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.760 
baked texture with the obaid obj model
or<00:06:51.050> the

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.219 

fbx<00:06:55.699> model<00:06:56.030> and<00:06:56.240> you<00:06:56.569> can<00:06:56.599> import<00:06:56.990> that<00:06:57.080> into

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 
fbx model and you can import that into

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.849 
fbx model and you can import that into
your<00:06:57.590> player<00:06:57.889> keep
