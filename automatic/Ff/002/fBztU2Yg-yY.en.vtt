00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.720
 and today I want to show you in this and that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.240
 it's an inside see here we have a cake 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.220
 that here means baby in Hawaiian is 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.320
 a word that is given to you for these 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.270
 little children who grow up to 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.150
 that grow orchids in 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.450
 Sometimes they can be like orchids 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.450
 dendrobium or fanello csis here we have 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.020
 two cake and I know what we're going to do is 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.970
 transplant them to another in a pot 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.970
 because they already have enough roots 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.370
 I want although they start to develop 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.440
 well in a pot the only thing that there is 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.710
 do many people what they do is 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.589
 cut him with a whole step of the cane and 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.860
 other people the only thing they do is 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.980
 grab it 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.510
 and they simply turn it around 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.940
 until it only comes out completely is 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.180
 as you can see here it's already out 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.180
 completely 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.420
 we are going to transplant it in a pot 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:24.350
 small we have the other 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.770
 let's grab and let's turn 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.180
 carefully until it comes out alone 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.310
 we're going to completely put it in this 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.100
 flowerpot is a our little color 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.720
 black and here on the sides he did 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.899
 some sound so there is more 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.590
 aggregation of the roots and a greater 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.539
 drainage and I mix it that we are going to use is 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.360
 small pine bark and a little 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.360
 unicel or dry ice poliexpÃ¡n de c's 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.910
 the background has not filled up a bit 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 what we are going to do with what x is 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.679
 put them in a little while in water this for 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.140
 make the times a little more flexible and 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.360
 that they will not break us when the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.810
 we put in our pot the go 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.960
 left and 15 minutes and we will proceed to the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.060
 transplant 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.010
 Well, now we are going to change it 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.620
 our planter what we are going to do is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.460
 nothing else 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.270
 Well, you know like any other plant 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.050
 let's click on the flowerpot and let's 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.250
 fill in 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.250
 with the substrate 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.890
 but I do not 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.340
 and how can this result? 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.530
 final here we already have it in our most 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.200
 little pot, what I did here was 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.560
 put a wire so that both 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.549
 they were completely straight and 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.610
 both grew at the same time and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.860
 the same space 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.960
 and that is a very small goal let's hope 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.750
 that soon fall fast and the 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.220
 we can after passing to another a little more 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.380
 big 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.030
 and this has been the video today I hope 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.540
 that you liked and others but in the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.540
 next
