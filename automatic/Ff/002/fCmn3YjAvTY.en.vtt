basically<00:03:06.670> becomes<00:03:07.150> this<00:03:07.330> system<00:03:07.750> so

basically becomes this system so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.420 
basically becomes this system so

have to make sure I have to plan up a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.119 
have to make sure I have to plan up a
hairline<00:03:46.819> right<00:03:47.109> just<00:03:48.109> remember<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.769> during

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
hairline right just remember like during

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.890 
hairline right just remember like during
fights<00:03:49.370> which<00:03:49.730> buttons<00:03:50.120> recombination<00:03:50.840> you

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
fights which buttons recombination you

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.780 
fights which buttons recombination you
be<00:03:51.079> using<00:03:51.260> water<00:03:51.560> which<00:03:52.069> will<00:03:52.220> be<00:03:52.310> easier<00:03:52.579> for

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
be using water which will be easier for

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.909 
be using water which will be easier for
the<00:03:53.000> top<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.989> of<00:03:54.109> course<00:03:54.319> you<00:03:54.469> can<00:03:54.590> alternate

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
the top and of course you can alternate

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.390 
the top and of course you can alternate
between<00:03:54.980> iPad<00:03:55.629> or<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:57.200> analog<00:03:57.950> part<00:03:58.159> which

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
between iPad or the analog part which

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.699 
between iPad or the analog part which
acts<00:03:58.669> like<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.879> joystick<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.750> sorts<00:04:00.079> but<00:04:00.319> not<00:04:00.530> as

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
acts like a joystick of sorts but not as

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.830 
acts like a joystick of sorts but not as
much<00:04:01.930> what<00:04:02.959> really<00:04:03.579> no<00:04:04.579> way<00:04:04.819> hey<00:04:05.299> don't<00:04:05.659> knock

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
much what really no way hey don't knock

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.440 
much what really no way hey don't knock
it<00:04:05.900> yet<00:04:06.260> sure<00:04:07.069> it's<00:04:07.730> not<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:07.969> ideal<00:04:08.239> choice

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
it yet sure it's not the ideal choice

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.690 
it yet sure it's not the ideal choice
for<00:04:08.510> arcade<00:04:09.079> goes<00:04:09.260> everywhere<00:04:09.829> but<00:04:10.159> this

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
for arcade goes everywhere but this

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.430 
for arcade goes everywhere but this
remember<00:04:11.120> like<00:04:11.329> pink<00:04:11.750> when<00:04:11.900> our<00:04:12.019> case<00:04:12.229> is

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
remember like pink when our case is

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.559 
remember like pink when our case is
pretty<00:04:12.709> high<00:04:12.919> so<00:04:12.949> so<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.060> buy<00:04:14.329> supposed

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
pretty high so so you can buy supposed

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.479 
pretty high so so you can buy supposed

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
arcade cabinet uses a joystick so I can

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
over to my place to place or pelvic fall

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.029 
over to my place to place or pelvic fall
and<00:05:20.180> they<00:05:20.599> tell<00:05:20.840> me<00:05:20.870> they<00:05:21.110> can<00:05:21.259> use<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.590> 360

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
and they tell me they can use the 360

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.089

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
choice back there to use the ps3 one so

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.740 
choice back there to use the ps3 one so
a<00:05:25.130> joystick<00:05:25.610> is<00:05:25.759> also<00:05:25.970> good<00:05:26.150> because<00:05:26.300> it's

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
a joystick is also good because it's

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.080 
a joystick is also good because it's
non-universal<00:05:27.470> in<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.710> arcades<00:05:28.099> but<00:05:28.789> one
