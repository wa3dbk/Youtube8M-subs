00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.520 
some way back here so all right i'll go
ahead<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.030> finish<00:03:23.240> winching<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.170> one<00:03:24.320> up<00:03:24.410> in

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
ahead and finish winching this one up in

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:53.660 
ahead and finish winching this one up in
the<00:03:24.620> truck

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.000 

it's<00:03:54.670> time<00:03:54.820> for<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:55.030> second<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.620> notice<00:03:56.890> what

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
it's time for a second you notice what

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.990 
it's time for a second you notice what
the<00:03:57.070> difference<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:59.850> truck's<00:04:00.850> not

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
the difference is the truck's not

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.980 
the difference is the truck's not
running<00:04:01.300> let<00:04:01.420> me<00:04:01.480> see<00:04:01.630> if<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.780> makes<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
running let me see if it makes the

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
running let me see if it makes the
difference<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.320> have<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.500> truck<00:04:02.680> running

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:17.860 

it's<00:04:06.010> kind<00:04:06.130> of<00:04:06.280> run<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.460> little<00:04:06.700> sluggish<00:04:06.910> there

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.009 

I'm<00:04:18.410> going<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.620> back<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.919> down<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.100> little<00:04:19.280> bit

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
I'm going to back it down a little bit

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:29.700 
I'm going to back it down a little bit
it's<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.169> B<00:04:21.290> button<00:04:21.440> on<00:04:21.650> here<00:04:21.769> back<00:04:21.979> sit<00:04:22.160> down

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.780 

all<00:04:30.710> right

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.120 

saw<00:04:38.420> something<00:04:38.630> was<00:04:39.050> just<00:04:39.170> some<00:04:39.290> dust<00:04:39.530> go

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
saw something was just some dust go

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:56.740 
saw something was just some dust go
ahead<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.460> try<00:04:40.670> it<00:04:40.760> now

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.420 

the<00:04:57.290> actually<00:04:57.590> seem<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.860> do<00:04:57.980> better<00:04:58.010> with<00:04:58.340> the

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
the actually seem to do better with the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.180 
the actually seem to do better with the
truck<00:04:58.640> running

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.300 

it<00:05:01.700> was<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:02.200> little<00:05:03.200> sluggish

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
it was a little sluggish

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.360 
it was a little sluggish
when<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:05.970> truck<00:05:06.210> wasn't<00:05:06.450> running<00:05:07.370> much

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
when the truck wasn't running much

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:27.439 
when the truck wasn't running much
better<00:05:08.670> when<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.940> truck<00:05:09.180> is<00:05:09.210> running

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.939 

all<00:05:28.449> right<00:05:28.570> as<00:05:28.690> far<00:05:28.840> as<00:05:29.080> I'll<00:05:29.229> go<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:29.680> got<00:05:29.830> the

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
all right as far as I'll go you got the

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.250 
all right as far as I'll go you got the
idea<00:05:30.280> all<00:05:31.210> right<00:05:31.419> so<00:05:31.570> that's<00:05:31.630> good<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:31.930> know<00:05:32.050> I

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
idea all right so that's good to know I

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.180 
idea all right so that's good to know I
guess<00:05:32.440> this<00:05:32.590> is<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.680> first<00:05:32.889> time<00:05:33.010> I've

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
guess this is the first time I've

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.439 
guess this is the first time I've
actually<00:05:33.280> used<00:05:33.550> it<00:05:33.790> to<00:05:33.880> win<00:05:34.000> something<00:05:34.180> up<00:05:34.330> in

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
actually used it to win something up in

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.570 
actually used it to win something up in
the<00:05:34.510> truck<00:05:34.750> since<00:05:35.169> I've<00:05:35.320> had<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.560> I<00:05:35.740> do<00:05:36.340> have<00:05:36.550> a

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
the truck since I've had it I do have a

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.700 
the truck since I've had it I do have a
battery<00:05:36.760> in<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.000> box<00:05:37.180> so<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.080> will<00:05:38.440> run

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
battery in the box so it will run

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.550 
battery in the box so it will run
without<00:05:39.660> being<00:05:40.660> plugged<00:05:40.780> into<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.110> truck<00:05:41.410> but

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560
