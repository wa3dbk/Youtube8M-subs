normally solitary except during the
mating<00:00:30.929> season<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.290> strong

mating season but because of the strong

mating season but because of the strong
sense<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.739> smell

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
sense of smell

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.639 
sense of smell
males<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:36.030> attracted<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> females

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.560

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.180 
during the mating season both the males
and<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> females<00:00:42.960> tend<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.710> lose<00:00:43.920> weight

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and the females tend to lose weight

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.209 
and the females tend to lose weight
because<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.960> females<00:00:46.410> are<00:00:46.559> constantly<00:00:46.980> being

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
because the females are constantly being

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.970 
because the females are constantly being
harassed<00:00:47.399> by<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> males<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.500> males<00:00:49.739> are

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
harassed by the males and the males are

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.319 
harassed by the males and the males are
too<00:00:50.160> busy<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.640> eat<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.610> she<00:00:53.789> comes<00:00:54.059> out

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
too busy to eat and as she comes out

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.260 
too busy to eat and as she comes out
there<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.559> two<00:00:55.969> males<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
there we can see one then two males that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.810 
there we can see one then two males that
have<00:00:57.390> been<00:00:57.539> attracted<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.820> here's<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> third

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
have been attracted and here's a third

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.870 
have been attracted and here's a third
and<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.739> male<00:01:04.979> using<00:01:05.489> his<00:01:05.610> beak

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and you can see the male using his beak

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
and you can see the male using his beak
waving<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> round<00:01:06.840> putting<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.470> putting<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
waving it round putting it putting it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.480 
waving it round putting it putting it
close<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> female<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.510> there's<00:01:09.780> probably

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
close to the female now there's probably

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.130 
close to the female now there's probably
smelling<00:01:11.490> inspecting<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.450> checking<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
smelling inspecting and checking but I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
smelling inspecting and checking but I
think<00:01:13.439> also<00:01:13.650> there's<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.340> sort<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> tactile

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
think also there's so sort of tactile

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
think also there's so sort of tactile
stimulation<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.200> he<00:01:16.650> hopes<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
stimulation that he hopes to get the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.830 
stimulation that he hopes to get the
female<00:01:18.360> ready<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.960> mate<00:01:20.150> they're<00:01:21.150> promiscuous

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
female ready to mate they're promiscuous

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.590 
female ready to mate they're promiscuous
because<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.409> females<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.610> certainly<00:01:24.210> mating

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
because the females are certainly mating

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.210 
because the females are certainly mating
with<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> large<00:01:25.020> number<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.470> different<00:01:26.009> males

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
with a large number of different males

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
with a large number of different males
and<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.790> males<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.420> mating<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.080> many

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and the males are mating with as many

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.399 
and the males are mating with as many
females<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.250> possibly<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:31.110> all

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
females as they possibly can this all

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
females as they possibly can this all
looks<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.950> cute<00:01:32.340> cuddly<00:01:32.670> fun<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.600> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
looks like cute cuddly fun but it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.280 
looks like cute cuddly fun but it's
pretty<00:01:34.790> deadly<00:01:35.790> important<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> echidnas

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
pretty deadly important for the echidnas

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
pretty deadly important for the echidnas
because<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.829> they<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.700> mating

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
because if they don't get the mating

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.649 
because if they don't get the mating
then<00:01:39.689> they're<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.049> passing<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.560> their<00:01:40.740> genes

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
then they're not passing on their genes

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.450 
then they're not passing on their genes
as<00:01:42.659> soon<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.020> she<00:01:43.170> stops<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.890> males<00:01:44.130> try<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
as soon as she stops the males try to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.660 
as soon as she stops the males try to
lift<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.640> her<00:01:47.820> rear<00:01:48.509> end<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.369> within<00:01:50.369> weeks

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
lift up her rear end and within weeks

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.880 
lift up her rear end and within weeks
and<00:01:50.970> mate<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> okay<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.470> three<00:01:52.619> males

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and mate with it okay the three males

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
and mate with it okay the three males
have<00:01:53.100> walked<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.790> now<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.329> them

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
have walked on but now one of them

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.480 
have walked on but now one of them
realizes<00:01:55.020> what's<00:01:55.229> happened<00:01:55.560> -<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.009> back<00:01:56.250> he's

chaperoned

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.969 
chaperoned
and<00:02:02.329> he's<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.540> starts<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> mate<00:02:04.530> he's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.199 

and<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.770> Second<00:02:12.160> Mile<00:02:12.310> realizes<00:02:13.030> what's

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
and the Second Mile realizes what's

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.210 
and the Second Mile realizes what's
going<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:13.870> he<00:02:14.020> desperately<00:02:14.380> tries<00:02:15.010> to
