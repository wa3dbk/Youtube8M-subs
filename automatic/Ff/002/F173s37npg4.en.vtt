Apple I tablet before Apple did so we
wanted<00:00:25.089> to<00:00:25.150> see<00:00:25.329> exactly<00:00:25.599> what<00:00:25.869> this<00:00:25.960> thing

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
wanted to see exactly what this thing

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.130 
wanted to see exactly what this thing
was<00:00:26.259> all<00:00:26.409> about<00:00:26.650> so<00:00:26.859> we<00:00:26.949> bought<00:00:27.189> one<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:29.019> the

was all about so we bought one it's the
first<00:00:29.320> test<00:00:29.650> is<00:00:29.859> booting<00:00:30.669> something<00:00:30.999> up<00:00:31.119> so<00:00:31.359> i

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
first test is booting something up so i

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.450 
first test is booting something up so i
just<00:00:31.509> plugged<00:00:31.689> it<00:00:31.839> in<00:00:32.040> check<00:00:33.040> out<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.280> boot

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
just plugged it in check out the boot

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.479 
just plugged it in check out the boot
time<00:00:33.700> on<00:00:33.880> this<00:00:34.060> i<00:00:34.390> believe<00:00:35.200> and<00:00:35.890> i'll<00:00:36.220> double

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
time on this i believe and i'll double

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.270 
time on this i believe and i'll double
check<00:00:36.520> this<00:00:36.850> this<00:00:37.090> is<00:00:37.239> an<00:00:37.360> ARM<00:00:37.830> chip<00:00:38.830> same

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
check this this is an ARM chip same

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.890 
check this this is an ARM chip same
thing<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:39.520> powers<00:00:39.910> a<00:00:40.240> lot<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.780> new

android phones it is a tenant screen and
there<00:00:49.240> are<00:00:49.300> a<00:00:49.360> lot<00:00:49.540> of<00:00:49.570> things<00:00:49.750> it<00:00:49.960> doesn't<00:00:50.140> do

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
there are a lot of things it doesn't do

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.720 
there are a lot of things it doesn't do
first<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:51.040> all<00:00:51.100> it's<00:00:51.220> not<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.370> touchscreen

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
first of all it's not a touchscreen

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.790 
first of all it's not a touchscreen
there<00:00:52.180> are<00:00:52.270> some<00:00:52.420> touch<00:00:52.600> controls<00:00:53.140> around<00:00:53.530> the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
there are some touch controls around the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.610 
there are some touch controls around the
edge<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.660> main<00:00:55.870> thing<00:00:55.900> you<00:00:56.110> want<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.350> do<00:00:56.500> with

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
edge the main thing you want to do with

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.490 
edge the main thing you want to do with
this<00:00:56.770> thing<00:00:57.040> since<00:00:57.400> it's<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:59.140> call<00:00:59.380> the

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
this thing since it's and call the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.340 
this thing since it's and call the
tablet<00:00:59.860> computers<00:01:00.340> touch<00:01:01.000> it<00:01:01.210> so<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.230> boot

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
tablet computers touch it so the boot

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.600 
tablet computers touch it so the boot
time<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.650> pretty<00:01:02.860> quick<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:05.490> activate<00:01:06.490> the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
time is pretty quick you activate the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.700 
time is pretty quick you activate the
controls<00:01:07.000> around<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.420> edge<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:07.900> you<00:01:08.320> can<00:01:08.530> do

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
controls around the edge and you can do

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.340 
controls around the edge and you can do
things<00:01:09.009> like<00:01:09.480> scroll<00:01:10.480> through<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.780> menu<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
things like scroll through the menu you

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.840 
things like scroll through the menu you
can<00:01:14.409> also<00:01:14.590> scroll<00:01:14.920> down<00:01:15.130> with<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.430> virtual

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
can also scroll down with a virtual

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.050 
can also scroll down with a virtual
keyboard<00:01:16.240> pops<00:01:16.450> up<00:01:17.130> control<00:01:18.130> volume<00:01:18.550> things

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
keyboard pops up control volume things

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.840 
keyboard pops up control volume things
like<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.710> device<00:01:20.979> itself<00:01:21.159> physically

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
like that the device itself physically

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.290 
like that the device itself physically
is<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:23.890> thin<00:01:24.220> except<00:01:24.610> for<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.820> back<00:01:24.970> part

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
is very thin except for the back part

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.390 
is very thin except for the back part
which<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.020> an<00:01:26.350> extra<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:27.150> little<00:01:28.150> about<00:01:28.270> an<00:01:28.420> inch

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
which is an extra a little about an inch

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.130 
which is an extra a little about an inch
it's<00:01:30.400> not<00:01:30.460> very<00:01:30.520> heavy<00:01:30.850> but<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.870> certainly

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
it's not very heavy but it certainly

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.960 
it's not very heavy but it certainly
isn't<00:01:32.409> portable<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:34.500> lack<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.770> touch<00:01:36.729> screen

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
isn't portable a lack of a touch screen

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.149 
isn't portable a lack of a touch screen
it<00:01:37.360> seems<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.870> bit<00:01:37.990> odd<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.409> me<00:01:38.500> given<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:38.920> how

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
it seems a bit odd to me given that how

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.740 
it seems a bit odd to me given that how
much<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.610> cost<00:01:39.760> has<00:01:40.000> come<00:01:40.210> down<00:01:40.390> for

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
much the cost has come down for

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.840 
much the cost has come down for
resistive<00:01:41.350> touchscreens<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.580> seems<00:01:42.760> like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
resistive touchscreens it seems like

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.980 
resistive touchscreens it seems like
they<00:01:42.940> could<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.180> put<00:01:43.330> one<00:01:43.450> end<00:01:43.630> pretty

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
they could have put one end pretty

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.530 
they could have put one end pretty
easily<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:45.670> well<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:45.880> has<00:01:45.970> some<00:01:46.180> pre<00:01:46.360> built

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
easily also well it has some pre built

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.719 
easily also well it has some pre built
in<00:01:46.690> services<00:01:47.260> like<00:01:47.440> Pandora<00:01:47.620> I<00:01:48.190> tried

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
in services like Pandora I tried

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.090 
in services like Pandora I tried
yesterday<00:01:49.200> after<00:01:50.200> took<00:01:50.440> me<00:01:50.619> about<00:01:50.830> five

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
yesterday after took me about five

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.030 
yesterday after took me about five
minutes<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.460> get<00:01:51.580> Wi-Fi<00:01:51.970> enabled<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:53.010> try<00:01:54.010> to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
username password and it just wouldn't

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.000 
username password and it just wouldn't
work<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.549> don't<00:01:57.790> that's<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.030> Pandora<00:01:58.420> problem<00:01:58.810> or

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
work I don't that's a Pandora problem or

work I don't that's a Pandora problem or
something<00:02:00.010> with<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.340> device<00:02:00.670> couldn't<00:02:01.299> get

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
something with the device couldn't get

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.359 
something with the device couldn't get
there<00:02:01.510> smart<00:02:02.229> radio<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.560> work<00:02:02.619> either<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.220> I

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
there smart radio to work either and I

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.160 
there smart radio to work either and I
tried<00:02:03.610> for<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:03.820> couple<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.119> minutes<00:02:04.180> so

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
tried for a couple of minutes so

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.170 
tried for a couple of minutes so
basically<00:02:05.799> you<00:02:06.280> know<00:02:06.400> this<00:02:06.549> thing's<00:02:06.760> pretty

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
basically you know this thing's pretty

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.550 
basically you know this thing's pretty
useless<00:02:07.510> as<00:02:07.750> far<00:02:07.930> as<00:02:08.019> I'm<00:02:08.080> concerned<00:02:08.110> unless

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
useless as far as I'm concerned unless

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.859 
useless as far as I'm concerned unless
you're<00:02:08.769> comparing<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.189> to<00:02:09.220> clock<00:02:09.429> radios

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you're comparing it to clock radios

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.030 
you're comparing it to clock radios
which<00:02:10.869> case<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.290> think<00:02:11.319> I'd<00:02:11.590> take<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.769> clock

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
which case I think I'd take a clock

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.589 
which case I think I'd take a clock
radio<00:02:12.069> because<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.970> heck<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.540> lot

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
radio because it's a heck of a lot

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.550 
radio because it's a heck of a lot
easier<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.190> setup<00:02:15.190> than<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.580> thing<00:02:15.819> was

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
easier to setup than this thing was

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.130 
easier to setup than this thing was
there's<00:02:17.560> no<00:02:17.650> browser<00:02:17.860> at<00:02:18.220> all

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
there's no browser at all

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.350 
there's no browser at all
seems<00:02:20.140> like<00:02:20.640> these<00:02:21.640> sort<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.880> obvious<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.270> have

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
seems like these sort of obvious to have

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.790 
seems like these sort of obvious to have
a<00:02:22.390> browser<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.900> device<00:02:23.110> like<00:02:23.349> this<00:02:23.530> and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
a browser and device like this and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.580 
a browser and device like this and
probably<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.970> worst<00:02:25.150> part<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.690> my<00:02:26.349> opinion

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
probably the worst part of it my opinion

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.640 
probably the worst part of it my opinion
is<00:02:27.780> there's<00:02:28.780> no<00:02:28.900> battery<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.680> if<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.610> want<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
is there's no battery so if you want to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.850 
is there's no battery so if you want to
take<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.800> thing<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.190> go<00:02:34.680> unscrew<00:02:35.680> this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
take this thing on the go unscrew this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.910 
take this thing on the go unscrew this
handy<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:39.819> plug<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.620> well<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> device

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
handy and then plug it well the device
