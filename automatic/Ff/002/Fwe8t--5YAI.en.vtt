00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.700
 For a given reason I want one 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.440
 Show you here how to get one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.000
 Song could play something like that 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
 sounds like lena satellite 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 it is not lenas satellite but it 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:22.140
 sounds ok summarizes the first court is in 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.449
 b-minor normal h minor in the sepen 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.349
 bunch now continue kurth is something like that 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.590
 except that the note on the b-side is the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:38.579
 the hair is reduced by a high 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.969
 note on bgh new major 7 could you do that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.210
 call 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.730
 it sounds the same as it's called 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.739
 something weird could be in one 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.200
 james-bond-film hereunder completely 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.920
 okay the third chord is an alu 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.220
 and then it goes back to the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.700
 hamburg stanza could be so so 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.700
 play 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.670
 that was the punishment so now to the refrain 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.450
 the preorder from three chords god 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.260
 Thank you 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.330
 the first is h minor we just had 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.110
 already the 27th 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.030
 that too in the seventh bund and the third 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.210
 is at 5 and who 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.659
 and back to the poor and you could do it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.659
 play like this 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.710
 okay that was the refrain so missing now 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.330
 still a part about a song 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.400
 to be able to play that sounds like 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.810
 lenas satellite namely the so-called 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.530
 quote and for this case we need 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.770
 once this is only possible in the third bunch then 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.090
 you need 47 in the second bund then 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.110
 we need a b minor 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.580
 afterwards there was another a major in the 50th 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.580
 and then it sounds like that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:06.700
 So hop the last chords against 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.140
 fischer be twice as long plays 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.760
 and you add these parts together there 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.620
 you can move in about the same way 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.010
 sounds like lena satellite is not 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.230
 is so and in front of all still no one 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.090
 I also have barea court 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.530
 another version that was without rule 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.000
 god is at the ready and ahead of us 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.900
 Although we do not start with hamborn 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.120
 but with him we change all that now 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.100
 also to a major 7 from because the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.000
 note on the b side again half 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.269
 set note down 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.170
 that 's record and then it comes 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.330
 standard d major we all know 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.319
 and then he goes back to heaven and 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.319
 that could sound like that 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:18.340
 what I'm going to do for the wife 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:23.180
 in the open version finds such a time 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:28.630
 then we have on 7 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.630
 the tour and together it went like this 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.390
 that would be before we continue with the goal 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.090
 so many gamers now the days of 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.570
 open version of the ten part begins 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.570
 with 10 o'clock 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.240
 standard figure then noticeable 7 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.420
 as follows and as simple as possible 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.400
 to make forefinger second colorful 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:19.680
 page 2 and g string middle finger and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:23.190
 second collar high side ring finger then 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.100
 follows a standard e minor and the 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.420
 normal d major 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.420
 and together child is like that 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.939
 twice as long 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.940
 and that would have been the case with it 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:59.720
 the song completely in the open version 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.580
 played and enjoy playing 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.680
 learns nevertheless take rule just like that 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.849
 a song is an example of where you are 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.440
 the actually not in rule the 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.889
 can spare and it is worth it 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.710
 searched 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.039
 ok so see you later to 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.039
 grammy awards ceremony
