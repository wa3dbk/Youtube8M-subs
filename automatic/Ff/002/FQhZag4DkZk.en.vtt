this is the remote desktop capability so

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.559 
this is the remote desktop capability so

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
if you need to access a system that is

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.210 
if you need to access a system that is
somewhere<00:04:10.900> else<00:04:11.019> on<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.259> network<00:04:11.650> or<00:04:12.069> you

somewhere else on the network or you

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.399 
somewhere else on the network or you
need<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.430> connect<00:04:12.849> to<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.269> terminal<00:04:13.810> server<00:04:14.139> and

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
need to connect to a terminal server and

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
be able to use those capabilities this

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.300 
be able to use those capabilities this
is<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.930> utility<00:04:17.199> that<00:04:17.620> would<00:04:17.739> allow<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.039> to

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
is the utility that would allow you to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.520 
is the utility that would allow you to
do<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.639> this<00:04:19.150> is<00:04:19.329> also<00:04:19.479> useful<00:04:19.870> if<00:04:20.349> you're

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
do that this is also useful if you're

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.980 
do that this is also useful if you're
managing<00:04:20.949> a<00:04:21.340> series<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:21.849> servers<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.599> may

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
managing a series of servers that may

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.379 
managing a series of servers that may
not<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.469> keyboards<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.520> mice<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.729> monitors

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
not have keyboards and mice and monitors

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.480 
not have keyboards and mice and monitors
connected<00:04:25.599> to<00:04:25.990> them<00:04:26.229> we<00:04:26.590> call<00:04:26.800> those<00:04:26.979> headless

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
connected to them we call those headless

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.440 
connected to them we call those headless
connections

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
connections

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.010 
connections
so<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:28.660> would<00:04:28.870> use<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:30.150> stsc<00:04:31.150> at<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.690> command

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
so you would use the stsc at the command

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.170 
so you would use the stsc at the command
line<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.770> launch<00:04:32.980> this<00:04:33.340> utility<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.090> will

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
line to launch this utility that will

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.090 
line to launch this utility that will
allow<00:04:34.420> you<00:04:34.480> then<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.870> connect<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.890> those

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
allow you then to connect to those

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.910 
allow you then to connect to those
servers<00:04:36.400> if<00:04:36.990> you're<00:04:37.990> managing<00:04:38.350> Windows

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
servers if you're managing Windows

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.800 
servers if you're managing Windows
servers<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.580> Windows<00:04:39.880> desktops<00:04:40.450> then<00:04:40.690> you're

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
servers and Windows desktops then you're

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.570 
servers and Windows desktops then you're
probably<00:04:41.110> looking<00:04:41.650> at<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.770> lot<00:04:42.040> of<00:04:42.070> text<00:04:42.460> files

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
probably looking at a lot of text files

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.060 
probably looking at a lot of text files
and<00:04:42.910> if<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.150> ever<00:04:43.300> need<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.570> view<00:04:44.260> or<00:04:44.470> edit<00:04:44.500> any

and if you ever need to view or edit any
of<00:04:45.280> those<00:04:45.400> text<00:04:45.730> files<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.450> can<00:04:46.540> use<00:04:46.600> the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
of those text files you can use the

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.050 
of those text files you can use the
built<00:04:47.140> in<00:04:47.290> utility<00:04:47.830> called<00:04:48.040> notepad<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:48.730> you
