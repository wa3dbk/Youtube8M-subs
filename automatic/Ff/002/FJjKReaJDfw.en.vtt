00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.300
 for this we are going to need 4 cups of 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.570
 flour with baking powder 5 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.820
 teaspoons of salt 2 boxes of spinach 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.300
 or chard half a kilo of ricotta 11 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.170
 eggs white pepper 2 teaspoon 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.750
 seasoned pepper 2 onions 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.340
 a cup of oil two cups of water 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.840
 boiling 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.840
 we started putting the flour 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.029
 in a bowl in a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.029
 then we put the salt 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.920
 three teaspoons of salt 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.020
 we proceed to put the cup of oil 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.280
 the boiling water 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.280
 two cups of boiling water 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.790
 and we started mixing 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.180
 then the months we spent with our hands 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.899
 well kneaded 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.770
 then take the onion 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.899
 we apply it well 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.820
 and we put it to fry then we take in 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.820
 another bowl we put the ricotta 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.729
 the spinach 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.800
 the onion that we just fry 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.900
 and a little salt 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.570
 teaspoon of salt and then we put the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.570
 seasoned pepper 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520
 two teaspoons 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.729
 a little bit of white pepper too 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.729
 and then we revolve it 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.540
 or else to mix well the 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.310
 condiments and everything 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.850
 today we have the mass that we have at 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.850
 beginning 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.500
 we cut it in 2 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.519
 let's do the background 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.519
 with the other the lid of the pascualina 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.810
 we passed it stopped well 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.510
 and this is the best way to get the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.020
 shape 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.150
 we use the same mold 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.150
 we cut it with her with her hip 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.250
 we take what we have left 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.420
 we throw some oil spray to 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.420
 that does not stick 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.909
 we have a little bit more we make it a 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.909
 little bit bigger than it is 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.700
 then we all have to walk 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.700
 stretching a bit with your hand too 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.100
 there they have the base 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.100
 we put the stuffing 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.489
 we distribute it well 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.910
 then with the same spoon we make 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.430
 some holes 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.010
 to the filling so that later they settle 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.849
 there 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.849
 in the holes 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.330
 now we are laying the eggs 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.050
 starting to one 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.630
 and trying to put them in the holes 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.630
 what we did with the spoon 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.540
 we try as long as they fit 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.420
 spread out is usually around 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.700
 from 10 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.520
 10 games more or less after what 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.849
 we put the lid we grabbed an egg what 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.060
 we beat well 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.420
 a little 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.340
 and we put it above 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.740
 so that pascualina is shiny 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.260
 when we take it out we put it in the oven 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.260
 by 160 degrees for 80 minutes 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.819
 well the eggs are cooked well 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.819
 in 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.510
 and there they have exit from the oven 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.590
 is ready to serve
