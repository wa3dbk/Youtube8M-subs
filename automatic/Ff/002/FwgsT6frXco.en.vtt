 all Ecuadorians and for the people 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.409

 that I have no explanation to express

 what I feel now 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.150
 then I took the proud medal for a 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.750
 modestly and mentally 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.750
 look at it

 you feel 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.240
 and the truth is that a very 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.600
 great because 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.280
 the Ecuador 28 years ago we get a 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.240
 gold medal in the Bolivarians in 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.880
 basketball and feel myself having formed and going 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.770
 to be part of the team to have my 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.360
 minutes on court and to know that I 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.660
 I defended my country's shirt for 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.370
 have won I feel an emotion of what 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.310
 it's a feeling found 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.220
 happiness is that if you want to achieve it 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.580
 you can never give up 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.320
 that with the effort with patience and 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.390
 perseverance you can achieve things 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.910
 that one wants in life and that is a 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.130
 goal that I had also drawn and for 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.410
 what's more in my resume 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.650
 of values really not when I started to 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.410
 work this year in February I did not think 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.290
 that this is going to happen so fast is 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.390
 really a tdt tag of the floors 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.340
 from the earth 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.100
 I know we have a lot to work with and 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.530
 a lot to improve the goal a little 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.750
 was to try to put it between the four 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.160
 first in South America thinking that 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.070
 Well this topic was not Brazil and 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.010
 argentina but really good this 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.320
 exceeded expectations of what one 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.270
 I always thought titrate course one 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.980
 when he is in the bank a team wants 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.670
 win and want to get out as above 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.100
 possible but I think that even though I do not 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.000
 We can be a great preparation 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.610
 girls have made a tremendous effort 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.160
 they have left everything in every game and I think that 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.810
 they deserve this joy because this does not 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.810
 you always have to fight it
