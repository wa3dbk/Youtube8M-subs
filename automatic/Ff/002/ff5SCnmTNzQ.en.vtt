just the glittered ahead and come off so

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.890 
just the glittered ahead and come off so
the<00:02:36.880> glitter<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.269> do<00:02:37.420> have<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.630> put<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> little

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the glitter you do have to put a little

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.410 
the glitter you do have to put a little
bit<00:02:38.050> more<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.440> pressure<00:02:38.880> which<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:39.910> okay<00:02:40.360> to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
bit more of a pressure which is okay to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.390 
bit more of a pressure which is okay to
me<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:40.930> that's<00:02:41.410> actually<00:02:41.950> pretty<00:02:42.130> good

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
me because that's actually pretty good

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.630 
me because that's actually pretty good

and if you are nail savvy and you have

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.460 
and if you are nail savvy and you have
no<00:02:45.850> time<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.950> basically<00:02:48.000> re<00:02:49.000> like<00:02:49.989> take<00:02:50.290> off

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
no time to basically re like take off

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
takes forever when you use regular one

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.860 
takes forever when you use regular one
by<00:02:53.709> one<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.269> very<00:02:55.480> innovate

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
by one and then this is very innovate

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.530 
by one and then this is very innovate
innovative<00:02:56.440> because<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.400> like<00:02:57.850> five<00:02:58.239> holes

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
innovative because it's like five holes

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.830 
innovative because it's like five holes
and<00:02:58.989> does<00:02:59.290> one<00:02:59.590> hand<00:02:59.830> really<00:03:00.130> fast<00:03:00.840> something

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
and does one hand really fast something

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.330 
and does one hand really fast something
that's<00:03:02.080> pretty<00:03:02.260> good<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.920> doesn't<00:03:03.190> leave

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
that's pretty good and it doesn't leave

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.670 
that's pretty good and it doesn't leave
that<00:03:03.489> white<00:03:03.730> residue<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:04.870> know<00:03:04.989> how<00:03:05.110> I'm<00:03:05.410> and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
use acetone it does tend to leave that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.259 
use acetone it does tend to leave that
white<00:03:08.650> cast<00:03:09.010> finish<00:03:09.459> where<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.670> looks<00:03:09.910> really
