00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.010
 very good kids we are here in the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.960
 My business's clash of clans channel 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.119
 some guys as you see we have to attack in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.740
 war to this town hall level 9 a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.140
 little under the truth but well let's 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.550
 try to make a good attack and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.530
 Well, guys, tell you that my 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.750
 fellow explosion because he could not do 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.220
 your attack is worth it because you are directly 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 was the internet just when I was 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 releasing the troops so 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 well he did not detect the troops worth 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
 He left with a zero percent 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.070
 well come on let's attack we're going 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.830
 to attack by bass with everything 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 we have to see if we burst the village and 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.410
 already when we reach the end then good 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.570
 it's the simplest thing because only 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 would be the heroes although well then 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.860
 he takes me a loquera to knock him down 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 chocillas and that we have time to make 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.000
 one hundred percent if we arrived so 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 nothing we are going to attack we attack with these 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.660
 troops I have three goals and I'm going to do the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.430
 same army that I had made for 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 town hall level 10 to see we are going to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.500
 try to attack it there we attack perfect 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.820
 and nothing come then we start to let go 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 girlfriend takes out the clan castle because 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.580
 yes no I do not know if I'm going to give time to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.400
 Killing him is worth it because we carry the spell 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.780
 of healing and such come so I'm going to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 throw the freckles already out there 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.290
 pigs the heroes castle of the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 Tall clan come healing spell for 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.740
 there a spell of rage we are also going to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.200
 use it and when the castle comes 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.240
 of the clan we began to release the potion 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.220
 there had to having released him 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.110
 It breaks walls, something that always ends up 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.180
 forgetting I do not know why the truth but 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 good to see if we are lucky there is worth 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 the jump spell out there to see if 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 we are lucky and all the troops are going 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.409
 that I do not kill those magicians I'm going to 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.700
 use the healing success is worth 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.619
 It is complicating the attack a bit 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.210
 I thought it would be better but 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.220
 well let's see if in the end it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.960
 rectify the attack a bit and we have 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.840
 there already already and the sets of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.490
 explosives uf uf vale had to have 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.500
 used the archer to take the other 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 and I've seen that I forgot but 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.069
 good is good going the attack we knocked 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.509
 right now the town hall and 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.520
 we got the second star but 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.100
 those magicians have dead I shit on everything 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.410
 boy I can fit to see if the queen 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.330
 it saves us a little the skin worth 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.580
 try to break the walls to see if the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.470
 break and at least we do something 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.060
 is the cuff that's out there seems to be and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.430
 it's been a hair come that the tuna 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.269
 of the mortar that does not bother 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.709
 perfect vale is worth that tower give 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.329
 and come and see if we are lucky the hundred 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.430
 Per hundred can get there I say yes 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.750
 we will have we have time is worth 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.909
 damn they go for that hut of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.260
 builders the queen and such is it worth 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.000
 I think one hundred percent comes though 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.010
 there we have put a little bit because 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.439
 I 've been clueless I was more attentive to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.569
 see if the attack was being recorded or not 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.829
 but it's good, it looks very good 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.859
 truth only remains salt tower of 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.569
 wizards is the good cannon takes away a 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.069
 little zoom already uses the ability to 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.859
 the queen to knock down everything 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.170
 is already there and that generates some 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.090
 how many archers and we already have guys the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.069
 one hundred percent got worth perfect 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.720
 guys, we've returned to get a 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.819
 one hundred percent at war for here to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.290
 help all our classmates like this 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.359
 I am very happy and see if 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.709
 we won this clan war that the 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.480
 truth then good now is a 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.129
 little complicated to win it because we 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.319
 have done several hundred percent since 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.260
 very unequal state to the war but 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.629
 very very very bumpy fairy and good guys 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.609
 we get here 100% we get 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.230
 right now with three stars for 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.060
 in front of the other clan with more attacks 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.500
 but good thing is that they have made us the hundred 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.139
 percent to the first village and to the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.160
 third since this city council fixos 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.980

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.570

 rabid healing this has it all at 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.930
