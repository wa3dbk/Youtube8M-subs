00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 and just on youtube I'm a baby pps 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.070
 I'm here with the samsung galaxy tab 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 use acs pepper 10 samsung and the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.680
 Samsung Galaxy 3 to talk about what 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 about gyroscope accelerometer 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.400
 Okay, okay, a lot of people invented it. 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.140
 that the personal accelerometer accelerometer 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.490
 for who there are people who do not know how to be 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.019
 So, I'll explain the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.309
 this accelerometer here 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:38.129
 he knows very well the cope the accelerometer 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 when you have a game you use it 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.239
 To do this, here is a racing game. 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 for example already have some videos then the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.899
 gyroscope is this here you are following the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.899
 is that the tablet 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.719
 that eventually entered 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 the gyroscope dr 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:24.259
 for example here in settings 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 and horizontal calibration display calibrate 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.939
 horizontally using the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.860
 then you calibrate the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:39.420
 your standing device 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.810
 I mean this after getting samsung s 3 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.810
 thousand 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.219
 Let's go in setup somewhere else 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:56.500
 It's personal while it's on the display here 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:02:01.509
 Let's see here are total 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:07.110
 here it is not so we're going here on 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.110
 moving movement goes there at the end 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 sensitivity settings will be that 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.380
 same is the calibration with gyroscope 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.480
 properly calibrate movement 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.730
 using the gyroscope 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.489
 this is where you will calibrate the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:32.379
 gyro and my surprise is that the 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:35.739
 samsung sdi use it does not have a place 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:40.090
 for you to calibrate I searched for everything 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:43.840
 How much has it been here? 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.709
 I do not think it's personal, I do not think so. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.430
 Does anyone know where the option is? 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:57.940
 to calibrate this device here by 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.160
 please do not email me a message for me 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.290
 the work is only in such a place that I go and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.569
 I make a video this doubt until it's iran is 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.910
 close if I'm not mistaken of the channel 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.380
 youtube.com for linux brs1 that spoke 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.650
 that he would like to know if he has 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.019
 calibrate you can not calibrate this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.530
 device that would be samsung galaxy s 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.690
 12 but s3 me has how you calibrate and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.209
 samsung galaxy tab also has 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.209
 calibrate personal touch 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.669
 so this is a tip on or the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.099
 device calibration 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:37.980
 If you liked, let the ladybug leave. 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.980
 Personal touch message thank you and see you later
