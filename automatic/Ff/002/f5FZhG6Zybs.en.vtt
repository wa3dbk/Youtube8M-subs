three<00:00:10.550> by<00:00:10.700> three<00:00:10.970> mercury<00:00:11.450> puzzle<00:00:11.809> and<00:00:11.959> then

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
three by three mercury puzzle and then

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.690 
three by three mercury puzzle and then
I'm<00:00:12.709> going<00:00:12.830> to<00:00:12.860> go<00:00:13.040> ahead<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.280> do<00:00:13.580> it

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
I'm going to go ahead and do it

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.579 
I'm going to go ahead and do it
disassembly<00:00:14.299> and<00:00:14.330> show<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.839> mechanism<00:00:15.379> and

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
disassembly and show the mechanism and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.390 
disassembly and show the mechanism and
what<00:00:16.219> makes<00:00:16.400> these<00:00:17.390> faces<00:00:17.960> unlocked<00:00:18.530> and<00:00:18.800> some

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
what makes these faces unlocked and some

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.660 
what makes these faces unlocked and some
faces<00:00:19.940> locked<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.920> mercury<00:00:22.220> puzzle<00:00:22.550> has

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
faces locked so the mercury puzzle has

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.190 
faces locked so the mercury puzzle has
one<00:00:23.120> circle<00:00:23.660> that's<00:00:23.780> locked<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:26.020> all<00:00:27.020> the

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
one circle that's locked and all the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.709 
one circle that's locked and all the
other<00:00:27.320> circles<00:00:27.680> are<00:00:27.800> unlocked<00:00:30.700> so<00:00:31.700> this<00:00:32.450> just

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
other circles are unlocked so this just

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.310 
other circles are unlocked so this just
adds<00:00:32.899> a<00:00:33.050> normal<00:00:33.610> rubix<00:00:34.610> color<00:00:34.850> scheme<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.839> it

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
adds a normal rubix color scheme and it

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.340 
adds a normal rubix color scheme and it
is<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:36.679> exact<00:00:37.010> same<00:00:37.190> size<00:00:37.429> as<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:38.690> normal<00:00:39.109> three

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
is the exact same size as a normal three

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.340 
is the exact same size as a normal three
by<00:00:39.469> three<00:00:40.359> the<00:00:41.359> turning<00:00:41.659> this<00:00:41.719> puzzle<00:00:42.079> is<00:00:42.109> very

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
by three the turning this puzzle is very

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.959 
by three the turning this puzzle is very
nice<00:00:42.789> it's<00:00:43.839> pretty<00:00:44.839> much<00:00:44.960> finger<00:00:45.320> trickable

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
nice it's pretty much finger trickable

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.309 
nice it's pretty much finger trickable
except<00:00:46.969> it<00:00:47.120> doesn't<00:00:47.300> really<00:00:47.629> cut<00:00:47.929> that<00:00:48.140> well

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
except it doesn't really cut that well

except it doesn't really cut that well
can't<00:00:48.980> cut<00:00:49.219> corners<00:00:49.249> all<00:00:49.699> that<00:00:49.819> grape<00:00:50.030> and

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
can't cut corners all that grape and

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.939 
can't cut corners all that grape and
when<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.190> on<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.210> locked<00:00:53.420> face<00:00:53.719> when<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.199> do

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
when you on the locked face when you do

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.790 
when you on the locked face when you do
up<00:00:55.129> turns<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:56.210> can<00:00:56.510> come<00:00:56.960> out<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.199> alignment<00:00:57.409> as

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
up turns it can come out of alignment as

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.439 
up turns it can come out of alignment as
you<00:00:58.010> can<00:00:58.100> see<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:58.519> you<00:00:59.050> just<00:01:00.050> have<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.440> kind<00:01:01.190> of

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
you can see and you just have to kind of

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.229 
you can see and you just have to kind of
turn<00:01:02.449> it<00:01:02.629> to<00:01:02.780> get<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.050> back<00:01:03.199> into<00:01:03.850> alignment<00:01:04.850> oh

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
turn it to get it back into alignment oh

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.170 
turn it to get it back into alignment oh
you<00:01:05.720> can<00:01:06.290> use<00:01:06.500> two<00:01:06.920> fingers<00:01:07.250> in<00:01:07.430> 3<00:01:07.579> light<00:01:10.180> this

you can use two fingers in 3 light this
puzzles<00:01:11.990> turns<00:01:12.560> very<00:01:12.770> fast<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:15.170> like<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:15.710> said

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
puzzles turns very fast and like I said

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.429 
puzzles turns very fast and like I said
it<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.250> has<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.460> be<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:17.060> alignment<00:01:17.719> in<00:01:18.200> order

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
it just has to be in alignment in order

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.060 
it just has to be in alignment in order
to<00:01:18.530> turn<00:01:18.680> turn<00:01:19.039> very<00:01:19.460> well<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:21.259> I'm<00:01:21.829> going<00:01:22.039> to

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
to turn turn very well so I'm going to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.399 
to turn turn very well so I'm going to
go<00:01:22.189> ahead<00:01:22.219> and<00:01:22.520> do<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.670> disassembly<00:01:23.539> because

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
go ahead and do a disassembly because

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.969 
go ahead and do a disassembly because
the<00:01:24.590> mechanisms<00:01:25.130> elizy<00:01:26.560> do<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.829> can

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
the mechanisms elizy do that you can

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.940 
the mechanisms elizy do that you can
just<00:01:28.159> pull<00:01:28.759> out<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.060> inner<00:01:29.299> circle<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:32.950> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
just pull out this inner circle and you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.749 
just pull out this inner circle and you
can<00:01:34.100> see<00:01:34.219> the<00:01:34.340> piece<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.780> then<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.009> edge

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
can see the piece and then the edge

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:48.880 
can see the piece and then the edge
piece<00:01:38.119> looks<00:01:38.539> like<00:01:38.780> this

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.120 

and<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.270> can<00:01:50.420> see<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:51.470> inner<00:01:51.680> circle

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
and you can see that this inner circle

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.060 
and you can see that this inner circle
piece<00:01:52.340> fits<00:01:52.640> right<00:01:52.790> in<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:57.070> then

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
piece fits right in like that and then

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.260 
piece fits right in like that and then
the<00:01:58.190> rest<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.520> puzzle<00:01:58.790> just<00:01:58.909> comes<00:01:59.119> apart

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
the rest of the puzzle just comes apart

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.109 
the rest of the puzzle just comes apart
basically<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.409> 3<00:02:00.680> by<00:02:00.800> 3<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.220> here<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.000> can

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
basically like a 3 by 3 and here you can

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.390 
basically like a 3 by 3 and here you can
see<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:03.970> corner<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:06.740> fits<00:02:06.979> right<00:02:07.220> in

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
see the corner and this fits right in

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.260 
see the corner and this fits right in
like<00:02:07.550> that<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:12.550> then<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> rest<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.000> should

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
like that and then the rest of it should

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:31.210 
like that and then the rest of it should
just<00:02:15.160> come<00:02:16.160> apart<00:02:16.250> now<00:02:29.739> okay<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:30.800> here's<00:02:31.130> the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
just come apart now okay so here's the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.640 
just come apart now okay so here's the
core<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.900> you're<00:02:33.050> nervous<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.500> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
core and if you're nervous on this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.600 
core and if you're nervous on this
puzzle<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:38.300> white<00:02:38.480> face<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:39.310> has<00:02:40.310> a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
puzzle this one the white face is has a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.590 
puzzle this one the white face is has a
square<00:02:41.360> I'm<00:02:42.400> Necker<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:44.030> don't<00:02:44.390> know<00:02:44.450> what<00:02:44.540> you

square I'm Necker I don't know what you
want<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.810> call<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.200> that's<00:02:45.739> what<00:02:45.830> locks<00:02:46.250> in

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
want to call it and that's what locks in

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.020 
want to call it and that's what locks in
the<00:02:47.260> white<00:02:48.260> circle<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:50.320> these<00:02:51.320> ones<00:02:51.560> don't

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the white circle and these ones don't

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.640 
the white circle and these ones don't
turn<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.209> all<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.540> they're<00:02:54.110> actually<00:02:54.230> locked

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
turn it all and they're actually locked

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.560 
turn it all and they're actually locked
into<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.239> ball<00:02:56.239> neck<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.900> ball<00:02:57.140> cord<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.880> so

the<00:03:01.489> white<00:03:01.640> one<00:03:01.790> off<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.700> i'm<00:03:07.850> going<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.030> go

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
the white one off and i'm going to go

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.110 
the white one off and i'm going to go
ahead<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:09.040> take<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.549> i'll<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:10.880> take<00:03:10.940> one

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
ahead and take just i'll just take one

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.280 
ahead and take just i'll just take one
of<00:03:11.209> these<00:03:11.299> off<00:03:11.510> i'll<00:03:11.660> take<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> red<00:03:12.019> one<00:03:12.049> off

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
of these off i'll take the red one off

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:27.040 
of these off i'll take the red one off
and<00:03:12.790> compare<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:15.910> core

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.420 

so<00:03:28.050> as<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.680> see<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.040> white<00:03:29.190> face

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
so as you can see on the white face

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.060 
so as you can see on the white face
which<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.180> lock<00:03:30.420> circle<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:31.890> has

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
which is the lock circle that it has

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.590 
which is the lock circle that it has
this<00:03:32.400> square<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:35.610> circle<00:03:36.030> always

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
this square so that the circle always

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.180 
this square so that the circle always
moves<00:03:36.900> with<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:39.140> centerpiece<00:03:40.140> however<00:03:41.010> on

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
moves with the centerpiece however on

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.970 
moves with the centerpiece however on
this<00:03:41.400> piece<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:42.840> circular<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.830> has

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
this piece it is circular and it has

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.360 
this piece it is circular and it has
these<00:03:44.750> indents<00:03:45.750> right<00:03:45.990> here<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.380> what

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
these indents right here and what

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.820 
these indents right here and what
happens<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.910> these<00:03:48.150> they<00:03:48.930> lock<00:03:49.140> into<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.470> core

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
happens is these they lock into the core

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.430 
happens is these they lock into the core
or<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.960> can't<00:03:52.170> turn<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
or like that and you can't turn the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.770 
or like that and you can't turn the
middle<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:58.410> has<00:03:58.560> been<00:03:58.590> my<00:03:58.890> review<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
middle so this has been my review and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.350 
middle so this has been my review and
