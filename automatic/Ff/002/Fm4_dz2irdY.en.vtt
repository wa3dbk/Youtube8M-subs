00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
wide at the tip than a 5rv

two<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.350> half<00:02:03.560> Reed<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.130> mean<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.400> should

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
two and a half Reed I mean I should

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.330 
two and a half Reed I mean I should
really<00:02:04.910> go<00:02:05.120> up<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.450> a3<00:02:05.780> now<00:02:06.410> but<00:02:07.130> well<00:02:07.310> let's

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
really go up to a3 now but well let's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.250 
really go up to a3 now but well let's
use<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.700> same<00:02:08.060> Reed<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.600> you'll<00:02:08.750> hear<00:02:09.140> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:22.130 
use the same Reed and you'll hear the
difference

now you can see immediately that I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.760 
now you can see immediately that I

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.180 
mouthpiece but it's also got a slightly
different<00:02:30.400> tonal<00:02:31.060> quality<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.650> just

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
different tonal quality and so just

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.010 
different tonal quality and so just
going<00:02:33.550> up<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.850> strength<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.360> read<00:02:34.540> there<00:02:34.780> half

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
going up the strength of read there half

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.960 
going up the strength of read there half
a<00:02:35.170> strength<00:02:35.500> you'll<00:02:36.100> get<00:02:36.370> exactly<00:02:36.520> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
a strength you'll get exactly the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:47.670 
a strength you'll get exactly the
results<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.690> want

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.330 

so<00:02:48.680> that's<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.100> smallest<00:02:49.460> one<00:02:50.980> this<00:02:51.980> at<00:02:52.250> the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
so that's the smallest one this at the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.460 
so that's the smallest one this at the
moment<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.730> proving<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.330> our<00:02:53.780> most<00:02:54.140> popular

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
moment is proving to be our most popular

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.410 
moment is proving to be our most popular
it's<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.370> m3<00:02:56.800> it's<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.340> m1<00:02:58.730> used<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.270> be<00:02:59.390> very

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
it's the m3 it's the m1 used to be very

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.870 
it's the m3 it's the m1 used to be very
popular<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.800> m3<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.580> slightly

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
popular and the m3 is just slightly

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.690 
popular and the m3 is just slightly
overtaken<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.900> recently<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.680> think<00:03:04.100> that's<00:03:04.550> to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
overtaken it recently I think that's to

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.570 
overtaken it recently I think that's to
do<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:04.910> its<00:03:05.840> comfort<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.680> playing<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.280> also

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
do with its comfort in playing and also

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.840 
do with its comfort in playing and also
the<00:03:07.730> sound<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.240> produces<00:03:08.710> again<00:03:09.710> youth<00:03:10.460> wants

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
the sound it produces again youth wants

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.360 
the sound it produces again youth wants
a<00:03:10.970> probably<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.330> number<00:03:11.630> three<00:03:11.900> read<00:03:12.170> on<00:03:12.410> here

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
a probably a number three read on here

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.030 
a probably a number three read on here
the<00:03:13.640> lay<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:14.060> bigger<00:03:14.450> than<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.560> small<00:03:15.860> one

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
the lay is bigger than the the small one

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.730 
the lay is bigger than the the small one
I<00:03:16.220> showed<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:16.790> now<00:03:17.090> but<00:03:17.620> it's<00:03:18.620> a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
I showed you just now but it's a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.330 
I showed you just now but it's a
slightly<00:03:18.980> different<00:03:19.160> shape<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.830> if<00:03:21.830> you'll

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
slightly different shape and if you'll

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:36.140 
slightly different shape and if you'll
hear<00:03:22.760> exactly<00:03:23.210> what<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.690> does

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:50.240 

it's<00:03:37.150> got<00:03:37.420> quite<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.780> smooth<00:03:38.290> darker<00:03:39.100> sound<00:03:49.080> and

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
it's got quite a smooth darker sound and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.830 
it's got quite a smooth darker sound and
with<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.430> two-and-a-half<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.270> actually<00:03:52.510> feel

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
with that two-and-a-half I actually feel

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.230 
with that two-and-a-half I actually feel
quite<00:03:53.140> comfortable<00:03:53.350> but<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.370> may<00:03:54.610> want<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.030> go

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
quite comfortable but you may want to go

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.810 
quite comfortable but you may want to go
up<00:03:55.270> to<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.840> three<00:03:56.170> because<00:03:56.860> there's<00:03:57.100> not<00:03:57.610> much

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
up to a three because there's not much

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.330 
up to a three because there's not much
resistance<00:03:58.240> there<00:03:58.720> at<00:03:58.840> all<00:03:59.080> then<00:03:59.530> we<00:03:59.740> have<00:04:00.040> a

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
resistance there at all then we have a

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.570 
resistance there at all then we have a
slightly<00:04:01.180> German<00:04:02.050> influenced<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:03.070> which<00:04:03.400> is

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
slightly German influenced one which is

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.320 
slightly German influenced one which is
quite<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> long<00:04:04.690> flat<00:04:05.380> lay<00:04:05.710> it's<00:04:06.520> particularly

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
quite a long flat lay it's particularly

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.850 
quite a long flat lay it's particularly
suited<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.370> v12<00:04:10.080> van<00:04:11.080> Doorn<00:04:11.350> Reeves<00:04:11.910> and

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
suited to the v12 van Doorn Reeves and

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.710 
suited to the v12 van Doorn Reeves and
it<00:04:14.860> clears<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.580> sound<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:16.270> them<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:16.630> they

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
it clears the sound for them and they

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.650 
it clears the sound for them and they
don't<00:04:16.750> sound<00:04:17.260> quite<00:04:17.860> so<00:04:18.120> asthmatic<00:04:19.120> sometimes

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
don't sound quite so asthmatic sometimes

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.680 
don't sound quite so asthmatic sometimes
they<00:04:19.870> can<00:04:20.140> you<00:04:20.620> know<00:04:20.650> with<00:04:20.890> some<00:04:21.130> mouthpieces

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
they can you know with some mouthpieces

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.930 
they can you know with some mouthpieces
it's<00:04:22.690> longer<00:04:23.080> lay<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:24.310> gives<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.730> a

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
it's longer lay and it gives you a

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:38.650 
it's longer lay and it gives you a
different<00:04:25.180> quality<00:04:25.930> again

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.110 

again<00:04:39.560> now<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:39.830> would<00:04:40.220> lead<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.460> number<00:04:40.880> three

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
again now I would lead a number three

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.170 
again now I would lead a number three
vendor<00:04:41.600> on<00:04:41.900> there<00:04:42.139> or<00:04:42.530> perhaps<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:43.370> ruler<00:04:43.729> pica

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
vendor on there or perhaps a ruler pica

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.589 
vendor on there or perhaps a ruler pica
number<00:04:44.449> three<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:46.370> would<00:04:46.580> take<00:04:47.389> that

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
number three and that would take that

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.930 
number three and that would take that
edge<00:04:47.810> off<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.080> sound<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.860> bring<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.520> warmth

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
edge off the sound and bring the warmth

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.540 
edge off the sound and bring the warmth
back<00:04:50.270> in<00:04:50.599> but<00:04:51.229> again<00:04:51.349> it's<00:04:51.770> you've<00:04:52.009> getting<00:04:52.370> a

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
back in but again it's you've getting a

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:09.480 
back in but again it's you've getting a
more<00:04:53.210> darker<00:04:54.080> sound<00:04:54.380> here

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.830 

now<00:05:10.490> here<00:05:10.879> I'm<00:05:11.030> going<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.240> still<00:05:11.479> use<00:05:11.659> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
now here I'm going to still use the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.529 
now here I'm going to still use the
two-and-a-half<00:05:12.199> but<00:05:12.830> really<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.729> should<00:05:14.120> be<00:05:14.150> on

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
two-and-a-half but really I should be on

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.809 
two-and-a-half but really I should be on
something<00:05:14.900> like<00:05:15.110> a<00:05:15.169> three<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.770> half<00:05:15.979> this

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
something like a three and a half this

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.330 
something like a three and a half this
is<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.240> Symphonic<00:05:17.900> one<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.259> D<00:05:18.469> three<00:05:18.830> it's<00:05:19.189> a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
is the Symphonic one the D three it's a

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.390 
is the Symphonic one the D three it's a
very<00:05:19.759> long<00:05:20.150> way<00:05:22.659> it's<00:05:23.659> taken<00:05:24.199> from<00:05:24.439> a<00:05:24.530> lathe<00:05:25.099> at

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
very long way it's taken from a lathe at

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.270 
very long way it's taken from a lathe at
quite<00:05:25.789> a<00:05:25.819> number<00:05:26.180> of<00:05:26.449> very<00:05:27.259> very<00:05:27.469> revered

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
quite a number of very very revered

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.089 
quite a number of very very revered
symphonic<00:05:28.939> players<00:05:29.210> played<00:05:29.599> in<00:05:30.379> this<00:05:30.620> country

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
symphonic players played in this country

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.809 
symphonic players played in this country
and<00:05:32.560> gives<00:05:33.560> you<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.740> tremendous<00:05:33.979> amount<00:05:34.699> of

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
and gives you a tremendous amount of

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.820 
and gives you a tremendous amount of
projection<00:05:35.479> that<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:36.020> would<00:05:36.199> need<00:05:36.440> in<00:05:36.710> the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
projection that you would need in the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:54.159 
projection that you would need in the
symphonic<00:05:37.370> situation

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.840 

and<00:05:55.169> again<00:05:55.500> with<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> three<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.310> half<00:05:56.580> on

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
and again with a three and a half on

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.250 
and again with a three and a half on

there so that this two and a half which
is<00:05:58.290> really<00:05:58.710> too<00:05:58.919> easy<00:06:00.080> you<00:06:01.080> get<00:06:01.350> that<00:06:01.500> real

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
is really too easy you get that real

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.770 
is really too easy you get that real

weight of sound particularly for bronze

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.870 
weight of sound particularly for bronze
or<00:06:04.260> recommend<00:06:04.680> enough<00:06:04.919> where<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:05.669> could
