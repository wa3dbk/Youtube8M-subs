00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 removed and winter autumn cuttings take 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.799
 best bushes tested on 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.240
 yield and quality of berries 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.300
 harvesting them during trimming bushes 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.580
 at the end of September at the beginning of October for 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.830
 cuttings use the middle portion of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.710
 incense of summer fruit shoots 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 arrows or shoots that are cut at 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.650
 substitute mote ideally shoots should 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.250
 be in diameter of 7-10 millimeters length 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.510
 internodes 7-10 centimeters however 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.540
 there are varieties 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.840
 for example the mystery of the ball obviously thin 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.379
 cut off the vine leaves 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.360
 the antennae of stepchildren are not mature tops and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.539
 cut into cuttings with three four 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.739
 buds harvested cuttings day 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.660
 soaked in water 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.969
 disinfected in a solution of iron 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.760
 sulphate is necessarily dried and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.190
 mark stored cuttings in refrigerators 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.219
 cellars or cellars at 0 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.820
 + 2 under plastic wrap on 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.059
 cuttings 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.880
 use a sharp knife to cut the bottom straight 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 5 millimeters from the lower kidney top 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.280
 inclined to one or two centimeters above 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 the upper kidney and the slope is done from 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.890
 buds on the lower end of the cutting needle or 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.140
 I make three or four furrows with a knife 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.150
 three centimeters with a visa I only bark 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 It would give the soil 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.250
 additional roots will grow from the furrows 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.799
 late January early February 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.020
 take out the cuttings and within two days 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.720
 soaked in a warm settled or 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.930
 snow water that is changed daily 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.110
 then for one day kept in the stimulator 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.700
 rooting germination methods 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.899
 cuttings first option for germination 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.729
 clear plastic is used 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.850
 0.5 liter glass in its not awl 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.399
 I make three four holes down the glass 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.159
 a mixture of leaf humus is poured and 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.549
 one-to-one land 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.070
 layer two two and a half centimeters on 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.039
 ground in the center of the glass set 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.619
 a hollow cylinder with a diameter of 30 millimeters and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.170
 100 millimeters high space 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.420
 between the walls of the glass and cylinder for 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.170
 changing earth which condense and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.540
 watered 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.870
 the cylinder is filled with washed and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:31.230
 heated river sand it poured 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:32.700
 the cylinder is pulled out in the center of the sand on 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.580
 depth 4 centimeters 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.430
 a hole is made with a stick of diameter 1 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.599
 a centimeter is inserted into the hole stalk 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.250
 Sand is poured on top of poured sand 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.280
 the stalk is covered with transparent plastic 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 a bottle with a cut off bottom in the neck 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.900
 the bottle remains open 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.150
 cuttings watered with warm water in volume 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.000
 30 milliliters every day or through 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.780
 day depending on the dryness of the air in 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.120
 indoors 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.160
 when the roots sprout to the walls 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.150
 cups and formed four five 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.150
 leaflets bottle remove the second option 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.110
 in plastic bottles without a throat in the bottom 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.450
 make a hole and pour drainage then 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.060
 six eight tablespoons of soil mixture and 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.490
 slope put the stalk so that it 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.260
 the top peephole was flush with the cut 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.630
 bottles after that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.350
 sprinkle old moistened steamed 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.630
 sawdust 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.790
 put on the window sill with an eye from the window 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.280
 Cover with plastic disposable 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.770
 a glass of his take off when the escape 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.710
 the tariff stops 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.020
 seedlings are conducted from the bottom through the pallet and 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.930
 enough to pour half a centimeter of water and 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.950
 hold no more seedlings in a bottle 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.740
 15 minutes 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.510
 the third method cuttings are placed in 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.540
 plastic bag on the bottom of which 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.090
 put a piece of wet foam rubber cuttings 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.620
 heels rest on foam rubber and package 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.110
 sent to the closet 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.270
 after about ten days begin 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.520
 check the appearance of Colas and even 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.070
 tiny one two millimeter 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.500
 rootlets then the cuttings are planted in 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.109
 plastic cup as in the first embodiment 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.330
 This method allows you to advance 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.660
 choose sprouted cuttings and thereby 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.550
 save space on the windowsill roots 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.150
 most actively formed when 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.100
 temperature of 20-25 degrees for this 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.470
 glasses with cuttings on a tray 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.780
 set by the sun window above 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.930
 heaters inside the bottle 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.990
 temperature maintained 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.810
 12 18 degrees thanks to this root 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.240
 the cutting system is growing faster than 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.210
 Escape and development of seedlings strongly 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.850
 accelerates in late April early May 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.420
 seedlings transplanted into a larger container 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.510
 size 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.510
 volume of 23 liters and grow in the greenhouse 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.350
 in late July, the seedlings transplant buckets 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.990
 and kept outdoors 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.210
 if in mid-September the shoots matured 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.090
 at least two buds then sapling 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.090
 planted in a trench at a permanent place 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.389
 ripened timber has 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.389
 light brown color not matured 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.790
 green if the wood on the shoots is not 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.950
 ripened then at the end of September buckets 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.680
 are brought into the apartment and put near 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.560
 Balcony after the leaves and if leaves 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.169
 so and naples is in early december 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.110
 seedlings are cut into 3-4 mature buds 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.960
 spring shoots begin to grow from the buds and 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.260
 at the end of May, saplings in buckets are taken away 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.680
 garden in the greenhouse on seedlings left 12 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.810
 best escape in mid september 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:20.720
 seedlings are planted in a trench in this 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.720
 case next year is a grape bush
