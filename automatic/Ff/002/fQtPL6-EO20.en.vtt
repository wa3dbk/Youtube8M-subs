00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.789
 today's creepy pasta is called pokémon black version 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:14.869
 and says so 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.369
 I am and what could be called a collector of alternative versions 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.890
 of pokémon games 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.380
 pokémon diamond and jade 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.259
 chaos black ' 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.409
 etcetera it is amazing how often you can find them in houses 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.130
 Pawn 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.699
 goodwin flea fair and similar 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.000
 these are usually fun even if they are injudicious you talk to 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.770
 often they are poor translation and poor quality makes them unintentional 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:38.629
 funny 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.320
 I have been able to find most of the ones I had played online 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.460
 but there is one of which I have not seen any mention about him 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.929
 I bought it at a flea show about five years ago 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.530
 Here is a photograph of the cartridge in case anyone recognizes it 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.940
 unfortunately when I switched two years ago 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.810
 I lost the game so I can not give you any screenshots 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.639
 sorry 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:06.640
 the game starts with the family intro of midori I did not do in garde the version 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.550
 Red and blue 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.800
 however, the screen of 3 has been altered 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.020
 red appears there but the site does not appear because you put it from one side to another 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 and also says blas version under the logo of because non 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.610
 when selecting nor uribe 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.490
 the game starts with the teacher's speech 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.670
 and this makes it clear that the game was pokémon red version after 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 select your initials if you look at your pokemons you have in addition to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.790
 volva sor 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.530
 ander charm 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.780
 or is kirk him another pokémon 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.300
 the Pokémon was level 1 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.400
 and had the esprit a of the ghosts 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.090
 that we found in the tower the band before getting the written neckline and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.550
 he has an attack 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.180
 I know there is a real attack called curse 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.970
 to curse 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.329
 but the attack does not exist 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.290
 in Generation 1 so it seems that it was introduced to that at the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.570
 pokemones when defending themselves were unable to attack August 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.930
 he just said that they were too scared to move when the movement 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.280
 was used in battle 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.940
 the screen was cut January 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.610
 the cry of the pokémon defending itself was heard 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.150
 but it was distorted 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.519
 touched to a lower than normal tone 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.879
 the battle screen reappears and the defending pokémon would have gone 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.489
 if we use it in a battle against a coach 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.889
 when the few balls represent their pokemons in the corner 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.000
 they would have a little less ball 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.690
 this implied that the Pokémon had died 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.240
 what was even weirder is that after defeating a coach and 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.279
 berrojo received $ 200 for the victory 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.829
 the battle commands would reappear 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.419
 if your selection abás run 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.040
 the battle would end as it normally does 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.849
 you can also select curse if you did 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.700
 when returning to the top view 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.769
 the coach's spirit will be gone 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.190
 after leaving and re-entering the same area 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 the place where the coach had been will be replaced by a crypt 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.230
 Like the ones in the tower, the band movement was not usable in 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.079
 all instances would fail against other pokémon ghosts 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.619
 would also fail against coaches with whom you had to go back to 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:03.159
 fight 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.159
 as your opponent or giovanni however it could be used in your final battles 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.400
 Against them 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.730
 I thought that this was the trick of the game 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.739
 allowing you to use ghosts that could not be captured before 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.989
 and why I'm moving towards the game so easy 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.350
 use it throughout the adventure 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.169
 the game changed a bit after defeating the four elite 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.040
 after seeing the hall of fame 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.120
 which consisted of ghosts and a very low-level couple because we have 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.430
 the screen changed to black a text box appeared with the words many 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.900
 years later and then the band goes to the tower 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.129
 an old man is looking at the crypts 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.260
 then you realize that that man is your character 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.599
 the man only moves at half the speed when walking 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.779
 you do not have any pokémon with you 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:47.829
 not even you 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.519
 that up to this point had been impossible to remove from your group by 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.540
 half of pepo cite it in the ps 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.939
 in the top view of the stage it was completely empty 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.959
 there were no people at all there were still the tombs of the trainers 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.660
 about which I had used course however 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.720
 you can go to almost anywhere in the top view at this point although 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.840
 your movements are limited by the fact that you do not have pokemons to 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.340
 use hms 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.059
 and no matter where you go 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:19.040
 the village music the band is still listening in a loop continued 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.130
 after walking for a while I found that if you go through the cavern of the tickets 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.080
 one of the bushes that usually block the road to the other side and 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.150
 it does not appear anymore 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.360
 what would allow you to move forward and return village palette 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.439
 when you enter your house and go to the exact same table where you start the 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.610
 game the screen will go black 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.169
 then the image of a cancer that appears 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.520
 and then it's replaced by one of a 9 19 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.009
 and then a pillage and 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.069
 then I realized that as the pokemones progress from sterrato tables 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:48.690
 codex 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.470
 that that was all the pokemon on which I used curse 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.780
 after finishing my rival's team 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.879
 a young man appears and then an insect hunter 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.110
 those were the coaches on whom I used curse 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.729
 through the sequence the music of the town the band was still listening 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.669
 but I was slowly decreasing the tone 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.270
 for the moment your rival appears on the screen 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.590
 it was little more than a roll of the devil 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.830
 another cut to black screen a few moments after the screen soon 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.800
 of battle appears the esprit or your coach is now that old man 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.600
 the same one that teaches you to capture pokemons in city divided 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.110
 gost appears on the other side with the words you want to fight 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.729
 you can not use items 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.169
 and you do not have pokemones 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.150
 and if you try to run you can not escape the only option is to fight 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.790
 using fight causes you to immediately use effort that does not affect 2 but 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.889
 takes a bit of your own HP when it's your turn to attack two 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.110
 he simply says eventually 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.620
 when your hp reach a critical point 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.729
 2 finally uses curse 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.120
 the screen goes black for the last time 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.469
 regardless of the buttons that press 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.449
 tuqueras permanently trapped in this black screen at this point the 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.210
 The only thing you can do is turn off the gain body 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.630
 when you go back to playing again, and neither is the only option 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.510
 the game has deleted the file 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.240
 I played through this game a lot of times 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.199
 and each time the game ended with the same sequence 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.439
 a lot of times do not use August at all since it is impossible to remove 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.069
 of the group 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.999
 in those cases he did not show any pokémon or trainer and you just 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:24.580
 leads to climate combat against August 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.289
 I'm not sure what the motives of the creator of this atc were 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.830
 it was not widely distributed so presumably it was not for a profit 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.520
 monetary 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.220
 and it was very well done to be alternative it seems that he was 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.180
 trying to convey a message 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.259
 It seems that I am the only one who received this message 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.750
 I'm not completely sure what it was 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.699
 the inevitability of death 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.830
 the little sense of it 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.850
 or maybe he was just trying to morbidly add death 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.849
 and dark in a children's game 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.459
 Anyway, this children's game made me think and made me cry
