00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
the one piece of advice that I would

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.550 
the one piece of advice that I would
give<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.000> company<00:00:03.449> that's<00:00:03.659> still<00:00:03.899> running<00:00:04.259> XP

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
give a company that's still running XP

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.639 
give a company that's still running XP
is<00:00:05.009> they<00:00:05.400> they<00:00:05.819> need<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.509> think<00:00:06.960> about<00:00:07.140> this

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
is they they need to think about this

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.350 
is they they need to think about this
issue<00:00:08.010> now<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.269> date<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:09.870> out<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.679> 2014<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:12.150> far

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.900 
issue now the date is out in 2014 as far
as<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> end<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.900> support<00:00:13.349> but<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.250> doesn't

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
as the end of support but that doesn't

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.970 
as the end of support but that doesn't
mean<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.420> wait<00:00:15.719> until<00:00:16.020> then<00:00:16.500> you've<00:00:16.680> got

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
mean you can wait until then you've got

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.820 
mean you can wait until then you've got
to<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.490> about<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:18.029> now<00:00:18.060> make<00:00:18.930> sure<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
to think about it now make sure that you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.910 
to think about it now make sure that you
are<00:00:20.810> investigating<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.380> needs<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.890> done

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
are investigating what needs to be done

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.769 
are investigating what needs to be done
and<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.670> started<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> actual

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and you get started with the actual

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.200

the fear there is that you could run out
