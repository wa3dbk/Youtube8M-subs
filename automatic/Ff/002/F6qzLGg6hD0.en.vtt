00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.980 
piece for cube like this you will make
something<00:00:17.990> like<00:00:18.199> this<00:00:18.470> from<00:00:18.710> this<00:00:18.980> board

know you made the box then you're going

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.169 
know you made the box then you're going
to<00:00:51.499> get<00:00:51.920> nine<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.550> these<00:00:52.699> boxes<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.920> we

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
to get nine of these boxes I we

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.459 
to get nine of these boxes I we
collected<00:00:56.179> them<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:56.979> build<00:00:57.979> hit<00:00:58.190> them<00:00:58.399> up<00:00:58.429> I

collected them and build hit them up I

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.639 
collected them and build hit them up I
was<00:01:00.469> not<00:01:00.769> having<00:01:01.010> much<00:01:01.190> time<00:01:01.489> in<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.539> video<00:01:02.929> so

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
was not having much time in the video so

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:12.760 
was not having much time in the video so
I<00:01:07.840> connected<00:01:08.840> them<00:01:08.990> up<00:01:09.370> for<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.940> see<00:01:11.770> there

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
I connected them up for you to see there

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.360 
I connected them up for you to see there
are<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.860> total<00:01:12.980> of<00:01:13.220> nine<00:01:13.280> boxes<00:01:18.190> now<00:01:19.190> that

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
are a total of nine boxes now that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.200 
are a total of nine boxes now that
suspect<00:01:19.790> know<00:01:20.270> what<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.200> going<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.410> do<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:22.210> to

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
suspect know what you going to do is to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:33.610 
suspect know what you going to do is to
tape<00:01:24.050> them<00:01:24.260> up<00:01:26.410> from<00:01:27.410> up<00:01:31.180> over<00:01:32.180> here<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.660> from

tape them up from up over here and from
the<00:01:33.800> sides<00:01:36.850> every<00:01:37.850> box<00:01:38.440> jovanotti<00:01:41.110> okay<00:01:42.110> then

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
the sides every box jovanotti okay then

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.690 
the sides every box jovanotti okay then
let's<00:01:42.470> tape<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:47.560> now<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.250> have<00:01:49.280> taped

other videos it is shown how to make
take<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.310> cube<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.180> paper<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:36.129> can<00:02:36.310> even<00:02:36.430> make

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
take a cube of paper you can even make

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.860 
take a cube of paper you can even make
that<00:02:37.000> or<00:02:37.620> use<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.920> boxes<00:02:39.519> like<00:02:39.670> these<00:02:39.909> but<00:02:40.719> you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that or use of boxes like these but you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.490 
that or use of boxes like these but you
have<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.349> get<00:02:41.500> 9<00:02:42.629> some<00:02:43.629> real<00:02:43.840> estates<00:02:44.230> eight

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
have to get 9 some real estates eight

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.970 
have to get 9 some real estates eight
but<00:02:45.400> it's<00:02:45.760> wrong<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.749> must<00:02:46.959> get<00:02:47.169> 9<00:02:47.409> or<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.859> will

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
but it's wrong you must get 9 or it will

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.699 
but it's wrong you must get 9 or it will
not<00:02:48.250> work<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:51.040> for<00:02:51.969> the<00:02:52.419> part<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.469> are<00:02:53.500> going

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
not work now for the part you are going

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.629 
not work now for the part you are going
to<00:02:53.769> connect<00:02:54.099> them<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.980> should<00:02:57.189> first<00:02:57.430> make

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
to connect them you should first make

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:15.690 
to connect them you should first make
this<00:02:57.969> formation

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.550 

this<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.569> formation<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.349> are<00:03:17.410> going

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
this is the formation that you are going

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.369 
this is the formation that you are going
to<00:03:17.650> work<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.540> connect<00:03:19.870> all<00:03:20.110> these

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
to work on you have to connect all these

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.320 
to work on you have to connect all these
boxes<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:21.280> these<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:24.310> for<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.940> connection

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
boxes like these now for the connection

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.390 
boxes like these now for the connection
part<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:27.370> must<00:03:27.580> connect<00:03:27.849> it<00:03:27.970> from<00:03:28.239> one<00:03:29.400> outer

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
part we must connect it from one outer

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.990 
part we must connect it from one outer
side<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:30.910> okay<00:03:31.900> then<00:03:32.050> this<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.380> formation

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
side and okay then this is the formation

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.309 
side and okay then this is the formation
we<00:03:34.000> are<00:03:34.090> going<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.300> put<00:03:34.510> these<00:03:34.660> boxes<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.200> this

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
we are going to put these boxes in this

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.559 
we are going to put these boxes in this
formation<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.459> what<00:03:36.790> you're<00:03:36.970> going<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.209> do<00:03:37.330> is

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
formation and what you're going to do is

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.809 
formation and what you're going to do is
to<00:03:38.970> tape<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.180> from<00:03:40.420> here<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.870> from<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.700> inner

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819
