00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
and that's cuz it's awkward to play and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.470 
and that's cuz it's awkward to play and
it's<00:03:32.470> weird<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.100> look<00:03:33.250> at<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.730> grapple<00:03:34.450> with

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
it's weird to look at a grapple with

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.690 
it's weird to look at a grapple with
this<00:03:34.660> bizarre<00:03:35.020> system<00:03:35.830> that's<00:03:36.070> based<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.490> like

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
this bizarre system that's based on like

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.210 
this bizarre system that's based on like
like<00:03:37.360> who<00:03:37.660> hit<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.050> button<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.440> first<00:03:38.709> which

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
like who hit the button is first which

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.770 
like who hit the button is first which
means<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.520> which<00:03:39.880> means<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.180> go<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.360> walk<00:03:40.570> up

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
means you which means you go to walk up

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.990 
means you which means you go to walk up
and<00:03:40.989> you're<00:03:41.560> not<00:03:41.709> pounding<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.400> buttons<00:03:42.790> to

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
and you're not pounding the buttons to

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.640 
and you're not pounding the buttons to
win<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.300> grapple<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.930> your<00:03:44.080> move<00:03:44.290> you

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
win the grapple and do your move you

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.080 
win the grapple and do your move you
just<00:03:44.830> have<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.070> push<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.430> buttons<00:03:45.730> first

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
just have to push the buttons first

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.150 
just have to push the buttons first
which<00:03:46.900> would<00:03:47.260> mean<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.500> it's<00:03:47.770> based<00:03:47.980> on

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
which would mean that it's based on

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.460 
which would mean that it's based on
timing<00:03:48.520> I<00:03:48.850> guess<00:03:49.180> but<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:50.020> thing<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.440> have

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
timing I guess but the thing is you have

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.070 
timing I guess but the thing is you have
no<00:03:50.770> idea<00:03:50.800> what<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.520> timing<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:52.150> like<00:03:52.660> like<00:03:52.959> you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
no idea what the timing is like like you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.229 
no idea what the timing is like like you
don't<00:03:53.260> know<00:03:53.350> when<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> start<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.160> it's<00:03:54.970> it's

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
don't know when the start is it's it's

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.270 
don't know when the start is it's it's
kind<00:03:55.420> of<00:03:55.450> like<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.660> deaf<00:03:55.900> guy<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.590> an<00:03:56.800> Old<00:03:57.040> West

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.949 
kind of like a deaf guy in an Old West
shootout<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:58.270> if<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.450> can't<00:03:58.660> hear<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
shootout but if you can't hear the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.620
