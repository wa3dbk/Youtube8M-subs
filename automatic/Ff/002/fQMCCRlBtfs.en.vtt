biceps we're gonna do an exercise called

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
biceps we're gonna do an exercise called
21s<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:04.920> involves<00:01:05.280> three<00:01:05.610> portions<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
21s which involves three portions to the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.590 
21s which involves three portions to the
movement<00:01:07.700> first<00:01:08.700> part<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> contraction

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
movement first part of the contraction

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
movement first part of the contraction
it's<00:01:09.869> 50%<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> contraction<00:01:11.159> you're<00:01:11.369> gonna

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it's 50% of the contraction you're gonna

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's 50% of the contraction you're gonna
do<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.880> seven

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
do that for seven

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.990 
do that for seven
the<00:01:14.350> second<00:01:14.770> part<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.130> movement<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.640> the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
the second part of the movement is the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.510 
the second part of the movement is the
top<00:01:16.210> contraction<00:01:16.780> part<00:01:16.990> that<00:01:17.350> upper<00:01:17.830> 50%<00:01:18.430> of

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
top contraction part that upper 50% of

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.490 
top contraction part that upper 50% of
the<00:01:18.610> contraction<00:01:19.060> for<00:01:19.570> seven<00:01:19.900> and<00:01:20.080> then

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
the contraction for seven and then

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.750 
the contraction for seven and then
you're<00:01:20.620> going<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.800> complete<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.520> movement

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
you're going to complete the movement

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.330 
you're going to complete the movement
with<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.420> full<00:01:22.720> range<00:01:22.960> for<00:01:23.500> an<00:01:23.890> additional

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
with the full range for an additional

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.910 
with the full range for an additional
seven<00:01:24.730> hence<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.300> 21<00:01:25.780> we're<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:26.680> start

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
seven hence the 21 we're going to start

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.000 
seven hence the 21 we're going to start
out<00:01:27.010> with<00:01:27.190> 30<00:01:27.460> pound<00:01:27.700> dumbbells<00:01:28.860> we're<00:01:29.860> going

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
out with 30 pound dumbbells we're going

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.920 
out with 30 pound dumbbells we're going
to<00:01:30.070> use<00:01:30.160> as<00:01:30.310> little<00:01:30.490> rest<00:01:30.820> as<00:01:31.000> possible<00:01:31.060> get

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
to use as little rest as possible get

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.710 
to use as little rest as possible get
down<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.350> twenty<00:01:32.620> fives<00:01:32.800> 20s<00:01:33.490> 15<00:01:34.390> s<00:01:34.570> and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
down to the twenty fives 20s 15 s and

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.520 
down to the twenty fives 20s 15 s and
10's<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.540> first<00:01:37.690> start<00:01:37.960> out<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.380> not

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
10's when you first start out it's not

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.410 
10's when you first start out it's not
that<00:01:38.740> tough<00:01:38.979> especially<00:01:39.880> with<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.030> 50<00:01:40.390> percent

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
that tough especially with a 50 percent

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.180 
that tough especially with a 50 percent
contraction<00:01:40.990> movement<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.650> not<00:01:41.800> that<00:01:42.010> heavy

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
contraction movement and not that heavy

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.890 
contraction movement and not that heavy
but<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.150> start<00:01:43.390> getting<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> little<00:01:43.720> bit

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
but as you start getting a little bit

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.600 
but as you start getting a little bit
further<00:01:44.140> even<00:01:44.800> as<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.010> weights<00:01:45.190> come<00:01:45.400> down

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
further even as the weights come down

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.010
