00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
for their slime cube so you can see

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.410 
for their slime cube so you can see
there's<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.590> clear<00:01:35.040> outer<00:01:35.280> shell<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.150> then

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
there's a clear outer shell and then

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
there's a clear outer shell and then
there's<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> solid<00:01:37.259> green<00:01:37.880> cube<00:01:38.880> inside

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
there's like a solid green cube inside

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.889 
there's like a solid green cube inside
the<00:01:40.110> face<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.250> obviously<00:01:42.240> painted<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> top

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
emotion when you know when you move a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.840 
emotion when you know when you move a
jello<00:01:52.470> around<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.159> yeah<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
jello around but yeah it's here and
inside<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:55.079> hollow<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.159> guess<00:01:56.340> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
inside it's it's hollow so I guess it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.910 
inside it's it's hollow so I guess it's
just<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.439> like<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:59.210> like<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> four<00:02:00.600> sided

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
just like a like a like a four sided

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.429 
just like a like a like a four sided
cube<00:02:01.920> solid<00:02:02.549> cube<00:02:02.850> inside<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.659> pre

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
cube solid cube inside but it's pre

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.990 
cube solid cube inside but it's pre
hollow<00:02:04.619> inside<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.250> didn't<00:02:05.549> bother<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hollow inside they didn't bother to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.570 
hollow inside they didn't bother to
paint<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> maybe<00:02:06.799> but<00:02:07.799> yeah<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.310> for

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
paint that maybe but yeah that's it for

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.270 
paint that maybe but yeah that's it for
these<00:02:08.729> three<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.599> cube<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> most<00:02:10.280> so

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
these three I like the cube the most so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
these three I like the cube the most so
I'm<00:02:11.370> gonna<00:02:11.610> recommend<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.270> because<00:02:12.510> that's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
I'm gonna recommend this because that's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.970 
I'm gonna recommend this because that's
the<00:02:12.810> one<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.959> picked<00:02:13.140> up<00:02:13.319> obviously

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the one I picked up obviously

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.339 
the one I picked up obviously
unlike<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.090> other<00:02:15.239> three<00:02:15.360> they're<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
unlike the other three they're not that

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.360 
unlike the other three they're not that
cool<00:02:17.010> compared<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.879> one<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:20.010> if<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.310> get

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
cool compared to this one but if I get

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.410 
cool compared to this one but if I get
them<00:02:20.640> discount<00:02:21.569> maybe<00:02:21.780> I'll<00:02:21.989> pick<00:02:22.170> them<00:02:22.349> up<00:02:22.500> um

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
them discount maybe I'll pick them up um

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.520 
them discount maybe I'll pick them up um
probably<00:02:24.420> down<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> line<00:02:24.959> they'll<00:02:25.140> get<00:02:25.349> some

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
probably down the line they'll get some

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.619 
probably down the line they'll get some
repaints<00:02:26.069> or<00:02:26.190> something<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:26.819> it's<00:02:27.420> whatever

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
repaints or something but it's whatever
