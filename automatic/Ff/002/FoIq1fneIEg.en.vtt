what's<00:00:02.700> up<00:00:03.030> everybody<00:00:03.510> it's<00:00:03.990> sir<00:00:04.200> blaze<00:00:04.440> Moore

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
what's up everybody it's sir blaze Moore

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.860 
what's up everybody it's sir blaze Moore
and<00:00:05.040> today<00:00:05.549> I'm<00:00:05.730> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.089> going<00:00:06.390> over<00:00:06.720> how

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
and today I'm going to be going over how

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.980 
and today I'm going to be going over how
to<00:00:06.930> build<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.740> ultra<00:00:08.160> ramp<00:00:08.599> I've<00:00:09.599> kind<00:00:09.870> of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
to build the ultra ramp I've kind of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.169 
to build the ultra ramp I've kind of
covered<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.920> few<00:00:11.160> tutorials<00:00:11.340> already

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
covered this in a few tutorials already

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.419 
covered this in a few tutorials already
but<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> figured<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.590> would<00:00:13.620> make<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.950> separate

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
but I figured I would make a separate

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.340 
but I figured I would make a separate
video<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.299> case<00:00:15.480> anybody<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.109> still

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
video just in case anybody was still

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.580 
video just in case anybody was still
unfamiliar<00:00:16.949> or<00:00:17.369> new<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.150> creating<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
unfamiliar or new to creating and just

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
unfamiliar or new to creating and just
wanted<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.980> know<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.310> build<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.850> type<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
wanted to know how to build this type of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.070 
wanted to know how to build this type of
ramp<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.810> particular<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:24.570> basically<00:00:24.960> all

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
ramp in particular so basically all

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.480 
ramp in particular so basically all
you're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.890> you're<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.960 
you're going to do is you're going to
use<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.880> small<00:00:27.180> ramp<00:00:28.310> place<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.519> wherever<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
use the small ramp place it wherever you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.659 
use the small ramp place it wherever you
want<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.980> then<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> switch

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
want and then you're going to switch

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.639 
want and then you're going to switch
you're<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> push<00:00:33.750> left<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> d-pad

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
you're going to push left on the d-pad

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.389 
you're going to push left on the d-pad
and<00:00:35.010> go<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:35.940> machine<00:00:36.329> electrical<00:00:37.110> box

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
and go to your machine electrical box

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.250 
and go to your machine electrical box
place<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> down<00:00:38.790> pick<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.360> you're<00:00:40.079> just

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
place that down pick it up you're just

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.569 
place that down pick it up you're just
going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.559> want<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.739> put<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> end

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
going to want to put it right on the end

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.760 
going to want to put it right on the end
and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.840> you're<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> hit<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.620> on

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and then you're going to hit right on

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.760 
and then you're going to hit right on
the<00:00:43.890> d-pad<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:45.480> want<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:45.870> lined<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.940> and

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
the d-pad you want to get lined up and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.040 
the d-pad you want to get lined up and
then<00:00:49.770> basically<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
then basically just go back to this and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
then basically just go back to this and
press<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> d-pad<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.250> press<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.699> at

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
press right on the d-pad and press I at

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
press right on the d-pad and press I at
the<00:00:53.910> same<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:55.379> keep<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.770> back<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the same time just keep going back and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.119 
the same time just keep going back and
forth<00:00:56.219> until<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> stick<00:00:58.129> just

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
forth until you get it to stick just

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
forth until you get it to stick just
like<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.020> you're<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
like that and then you're just going to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.609 
like that and then you're just going to
continue<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.219> process<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:03.229> four<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.350> five

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
continue this process for four or five

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.090 
continue this process for four or five
ramps<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.810> then<00:01:06.810> once<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.680> about

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
ramps and then once you get up to about

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.820 
ramps and then once you get up to about
the<00:01:08.400> sixth<00:01:08.790> ramp<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.240> believe<00:01:09.619> we'll<00:01:10.619> use<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the sixth ramp I believe we'll use a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.480 
the sixth ramp I believe we'll use a
little<00:01:11.220> bit<00:01:11.400> different<00:01:11.850> method<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.310> like

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
little bit different method so just like

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.760 
little bit different method so just like
that<00:01:14.659> just<00:01:15.659> keep<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.710> depending<00:01:19.710> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that just keep on going and depending on

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.350 
that just keep on going and depending on
the<00:01:19.950> type<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> ramp<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> build

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the type of ramp that you want to build

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
the type of ramp that you want to build
sometimes<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> don't<00:01:22.290> need<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> build<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.070> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
sometimes you don't need to build it so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.620 
sometimes you don't need to build it so
high<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> show<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> guys<00:01:24.570> how

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
high I'm just going to show you guys how

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.200 
high I'm just going to show you guys how
to<00:01:24.840> build<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.979> maximum<00:01:26.580> height<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.030> can

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to build it the maximum height you can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.080 
to build it the maximum height you can
build<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:29.250> technically<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.970> know

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
build like this but technically you know

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.359 
build like this but technically you know
you<00:01:30.150> could<00:01:30.420> take<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> few<00:01:30.810> off<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you could take a few off and then you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.910 
you could take a few off and then you
would<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.700> further<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.049> ramp<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.650> so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
would go further off the ramp and not so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.510 
would go further off the ramp and not so
high<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.430> vertical<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> let's<00:01:38.310> keep<00:01:38.460> going

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
high and vertical so let's keep going

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.700 
high and vertical so let's keep going
here

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.030 

you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.430 

so<00:01:54.550> I'll<00:01:54.880> take<00:01:55.120> this<00:01:55.330> time<00:01:55.660> I'm<00:01:56.020> going<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.290> show

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
so I'll take this time I'm going to show

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.460 
so I'll take this time I'm going to show
you<00:01:56.470> guys<00:01:56.710> how<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.070> smooth<00:01:57.580> out<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.030> bottom<00:01:58.470> so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
you guys how to smooth out the bottom so

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.500 
you guys how to smooth out the bottom so
if<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.650> look<00:01:59.800> at<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.130> one<00:02:00.370> you<00:02:00.640> can<00:02:01.300> kind<00:02:01.480> of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
if you look at this one you can kind of

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.450 
if you look at this one you can kind of
see<00:02:01.720> how<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.900> first<00:02:02.200> three<00:02:02.560> ramps<00:02:02.980> are<00:02:03.130> on<00:02:03.220> top

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
see how the first three ramps are on top

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.220 
see how the first three ramps are on top
of<00:02:03.490> each<00:02:03.760> other<00:02:03.910> and<00:02:04.180> there's<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.540> bit<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:05.020> lip

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
of each other and there's a bit of a lip

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.670 
of each other and there's a bit of a lip
there<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:07.240> will<00:02:07.450> sometimes<00:02:07.900> cause<00:02:08.200> certain

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
there that will sometimes cause certain

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.100 
there that will sometimes cause certain
cars<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.220> smack<00:02:09.520> into<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.330> people<00:02:10.780> get

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
cars to smack into it and people get

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.620 
cars to smack into it and people get
really<00:02:11.260> pissed<00:02:11.500> off<00:02:12.240> here<00:02:13.240> I've<00:02:13.420> already

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
really pissed off here I've already

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.840 
really pissed off here I've already
smooth<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.350> smoothed<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.100> out<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.730> can

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
smooth that smoothed it out and you can

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.940 
smooth that smoothed it out and you can
tell<00:02:16.330> how<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> ramps<00:02:17.050> go<00:02:17.200> into<00:02:17.590> each<00:02:17.710> other

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
tell how the ramps go into each other

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.700 
tell how the ramps go into each other
and<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:19.330> makes<00:02:19.600> for<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> much<00:02:20.080> smoother<00:02:20.470> ramp

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
and that makes for a much smoother ramp

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.590 
and that makes for a much smoother ramp
so<00:02:21.520> let<00:02:21.610> me<00:02:21.670> show<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:21.910> how<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.060> do<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.450> real

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
so let me show you how you do that real

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.000 
so let me show you how you do that real
quick<00:02:22.840> basically<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.560> need<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
quick basically you just need to do it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.670 
quick basically you just need to do it
to<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> first<00:02:24.580> three<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.290> want<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.500> pick

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
to the first three so you want to pick

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.150 
to the first three so you want to pick
up<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.950> third<00:02:27.190> ramp<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.710> swing

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
up the third ramp just like that swing

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.410 
up the third ramp just like that swing
your<00:02:30.310> camera<00:02:30.700> around<00:02:30.970> like<00:02:31.240> this<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:34.150> lined

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
your camera around like this get lined

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.450 
your camera around like this get lined
up<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:36.670> want<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.000> barely<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:39.310> want

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
up and you just want to barely just want

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.840 
up and you just want to barely just want
to<00:02:39.520> barely<00:02:39.760> see<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:41.010> lip<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.250> ramp<00:02:42.400> like

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
to barely see the lip of the ramp like

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.030 
to barely see the lip of the ramp like
that<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:44.080> then<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.440> switch<00:02:44.770> glitch

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
that and then you just switch glitch

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.970 
that and then you just switch glitch
again<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:46.560> voila

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
again and voila

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.370 
again and voila
then<00:02:48.100> it's<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.490> smooth<00:02:48.880> ramp<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.230> even

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
then it's a smooth ramp and you can even

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.810 
then it's a smooth ramp and you can even
pull<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.800> down<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.220> bit<00:02:51.370> further<00:02:51.640> than

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
pull it down a little bit further than

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.600 
pull it down a little bit further than
that<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.300> like<00:02:52.450> mine<00:02:52.750> like<00:02:52.959> that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
that I like mine like that

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that I like mine like that
and<00:02:54.610> then<00:02:54.700> you're<00:02:54.850> going<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.060> want<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.300> just<00:02:55.480> go

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
and then you're going to want to just go

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.100 
and then you're going to want to just go
back<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.050> pick<00:02:56.200> up<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.500> second<00:02:56.920> ramp<00:02:57.750> oops<00:02:58.750> if

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
back and pick up the second ramp oops if

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.090 
back and pick up the second ramp oops if
you<00:02:59.230> pick<00:02:59.440> up<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.709> wrong<00:02:59.860> ramp<00:03:00.190> just<00:03:00.489> hit<00:03:00.640> b2

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
you pick up the wrong ramp just hit b2

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:20.240 
you pick up the wrong ramp just hit b2
to<00:03:03.100> replace<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.209> back<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.540> where<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.780> was

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.100 

all<00:03:21.250> right<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.879> then<00:03:22.239> just<00:03:22.450> pick<00:03:22.599> up<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.930> last

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
all right and then just pick up the last

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:42.690 
all right and then just pick up the last
one<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.690> want<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:25.989> do<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.260> same<00:03:26.470> thing

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.770 

close<00:03:43.700> enough<00:03:43.970> there<00:03:44.330> we<00:03:44.450> go

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
close enough there we go

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.230 
close enough there we go
so<00:03:45.050> now<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.260> got<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.470> smooth<00:03:45.920> run<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.520> there<00:03:46.790> no

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
so now you got a smooth run up there no

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.140 
so now you got a smooth run up there no
cars<00:03:47.480> are<00:03:47.690> going<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.870> get<00:03:48.050> glitched<00:03:48.320> on<00:03:48.530> that

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
cars are going to get glitched on that

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.120 
cars are going to get glitched on that
and<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:51.020> said<00:03:51.080> once<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.650> get<00:03:51.830> to<00:03:52.010> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
and like I said once you get to the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.160 
and like I said once you get to the
seventh<00:03:52.550> ramp<00:03:52.850> you're<00:03:53.660> not<00:03:53.810> going<00:03:53.960> to<00:03:54.020> be<00:03:54.110> able

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
seventh ramp you're not going to be able

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.410 
seventh ramp you're not going to be able
to<00:03:54.320> use<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.590> machine<00:03:54.920> box<00:03:55.130> anymore<00:03:55.520> which

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
to use the machine box anymore which

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.600 
to use the machine box anymore which
you're<00:03:56.570> going<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.720> want<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:56.930> do<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.950> select<00:03:58.340> a

you're going to want to do is select a

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.550 
you're going to want to do is select a
small<00:03:58.910> ramp<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.480> press<00:03:59.810> right<00:04:00.170> on<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.440> d-pad

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
small ramp and press right on the d-pad

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.540 
small ramp and press right on the d-pad
go<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.430> your<00:04:01.580> signs<00:04:01.990> go<00:04:02.990> down<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.650> switch<00:04:04.220> to

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
go to your signs go down and switch to

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.100 
go to your signs go down and switch to
the<00:04:04.580> right<00:04:06.130> Chevron<00:04:07.130> sign<00:04:07.780> place<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.960> down

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
the right Chevron sign place it down

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.820 
the right Chevron sign place it down
pick<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.440> up

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
pick it up

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.620 
pick it up
and<00:04:09.920> you'll<00:04:10.340> be<00:04:10.490> able<00:04:10.550> to<00:04:10.730> place<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:11.300> on<00:04:11.600> the

and you'll be able to place this on the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.880 
and you'll be able to place this on the
end<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.140> ramp<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:13.330> just<00:04:14.330> like<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.890> and

process<00:04:30.230> so<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.130> little<00:04:31.280> bit<00:04:31.630> more

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
process so it's a little bit more

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.350 
process so it's a little bit more
arduous<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:34.220> can<00:04:34.430> be<00:04:34.550> done<00:04:34.700> and<00:04:35.030> you'll

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
arduous but it can be done and you'll

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.680 
arduous but it can be done and you'll
get<00:04:35.480> better<00:04:35.690> at<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:36.080> with<00:04:36.110> time<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:37.640> you<00:04:38.630> just

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
get better at it with time and you just

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.250 
get better at it with time and you just
keep<00:04:39.020> doing<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:40.780> switch<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.990> your<00:04:42.110> right

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
keep doing that switch to your right

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.490 
keep doing that switch to your right
Chevron<00:04:47.410> boom

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
Chevron boom

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.310 
Chevron boom
so<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.070> think<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.880> think<00:04:51.330> that's<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.840> let<00:04:51.990> me<00:04:52.050> see

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
so I think I think that's it let me see

if you can put one more on there might

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:04.510 
if you can put one more on there might
be<00:04:55.680> able<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.920> put<00:04:56.070> one<00:04:56.220> more
