00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.259 

for<00:00:05.690> me<00:00:05.810> frogs<00:00:06.650> on<00:00:07.010> the<00:00:07.070> move<00:00:07.400> is<00:00:07.759> the<00:00:08.000> first

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
for me frogs on the move is the first

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.759 
for me frogs on the move is the first
sign<00:00:08.540> of<00:00:08.570> spring

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.320 

if<00:00:12.769> you<00:00:12.889> ever<00:00:12.980> come<00:00:13.280> across<00:00:13.369> a<00:00:13.549> pond<00:00:13.969> that's

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
if you ever come across a pond that's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.540 
if you ever come across a pond that's
full<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:14.690> spawn<00:00:15.110> when<00:00:15.650> you<00:00:15.740> probably<00:00:16.160> missed

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
full of spawn when you probably missed

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.760 
full of spawn when you probably missed
the<00:00:16.730> event<00:00:16.849> when<00:00:17.359> that<00:00:17.539> spawn<00:00:17.930> was<00:00:18.199> created

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.529 

the<00:00:21.770> trick<00:00:22.099> is<00:00:22.340> to<00:00:22.400> get<00:00:22.880> there<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.329> little

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
the trick is to get there a little

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.319 
the trick is to get there a little
earlier<00:00:24.199> than<00:00:24.410> usual<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:25.189> then<00:00:25.640> this<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.150> what

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
earlier than usual and then this is what

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.089 
earlier than usual and then this is what
you'll<00:00:26.539> see<00:00:28.509> male<00:00:29.509> frogs<00:00:30.050> tend<00:00:30.439> to<00:00:30.560> gather<00:00:30.800> in

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
you'll see male frogs tend to gather in

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.880 
you'll see male frogs tend to gather in
pools<00:00:31.550> around<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.660> first<00:00:32.960> mild<00:00:33.410> day<00:00:33.710> in

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
pools around the first mild day in

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.590 
pools around the first mild day in
February<00:00:34.370> depending<00:00:35.059> on<00:00:35.120> where<00:00:35.269> you<00:00:35.360> are<00:00:35.390> in

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it starts earlier in the south and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.070 
it starts earlier in the south and
gradually<00:00:44.640> moves<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.420> source<00:00:45.630> of<00:00:45.750> wave
