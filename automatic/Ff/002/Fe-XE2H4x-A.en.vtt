00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
other a lot of controversy in my opinion

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.030 
other a lot of controversy in my opinion
I<00:02:25.340> thought<00:02:25.810> Tyrone<00:02:26.810> could<00:02:27.019> have<00:02:27.110> continued<00:02:27.830> I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
I thought Tyrone could have continued I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.180 
I thought Tyrone could have continued I
don't<00:02:28.640> think<00:02:28.849> you<00:02:28.970> should<00:02:29.000> have<00:02:29.299> been<00:02:29.420> stopped

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
don't think you should have been stopped

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.280 
don't think you should have been stopped
so<00:02:31.190> it's<00:02:31.370> going<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.519> be<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.700> great<00:02:31.970> rematch<00:02:32.540> my

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so it's going to be a great rematch my

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.020 
so it's going to be a great rematch my
prediction<00:02:33.590> for<00:02:33.799> this<00:02:34.069> fight<00:02:34.340> though<00:02:34.579> I<00:02:34.610> think

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
prediction for this fight though I think

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.170 
prediction for this fight though I think
Tyrone<00:02:35.810> Spong<00:02:35.959> has<00:02:36.470> really<00:02:37.340> elevated<00:02:38.030> his
