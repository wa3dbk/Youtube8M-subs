there<00:01:56.390> well<00:01:56.780> as<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.929> matter<00:01:57.079> of<00:01:57.170> fact<00:01:57.409> Tim

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
there well as a matter of fact Tim

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.260 
there well as a matter of fact Tim
sometimes<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.340> not<00:01:58.460> enough<00:01:58.670> space<00:01:58.969> between

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
sometimes it's not enough space between

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.169 
sometimes it's not enough space between
the<00:01:59.929> existing<00:02:00.200> grass<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.729> plants<00:02:02.119> that

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
the existing grass and the plants that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.480 
the existing grass and the plants that
are<00:02:02.329> in<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.509> bed<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.649> use<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.009> edge<00:02:04.189> prep

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
are in the bed so we use this edge prep

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.249 
are in the bed so we use this edge prep
machine<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.119> machine<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.479> preps<00:02:05.960> the

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
machine it's a machine that preps the

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.290 
machine it's a machine that preps the
edge<00:02:06.439> ready<00:02:07.159> for<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.460> curbing<00:02:07.819> it<00:02:07.909> removes

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
edge ready for the curbing it removes

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.969 
edge ready for the curbing it removes
the<00:02:08.510> sod<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.780> hardens<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.500> ground<00:02:09.740> as<00:02:09.890> it

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
the sod and hardens the ground as it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.740 
the sod and hardens the ground as it
goes<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.610> tempts<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.060> ground<00:02:11.270> down<00:02:11.510> as<00:02:11.630> it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
goes so it tempts the ground down as it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.110 
goes so it tempts the ground down as it
goes<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.320> we<00:02:12.890> can<00:02:13.010> remove<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.400> section<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.880> side

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
goes and we can remove a section of side

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.350 
goes and we can remove a section of side
of

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.880

the width of the curving about nine

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.920 
the width of the curving about nine
inches<00:02:16.100> wide<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.330> curbing<00:02:17.660> will<00:02:17.750> fit

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
inches wide and the curbing will fit

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.390 
inches wide and the curbing will fit
right<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.290> there<00:02:18.470> when<00:02:18.560> we're<00:02:18.680> done<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
right in there when we're done so you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.280 
right in there when we're done so you
literally<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.300> know<00:02:20.420> I've<00:02:20.600> seen<00:02:20.900> some<00:02:21.170> of

literally you know I've seen some of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.080 
literally you know I've seen some of
these<00:02:21.380> goofy<00:02:21.860> companies<00:02:22.370> they'll<00:02:22.700> put<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
these goofy companies they'll put the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.730 
these goofy companies they'll put the
curving<00:02:23.510> down<00:02:23.540> right<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:24.080> top<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.470> grass

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
curving down right on top of the grass

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.730 
curving down right on top of the grass
that<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:25.280> isn't<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.910> guys<00:02:26.090> do<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.390> know

that that isn't what you guys do I know

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.020 
that that isn't what you guys do I know
absolutely<00:02:27.740> correct<00:02:28.100> Tim<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.490> can't<00:02:28.700> put<00:02:28.940> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
absolutely correct Tim you can't put the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.640 
absolutely correct Tim you can't put the
curving<00:02:29.390> over<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.660> grass<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.170> grass<00:02:30.200> would

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
curving over the grass the grass would

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.350 
curving over the grass the grass would
rot<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.160> curbing<00:02:31.460> would<00:02:31.580> sink<00:02:31.850> later<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
rot in the curbing would sink later and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
rot in the curbing would sink later and
crack<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:32.990> we<00:02:33.230> want<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.590> down<00:02:33.770> below<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
crack so we want to get down below the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.920 
crack so we want to get down below the
grass<00:02:34.490> below<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.090> roots<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.600> machine

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
grass below the roots and this machine

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.630 
grass below the roots and this machine
is<00:02:36.050> designed<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.280> makes<00:02:37.460> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
is designed to do just that it makes the

is designed to do just that it makes the
job<00:02:37.670> easy<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.480> our<00:02:39.050> people<00:02:39.260> can<00:02:39.410> bring<00:02:39.680> it

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
job easy so our people can bring it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.540 
job easy so our people can bring it
around<00:02:40.010> there

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
around there

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.280 
around there
prep<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.120> ground<00:02:41.360> very<00:02:41.570> quickly<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.170> easily

prep the ground very quickly and easily

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.870 
prep the ground very quickly and easily
and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:42.860> when<00:02:42.980> you'll<00:02:43.220> see<00:02:43.400> later<00:02:43.640> on<00:02:43.760> when

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
and then when you'll see later on when

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.030 
and then when you'll see later on when
we've<00:02:44.120> done<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.600> how<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.350> can<00:02:45.560> lay<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.830> curb

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
we've done this how we can lay the curb

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.500 
we've done this how we can lay the curb
straight<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.640> trench<00:02:46.880> right<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
straight into that trench right on the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.660 
straight into that trench right on the
raw<00:02:47.660> ground<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.530> when<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:48.860> mix<00:02:49.010> concrete<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.610> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
raw ground so when we mix concrete in a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.510 
raw ground so when we mix concrete in a
concrete<00:02:49.880> mixer<00:02:50.420> we<00:02:50.600> have<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:51.200> coarse<00:02:51.650> sand<00:02:52.250> and

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
concrete mixer we have a coarse sand and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.510 
concrete mixer we have a coarse sand and
cement<00:02:53.150> mixture<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.740> proprietary<00:02:55.010> mix

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
cement mixture it's a proprietary mix

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.220 
cement mixture it's a proprietary mix
which<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.880> teach<00:02:56.090> our<00:02:56.270> new<00:02:56.450> operators<00:02:56.959> today

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
which we teach our new operators today

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.020 
which we teach our new operators today
we<00:02:57.410> have<00:02:57.620> trainees<00:02:58.459> here<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:58.910> we're

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
we have trainees here that we're

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.780 
we have trainees here that we're
teaching<00:02:59.270> how<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.600> lay<00:02:59.810> curb<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:01.459> trainer

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
teaching how to lay curb and the trainer

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.330 
teaching how to lay curb and the trainer
is<00:03:02.150> teaching<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:03.350> process<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.100> first

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
is teaching the process so the first

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.430 
is teaching the process so the first
step<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.060> concrete<00:03:05.660> mix<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.080> mixed

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
step is that the concrete mix is mixed

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.199 
step is that the concrete mix is mixed
up<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:07.040> what<00:03:07.280> we<00:03:07.400> call<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.670> zero<00:03:07.820> slump

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
up and what we call the zero slump

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.820 
up and what we call the zero slump
mixture<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.930> deposit<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.500> into<00:03:09.800> a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
mixture and deposit it into a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.010 
mixture and deposit it into a
wheelbarrow<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.640> taken<00:03:11.330> over<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.810> job

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
wheelbarrow and taken over to the job

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.360 
wheelbarrow and taken over to the job
site<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.500> let's<00:03:12.650> go<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:12.860> have<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.040> look<00:03:13.130> at<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
site so let's go and have a look at the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.130 
site so let's go and have a look at the
edge<00:03:13.490> master<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.090> where<00:03:14.240> it's<00:03:14.360> working<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
edge master and where it's working the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.680 
edge master and where it's working the
next<00:03:15.260> step<00:03:15.560> after<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:17.150> lay<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.300> curb

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
next step after that is to lay the curb

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.199 
next step after that is to lay the curb
so<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.140> edge<00:03:18.410> master<00:03:18.920> machine<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.640> set<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.030> in

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
so the edge master machine is set up in

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.360 
so the edge master machine is set up in
the<00:03:20.570> trench<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.290> has<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> profile<00:03:22.010> attached

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
the trench it has a profile attached

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.520 
the trench it has a profile attached
that<00:03:22.850> allows<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.420> curb<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.900> extruded<00:03:24.440> in

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
that allows the curb to be extruded in

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.199 
that allows the curb to be extruded in
the<00:03:24.590> right<00:03:24.769> shape<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:25.280> we<00:03:25.400> want<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.760> we<00:03:26.030> will

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
the right shape that we want and we will

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.750 
the right shape that we want and we will
borrow<00:03:26.540> concrete<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.290> we've<00:03:27.470> mixed<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:28.730> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
borrow concrete that we've mixed to the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.360 
borrow concrete that we've mixed to the
Machine<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.420> feed<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.989> concrete<00:03:30.470> into<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
Machine and feed the concrete into the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.759 
Machine and feed the concrete into the
edge<00:03:31.760> master<00:03:32.239> machine<00:03:32.570> as<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.840> concrete<00:03:33.320> is<00:03:33.530> fed

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
edge master machine as a concrete is fed

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.949 
edge master machine as a concrete is fed
in<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.130> moves<00:03:34.370> forward<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.880> its<00:03:35.000> own<00:03:35.150> accord<00:03:35.630> as

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
in it moves forward of its own accord as

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.780 
in it moves forward of its own accord as
it<00:03:36.200> extrudes<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.830> concrete<00:03:37.250> out<00:03:37.340> through<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
it extrudes the concrete out through the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.810 
it extrudes the concrete out through the
profile<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.050> also<00:03:39.260> self<00:03:39.739> propelled<00:03:40.190> the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
profile so it's also self propelled the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.240 
profile so it's also self propelled the
operator<00:03:41.209> all<00:03:41.540> he<00:03:42.140> has<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.290> do<00:03:42.560> is<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.800> drive<00:03:43.040> it

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
operator all he has to do is to drive it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.850 
operator all he has to do is to drive it
by<00:03:43.400> steering<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:44.030> along<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.420> desired<00:03:44.780> path<00:03:45.110> so

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
by steering it along the desired path so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.530 
by steering it along the desired path so
he<00:03:45.920> makes<00:03:46.160> adjustments<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.940> height<00:03:47.209> with

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
he makes adjustments to height with

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.750 
he makes adjustments to height with
these<00:03:47.720> control<00:03:48.140> knobs<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.739> he<00:03:48.950> move

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
these control knobs and he move

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.479 
these control knobs and he move
and<00:03:49.970> allows<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.659> machine<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:51.310> work<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
and allows the machine to work the

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.759 
and allows the machine to work the
curbing<00:03:52.879> very<00:03:53.180> very<00:03:53.390> close<00:03:53.629> to<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.900> grass<00:03:54.140> but

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
curbing very very close to the grass but

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.589 
curbing very very close to the grass but
with<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:54.950> small<00:03:55.280> gap<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:56.060> make<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.329> easy<00:03:56.480> to

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
with a small gap to make it easy to

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.600 
with a small gap to make it easy to
trail<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.110> curb<00:03:57.319> later<00:03:57.620> once<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.189> curve<00:03:58.400> is

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
trail the curb later once the curve is

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.729 
trail the curb later once the curve is
in<00:03:58.939> place<00:03:59.239> sometimes<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.200> needs<00:04:00.349> a<00:04:00.500> slight

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
in place sometimes it needs a slight

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.920 
in place sometimes it needs a slight
adjustment<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.549> trail<00:04:01.879> it<00:04:02.060> with<00:04:02.209> a<00:04:02.239> hand

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
adjustment so we trail it with a hand

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.990 
adjustment so we trail it with a hand
trowel<00:04:03.260> by<00:04:03.799> passing<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.370> trail<00:04:04.670> over<00:04:04.909> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
trowel by passing that trail over the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.089 
trowel by passing that trail over the
surface<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.390> takes<00:04:05.599> out<00:04:05.810> any<00:04:05.989> humps<00:04:06.500> or<00:04:06.680> bumps

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
surface it takes out any humps or bumps

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.210 
surface it takes out any humps or bumps
or<00:04:07.280> any<00:04:07.400> small<00:04:07.940> imperfections<00:04:08.950> one<00:04:09.950> pass

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
or any small imperfections one pass

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.860 
or any small imperfections one pass
without<00:04:10.640> hand<00:04:10.849> trail<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.209> all<00:04:11.329> that's<00:04:11.510> usually

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
without hand trail is all that's usually

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.869 
without hand trail is all that's usually
required<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.980> finished<00:04:13.280> result<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.730> what

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
required and the finished result is what

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.060 
required and the finished result is what
you<00:04:13.909> see<00:04:14.030> here<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.450> beautiful<00:04:14.930> curb<00:04:15.409> that's

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
you see here a beautiful curb that's

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.340 
you see here a beautiful curb that's
laid<00:04:16.280> out<00:04:16.310> by<00:04:16.699> the<00:04:16.760> edge<00:04:17.000> master<00:04:17.419> machine<00:04:17.750> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
laid out by the edge master machine the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.469 
laid out by the edge master machine the
next<00:04:18.380> step<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.100> we<00:04:19.310> trim<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.609> excess<00:04:20.060> away<00:04:20.239> at

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
next step is we trim the excess away at

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.710 
next step is we trim the excess away at
the<00:04:20.600> base<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.109> curb<00:04:21.320> using<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.280> knife<00:04:22.760> we

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
the base of the curb using a knife we

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.180 
the base of the curb using a knife we
put<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.930> cut<00:04:24.169> at<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.380> front<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.710> curb<00:04:24.949> to

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
put a cut at the front of the curb to

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.159 
put a cut at the front of the curb to
allow<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.090> be<00:04:26.240> removed<00:04:26.660> later<00:04:26.960> the

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
allow that to be removed later the

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.680 
allow that to be removed later the
excess<00:04:27.530> material<00:04:27.740> at<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.669> base<00:04:28.880> with<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
excess material at the base with the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.330 
excess material at the base with the
finishing<00:04:30.169> process<00:04:30.320> it's<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.770> secret<00:04:31.130> process

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
finishing process it's a secret process

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.100 
finishing process it's a secret process
it's<00:04:31.699> something<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.180> we<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.449> patented<00:04:32.990> we

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
it's something that we have patented we

secret<00:04:42.440> but<00:04:43.070> we'll<00:04:43.220> show<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.430> what<00:04:43.639> it<00:04:43.729> looks

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
secret but we'll show you what it looks

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.570
