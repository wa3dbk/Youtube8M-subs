00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
huge problem right and not Bend and then

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
huge problem right and not Bend and then
remember<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> natural<00:01:15.150> resource<00:01:15.600> depletion

you can get a small soda for cheap I'm
just<00:02:16.210> saying<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.990> could<00:02:17.080> redirect<00:02:17.770> people<00:02:17.890> to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
sodas which are a huge problem in this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.410 
sodas which are a huge problem in this
case<00:02:20.920> if<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.580> only<00:02:21.610> town<00:02:21.970> doing<00:02:22.180> it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
case if this is the only town doing it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.030 
case if this is the only town doing it
there<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.870> think<00:02:22.990> that's<00:02:23.320> exactly<00:02:23.530> what<00:02:23.920> will

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
there I think that's exactly what will

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.070 
there I think that's exactly what will
happen<00:02:24.070> but<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.150> mean<00:02:25.420> they're<00:02:25.600> trying<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.870> set

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
happen but I mean they're trying to set

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.750 
happen but I mean they're trying to set
an<00:02:26.170> example<00:02:26.260> if<00:02:26.770> more<00:02:27.010> towns<00:02:27.250> start<00:02:27.520> doing

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
an example if more towns start doing

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.300 
an example if more towns start doing
this<00:02:27.880> these<00:02:28.480> gas<00:02:29.290> stations<00:02:29.740> these<00:02:29.890> companies

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
this these gas stations these companies

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.810 
this these gas stations these companies
will<00:02:30.490> start<00:02:30.670> buying<00:02:31.320> drinks<00:02:32.320> from

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
will start buying drinks from

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.220 
will start buying drinks from

whatever other things you know that hard

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.750 
whatever other things you know that hard
paper<00:02:38.230> cardboard<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.250> used<00:02:39.460> sometimes

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
paper cardboard that's used sometimes

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.940 
paper cardboard that's used sometimes
yeah<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.960> that's<00:02:41.320> how<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.530> that's<00:02:41.860> how<00:02:41.920> you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
yeah so that's how you that's how you

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.830 
yeah so that's how you that's how you
make<00:02:42.160> change<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.670> broader<00:02:42.940> question<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:43.600> ton

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
make change the broader question a ton

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.220 
make change the broader question a ton
is<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.380> what<00:02:44.620> level<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.510> minutia<00:02:46.510> should<00:02:47.080> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
is to what level of minutia should the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.650 
is to what level of minutia should the
government<00:02:47.590> be<00:02:47.830> involved<00:02:48.190> on<00:02:48.550> sizes<00:02:49.420> for

water bottles in Concord let's talk

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.650 
water bottles in Concord let's talk
about<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.550> slippery<00:02:54.910> slope<00:02:55.180> because<00:02:55.510> it's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
about the slippery slope because it's

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.510 
about the slippery slope because it's
probably<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.050> legitimate<00:02:56.740> question<00:02:57.100> here<00:02:57.310> to

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
probably a legitimate question here to

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.650 
probably a legitimate question here to
what<00:02:57.670> extent<00:02:58.000> should<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.209> government<00:02:58.480> be

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
what extent should the government be

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.720 
what extent should the government be
even<00:02:58.870> involved<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.350> this<00:02:59.500> well<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.280> mean<00:03:00.550> it's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
even involved in this well I mean it's

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.690 
even involved in this well I mean it's
hard<00:03:00.970> not<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:03.250> being<00:03:03.580> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
hard not to see just like this being a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.880 
hard not to see just like this being a
bland<00:03:04.060> position<00:03:04.750> because<00:03:05.050> if<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.350> problem<00:03:05.770> is

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
bland position because if the problem is

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.210 
bland position because if the problem is
plastic<00:03:06.400> bottles<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:08.350> doesn't<00:03:08.740> make<00:03:08.890> too<00:03:08.920> much

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
plastic bottles it doesn't make too much

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.460 
plastic bottles it doesn't make too much
sense<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.730> me<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.120> ban<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.900> ones<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.320> have

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
sense to me to ban the ones that have

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.530 
sense to me to ban the ones that have
the<00:03:11.650> least<00:03:11.860> plastic<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.760> as<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.180> allow<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
the least plastic and as you allow the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.600 
the least plastic and as you allow the
ones<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.170> most<00:03:14.440> plastic<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.220> two-liter
