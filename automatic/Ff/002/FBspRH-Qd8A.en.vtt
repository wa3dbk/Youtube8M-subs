a<00:01:55.720> way<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.870> communication<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.830> know<00:01:57.010> you're

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
a way of communication you know you're

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.220 
a way of communication you know you're
giving<00:01:57.760> someone<00:01:57.940> directions<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.750> how<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.960> do

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
giving someone directions on how to do

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.800 
giving someone directions on how to do
something<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.610> think<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:00.940> know<00:02:00.970> in<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.660> way

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
something and I think you know in a way

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.410 
something and I think you know in a way
it<00:02:02.020> does<00:02:02.410> help<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.920> think<00:02:03.220> very<00:02:03.430> logically

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
it does help you to think very logically

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.840 
it does help you to think very logically
on<00:02:04.660> how<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.470> teach<00:02:05.800> people<00:02:05.830> how<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.370> do<00:02:06.610> things

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
on how to teach people how to do things

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.400 
on how to teach people how to do things
and<00:02:07.120> I<00:02:07.360> think<00:02:07.750> what<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.960> get<00:02:08.080> comfortable

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and I think what you get comfortable

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.839 
and I think what you get comfortable
with<00:02:08.560> putting<00:02:08.830> things<00:02:09.160> like<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.429> down<00:02:09.670> on

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
with putting things like that down on

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.820 
with putting things like that down on
paper<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.959> also<00:02:11.110> makes<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.650> more<00:02:11.770> comfortable

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
paper it also makes you more comfortable

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.830 
paper it also makes you more comfortable
when<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.370> talk<00:02:12.670> about<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.970> recipe<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.660> talk

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
when you talk about a recipe and talk

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.150 
when you talk about a recipe and talk
people<00:02:14.050> through<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.590> because<00:02:14.950> you're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
people through it because you're

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.520 
people through it because you're
basically<00:02:15.460> doing<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.030> your<00:02:16.150> head

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
basically doing that in your head

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.710 
basically doing that in your head
you're<00:02:16.650> writing<00:02:16.830> down<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> recipe<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
you're writing down the recipe so you

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240 
you're writing down the recipe so you
know<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.990> kind<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.290> stepping<00:02:19.709> stone<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
know it's kind of a stepping stone to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.620 
know it's kind of a stepping stone to
maybe<00:02:20.569> crew<00:02:21.569> doing<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.500> recipe<00:02:22.830> demo<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:24.150> camera

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
maybe crew doing a recipe demo on camera

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.470 
maybe crew doing a recipe demo on camera
so<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.620> kind<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.920> training<00:02:26.310> process<00:02:26.520> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
so it's kind of a training process and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.880 
so it's kind of a training process and
what<00:02:27.600> where<00:02:27.900> does<00:02:28.020> creativity<00:02:28.590> coming<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
what where does creativity coming to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.100 
what where does creativity coming to
that<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.880> as<00:02:30.060> far<00:02:30.240> as<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.450> creating<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that well as far as like creating the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.860 
that well as far as like creating the
recipes<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.940> know<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.390> gotta<00:02:33.630> get

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
recipes you know you just gotta get

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.809 
recipes you know you just gotta get
comfortable<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.010> kitchen<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.610> kind

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
comfortable in the kitchen it's the kind

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.940 
comfortable in the kitchen it's the kind
of<00:02:35.910> thing<00:02:36.120> where<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.319> get<00:02:37.680> comfortable

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
of thing where you know get comfortable

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.440 
of thing where you know get comfortable
around<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.280> ingredients<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:38.940> got<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.270> know

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
around the ingredients you got to know

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.600 
around the ingredients you got to know
what<00:02:40.350> works<00:02:40.590> there<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:40.980> certain<00:02:41.310> things<00:02:41.459> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
what works there are certain things that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.890 
what works there are certain things that
work<00:02:41.880> together<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.540> mean<00:02:42.720> when<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> think

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
work together I mean when you think

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.140 
work together I mean when you think
about<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.260> baking<00:02:43.680> recipe<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.730> know<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.910> have

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
about a baking recipe you know you have

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.610 
about a baking recipe you know you have
to<00:02:45.270> have<00:02:45.360> leavening<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
to have leavening you know you have to

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.380 
to have leavening you know you have to
have<00:02:46.709> something<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.250> gonna<00:02:47.610> make<00:02:47.700> nothing

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
have something that's gonna make nothing

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.479 
have something that's gonna make nothing
rise<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> know<00:02:49.620> you've<00:02:50.100> got<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.370> know

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
rise so but you know you've got to know

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.790 
rise so but you know you've got to know
what<00:02:50.850> works<00:02:51.390> with<00:02:51.660> what<00:02:51.900> ingredients<00:02:52.590> you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
what works with what ingredients you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.009 
what works with what ingredients you
know<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.340> there's<00:02:54.000> certain<00:02:54.300> basics<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.840> each

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
know so there's certain basics that each

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.720 
know so there's certain basics that each
recipe<00:02:55.290> has<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.739> have<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.610> can

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
recipe has to have and then you can

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.920 
recipe has to have and then you can
start<00:02:56.940> playing<00:02:57.239> around<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:57.630> flavor

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
start playing around with flavor

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.150 
start playing around with flavor
profiles<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.650> there<00:02:58.739> are<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.860> lot<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:58.980> things

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
profiles and there are a lot of things

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.340 
profiles and there are a lot of things
that<00:02:59.340> don't<00:02:59.519> work<00:02:59.700> well<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.570> know<00:03:00.780> I've<00:03:00.870> made

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
that don't work well you know I've made

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.470 
that don't work well you know I've made
some<00:03:01.410> disasters<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:03.000> never<00:03:03.180> know

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
some disasters but you never know

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.059 
some disasters but you never know
because<00:03:03.750> I've<00:03:03.930> had<00:03:03.959> some<00:03:04.350> flavors<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:04.920> come

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
because I've had some flavors that come

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.070 
because I've had some flavors that come
together<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:05.730> may<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.000> unorthodox<00:03:06.269> that

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
together that are may be unorthodox that

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.100 
together that are may be unorthodox that
end<00:03:07.350> up<00:03:07.500> being<00:03:07.709> amazing<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:09.209> know<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.610> it's<00:03:12.110> it

end up being amazing you know so it's it

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.100 
end up being amazing you know so it's it
is<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> very<00:03:14.069> creative<00:03:14.790> process<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.959> mean

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
is a very creative process I mean

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.870 
is a very creative process I mean
absolutely<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:18.800> it's<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:20.190> lot<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.430> like<00:03:20.670> it's

just<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.329> lot<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.540> trial<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:21.959> error<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:23.510> you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
just a lot of trial and error and you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.850 
just a lot of trial and error and you
know<00:03:24.600> every<00:03:24.900> once<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.230> blue<00:03:25.380> moon<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.590> get
