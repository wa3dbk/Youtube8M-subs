00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.749 

this<00:00:00.659> time<00:00:01.199> we<00:00:02.100> are<00:00:02.129> making<00:00:02.520> an<00:00:02.850> angel<00:00:04.759> first

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this time we are making an angel first

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.320 
this time we are making an angel first
angel<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:07.020> need<00:00:07.319> three<00:00:08.069> equal<00:00:08.670> sides<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.240> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
angel you need three equal sides of the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.430 
angel you need three equal sides of the
paper<00:00:10.010> first<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.519> meet<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.910> head<00:00:12.410> you<00:00:13.410> take

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
paper first to meet the head you take

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.829 
paper first to meet the head you take
one<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> piece<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.429> paper<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.570> color

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
one of the piece of the paper the color

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.720 
one of the piece of the paper the color
you<00:00:16.020> want<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> outside<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> you

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you want to be on the outside and you

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.359 
you want to be on the outside and you
just<00:00:18.090> pull<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.690> triangle<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.830> then

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
just pull it in the triangle and then

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.259 
just pull it in the triangle and then
you<00:00:23.609> fold<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.119> half<00:00:24.449> again<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.830> other<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.269> for

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you fold in half again the other way for

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.720 
you fold in half again the other way for
only<00:00:27.420> crease<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.650> these<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> looks<00:00:32.520> like

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
only crease one of these so looks like

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.000 
only crease one of these so looks like
this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.069 
this
and<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.460> fold<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> top<00:00:36.090> part<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.719> here

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and then you fold the top part over here

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:50.340 
and then you fold the top part over here
into<00:00:37.410> thirds<00:00:38.239> so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.880 

one<00:00:50.980> 230<00:00:51.850> part<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.900> let's<00:00:53.050> just<00:00:53.260> keep<00:00:53.590> folding

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
one 230 part so let's just keep folding

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
one 230 part so let's just keep folding
it<00:00:54.100> down<00:00:54.270> until<00:00:55.270> it<00:00:55.420> looks<00:00:55.570> like<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:56.050> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it down until it looks like this and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.180 
it down until it looks like this and
then<00:00:57.910> you<00:00:58.030> take<00:00:58.300> these<00:00:58.540> edges<00:00:59.050> over<00:00:59.379> here<00:00:59.710> and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
then you take these edges over here and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.010 
then you take these edges over here and
you're<00:01:00.430> going<00:01:00.610> to<00:01:00.730> fold<00:01:00.940> down<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.239> hair<00:01:01.660> to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
you're going to fold down the hair to

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:15.270 
you're going to fold down the hair to
frame<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:03.250> angels<00:01:03.730> face

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.130 

and<00:01:16.280> now<00:01:16.430> that<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:16.760> have<00:01:16.790> this<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.810> bring

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
and now that you have this you bring

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.080 
and now that you have this you bring
down<00:01:18.290> bitches<00:01:18.979> over<00:01:19.340> here

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
down bitches over here

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.060 
down bitches over here
and<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:20.720> fold<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.229> back<00:01:23.409> now<00:01:24.409> when<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.740> fought

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
and you fold it back now when you fought

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.609 
and you fold it back now when you fought
it<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.369> should<00:01:25.549> make<00:01:25.700> sure<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.240> edges

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
it you should make sure that the edges

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.899 
it you should make sure that the edges
correspond<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.070> edges<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.670> hair

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
correspond to the edges of the hair

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.649 
correspond to the edges of the hair
right<00:01:29.060> here<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:29.690> let's<00:01:30.530> come<00:01:30.800> like<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.009> bowl<00:01:31.220> cut

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
right here so let's come like a bowl cut

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.660 
right here so let's come like a bowl cut
and<00:01:32.659> these<00:01:32.810> go<00:01:33.080> over<00:01:33.470> again<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.399> fold

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and these go over again and you fold

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.430 
and these go over again and you fold
drop<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.119> edges<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.720> hair<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.320> not

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
drop the edges of the hair so it's not

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.280 
drop the edges of the hair so it's not
so<00:01:36.710> pointy

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.800 

and<00:01:44.860> then<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.640> angel<00:01:46.000> head<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.660> you

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
and then this is the angel head and you

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.130 
and then this is the angel head and you
can<00:01:46.960> draw<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.260> face<00:01:47.650> later<00:01:47.980> and<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.840> throw

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
can draw the face later and now throw

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.040 
can draw the face later and now throw
the<00:01:50.200> angel<00:01:50.680> body<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:52.120> coloring<00:01:52.540> wants<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.930> be

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
the angel body the coloring wants to be

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.650 
the angel body the coloring wants to be
on<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.200> outside<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.790> pour<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.300> into<00:01:55.420> a

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
on the outside so pour it into a

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.570 
on the outside so pour it into a
triangle<00:01:57.960> open<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.080> up<00:01:59.290> hold<00:01:59.830> it<00:01:59.950> into<00:02:00.100> an<00:02:00.280> ice

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
triangle open it up hold it into an ice

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.310 
triangle open it up hold it into an ice
cream<00:02:01.000> cone<00:02:01.300> which<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.630> where<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.080> take<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
cream cone which is where you take the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.040 
cream cone which is where you take the
edges<00:02:02.830> over<00:02:03.100> here<00:02:03.660> fold<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.020> middle

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
edges over here fold it to the middle

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.010 
edges over here fold it to the middle
one<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.850> let's<00:02:07.030> go<00:02:07.180> like<00:02:07.300> an<00:02:07.450> ice<00:02:07.600> cream<00:02:07.810> cone

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
one so let's go like an ice cream cone

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.980 
one so let's go like an ice cream cone
and<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.700> take<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.060> part<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.720> your

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
and then you take this part in your

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.880 
and then you take this part in your
folder<00:02:17.350> all<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.800> way<00:02:17.980> up

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.580 

so<00:02:25.490> looks<00:02:25.700> like<00:02:25.880> that

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
so looks like that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.000 
so looks like that
and<00:02:28.310> that's<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.390> angel<00:02:29.930> wings<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and that's for the angel wings the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.120 
and that's for the angel wings the
coming<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.670> should<00:02:31.970> meet<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.680> outside

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
coming want should meet on the outside

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.300 
coming want should meet on the outside
so<00:02:34.730> pour<00:02:35.000> them<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.330> half<00:02:38.170> okay<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.770> Dan<00:02:39.920> happy

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
so pour them in half okay for Dan happy

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.850 
so pour them in half okay for Dan happy
other<00:02:40.640> way<00:02:44.920> open<00:02:45.920> again<00:02:46.900> take<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.050> edges<00:02:48.470> for

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
other way open again take the edges for

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.009 
other way open again take the edges for
them<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> center

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.229 

open<00:02:58.019> up<00:02:58.200> take<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.980> top<00:02:59.219> parts<00:02:59.549> over<00:02:59.700> here<00:02:59.819> and

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
open up take the top parts over here and

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.670 
open up take the top parts over here and
pull<00:03:00.510> them<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.900> crease<00:03:01.260> line<00:03:01.499> you<00:03:01.650> just

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
pull them to the crease line you just

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.660 
pull them to the crease line you just
need<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:06.920> unfold<00:03:07.920> one<00:03:08.159> of<00:03:08.249> the<00:03:08.340> creases

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
need like so unfold one of the creases

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.979 
need like so unfold one of the creases
and<00:03:09.239> bring<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:11.340> line<00:03:11.609> right<00:03:11.879> here<00:03:11.989> so

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
and bring up to this line right here so

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.929 
and bring up to this line right here so
looks<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:18.060> full<00:03:18.689> flip<00:03:19.439> up<00:03:19.939> so

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 
looks like this and a full flip up so

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.580 
looks like this and a full flip up so
the<00:03:21.120> corner<00:03:21.510> goes<00:03:21.719> back<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> little<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.409> this

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the corner goes back a little like this

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:30.970 
the corner goes back a little like this
and<00:03:22.889> you<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.250> same<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.760> other<00:03:23.909> side

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.420 

I'm<00:03:31.610> full<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.390> now<00:03:33.080> what<00:03:33.319> you<00:03:33.470> do<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:33.770> that<00:03:34.069> you

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
I'm full and now what you do is that you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.059 
I'm full and now what you do is that you
take<00:03:34.459> one<00:03:34.879> of<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.030> corners<00:03:35.300> in<00:03:36.080> a<00:03:36.140> float<00:03:36.560> board

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
take one of the corners in a float board

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.130 
take one of the corners in a float board
so<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.879> it<00:03:37.970> hits<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.269> little<00:03:38.540> crease<00:03:38.930> right

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
so that it hits the little crease right

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.869 
so that it hits the little crease right
here<00:03:41.170> these<00:03:42.170> might<00:03:42.530> go<00:03:42.709> over<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.340> fold<00:03:43.700> it

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
here these might go over and you fold it

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.309 
here these might go over and you fold it
back<00:03:44.300> all<00:03:44.629> the<00:03:44.780> way<00:03:44.870> on<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.170> crease<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:48.290> you

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
back all the way on this crease and you

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.150 
back all the way on this crease and you
flip<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.800> over<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:50.590> you've<00:03:51.590> bought<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:52.010> so

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
flip it over and you've bought it so

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.540 
flip it over and you've bought it so
hits<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.730> crease<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:54.310> that's<00:03:55.310> pretty<00:03:55.430> much

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
hits this crease and that's pretty much

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.370 
hits this crease and that's pretty much
what<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:56.000> do<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.420> keep<00:03:56.840> flipping<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.319> back

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
what you do you keep flipping it back

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.900 
what you do you keep flipping it back
and<00:03:57.769> forth<00:03:58.120> back<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.150> forth

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
and forth back and forth

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:33.950 
and forth back and forth
folding<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.090> into<00:04:02.330> about<00:04:02.810> crease<00:04:03.200> lines

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:43.790 

almost<00:04:34.960> finished<00:04:41.159> and<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:43.180> now<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:43.539> just

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
almost finished and so now you just

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.950 
almost finished and so now you just
bought<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:45.009> half<00:04:45.310> like<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.690> have<00:04:46.930> a

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
bought in half like this and I have a

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.290 
bought in half like this and I have a
choice<00:04:47.289> for<00:04:47.680> either<00:04:47.979> red<00:04:48.220> beans<00:04:48.550> or<00:04:48.909> yellow

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
choice for either red beans or yellow

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.240 
choice for either red beans or yellow
leaves<00:04:49.539> by<00:04:49.750> what<00:04:49.990> yellow<00:04:50.229> means<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:51.009> I'm<00:04:51.069> just

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
leaves by what yellow means so I'm just

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.550 
leaves by what yellow means so I'm just

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
going to go to open them up like this

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.909 
going to go to open them up like this
and<00:04:54.659> now<00:04:55.659> that<00:04:55.870> I'm<00:04:55.990> done<00:04:56.169> with<00:04:56.229> all<00:04:56.500> parts<00:04:56.860> of

and now that I'm done with all parts of
my<00:04:57.069> angels<00:04:57.310> I'm<00:04:57.819> gonna<00:04:58.060> take<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.479> glue<00:04:58.750> stick

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
my angels I'm gonna take a glue stick

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:14.840 
my angels I'm gonna take a glue stick
and<00:04:59.379> do<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.310> all<00:05:00.430> together

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.420 

and<00:05:15.390> for<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.900> Angeline<00:05:16.590> since<00:05:16.920> you<00:05:17.070> might<00:05:17.250> not

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
and for the Angeline since you might not

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.150 
and for the Angeline since you might not
stay<00:05:17.670> on<00:05:17.940> with<00:05:18.420> move<00:05:19.410> you<00:05:19.770> should<00:05:19.980> probably

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
stay on with move you should probably

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:35.150 
stay on with move you should probably
tape<00:05:20.820> them<00:05:21.060> together<00:05:30.050> like<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.980> this<00:05:34.980> is

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
tape them together like and this is

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.240 
tape them together like and this is
where<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.460> were<00:05:35.580> drawing<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:36.000> face
