about<00:04:06.720> these<00:04:06.959> they're<00:04:07.890> comfortable<00:04:08.310> they're

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
very well built very durable and I think

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.949 
very well built very durable and I think
that<00:04:12.540> every<00:04:13.250> everyone<00:04:14.250> should<00:04:14.519> get<00:04:14.640> one

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
from buddies they should probably get

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.050 
from buddies they should probably get
one<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.950> these<00:04:20.039> if<00:04:20.220> they<00:04:20.340> don't<00:04:20.519> have<00:04:20.700> them<00:04:20.880> and
