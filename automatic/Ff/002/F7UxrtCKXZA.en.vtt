and<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> vector<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.750> both<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.290> really

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and with a vector it is both a really

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.539 
and with a vector it is both a really
good<00:01:58.950> gun<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.369> strongly<00:02:00.210> recommend<00:02:00.950> using<00:02:01.950> this

good gun I strongly recommend using this
gun<00:02:02.820> or<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.000> vector<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> guys<00:02:03.750> have

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930

missed<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.259> previous<00:02:04.770> episode<00:02:04.979> i'll<00:02:05.399> probably

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
missed a previous episode i'll probably

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
missed a previous episode i'll probably
put<00:02:05.939> an<00:02:06.060> annotation<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> upper<00:02:07.380> left<00:02:07.590> left

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
put an annotation in the upper left left

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.010 
put an annotation in the upper left left
hand<00:02:08.099> corner<00:02:08.520> make<00:02:09.149> sure<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.360> check<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> one

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
hand corner make sure to check that one

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.360 
hand corner make sure to check that one
out<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.739> vector<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.069> also<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.520> good<00:02:11.610> gun

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
out the vector is also really good gun

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.680 
out the vector is also really good gun
like<00:02:12.489> this<00:02:12.670> gun<00:02:12.909> too<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.299> I've<00:02:13.390> been<00:02:13.540> playing

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
with this a lot and I think you have to

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.690 
with this a lot and I think you have to
unlock<00:02:17.019> some<00:02:17.230> attachments<00:02:17.799> for<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.040> until<00:02:18.549> it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
unlock some attachments for it until it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.850 
unlock some attachments for it until it
gets<00:02:18.909> like<00:02:19.030> really<00:02:19.060> good<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.319> as<00:02:20.409> you<00:02:20.500> can<00:02:20.620> see

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
gets like really good so as you can see

long-range it only is really good at me
r<00:03:13.180> close<00:03:13.629> range<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.230> bit<00:03:14.409> of<00:03:14.560> decent<00:03:15.519> that

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
r close range and a bit of decent that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.300 
r close range and a bit of decent that
medium-range<00:03:16.299> long<00:03:16.660> range<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:17.049> just<00:03:17.349> bad<00:03:17.650> you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
medium-range long range is just bad you

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.710 
medium-range long range is just bad you
can<00:03:18.549> better<00:03:18.730> switch<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.180> your<00:03:19.299> knife<00:03:19.510> or

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
don't know that's not even possible guy

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.550 
don't know that's not even possible guy
so<00:03:22.840> don't<00:03:22.959> even<00:03:23.169> try<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.549> um<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:26.049> gun<00:03:26.319> do<00:03:26.500> I

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
so don't even try it so um this gun do I

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.740 
so don't even try it so um this gun do I
recommend<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.069> yes<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:28.000> go<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.359> use<00:03:28.569> it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
recommend it yes just go and use it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.690 
recommend it yes just go and use it
straight<00:03:29.049> away<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.590> unlock<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.370> level

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
straight away you unlock it that level

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.539 
straight away you unlock it that level
irie<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.540> don't<00:03:32.260> know<00:03:32.319> it's<00:03:32.769> pretty<00:03:32.950> low<00:03:33.220> level

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
irie I don't know it's pretty low level

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.369 
irie I don't know it's pretty low level
I<00:03:33.669> think<00:03:33.819> it's<00:03:33.970> even<00:03:34.060> faster<00:03:34.389> than<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> vector

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
I think it's even faster than the vector

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.430 
I think it's even faster than the vector
so<00:03:36.129> you<00:03:36.489> can<00:03:36.669> use<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.120> before<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.139> unlock

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
so you can use this before you unlock

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.890 
so you can use this before you unlock
that<00:03:38.590> weapon<00:03:38.980> or<00:03:39.239> until<00:03:40.239> II<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.389> don't<00:03:40.750> know<00:03:40.840> you
