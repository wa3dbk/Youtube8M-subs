00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 begins to circulate in são paulo in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.720
 experimental character on the first bus 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.330
 country hybrid 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.049
 It has two diesel engines and one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.519
 that does not pollute and is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.599
 when the vehicle is down 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.070
 velocity 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.490
 the bus costs about 600 thousand reais 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.490
 50% more than traditional but 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.660
 consumes much less fuel in each 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 trip 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.850
 he arrived at the terminal slowly but soon 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.969
 attracted the attention, everyone wanted to see 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.180
 near the new star the hybrid bus to 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.510
 it is very good to drive in a 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.329
 I just do not go there with a new nothing loses nor 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.610
 nothing just joy this work there life 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.200
 Everything here in the car can not leave 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 family 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.789
 the bus has two engines each with 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.539
 a source of electric power and oil 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.460
 diesel 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.899
 so it is a hybrid according to the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.149
 engineers operating 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.460
 shared is the novelty of technology 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.769
 up to 20 kilometers per hour the vehicle is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.990
 driven by the electric motor when it passes 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.700
 this speed starts the engine at 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.580
 which also recharges the batteries 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.470
 the fuel economy system and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.930
 emissions of pollutants are the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.689
 main advantages the economy can 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.880
 reach up to 35% if we are 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.869
 saving fuel 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.509
 consequently we are failing to 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.310
 pollute this technology the manufacturer 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.159
 esteem that it will provide us with 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 80 to 90 percent reduction in 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.479
 emissions of pollutants in a way that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.830
 economic and silent 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.360
 the maneuver in the yard is made without noise 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.250
 directed his josé carlos made a 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.830
 12 hour training nothing much 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.350
 complicated automatic bus is much more 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.140
 easy to guide the other differences 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.000
 more comfort motors and assembly than I 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.540
 I have less stress more arrived more 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.710
 quieter peaceful understood 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.530
 Conditioned image to break the twig 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.790
 huh 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.940
 quite different from some buses 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.130
 conventional the front engine 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.190
 hot and noisy chattering that the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.600
 end of the day is dead all broken 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.250
 until the language hurts the hybrid bus entered 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.260
 on test this Friday on the line 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.720
 university city acclimatization 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.230
 the first passenger soon noticed the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.400
 Very nice novelty is much more 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.920
 broad is not even conditioned 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 besides saving the environment the bus 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.830
 Hybrid also a relief for 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.040
 passengers 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.860
 it is quieter it balances - and has air 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.570
 conditioning which makes the journey very 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.110
 more comfortable for those who are 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.430
 accustomed to reading with a 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.440
 shaking hands with the sun the guys in 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.959
 an example that is quiet for 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.360
 study while on the outside the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.019
 pollution of other buses is visible 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.930
 ibri 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.310
 there is cleaner and smoke signal 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.290
 silent 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.390
 I think it's the least we expect 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.760
 of a public transport policy 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.350
 inside environment well for us 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.600
 besides São Paulo the hybrid bus 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.030
 will also be tested in rio de janeiro and 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.650
 curitiba the capital of paulista will circulate 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.510
 within the next 15 days 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.550
 it is not yet known when models with 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.450
 this technology will be part of the 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.790
 From São Paulo 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.370
 but whoever has already boarded the hybrid does not see the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.269
 the first passengers approved 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.130
 and recommends that you have an additional eleven and 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.450
 if this was an incentive with the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.010
 people walking more than 11 né 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.560
 currently hybrid buses run on 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.019
 and in germany in são paulo after 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.420
 this test of 15 days the city hall will 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.400
 evaluate the relationship between the cost consuming 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.800
 the environmental benefit of the vehicle to 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.080
 decide whether or not it will be incorporated 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.080
 fleet of the city that today has 15 thousand
