00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
hello and welcome to another episode of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.320 
hello and welcome to another episode of
Eragon<00:00:13.730> that<00:00:14.730> would<00:00:14.849> be<00:00:14.969> me

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
Eragon that would be me

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.230 
Eragon that would be me
I<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.809> had<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.500> great<00:00:17.190> deal<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.400> response<00:00:17.820> once

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
I have had a great deal of response once

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
I have had a great deal of response once
again<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:19.910> my<00:00:20.910> Honda<00:00:21.300> nose<00:00:21.480> start<00:00:21.779> video<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
again to my Honda nose start video and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400 
again to my Honda nose start video and
lots<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.460> people<00:00:23.699> keep<00:00:23.850> saying<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.420> replace<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
lots of people keep saying I replace the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.769 
lots of people keep saying I replace the
fuel<00:00:25.619> pump<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.189> still<00:00:26.400> isn't<00:00:26.550> working

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
fuel pump this still isn't working

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.890 
fuel pump this still isn't working
lots<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> questions<00:00:28.769> really<00:00:28.980> pertaining<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
lots of questions really pertaining to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.380 
lots of questions really pertaining to
general<00:00:30.900> diagnosis<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:31.800> no<00:00:31.920> start<00:00:32.219> issue

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
general diagnosis but no start issue

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.190 
general diagnosis but no start issue
that's<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.510> we're<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> cover<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that's what we're going to cover in this

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.639 
that's what we're going to cover in this
video<00:00:34.950> right<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:36.090> order<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:37.140> order

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
video right here in order for in order

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
video right here in order for in order
for<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:38.070> internal<00:00:38.399> combustion<00:00:38.790> engine<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.329> run

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
for an internal combustion engine to run

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.869 
for an internal combustion engine to run
you<00:00:40.170> need<00:00:40.410> three<00:00:41.250> things<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:42.719> first<00:00:42.899> thing<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
you need three things the first thing is

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.090 
you need three things the first thing is
spark<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> ignition

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
spark and that is from the ignition

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
spark and that is from the ignition
system<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.760> other<00:00:47.850> words<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.360> need<00:00:48.510> spark<00:00:49.020> at

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
system in other words you need spark at

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.709 
system in other words you need spark at
the<00:00:49.289> spark<00:00:49.559> plug<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:51.090> next<00:00:51.329> thing<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.570> need

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the spark plug the next thing you need

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.040 
the spark plug the next thing you need
is<00:00:51.989> fuel<00:00:52.770> obviously<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
is fuel obviously and that's where the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
is fuel obviously and that's where the
nose<00:00:55.680> start<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> main<00:00:56.370> relay<00:00:56.640> comes<00:00:56.910> in

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
nose start for the main relay comes in

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910 
nose start for the main relay comes in
because<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.750> does<00:00:57.899> actually<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.770> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
because what that does actually is it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
because what that does actually is it
does<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.280> allow<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> fuel<00:00:59.910> pump<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> turn<00:01:00.510> on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
does not allow the fuel pump to turn on

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.020 
does not allow the fuel pump to turn on
thus<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.829> engine<00:01:02.100> does<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.550> fuel<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
thus the engine does not have fuel it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.000 
thus the engine does not have fuel it
will<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.329> start<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.589> third<00:01:04.799> thing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
will not start and the third thing

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.560 
will not start and the third thing
actually<00:01:05.280> has<00:01:05.580> two<00:01:05.820> parts

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
actually has two parts

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.620 
actually has two parts
and<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.290> timing<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.390> what<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> mean<00:01:09.570> by

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and that's timing and what I mean by

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
and that's timing and what I mean by
that<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.380> need<00:01:10.500> correct<00:01:10.979> ignition<00:01:11.250> timing

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that is you need correct ignition timing

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.399 
that is you need correct ignition timing
so<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> spark<00:01:12.510> plug<00:01:12.689> needs<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.990> fire<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so the spark plug needs to fire the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.649 
so the spark plug needs to fire the
proper<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> addition<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
proper time but in addition to that you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.649 
proper time but in addition to that you
also<00:01:15.900> need<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:17.070> engine<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:18.030> mechanically

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
also need the engine to be mechanically

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.359 
also need the engine to be mechanically
in<00:01:18.869> time<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> piston<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> valves

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
in time so the piston and the valves

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.859 
in time so the piston and the valves
need<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.700> working<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.090> concert<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.689> order

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
need to be working in concert in order

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
need to be working in concert in order
for<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> engine<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> run<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.860> want<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> add<00:01:23.580> one

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
for the engine to run I want to add one

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.760 
for the engine to run I want to add one
more<00:01:23.939> thing<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.270> will<00:01:24.479> call<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.900> fourth<00:01:25.439> thing

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
more thing that will call a fourth thing

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340 
more thing that will call a fourth thing
and<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.659> engine<00:01:27.960> needs<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.259> be

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and that is the engine needs to be

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
and that is the engine needs to be
mechanically<00:01:28.860> sound<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.759> other<00:01:29.939> words<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
mechanically sound in other words the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
mechanically sound in other words the
compression<00:01:30.990> needs<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.920> there

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
compression needs to be there if there

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.520 
compression needs to be there if there
is<00:01:32.790> some<00:01:33.150> kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> mechanical<00:01:33.960> failure<00:01:33.990> where

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
is some kind of mechanical failure where

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
is some kind of mechanical failure where
the<00:01:34.650> piston<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> unable<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.790> compress<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the piston is unable to compress the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480 
the piston is unable to compress the
mixture<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.770> course<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.159> not<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
mixture then of course it's not going to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
mixture then of course it's not going to
be<00:01:38.579> able<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> run<00:01:38.909> correctly<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:40.079> experience

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
be able to run correctly my experience

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
be able to run correctly my experience
in<00:01:40.799> these<00:01:41.490> situations<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.540> don't

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
in these situations is they don't

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.440 
in these situations is they don't
necessarily<00:01:42.899> cause<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> no<00:01:43.920> start<00:01:44.250> condition

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
necessarily cause a no start condition

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.600 
necessarily cause a no start condition
but<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.810> engine<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.320> run<00:01:46.590> very<00:01:46.770> poorly<00:01:47.460> in

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
but the engine will run very poorly in

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
but the engine will run very poorly in
that<00:01:47.880> case<00:01:48.149> unless<00:01:48.990> there's<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.320> failure<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that case unless there's a failure of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
that case unless there's a failure of
compression<00:01:50.250> across<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.790> board<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.450> can

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
compression across the board which can

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
compression across the board which can
happen<00:01:52.049> say<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> cylinder<00:01:52.920> walls<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.340> washed

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
happen say the cylinder walls get washed

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.480 
happen say the cylinder walls get washed
down<00:01:53.790> by<00:01:53.820> fuel<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> cars<00:01:54.930> flooded<00:01:55.490> in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
down by fuel and the cars flooded in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.300

which<00:01:56.759> case<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.750> want<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
which case what you want to do is if the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.459 
which case what you want to do is if the
car<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.610> cranking<00:01:59.969> very<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.509> fast<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.229> seems

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
car is cranking very very fast it seems

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.260 
car is cranking very very fast it seems
like<00:02:01.590> there's<00:02:01.860> no<00:02:01.920> resistance<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.969> engine

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
like there's no resistance the engine

whatsoever just try this for the heck of

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.609 
whatsoever just try this for the heck of
it<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.520> order<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> car<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.409> what's

it in order to get the car into what's
called<00:02:07.860> clear<00:02:08.190> flood<00:02:08.640> mode<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.119> only

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
called clear flood mode and this only

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.940 
called clear flood mode and this only
works<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.690> fuel-injected<00:02:10.289> models<00:02:10.739> for<00:02:10.890> the

works on fuel-injected models for the
most<00:02:11.129> part

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
most part

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.170 
most part
way<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.130> take<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.460> gas<00:02:13.640> pedal<00:02:14.060> and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
way is that you take the gas pedal and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.520 
way is that you take the gas pedal and
put<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.750> way<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.050> floor<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
put it all the way to the floor and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.980 
put it all the way to the floor and
crank<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.070> engine<00:02:16.400> continue<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> do<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
crank the engine continue to do so to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.350 
crank the engine continue to do so to
clear<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.160> flood<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.610> other<00:02:19.730> words<00:02:19.910> clear<00:02:20.270> the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
clear the flood in other words clear the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.880 
clear the flood in other words clear the
excess<00:02:20.720> fuel<00:02:20.990> that's<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.440> cylinders<00:02:21.860> that

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
excess fuel that's in the cylinders that

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.650 
excess fuel that's in the cylinders that
has<00:02:22.220> basically<00:02:22.610> washed<00:02:22.910> all<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.210> oil<00:02:23.480> away

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
has basically washed all the oil away

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.020 
has basically washed all the oil away
from<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.990> sides<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.410> Pistons<00:02:24.830> and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
from the sides of the Pistons and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.240 
from the sides of the Pistons and
therefore<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.180> don't<00:02:26.270> have<00:02:26.390> any<00:02:26.630> compression

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
therefore you don't have any compression

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
therefore you don't have any compression
do<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:29.380> period<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.470> time<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.670> if

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
do this for a period of time and if

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.700 
do this for a period of time and if
you're<00:02:32.570> unsuccessful<00:02:32.840> with<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.470> pretty

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
you're unsuccessful with that pretty

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.630 
you're unsuccessful with that pretty
much<00:02:33.830> you're<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.430> do<00:02:34.550> is

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
much you're going to have to do is

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.530 
much you're going to have to do is
remove<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.060> spark<00:02:35.330> plugs<00:02:35.600> dry<00:02:36.560> them<00:02:36.770> out<00:02:36.920> and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
remove the spark plugs dry them out and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.450 
remove the spark plugs dry them out and
go<00:02:38.540> from<00:02:38.780> there<00:02:38.960> but<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:39.740> in<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.950> case<00:02:40.160> where

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
go from there but that's in a case where

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.740 
go from there but that's in a case where
you<00:02:40.490> have<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> know<00:02:40.940> start<00:02:41.270> where<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> engine

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
you have a know start where the engine

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.040 
you have a know start where the engine
is<00:02:41.810> cranking<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.560> not<00:02:43.430> firing<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
is cranking but not firing and the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.080 
is cranking but not firing and the
engine<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:45.620> essence<00:02:46.100> flooded<00:02:46.640> which<00:02:46.820> this

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
engine is in essence flooded which this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.090 
engine is in essence flooded which this
does<00:02:47.360> happen<00:02:47.630> from<00:02:47.870> time<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.320> time<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
does happen from time to time but the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.520 
does happen from time to time but the
main<00:02:49.250> point<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.940> if<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.630> engine<00:02:51.200> cannot

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
main point is is if the engine cannot

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.920 
main point is is if the engine cannot
mechanically<00:02:52.310> produce<00:02:52.970> compression<00:02:53.600> either

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
mechanically produce compression either

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.490 
mechanically produce compression either
because<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:55.280> failure<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.930> say<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.110> sealing

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
because of a failure of say the sealing

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.840 
because of a failure of say the sealing
of<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.650> Pistons<00:02:58.250> or<00:02:58.460> a<00:02:58.520> valve<00:02:59.290> or<00:03:00.290> if<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.700> a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
of the Pistons or a valve or if it's a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.250 
of the Pistons or a valve or if it's a
question<00:03:02.210> of<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.420> engine<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.810> out<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.960> time

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
question of the engine is out of time

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.650 
question of the engine is out of time
mechanically<00:03:03.950> where<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.640> Pistons<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.570> the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
mechanically where the Pistons and the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.990 
mechanically where the Pistons and the
valves<00:03:06.020> are<00:03:06.140> not<00:03:06.410> moving<00:03:06.830> together<00:03:07.000> thus

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
valves are not moving together thus

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.180 
valves are not moving together thus
cannot<00:03:08.570> create<00:03:08.900> some<00:03:09.260> form<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.650> compression

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
cannot create some form of compression

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550 
cannot create some form of compression
so<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.340> guess<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.820> guess<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.450> third<00:03:11.660> /<00:03:12.140> fourth

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
so I guess I guess the third / fourth

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.470 
so I guess I guess the third / fourth
thing<00:03:12.890> should<00:03:13.160> really<00:03:13.610> be<00:03:13.820> engine

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
thing should really be engine

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.200 
thing should really be engine
compression<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.070> health<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.670> mechanical

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
compression so the health the mechanical

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.550 
compression so the health the mechanical
health<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.660> engine<00:03:17.990> needs<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.290> be<00:03:18.380> there

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
health of the engine needs to be there

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.740 
health of the engine needs to be there
in<00:03:18.680> order<00:03:18.830> for<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.100> car<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.370> run<00:03:19.540> back<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.570> you

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
in order for the car to run back to you

in order for the car to run back to you
Erik<00:03:20.960> and<00:03:22.000> often<00:03:23.000> overlooked<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.950> part<00:03:24.950> of

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
Erik and often overlooked a part of

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.210 
Erik and often overlooked a part of
diagnosis<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.240> you<00:03:26.810> know<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.530> mechanical

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
diagnosis and you know the mechanical

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.460 
diagnosis and you know the mechanical
issues<00:03:28.490> can<00:03:28.760> cause<00:03:29.000> no<00:03:29.240> start<00:03:29.480> problems<00:03:29.870> the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
issues can cause no start problems the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.810 
issues can cause no start problems the
tendency<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.220> blame<00:03:31.400> something

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
tendency is to blame something

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.180 
tendency is to blame something
electronic<00:03:32.210> it's<00:03:33.020> not<00:03:33.230> always<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.590> case<00:03:33.620> so

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
electronic it's not always the case so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.790 
electronic it's not always the case so
follow<00:03:35.060> these<00:03:35.270> procedures<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:36.380> find<00:03:36.620> out

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
follow these procedures to find out

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.510 
follow these procedures to find out
exactly<00:03:36.980> what<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:37.940> going<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.600> then

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
exactly what is going on and then

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.500 
exactly what is going on and then
proceed<00:03:40.520> with<00:03:40.640> your<00:03:40.670> diagnosis<00:03:41.210> from<00:03:41.300> there

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
proceed with your diagnosis from there

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.300 
proceed with your diagnosis from there
okay<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.590> first<00:03:42.710> thing<00:03:42.890> we're<00:03:42.980> going<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.130> talk

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
okay the first thing we're going to talk

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.910 
okay the first thing we're going to talk
about<00:03:43.340> here<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.940> checking<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.510> spark<00:03:45.050> now<00:03:45.590> I

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
about here is checking the spark now I

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.910 
about here is checking the spark now I
use<00:03:46.400> this<00:03:46.580> handy<00:03:47.240> little<00:03:47.270> tool<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.620> bought

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
use this handy little tool that I bought

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.320 
use this handy little tool that I bought
you<00:03:49.160> may<00:03:49.280> be<00:03:49.340> able<00:03:49.490> to<00:03:49.580> find<00:03:49.820> these<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.090> an<00:03:50.180> auto

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
you may be able to find these in an auto

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.590 
you may be able to find these in an auto
parts<00:03:50.630> store<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:53.000> can<00:03:53.150> plug<00:03:53.300> in<00:03:53.480> in

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
parts store that you can plug in in

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.890 
parts store that you can plug in in
place<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.080> spark<00:03:54.380> plug<00:03:55.270> and<00:03:56.270> in<00:03:56.660> order<00:03:56.870> to

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
place of the spark plug and in order to

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.590 
place of the spark plug and in order to
check<00:03:57.170> for<00:03:57.410> spark<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:58.670> could<00:03:58.820> probably<00:03:59.000> use<00:03:59.570> a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
check for spark you could probably use a

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.420 
check for spark you could probably use a
screwdriver<00:03:59.960> in<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.650> end<00:04:00.800> of<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.280> hold

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
screwdriver in the end of this and hold

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.920 
screwdriver in the end of this and hold
it<00:04:01.550> close<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:01.970> ground<00:04:02.270> but<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.660> better<00:04:02.810> be

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
it close to a ground but you better be

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.230 
it close to a ground but you better be
careful<00:04:03.080> because<00:04:03.320> you<00:04:04.040> can<00:04:04.550> get<00:04:04.730> shocked<00:04:05.030> and

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
careful because you can get shocked and

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.720 
careful because you can get shocked and
some<00:04:05.510> ignition<00:04:05.900> systems<00:04:06.260> have<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.800> great<00:04:07.550> deal

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
some ignition systems have a great deal

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.090 
some ignition systems have a great deal
of<00:04:07.760> voltage<00:04:08.180> behind<00:04:08.390> them<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.890> some<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:09.920> them

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
of voltage behind them and some of them

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.520 
of voltage behind them and some of them
have<00:04:10.310> enough<00:04:10.520> amperage<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:11.090> hurt<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.630> so<00:04:11.930> be

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
have enough amperage to hurt you so be

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.780 
have enough amperage to hurt you so be
careful<00:04:12.830> when<00:04:12.920> doing<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:13.490> this<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.760> a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
careful when doing this but this is a

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.539 
careful when doing this but this is a
nice<00:04:13.970> hands-free<00:04:14.660> way<00:04:14.930> of<00:04:15.350> checking<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.130> for

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
nice hands-free way of checking to for

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.610 
nice hands-free way of checking to for
spark<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.210> the<00:04:17.720> first<00:04:17.930> thing<00:04:18.080> I<00:04:18.170> check<00:04:18.410> for

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
spark so the first thing I check for

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.290 
spark so the first thing I check for
usually<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.160> spark

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.430 

and<00:04:23.300> as<00:04:23.420> you<00:04:23.570> can<00:04:23.660> see<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:24.020> engine<00:04:24.320> had

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
and as you can see this engine had

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.380 
and as you can see this engine had
plenty<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.800> spark<00:04:25.190> in<00:04:25.370> fact<00:04:25.730> this<00:04:25.880> engine<00:04:26.180> runs

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
plenty of spark in fact this engine runs

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.700 
plenty of spark in fact this engine runs
I'm<00:04:26.600> just<00:04:26.780> going<00:04:26.960> through<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.200> principles<00:04:27.590> of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
I'm just going through the principles of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.640 
I'm just going through the principles of
diagnosis<00:04:28.280> here<00:04:28.600> if<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:29.960> don't<00:04:30.140> see<00:04:30.320> spark

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
diagnosis here if you don't see spark

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.250 
diagnosis here if you don't see spark
there<00:04:31.040> at<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.430> spark<00:04:31.730> plug<00:04:31.970> follow<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.050> chain

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
there at the spark plug follow the chain

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.010 
there at the spark plug follow the chain
and<00:04:33.530> go<00:04:34.490> back<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.000> coil<00:04:35.210> itself<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:35.900> see

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
and go back to the coil itself and see

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.480 
and go back to the coil itself and see
if<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.230> have<00:04:36.410> spark<00:04:36.710> coming<00:04:36.890> out<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.250> coil

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
if you have spark coming out of the coil

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.190 
if you have spark coming out of the coil
if<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.150> have<00:04:38.240> spark<00:04:38.510> coming<00:04:38.690> out<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:38.990> coil

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
if you have spark coming out of the coil

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.320 
if you have spark coming out of the coil
but<00:04:39.740> not<00:04:39.980> at<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.160> spark<00:04:40.460> plug<00:04:40.700> then<00:04:41.120> there's<00:04:41.270> a

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
but not at the spark plug then there's a

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.510 
but not at the spark plug then there's a
problem<00:04:41.510> in<00:04:41.720> between<00:04:42.050> there<00:04:42.260> could<00:04:43.070> be<00:04:43.100> the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
problem in between there could be the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.450 
problem in between there could be the
cap<00:04:43.730> could<00:04:43.970> be<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.210> rotor<00:04:45.310> something<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.400> the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
cap could be the rotor something in the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.160 
cap could be the rotor something in the
secondary<00:04:46.850> side<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.240> ignition<00:04:47.450> system<00:04:47.720> so

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
secondary side of the ignition system so

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.370 
secondary side of the ignition system so
that's<00:04:48.800> what<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.130> do<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.730> start<00:04:50.540> from<00:04:50.810> one

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
that's what you do you start from one

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.320 
that's what you do you start from one
logical<00:04:51.950> point<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.490> work<00:04:52.790> your<00:04:53.000> way<00:04:53.090> back

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
logical point and work your way back

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.360 
logical point and work your way back
towards<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.780> problem<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.320> that's<00:04:54.980> that's

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
towards the problem and that's that's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.100 
towards the problem and that's that's
the<00:04:55.520> whole<00:04:55.640> point<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:55.940> diagnosis<00:04:56.570> is<00:04:56.750> working

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
the whole point of diagnosis is working

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.560 
the whole point of diagnosis is working
logically<00:04:57.530> don't<00:04:58.280> make<00:04:58.490> assumptions<00:04:59.000> the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
logically don't make assumptions the

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.870 
logically don't make assumptions the
next<00:04:59.780> thing<00:04:59.930> we<00:04:59.990> check<00:05:00.170> for<00:05:00.200> is<00:05:00.440> fuel<00:05:00.710> which<00:05:01.550> we

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
next thing we check for is fuel which we

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.970 
next thing we check for is fuel which we
have<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.180> a<00:05:02.210> previous<00:05:02.540> video<00:05:04.780> okay<00:05:05.780> lastly<00:05:06.230> you

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
have in a previous video okay lastly you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.110 
have in a previous video okay lastly you
want<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.160> make<00:05:07.220> sure<00:05:07.460> that<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.760> engine<00:05:07.910> is

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
want to make sure that the engine is

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.750 
want to make sure that the engine is
mechanically<00:05:08.720> in<00:05:08.840> time<00:05:09.550> something<00:05:10.550> like<00:05:10.730> a

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
mechanically in time something like a

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.470 
mechanically in time something like a
broken<00:05:10.970> timing<00:05:11.270> belt<00:05:11.450> can<00:05:11.780> look<00:05:12.020> like<00:05:12.260> it's

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
broken timing belt can look like it's

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.810 
broken timing belt can look like it's
okay<00:05:14.480> up<00:05:14.660> top<00:05:14.930> but<00:05:15.230> it<00:05:15.350> can<00:05:15.470> actually<00:05:15.919> not<00:05:16.580> move

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
okay up top but it can actually not move

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.370 
okay up top but it can actually not move
any<00:05:17.060> of<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.240> engine<00:05:17.480> on<00:05:17.600> top<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.110> bottom

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
any of the engine on top so the bottom

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.659 
any of the engine on top so the bottom
in<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.590> engine<00:05:19.010> needs<00:05:19.190> to<00:05:19.280> be<00:05:19.400> coordinated

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
in the engine needs to be coordinated

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.760 
in the engine needs to be coordinated
with<00:05:19.910> the<00:05:20.030> top<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.570> engine<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:20.990> on<00:05:21.110> these

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
with the top and the engine and on these

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.159 
with the top and the engine and on these
particular<00:05:22.300> cars<00:05:23.300> you<00:05:23.690> have<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.900> do<00:05:24.020> it<00:05:24.080> with

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
particular cars you have to do it with

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.930 
particular cars you have to do it with
the<00:05:24.260> timing<00:05:24.560> belt<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:24.890> you<00:05:25.190> may<00:05:25.400> have<00:05:25.669> to

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
the timing belt and you may have to

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.150 
the timing belt and you may have to
remove<00:05:26.630> parts<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.260> engine<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.770> verify

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
remove parts of the engine to verify

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.720 
remove parts of the engine to verify
that<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.460> engine<00:05:28.760> is<00:05:30.340> mechanically<00:05:31.340> in<00:05:31.490> time

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
that the engine is mechanically in time

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.090 
that the engine is mechanically in time
so<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.090> set<00:05:33.050> up<00:05:33.169> these<00:05:33.320> you<00:05:33.740> set<00:05:33.950> up<00:05:34.010> the

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
so you set up these you set up the

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.060 
so you set up these you set up the
timing<00:05:34.400> marks<00:05:34.669> and<00:05:35.500> make<00:05:36.500> sure<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.890> those

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
timing marks and make sure that those

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.260 
timing marks and make sure that those
timing<00:05:37.430> marks<00:05:37.640> are<00:05:37.790> lined<00:05:37.880> up<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.180> way

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
timing marks are lined up the way

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.010 
timing marks are lined up the way
they're<00:05:38.419> supposed<00:05:38.570> to<00:05:38.840> be

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
they're supposed to be

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.840 
they're supposed to be
you<00:05:39.680> can<00:05:39.830> usually<00:05:39.950> check<00:05:40.280> some<00:05:40.520> form<00:05:40.729> of

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
you can usually check some form of

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.340 
you can usually check some form of
service<00:05:41.180> manual<00:05:41.540> in<00:05:41.810> order<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.110> get<00:05:42.229> that

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
service manual in order to get that

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.940 
service manual in order to get that
information<00:05:42.700> okay<00:05:43.700> and<00:05:43.850> lastly<00:05:44.350> to<00:05:45.350> check<00:05:45.620> the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
information okay and lastly to check the

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.740 
information okay and lastly to check the
mechanical<00:05:46.520> health<00:05:46.700> of<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.030> engine<00:05:47.390> and<00:05:47.600> its

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
mechanical health of the engine and its

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.420 
mechanical health of the engine and its
compression<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.860> check<00:05:49.100> that<00:05:49.130> with<00:05:49.400> a

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
compression you check that with a

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.060 
compression you check that with a
compression<00:05:50.000> gauge<00:05:50.270> which<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.350> don't<00:05:51.770> have

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
compression gauge which I don't have

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.920 
compression gauge which I don't have
here<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.700> actually<00:05:53.210> I<00:05:53.240> think<00:05:53.540> I<00:05:53.630> could<00:05:53.780> should

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
here and actually I think I could should

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.990 
here and actually I think I could should

do a separate video just on checking

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.909 
do a separate video just on checking
engine<00:05:56.360> compression<00:05:56.720> once<00:05:57.320> again<00:05:57.530> check<00:05:57.890> the

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
engine compression once again check the

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.830 
engine compression once again check the

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
mechanical health of the engine in order

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.920 
mechanical health of the engine in order
to<00:06:00.080> verify<00:06:00.530> that<00:06:01.000> mechanically<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.660> engine

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
to verify that mechanically the engine

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.830 
to verify that mechanically the engine
is<00:06:03.050> sound<00:06:03.350> enough<00:06:03.680> to<00:06:04.360> produce<00:06:05.360> power

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
is sound enough to produce power

spark<00:06:09.410> fuel<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:10.550> timing<00:06:11.270> so<00:06:11.720> the<00:06:11.840> engine<00:06:12.050> has

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
spark fuel and timing so the engine has
