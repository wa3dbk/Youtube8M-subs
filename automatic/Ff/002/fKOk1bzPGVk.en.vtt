00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 I love sport camera work here on the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 start in this video is about when 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.649
 Should you train during the day when is 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.330
 the perfect time in the morning at noon 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.620
 or in the evening and many I have that 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.330
 asked I thought I'll take a quick look 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.799
 As a rule, you have to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.109
 first ask two questions when 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.279
 I manage to do it anyway 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.410
 completely then I still have to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.510
 I have to go to school to work 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.400
 you can study and of course you can 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.170
 just watch it morning noon and night 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.849
 and the second and certainly 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.349
 the most important question is what goal has 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.849
 i even want a little bit 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.369
 reduce fat through endurance training 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.530
 For example, or I want something 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.600
 build muscle mass 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.239
 These are actually two factors 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 which have an influence on when I am 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.110
 should train day 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 let's go to the very beginning 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.890
 early in the morning before breakfast 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 example, there are many rumors to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.180
 For example, on an empty stomach in the morning 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.920
 Exercise and so on, as a rule 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.480
 you should first know in the morning after 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.430
 it is like that when I get up 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 get up is mine he has my blood sugar 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.899
 So much of my insulin level 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 mental sugar levels in the cellar and for that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.299
 is my cortisol mirror relatively far 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.670
 top cortisol is a hormone what's up 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.070
 all a catapult metabolism process 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.530
 yes in the gang brings is there to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.900
 For example, lipolysis is one of when 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.650
 The lipolysis keeps that in mind 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.630
 is, so to speak, the splitting of fetzer 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.549
 That means in the morning is the body 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.860
 actually busy somewhere 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.689
 to get his energy forth because we 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 for example, the carbohydrate or 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.650
 Glykogenspeicher not filled up 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.270
 we still have no energy and then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.079
 the body wants its own somewhere 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.360
 take energy 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.100
 that means he is in the end in the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.439
 kata bohlen condition and would like then 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 like the fatty acids socio is approaching 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.759
 split, so to speak, to get energy 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.340
 Of course it is a good thing to do 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.960
 For example, a short cardio workout too 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.759
 if you really have the goal 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.450
 lose weight or get fat too 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.759
 burn 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.890
 but usually 20 to 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.560
 30 minutes in the morning before breakfast 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.850
 because you really if more than 30 now 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 minutes in the morning then trained without 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.439
 really to have energy 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.990
 even the whole fails and yes im 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.330
 end effect totally broken then you are 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.580
 also needs a certain amount of energy 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.500
 it's just not going to last forever 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.330
 that's why energy was available there 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.700
 in the morning before breakfast my 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.650
 Recommendation a short cardio workout of 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.320
 20 to 30 minutes that could be great 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.790
 if you senate for example 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.370
 definition phase since in calories 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.080
 would like to have deficit at the end of the day 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.820
 or if you just like that said 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.820
 would like to reduce fat or 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.450
 would like to reduce body weight is that 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.970
 a good thing in general you should 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.830
 if you are in the morning for example 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.930
 this training and there in the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.850
 Fat burning is coming in the end 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.900
 still the calorie balance crucial 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.030
 that means it does not matter if you 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.130
 burns a bit of calories in the morning 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.890
 or fat burning through them 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.260
 hypothesis and at the end of the day is yours 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.600
 balance thanks to this positive again because 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.580
 you have eaten in between , yeah 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.470
 You may like to drink coffee before drinking caffeine 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.360
 For example, this one will still inspire you 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.790
 little bit of that on this one 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.560
 fatburner often on it lyko bla bla bla bla 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.630
 bla bla there is always that way 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.130
 A sales volume usually suffices 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.700
 but if the coffee has to drink but 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.350
 Not be 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.330
 you actually come into this hypothesis 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.080
 directly because we said planking in the kata 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.390
 state his 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.850
 so almost always together in the morning 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.860
 the breakfast a tip in any case 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.230
 for all the a bit fat resp 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.510
 Want to lose weight a hard one 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.130
 However, strength training is due to the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.230
 missing energy actually here 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.060
 really not recommended 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.340
 For all who really want a split workout 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.830
 doing or intensive strength training is 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.660
 then already really very important that he 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.070
 glycogen storage stuffed that is you 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.930
 can actually do that with weight training 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.280
 after breakfast first board 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.959
 and I would miss you too 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.120
 between breakfast and weight training 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.769
 Allow at least an hour's break 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.930
 that really all energy storage 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.239
 may be filled shortly before the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.730
 training is still a bit smart 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.040
 Glucose is a principle of grape sugar 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.550
 have or have a banana before a 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.870
 schipper monza a screen exactly and 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.610
 then it runs quite well in bodybuilding 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.959
 still looks in the morning already, as I said 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.400
 just to be in front of you 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.230
 weight training like me your energy 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.739
 thus memory have filled it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.640
 works well and everything else 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.620
 one can still say 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.720
 in the end it is actually the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.489
 rest of the day really just about that 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.810
 you have supplied the energy if you 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.070
 she really needs to think about it 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.690
 in the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.520
 when did I train to this 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.250
 time the energy for that whole 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.020
 important yes that should actually synonymous 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.810
 your daily routine or expire 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.570
 Tune in on this 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.860
 ie when do I train and then look 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.200
 you just that you really before 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.150
 what has it or 1 memory are full 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.310
 with me is actually such a rule me 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.020
 am student I have to say often stand 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.450
 relatively late on the cover eleven or 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.760
 Breaking twelve makes us very strong 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.550
 deep with youtube and so on youtube 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.320
 and that's why I'm so often 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.260
 around 12 o'clock maybe more first 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.610
 get up and then eat something delicious then 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.830
 I get such a swing with me 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.290
 actually ideal 15 16 clock so my thing 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.940
 where i really always remember about years 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.710
 even as I have actually a 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.570
 powerful motors can tell you the best 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.280
 tell it to everyone 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.170
 something different depending on how 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.030
 The rhythm is so warm at work though 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.250
 escapes and so on that you should 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.690
 for you to find out is the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.300
 two points in the morning before breakfast 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.040
 really only if you have some calories 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.370
 wants to burn or fat 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.710
 if your goal is to lose weight or stop 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.540
 a definition phase when the cardio 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.520
 Part of the word is still in front of the word 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.500
 Weight training is ideal for all those 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.940
 seriously want to do weight training 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.010
 I would already recommend you 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.530
 early in the morning after the 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.450
 Breakfast or stop in the afternoon 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.710
 to train just because you notice 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.030
 that they are simply a much better 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.440
 had energy and strength 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.720
 we can still play with it 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.700
 training easter and so on but must 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.710
 would not be recommended now 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.940
 I do not recommend you now because 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.430
 in the end, it brings you so synonymous 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.990
 little rouge will not bring you the 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.120
 energy that you a guided 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.590
 can bring glycogen storage and 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.600
 so pay attention as I said 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.120
 In the morning, burn fat for all those 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.810
 want to lose weight 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.430
 really pay attention to the here too 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.170
 calorie balance again yes I am always 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.580
 still, of course, the role and 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.400
 first training the energy 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.990
 there is so I'm out I repeat 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.760
 i always lama too much i just have to 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.290
 times need to touch of a button always there 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.950
 one behind, the camera is easy 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.830
 make up 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.090
 Well, watch music more I am 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.500
 Maybe you can watch the video 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.250
 help a little further I hope so 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.250
 but I'm out
