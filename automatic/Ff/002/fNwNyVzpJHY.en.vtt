Korea and my first time working with OGN
and<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.049> thought<00:00:51.260> it<00:00:51.379> was<00:00:51.499> really<00:00:51.739> well

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
and I thought it was really well

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
produced and well made I think that my

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.049 
produced and well made I think that my
biggest<00:00:57.049> complaint<00:00:57.469> is<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:58.429> scheduling<00:00:58.940> was

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
biggest complaint is the scheduling was

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.359 
biggest complaint is the scheduling was
a<00:00:59.089> bit<00:00:59.269> off<00:00:59.449> since<00:01:00.049> we<00:01:00.649> were<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.799> bit<00:01:00.979> rushed<00:01:01.190> to
