 We'll need a cushion where 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.470
 also need a year in orange color 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.750
 What agreement, since even a good color 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.960
 It's just the way I thought it was. 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.790
 There you will ask me more than what kind of 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.340
 The plan that I'm going to buy so much can 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.130
 you buy a filter that tissue 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.600
 more cuddly like another type of fabric 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.760
 You go there at the fabric store said 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.090
 so I want to have been playing for 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.780
 cushion there seller will indicate the ideal 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.120
 for you 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.790
 then you will cut the fabric of the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.700
 The size of your child will measure more 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.009
 less so, or it overlaps with 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.259
 cushion to see how it stayed is only 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.390
 pass the machine or you can also paste 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.720
 with hot glue the sides 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.789
 there to finish sewing for 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.789
 last with line even by hand 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.670
 to do the part of the little eyes I 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.350
 I used a white fabric that is the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.560
 Any fabric that tim cook it was 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.840
 retail and also the center in black color 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.630
 that the format of the eyes that perfect that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.090
 I did I used these covers so 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.549
 glass as a mold that they are 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.469
 round is easy so you will find 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.859
 in your home you can also find in the closet 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.409
 from your home that's just you pick them up 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.750
 as base and with contouring with the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.750
 desired stylus pen 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.239
 now just cut and leave 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.680
 do the part of the best the way that 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.590
 I did I left or the image below the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.129
 and I passed with the pen over 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.010
 same 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.260
 but then how do I do if I have an ipad 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.379
 a tablet or anything you can 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.690
 print the template and use it as 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.849
 base and cut everything right and precise 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.390
 to do it this way exactly like this 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.390
 how I did 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.120
 after reporting everything right 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.400

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.430
 the change but aiming here below the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 video the original image I used 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.579
 to make the cushions then it will be 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.579
 easy for you to do too 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.600
