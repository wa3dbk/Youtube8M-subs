yeah<00:06:47.180> really<00:06:47.870> isn't<00:06:54.670> right<00:06:55.670> so<00:06:56.120> I<00:06:56.150> think<00:06:56.300> that

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
yeah really isn't right so I think that

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.720 
yeah really isn't right so I think that
they<00:06:56.780> should<00:06:56.810> make<00:06:57.050> some<00:06:57.380> changes<00:06:57.890> in<00:06:57.950> it<00:06:58.250> so

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
they should make some changes in it so

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.030 
they should make some changes in it so
that<00:06:58.940> if<00:06:59.060> it<00:06:59.210> is<00:06:59.360> to<00:06:59.570> pass<00:06:59.810> that<00:07:00.530> it<00:07:00.650> won't<00:07:00.830> go

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
that if it is to pass that it won't go

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.730 
that if it is to pass that it won't go
as<00:07:01.220> far<00:07:01.490> as<00:07:01.700> fun<00:07:01.940> to<00:07:02.150> eat<00:07:02.180> every<00:07:03.170> measure<00:07:03.410> that
