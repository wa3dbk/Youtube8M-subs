to<00:02:14.610> sew<00:02:14.760> them<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.959> what<00:02:16.410> we'll<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.739> we

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
to sew them in so what we'll do is we

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.809 
to sew them in so what we'll do is we
start<00:02:17.340> off<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.239> all<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> pillowcases

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
start off we have all the pillowcases

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.309 
start off we have all the pillowcases
when<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:20.910> open<00:02:21.120> application<00:02:21.840> you've<00:02:21.930> got<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
when you open application you've got the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.190 
when you open application you've got the
the<00:02:23.239> order<00:02:24.239> what<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.480> call<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the order what you call it it's like the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.020 
the order what you call it it's like the
flat<00:02:25.470> bit<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.220> stops<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.610> pillow<00:02:26.849> from

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
flat bit and that stops the pillow from

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.120 
flat bit and that stops the pillow from
sliding<00:02:27.330> out<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.260> needs<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.709> be<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
sliding out so that needs to be on the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.820 
sliding out so that needs to be on the
top<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.550> all<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.730> them<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.500> what<00:02:31.500> we'll<00:02:31.650> do

pillow and place it on there and sew it
down<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:24.020> side<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.530> I'll<00:04:24.710> do<00:04:24.889> that<00:04:24.919> for<00:04:25.340> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
down the side and I'll do that for the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.170 
down the side and I'll do that for the
other<00:04:25.610> two<00:04:25.880> as<00:04:26.030> well<00:04:27.250> okay<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.280> we<00:04:28.639> soon<00:04:28.910> our

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
other two as well okay so we soon our

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.960 
other two as well okay so we soon our
five<00:04:29.570> pillowcases<00:04:30.500> together<00:04:30.949> now<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:31.940> just

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
five pillowcases together now so it just

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.779 
five pillowcases together now so it just
looks<00:04:32.270> like<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.419> long<00:04:32.630> piece<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.960> material<00:04:33.080> and

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
looks like a long piece of material and

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.029 
looks like a long piece of material and
if<00:04:34.789> you're<00:04:35.150> not<00:04:35.300> using<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.780> floor<00:04:35.990> cushion<00:04:36.500> I

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
if you're not using the floor cushion I

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.529 
if you're not using the floor cushion I
thought<00:04:37.490> would<00:04:37.610> be<00:04:37.639> quite<00:04:37.849> a<00:04:37.880> good<00:04:38.090> idea<00:04:38.360> to

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
thought would be quite a good idea to

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.810 
thought would be quite a good idea to
sort<00:04:38.720> be<00:04:39.110> able<00:04:39.289> to<00:04:39.410> rolled<00:04:39.650> them<00:04:39.889> up<00:04:40.220> so<00:04:40.610> what

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
sort be able to rolled them up so what

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.570 
sort be able to rolled them up so what
I've<00:04:40.940> done<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.479> I'm<00:04:41.960> using<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.949> jersey
