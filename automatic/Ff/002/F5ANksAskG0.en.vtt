lighted<00:00:17.369> window<00:00:17.699> clean<00:00:18.000> mobile<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> had<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
lighted window clean mobile but we had a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
lighted window clean mobile but we had a
world<00:00:19.410> foster<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.699> tell<00:00:20.939> us<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.090> little<00:00:21.180> bit

world foster and so tell us a little bit

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.050 
world foster and so tell us a little bit
how<00:00:22.109> how<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.619> robot<00:00:23.100> works<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.699> see<00:00:23.880> there's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
how how the robot works we see there's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.410 
how how the robot works we see there's
two<00:00:24.869> pieces<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.640> window<00:00:27.029> cleaner

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
two pieces here so this window cleaner

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.519 
two pieces here so this window cleaner
is<00:00:27.779> adapting<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> permanent<00:00:28.949> magnet<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.529> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
is adapting the permanent magnet so so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.840 
is adapting the permanent magnet so so
it<00:00:32.420> consists<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:34.050> copper<00:00:34.559> bow<00:00:34.770> unit<00:00:35.130> so

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it consists of a copper bow unit so

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.690 
it consists of a copper bow unit so
foster<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> people<00:00:37.200> most<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> window

how<00:00:44.850> powerful<00:00:45.300> magnets<00:00:45.899> would<00:00:46.559> work<00:00:46.920> on

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
how powerful magnets would work on

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.279 
how powerful magnets would work on
double<00:00:47.399> pane<00:00:47.610> yeah<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:49.620> robot<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.700> used

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
double pane yeah this robot can be used

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.830 
double pane yeah this robot can be used
from<00:00:52.670> 16<00:00:53.670> millimeter<00:00:54.120> thickness<00:00:54.420> table

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.880 
glasses to 25 millimeter thickness of
glasses<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:59.719> we<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.350> show<00:01:01.500> us<00:01:01.649> both

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
glasses can we can you just show us both

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.200 
glasses can we can you just show us both
sides<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.730> yeah

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
sides here yeah

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.870 
sides here yeah
so<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.170> our<00:01:06.380> patron<00:01:06.950> citizen<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.760> is

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
so this is our patron citizen so this is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.920 
so this is our patron citizen so this is
the<00:01:07.970> navigation<00:01:08.120> this<00:01:08.930> navigation<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.250> we<00:01:10.400> can

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
the navigation this navigation so we can

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.890 
the navigation this navigation so we can
control<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.140> magnet<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:14.330> according<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.810> the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
control the magnet so according to the

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.110 
control the magnet so according to the
thickness<00:01:15.080> of<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.710> glasses<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.550> people<00:01:16.880> can

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
thickness of the glasses the people can

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.399 
thickness of the glasses the people can
control<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.260> magnet<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.830> power<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.430> turn

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.569 

and<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:24.530> that's<00:01:24.679> is<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:25.039> just<00:01:25.219> moving<00:01:25.520> a

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
and so that's is that just moving a

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.050 
and so that's is that just moving a
magnet<00:01:25.759> right<00:01:26.090> yes<00:01:26.539> yeah<00:01:27.499> and<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:28.670> how<00:01:28.850> big

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
magnet right yes yeah and so so how big

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.819 
magnet right yes yeah and so so how big

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.060 
force kimeta okay
and<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.020> tell<00:01:35.259> me<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.409> little<00:01:35.530> bit<00:01:35.680> about<00:01:35.799> that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
and so tell me a little bit about that

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.910 
and so tell me a little bit about that
you<00:01:36.520> talked<00:01:36.790> about<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.000> navigation<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:38.110> is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
you talked about the navigation is it is

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.580 
you talked about the navigation is it is
it<00:01:39.100> actually<00:01:39.520> plotting<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.570> path<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.110> random

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
it actually plotting a path is it random

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.139 
it actually plotting a path is it random
and<00:01:41.770> just<00:01:41.950> doing<00:01:42.280> coverage<00:01:42.729> how<00:01:42.880> does<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.060> make

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
and just doing coverage how does it make

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.539 
and just doing coverage how does it make
sure<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.509> cleans<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.840> whole<00:01:44.049> window<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
sure that it cleans the whole window the

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.880 
sure that it cleans the whole window the
tile<00:01:45.820> Collegium<00:01:46.330> is<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.630> first<00:01:46.869> if<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.590> stick

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
tile Collegium is the first if you stick

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.179 
tile Collegium is the first if you stick
together<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:50.670> foster<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.360> town<00:01:53.049> then<00:01:53.920> to

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
together then foster to the town then to

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.490 
together then foster to the town then to
the<00:01:54.310> bottom<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.270> in<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.539> situation<00:01:55.929> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
the bottom so in this situation the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.340 
the bottom so in this situation the
robot<00:01:56.890> can<00:01:57.130> check<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.720> length<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.140> weave

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
robot can check the length of the weave

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.440 
robot can check the length of the weave
so<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.220> does<00:02:00.399> first<00:02:00.700> come<00:02:01.000> here<00:02:01.030> right

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
so it does first come here right

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.380 
so it does first come here right
orientation<00:02:01.750> all<00:02:02.320> right<00:02:02.500> yeah<00:02:03.179> how<00:02:04.179> do<00:02:04.240> you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
orientation all right yeah how do you

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.990 
orientation all right yeah how do you
actually<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.459> started

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
actually get it started

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.100 
actually get it started
I<00:02:07.030> mean<00:02:07.209> here<00:02:07.539> we<00:02:07.659> have<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.810> free-standing

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
I mean here we have a free-standing

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.170 
I mean here we have a free-standing
window<00:02:08.709> but<00:02:08.979> any<00:02:09.519> two<00:02:09.700> people<00:02:09.910> -<00:02:10.390> no<00:02:11.019> no<00:02:11.200> no<00:02:12.180> so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
window but any two people - no no no so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.210 
window but any two people - no no no so
later<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.600> will<00:02:14.019> have<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.470> access<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.950> like

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
later you will have the access to like

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.970 
later you will have the access to like
this<00:02:15.459> for<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> stick<00:02:16.330> together<00:02:16.510> here<00:02:17.080> then

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this for the stick together here then

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.400 
this for the stick together here then
another<00:02:18.340> side<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.090> people<00:02:19.420> can<00:02:19.630> stick

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
another side that the people can stick

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.990 
another side that the people can stick
together<00:02:20.560> yeah<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.280> say<00:02:21.670> you're<00:02:21.819> hanging

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
together yeah so say you're hanging

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.970 
together yeah so say you're hanging
you're<00:02:22.269> hanging<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.660> your<00:02:22.810> right<00:02:22.959> ear<00:02:22.989> front

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
you're hanging on your right ear front

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.509 
you're hanging on your right ear front
area<00:02:24.190> by<00:02:24.400> area<00:02:24.549> so<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.920> wouldn't<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.340> good

our<00:02:45.040> country<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:45.730> Korea<00:02:45.970> they're<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.900> first

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
we exported to Europe and I think an

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.770 
we exported to Europe and I think an
extra<00:02:50.230> step<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.950> America<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:51.670> from<00:02:52.030> April

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
extra step is to America so from April

extra step is to America so from April
the<00:02:52.900> people<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.609> robot<00:02:54.790> here<00:02:55.269> in<00:02:55.450> USA

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
the people can see the robot here in USA

the people can see the robot here in USA
and<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:57.010> how<00:02:57.130> much<00:02:57.190> work<00:02:57.609> so<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.209> think<00:02:58.329> the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and and how much work so I think the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.720 
and and how much work so I think the
retail<00:02:59.079> price<00:02:59.290> will<00:02:59.620> be<00:02:59.769> around<00:03:00.100> four<00:03:00.700> hundred

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
retail price will be around four hundred
