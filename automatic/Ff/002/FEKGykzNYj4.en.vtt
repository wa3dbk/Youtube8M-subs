hours to beat the game on 95 so this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.470 
hours to beat the game on 95 so this
being<00:01:37.100> night<00:01:37.250> for<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.520> don't<00:01:37.670> expect<00:01:38.030> myself<00:01:38.270> to

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
being night for I don't expect myself to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.240 
being night for I don't expect myself to
get<00:01:38.630> very<00:01:38.870> far<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:39.620> I'm<00:01:39.740> gonna<00:01:39.830> keep<00:01:39.920> trying

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
get very far but I'm gonna keep trying

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.220 
get very far but I'm gonna keep trying
of<00:01:40.370> course<00:01:40.580> it's<00:01:41.480> pretty<00:01:41.690> early<00:01:41.840> into<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
of course it's pretty early into the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.710 
of course it's pretty early into the
game<00:01:42.410> it's<00:01:42.860> about<00:01:42.980> midnight<00:01:43.610> right<00:01:43.760> now<00:01:43.910> so<00:01:44.630> it

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
game it's about midnight right now so it

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.270 
game it's about midnight right now so it
should<00:01:44.870> be<00:01:44.900> pretty<00:01:44.990> good<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:45.740> currently<00:01:46.130> I

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
should be pretty good it is currently I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.460 
should be pretty good it is currently I
think<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.000> takes<00:01:47.150> about<00:01:47.300> two<00:01:47.630> minutes<00:01:47.660> or<00:01:48.230> so

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
think it takes about two minutes or so
