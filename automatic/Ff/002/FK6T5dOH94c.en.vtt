00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.150
 ah 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.530
 do not 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.170
 Hi, I'm Paula Soroa and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.050
 How to make up for this Christmas 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.580
 the lips in perfect red and ones 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.400
 tricks for you to hold all the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.349
 night first let's apply a base of 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.349
 makeup around the entire lip 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.070
 to recover the drawing of the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.020
 lip if it has been lost for some 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.820
 pupa or has sold 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.560
 and we're going to drag it a little bit 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.210
 the lip we can use the bar 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.530
 directly on the lip but for 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.870
 more precision I always prefer 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.520
 work with a brush because we arrived 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.050
 much better at the corner and we can 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.050
 better draw the contour of the lip 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.950
 that fills it the first to the part a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.030
 little bit below and then and 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.030
 directly up 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.030
 to look for the arch 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.030
 A) Yes 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.900
 before 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.060
 a trick to accept yourself is 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.130
 Stretch the lips because it slides 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.130
 better the brush or the bar failing 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.000
 if you use a brush it is very important 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.440
 that does not have loose hairs but that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.370
 are unified because those polyps to 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.180
 Sometimes they make the drawing 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.180
 Do not break 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.229
 the 15 the good thing that we can get right to 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.229
 the commissure 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 two
