from<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.360> scan<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:27.410> most<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.159> damage

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
from the scan that most of the damage

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.639 
from the scan that most of the damage
was<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.820> front<00:01:29.149> of<00:01:29.360> his<00:01:29.630> brain<00:01:29.899> but<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
was to the front of his brain but the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.649 
was to the front of his brain but the
implications<00:01:31.159> of<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.310> were<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:32.090> he<00:01:32.420> would

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
implications of that were that he would

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.990 
implications of that were that he would
have<00:01:32.899> difficulty<00:01:33.530> with<00:01:33.560> cognitive<00:01:34.310> function

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
have difficulty with cognitive function

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.740 
have difficulty with cognitive function
and<00:01:35.319> there<00:01:36.319> would<00:01:36.470> be<00:01:36.500> behavioral<00:01:36.950> issues<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
and there would be behavioral issues the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.649 
and there would be behavioral issues the
worst<00:01:39.050> thing<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:40.130> think<00:01:40.460> for<00:01:40.880> both<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.270> us<00:01:41.390> is

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
worst thing is I think for both of us is

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.190 
worst thing is I think for both of us is
that<00:01:41.720> they're<00:01:42.320> not<00:01:42.610> immediately<00:01:43.610> evident<00:01:44.200> his

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
that they're not immediately evident his

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.749 
that they're not immediately evident his
brain<00:01:45.439> doesn't<00:01:45.710> tell<00:01:46.009> him<00:01:46.220> when<00:01:46.369> he's<00:01:46.579> hungry

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
brain doesn't tell him when he's hungry

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.420 
brain doesn't tell him when he's hungry
so<00:01:47.509> he<00:01:47.689> has<00:01:47.840> great<00:01:48.079> difficulties<00:01:48.770> around<00:01:49.100> food

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
so he has great difficulties around food

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.719 
so he has great difficulties around food
he<00:01:50.390> gets<00:01:50.600> overexcited<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.829> doesn't<00:01:52.250> can't

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
he gets overexcited and doesn't can't

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.649 
he gets overexcited and doesn't can't
stop<00:01:53.149> talking<00:01:53.810> people<00:01:54.460> sometimes<00:01:55.460> think<00:01:55.820> he's

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
stop talking people sometimes think he's

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.969 
stop talking people sometimes think he's
just<00:01:56.930> being<00:01:57.110> foolish<00:01:57.500> or<00:01:57.890> being<00:01:58.189> rude<00:01:58.960> and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
just being foolish or being rude and

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.149 
just being foolish or being rude and
judged<00:02:00.979> him<00:02:01.219> on<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.710> it's<00:02:03.710> his<00:02:03.920> brain

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
judged him on that and it's his brain

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.319 
judged him on that and it's his brain
injury<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:05.659> hidden<00:02:05.869> disability<00:02:06.619> issue
