00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.190
 if you are looking for a sporty and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.830
 caring about puristical car 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.880
 then this new cayman gt4 is accurate 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.789
 the right thing for you 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.859
 and also for me because he owns the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.289
 very modern mid-engine technology 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.689
 can be found in today's sports cars 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 and also in formula 1 the car 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 is characterized by abundant 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 385 horsepower are available 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 There is an aerodynamic package ensures 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.500
 the downforce you need on one 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.660
 Racetrack 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.660
 Here I am and now I'm going to gas 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.690
 Of course , this GT4 will start with 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.579
 the key on the left side 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.079
 and then you hear 385 ps and the 420 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.440
 Newtonmeter torque was the track 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.440
 equal 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.700
 in portugal on the race track portimao 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.590
 is it really good for the cause of the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.770
 race track is extremely demanding 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.200
 and not an easy task for one 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 driver and also for a chassis so 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.390
 let's see so before you start to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.750
 time all electronic driving aids 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:34.579
 and then it becomes very clear what the car 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.560
 in things chassis for effort the 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.709
 entering the gt family of berkshire 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.420
 is now gt4 he is the first 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.610
 gt sports car the porsche cayman 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.210
 model series and straight away the new one 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.320
 athletic reference in its segment 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.850
 yes the whole thing is extremely tight and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.850
 reminds me of a real racing car 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.580
 when turning 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.610
 he is the car very precise 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.369
 So very closely the curves considered a 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.369
 Give the handlebar gas 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.950
 a little bit 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.829
 but the whole thing is really good too 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.160
 check long right turn out 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.220
 accelerate 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.560
 then you can feel the downforce as well 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.080
 man at the front and rear has 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.180
 over 100 kilograms 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.370
 This car generates a kick 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.280
 speed of 280 219 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.060
 but now she is just going down 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.060
 200 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.070
 the canon gt4 carries the genes of the big one 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.530
 Brothers the 911 GT3 chassis brake system 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.330
 and the book trees comes from him be 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.680
 trecker after liter six-cylinder engine 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.900
 with 283 kw comes from 911 carrera s den 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 sprint from 0 to 100 creates the come 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.680
 in 4.4 seconds 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.820
 Erdmann something very interesting 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:15.040
 although I developed a manual here 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.049
 have six-speed transmission 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.350
 controls electronics a bit 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.450
 between gas 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.110
 when turning it down , that makes it 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.110
 easy 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.420
 would be the guard two-door sports car 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.250
 dominated the circuit and there was 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.230
 a debut with a bang for the 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.720
 nÃ¼rburgring nordschleife he needed 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.280
 seven minutes and 40 seconds with the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.230
 gt four represent the Zuffenhausen 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.480
 again your expertise in the construction of 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.670
 exception sports cars in every class 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.930
 under Evidence 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.270
 Time training with the smartphone 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.520
 Porsche track procession app is 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.380
 part of the optional sport chrono 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.450
 Among other things, it enables packages 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:01.290
 timing and visualization of the 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:04.550
 driving dynamics on the mobile phone data 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.550
 the speeds 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.300
 I can start the video from anywhere 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.400
 what then synchronously with the vehicle data 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.460
 is reproduced in a very 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.130
 easy to use that really everyone 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.989
 customer who understands immediately and also 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.870
 can really see what's up 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.940
 a where made the fast and 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.650
 at the same time inexpensive entry into the gt 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.150
 family of industry means now 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.150
 came gt4 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.650
 what do you think about this cayman gt4 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.320
 He is a pure fun car and suitable 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.300
 of course, especially here on the 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.160
 race track to have fun but you can 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.699
 also use it for bread rolls 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.110
 it costs about 85,000 700 euros and for 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.800
 I would like to have that much more money now 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.800
 drive a little or
