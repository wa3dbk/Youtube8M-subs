00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
people address it in their workouts of

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.090 
people address it in their workouts of
the<00:01:36.180> triceps<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.320> hand<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> triceps

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the triceps and the one hand the triceps

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.370 
the triceps and the one hand the triceps
oh<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> lazy<00:01:38.549> head<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.150> actually<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> lot

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
oh the lazy head is actually a lot

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.520 
oh the lazy head is actually a lot
bigger<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.250> its<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.729> size<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.450> density<00:01:42.689> than

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
bigger in its in size and density than

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.499 
bigger in its in size and density than
these<00:01:44.070> short<00:01:44.399> head<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.149> you're<00:01:45.299> not

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
flexors which is what most people think

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.309 
flexors which is what most people think
of<00:02:17.799> when<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.239> forms<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.959> don't

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
of when I think the the forms and don't

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.809 
of when I think the the forms and don't
sleep<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.769> forms<00:02:21.129> because<00:02:21.280> what<00:02:21.519> I've<00:02:21.610> always

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
sleep on forms because what I've always

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.789 
sleep on forms because what I've always
found<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.299> that<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.959> people<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.500> work<00:02:23.769> there

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
found is that the people that work there

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.550 
found is that the people that work there
for<00:02:24.040> arms<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.790> grip<00:02:25.569> strength<00:02:25.599> there's<00:02:26.440> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
for arms and grip strength there's a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920 
for arms and grip strength there's a
large<00:02:26.829> residual<00:02:27.610> effect<00:02:27.970> into<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.390> size<00:02:28.660> and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
large residual effect into the size and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.500 
large residual effect into the size and
density<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.680> your<00:02:30.190> upper<00:02:30.610> arm<00:02:30.819> as<00:02:31.000> well<00:02:31.120> so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
density of your upper arm as well so

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.150 
density of your upper arm as well so
your<00:02:31.660> biceps<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.379> triceps<00:02:32.560> get<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.010> lot<00:02:33.129> of

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
your biceps and triceps get a lot of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.670 
your biceps and triceps get a lot of
work<00:02:33.370> when<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.209> lot<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.810> form<00:02:35.200> work<00:02:35.530> as

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
work when you do a lot of form work as

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.100 
work when you do a lot of form work as
well<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.209> those<00:02:37.209> are<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.510> muscles<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.959> are

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
well so those are the muscles that are

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.020 
well so those are the muscles that are
typically<00:02:38.440> being<00:02:38.650> they<00:02:38.799> gained<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.280> then<00:02:39.879> you

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
typically being they gained it then you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.550 
typically being they gained it then you
need<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> start<00:02:40.480> addressing<00:02:40.599> now<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.290> what

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
need to start addressing now so what

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.170 
need to start addressing now so what
