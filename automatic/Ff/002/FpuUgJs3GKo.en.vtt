00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello friends today how to unlock the 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.099
 leader of all the vehicles that come 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.139
 for this update of the great 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.110
 hits the most anticipated vehicle yo 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.100
 I think that the most everyone is 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.869
 desperate is the hydra the hydra is the 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.599
 vehicle that everyone wants to have but 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.760
 unfortunately it does not come as an option 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.689
 to buy immediately after 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.000
 what low 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.339
 the update we're going to have to do 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.470
 the great blow of human laboratories 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.350
 we're going to have to finish that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.600
 finish and when you have finished this 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.540
 great blow you are going to have available what 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.120
 that is the plane hydra then a lot of eye 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.130
 you have to make that big blow so that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.900
 you can have the leader do not go to 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.630
 get in and think and where is the hydra and 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.730
 you will see it blocked then remember 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.860
 that you have to make this big blow to 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.710
 than having it unlocked since we're 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.770
 talking about leader will have available 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.420
 empire's weapon of free mode because 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.670
 you have to remember that we're going to go 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.080
 steal and lead in one of the missions 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.330
 preparations for the great blow of the 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.490
 human laboratories we 're going to steal the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 leader but it's because he has a weapon that 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.910
 is it 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.520
 is the electromagnetic impulse then 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.780
 we will have that weapon available in the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.910
 free mode because if we have it 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.970
 available in free mode is going to be a 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.210
 huge advantage unless there is a 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.120
 let's say cut or diminished 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.010
 so that it does not become so dominant go 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.660
 because an electromagnetic impulse to your 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.670
 enemy that goes on a plane to which he goes in 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.610
 a helicopter because he is following him 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.890
 even he is watching in a car 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.380
 also the same and can without using the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.990
 auto from your helicopter with that gun 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.930
 so that's a big question that I have 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.340
 and then a few hours later we go to the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.979
 let's discover we will not discover 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.170
 if really that hydra is going to have the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.450
 weapon of it in py to play it in mode 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.310
 free we will discover it in about 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.950
 moments another of the things that they 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.400
 I wanted to mention was this helicopter the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.830
 Saturday and then we already have images of 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.630
 what is going to be let's say the front 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.600
 because in the trailer we only saw 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.250
 images of the back then 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.530
 here we already reach to distinguish 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.900
 clearly a machine gun in the part 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.849
 frontal this machine gun 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 a mind is going to be mobile I'm almost 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.780
 completely sure that it is movable and 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.060
 because with that we are going to have a power of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.739
 impressive attack is going to be a 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.390
 combination of power we are going to have 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.790
 available missiles we are going to have 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.920
 also available what are the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.720
 machine gun on the front and other 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.370
 of the things the crew of this 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.079
 helicopter I think it's going to be 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.450
 two people are able to see how 2 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.700
 hatches probably one is the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.159
 pilot and another one who manages the weapons 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.170
 but then we 're going to discover that already in 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.980
 a few hours more good friends this 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.980
 it was all goodbye
