drown<00:02:05.920> it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.370 

nice<00:02:14.569> drizzle

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.020 

and<00:02:17.860> we're<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.190> do<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.460> again<00:02:18.580> once<00:02:18.880> we

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and we're going to do that again once we

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.310 
and we're going to do that again once we
flip<00:02:19.210> but<00:02:19.450> we're<00:02:19.540> going<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.720> let<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.930> cook<00:02:20.080> for

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
flip but we're going to let it cook for

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.280 
flip but we're going to let it cook for
a<00:02:20.350> little<00:02:20.470> bit<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.560> can<00:02:23.740> test<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:25.290> you're

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
a little bit and you can test it you're

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.570 
a little bit and you can test it you're
definitely<00:02:26.440> going<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.770> want<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.130> Brown<00:02:27.340> you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
definitely going to want it to Brown you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.210 
definitely going to want it to Brown you
don't<00:02:27.820> want<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.240> burn<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.890> don't<00:02:30.070> want

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
don't want it to burn and you don't want

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.800 
don't want it to burn and you don't want
it<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.400> cook<00:02:30.550> too<00:02:30.820> fast<00:02:30.850> because<00:02:31.450> any<00:02:31.570> time

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
it to cook too fast because any time

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.970 
it to cook too fast because any time
that<00:02:31.960> you're<00:02:32.020> caramelizing<00:02:32.290> something

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
that you're caramelizing something

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.350 
that you're caramelizing something
you're<00:02:33.100> bringing<00:02:33.490> out<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.670> natural<00:02:33.700> sugars

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
you're bringing out the natural sugars

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.120 
you're bringing out the natural sugars
so<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:34.930> want<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.170> give<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.380> time<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
so we want to give it time to have the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.500 
so we want to give it time to have the
natural<00:02:36.430> sugars<00:02:36.700> actually<00:02:37.090> come<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:37.330> we

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
natural sugars actually come out we

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.120 
natural sugars actually come out we
don't<00:02:37.630> want<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.810> rush<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.140> process<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
don't want to rush the process but it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.620 
don't want to rush the process but it
shouldn't<00:02:39.400> take<00:02:39.430> longer<00:02:39.760> than<00:02:40.000> 6<00:02:40.300> minutes

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
shouldn't take longer than 6 minutes

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.160 
shouldn't take longer than 6 minutes
tops<00:02:45.180> let's<00:02:46.180> cook<00:02:46.330> for<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> little<00:02:46.750> bit<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.050> can

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
tops let's cook for a little bit I can

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.260 
tops let's cook for a little bit I can
tell<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:48.310> it's<00:02:48.460> starting<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> darken<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
tell that it's starting to darken a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.580 
tell that it's starting to darken a
little<00:02:49.300> bit<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.810> my<00:02:49.930> edges<00:02:50.200> are<00:02:50.290> getting<00:02:50.560> a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
little bit and my edges are getting a

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.050 
little bit and my edges are getting a
little<00:02:50.680> bit<00:02:50.860> brown<00:02:51.070> on<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> bottom<00:02:51.490> side<00:02:51.850> that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
little bit brown on the bottom side that

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.120 
little bit brown on the bottom side that
has<00:02:52.150> been<00:02:52.360> touching<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.320> heat<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.920> I'm<00:02:53.980> going

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
has been touching the heat so I'm going

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.440 
has been touching the heat so I'm going
to<00:02:54.160> flip<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.430> now<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:54.970> I<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.270> make<00:02:55.420> sure

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
to flip it now so that I can make sure

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:06.750 
to flip it now so that I can make sure
the<00:02:55.690> other<00:02:55.840> side<00:02:56.110> gets<00:02:56.350> some<00:02:56.500> honey<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:56.860> well

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.930 

okay

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.610 

and<00:03:10.060> then<00:03:10.570> for<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.960> last<00:03:11.170> little<00:03:11.410> bit<00:03:11.590> of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
and then for the last little bit of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.230 
and then for the last little bit of
honey<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.340> side<00:03:12.520> that<00:03:12.640> didn't<00:03:12.940> get<00:03:13.000> honey

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
honey so the side that didn't get honey

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.390 
honey so the side that didn't get honey
is<00:03:13.420> now<00:03:13.570> going<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.840> get<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.170> tiny<00:03:14.770> tiny<00:03:15.070> honey

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
is now going to get a tiny tiny honey

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.610 
is now going to get a tiny tiny honey
glow

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.460 

okay<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.450> that's<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.750> for<00:03:23.870> your<00:03:23.989> honey<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.290> can

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
okay so that's it for your honey you can

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.400 
okay so that's it for your honey you can
put<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.709> aside<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.690> now<00:03:29.780> lower<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.230> heat

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
put that aside and now lower the heat

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.809 
put that aside and now lower the heat
because<00:03:30.650> again<00:03:30.890> we're<00:03:31.040> just<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.310> slowly

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
because again we're just going to slowly

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.640 
because again we're just going to slowly
allow<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.420> natural<00:03:32.870> sugars<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.260> come<00:03:33.410> out<00:03:33.500> and

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
allow the natural sugars to come out and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:50.690 
allow the natural sugars to come out and
let<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.769> caramelize

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.170 

so<00:03:51.660> we're<00:03:51.810> about<00:03:51.900> done<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.470> could<00:03:52.709> smell<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
so we're about done I could smell it the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.850 
so we're about done I could smell it the
banana<00:03:54.330> starting<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.989> get<00:03:55.080> really<00:03:55.260> soft<00:03:55.650> and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
banana starting to get really soft and

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.620 
banana starting to get really soft and
we<00:03:55.980> have<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.250> nice<00:03:56.520> golden<00:03:57.090> brown<00:03:57.120> coating

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
on the majority of the surface area so

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.000
