 they play inside a mobile device 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.810
 like for example clash of titans that 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.660
 he wants to extract the stacks to be able to 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.060
 play and do not leave them for graphics card 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.650
 and all that because in this video they are going to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 be very helpful since yes 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.350
 that program may be useful for them 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.820
 what is playing here 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.820
 whatever 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 you have what the author and will only 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.410
 serve for what is for the actors 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.080
 android since this program is only 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.330
 available for what it is so that 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.940
 Detect what your ipod or ipad is or 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.420
 iphone so well, let's start with 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.420
 this video 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 good in the link the description of 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.500
 video I'm going to leave what is a link 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 so you can download what is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.030
 the serial of this program and perform the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.350
 program can download 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.909
 if they think they have videos or something 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.670
 and since you have downloaded the 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.250
 installer of him 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.250
 of the reflector you can search for files 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.480
 I do not have the destination folder of their 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.660
 chrome downloads or any other 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.660
 thing 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.990
 like this 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.290
 and then have a folder like this that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.790
 it is this that is here 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.800
 and they are going to make these files 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.420
 well that 's at 15 the installer 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.390
 that this I can also scale it from 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.190
 the original page of the reflector 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.960
 and only this is also just 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.300
 available for what is the windows 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.250
 for the great I have good also I think 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.179
 which is to serve this download first 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.890
 what is the manga installer 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.790
 and how it is done 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.709
 the reflector there is also another folder 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.709
 which is a page for windows 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.760
 original cause 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.349
 josé luís aguiar of what is 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.490
 reflector program for those who 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.250
 we live 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.740
 they would also be lord for those who are 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.510
 and nothing we approach with the installation 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.760
 we're just going to give it a double click 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.760
 he will see what not the administrator 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.070
 and accept the terms and conditions 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.840
 Let's read what he says when he does not know 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.540
 we are going to give him in accept 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.130
 install is going to download what is 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.870
 some files so you can 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.829
 operate this program 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.450
 Unfortunately this does not work for you 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.910
 which is for android devices already 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.550
 what 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.940
 as it is a special program in mind 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.670
 for what these two years 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.670
 it does not work for android because of this 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.550
 will not get them the majority because 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.880
 open the applications 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.920
 they take what is the black screen and 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.290
 does not download the application more than the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.240
 pure sound and well this program does 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.340
 that you can see your ipad iphone or what 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.870
 you want here on the computer and so 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.750
 is how you can open clans classes 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.880
 you can record make videos all that the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.500
 free version nava is going to use the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.930
 10 minutes and departure while I go to 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.500
 record but if you want completely 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.700
 this program put I bring you this 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.810
 once it has been downloaded they give it in 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.270
 finish in final 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.950
 it is here where the direct access of what 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.590
 which is the program has to close to 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.600
 a savior 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.930
 erase what would be 12,000 by the way 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.739
 a thread 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.739
 in the lounge 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.020
 I have to run first there 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.020
 but ghana 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.630
 and he does not know what a nice one we're going to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.670
 give a double click 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.410

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.200
 well we have now comes what comes out of what 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.629
 What is it 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.519

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.090
 things buttons are three do not agree and the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.830
 ask here to enter would be the bamberg 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.350
 and here I am stretching what is the 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.129

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.090
 gift that was already loaded with others 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.090

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.950
 Here we could know what the 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.950
 laugh version purchased 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.680
 to see what was delivered and patriots 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.620
 well once we have here the 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.600
 program we go to what is to our 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.150

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.320
 of adjustment let's see what it is in the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.690
 air play as what with points and ended up in 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.060

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.290
 is going to start loading since not the 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.290
 commented 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.230
 whatever a game 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.880
 I will have for the moment 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.880
 for what the game is 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.670
 x download back here right click what 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.750
 which are different types of water from 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:23.740
 settings like changing the color of the ipad 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:26.689
 rotate it record what what we want 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.439
 and here then simply 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.439
 how to see it 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.650
 already as a staff of those who 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.810
 know and well nothing sorry for this 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.250
 Juarez video has liked those who 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.250
 just right side 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.100
 when they go to fear of what is the 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.300
 ipad do the same to raise the finger 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.669
 up on the bottom 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.039
 to whom the pointer to the other of the ipad 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:02.190
 traiguera should be the normal and how 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.740
 could be removed no longer simply if 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.180
 you want to close what this 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.610
 program is what the anecdote would have done 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.500
 If you are already going to detect what is 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.960
 you climb the computers and it will come back in 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:18.630
 double click and open the program 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.630
 because it's just everything 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.660
 and
