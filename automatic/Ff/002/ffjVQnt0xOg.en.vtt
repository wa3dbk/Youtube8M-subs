88 in what else did I need I think I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.429 
88 in what else did I need I think I
need<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.510> rank-up-magic<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.230> think<00:02:37.379> I

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
need like the rank-up-magic I think I

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.509 
need like the rank-up-magic I think I
only<00:02:37.560> got<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.769> one<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.219> rank-up-magic

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
only got like one of the rank-up-magic

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.190 
only got like one of the rank-up-magic
from<00:02:38.939> both<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.209> my<00:02:39.269> boxes<00:02:39.569> which<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.959> kind<00:02:40.139> of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
from both of my boxes which is kind of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.709 
from both of my boxes which is kind of
crazy<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.919> I<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:42.150> it's<00:02:42.299> pretty<00:02:42.389> much<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
crazy and I think it's pretty much it

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.059 
crazy and I think it's pretty much it
cuz<00:02:42.930> I'm<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.230> course<00:02:43.439> working<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.889> gimmick

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
cuz I'm of course working on a gimmick

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.099 
cuz I'm of course working on a gimmick
puppet<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.579> profiled<00:02:44.969> the<00:02:45.090> McHale<00:02:45.750> se<00:02:45.959> da

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
puppet that profiled the McHale se da

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.990 
puppet that profiled the McHale se da
it's<00:02:46.319> really<00:02:46.530> firm<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.769> number<00:02:47.040> collection<00:02:47.849> I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it's really firm a number collection I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.270 
it's really firm a number collection I
don't<00:02:48.659> plan<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> use<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.169> in<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.799> deck<00:02:49.919> profile

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
don't plan to use it in the deck profile

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.189 
don't plan to use it in the deck profile
just<00:02:50.669> because<00:02:50.939> I<00:02:51.209> don't<00:02:51.359> like<00:02:51.480> number<00:02:51.780> 88<00:02:52.079> as

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:52.199 
just because I don't like number 88 as

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.330 
just because I don't like number 88 as
much<00:02:52.379> I<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.829> little<00:02:53.010> harder<00:02:53.219> to<00:02:53.250> use

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
much I think it's a little harder to use

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.819 
much I think it's a little harder to use
its<00:02:53.639> effect<00:02:53.730> although<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.299> cool<00:02:54.480> card<00:02:54.829> but

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
its effect although it's a cool card but

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.979 
its effect although it's a cool card but
yeah<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.579> think<00:02:56.699> the<00:02:57.269> rank<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.599> it's<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.900> only

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
yeah I think the rank of it's the only

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.750 
yeah I think the rank of it's the only
thing<00:02:58.169> I<00:02:58.260> need<00:02:58.439> in<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.250> magnet<00:02:59.730> all<00:03:01.489> for<00:03:02.489> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
thing I need in a magnet all for the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.599 
thing I need in a magnet all for the
deck<00:03:02.909> profile<00:03:03.209> on<00:03:03.359> that<00:03:04.280> see<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.519> get

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
deck profile on that see if we can get

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.670 
deck profile on that see if we can get
those<00:03:05.840> anyway<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:06.959> have<00:03:07.079> for<00:03:07.230> information

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
those anyway we have for information

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.459 
those anyway we have for information
Tinky<00:03:08.069> we<00:03:08.909> have<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.419> gimmick<00:03:09.780> puppet<00:03:09.870> dreary
