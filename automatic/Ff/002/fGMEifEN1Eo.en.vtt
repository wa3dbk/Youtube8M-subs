the<00:05:27.450> show<00:05:27.660> you<00:05:28.590> know<00:05:28.620> this<00:05:29.520> is<00:05:29.550> something

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
the show you know this is something

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.340 
the show you know this is something
that's<00:05:30.480> kind<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.810> come<00:05:31.020> up<00:05:31.110> in<00:05:31.230> the<00:05:31.260> last

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
that's kind of come up in the last

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.960 
that's kind of come up in the last
couple<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.860> weeks<00:05:32.070> that<00:05:32.160> I'm<00:05:32.340> still<00:05:32.580> trying<00:05:32.910> to

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
couple of weeks that I'm still trying to

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.970 
couple of weeks that I'm still trying to
get<00:05:33.090> my<00:05:33.150> arms<00:05:33.660> around<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:34.169> I<00:05:34.350> don't<00:05:34.740> know<00:05:34.830> that

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
get my arms around it I don't know that

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.130 
get my arms around it I don't know that
it's<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:35.220> saving<00:05:35.640> a<00:05:35.760> money<00:05:36.030> thing<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.630> think<00:05:36.690> it's

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
it's a saving a money thing I think it's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.159 
it's a saving a money thing I think it's
more<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:38.190> keep<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.610> competitive<00:05:39.270> nature<00:05:39.510> of

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
more to keep the competitive nature of

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.990 
more to keep the competitive nature of
this<00:05:40.320> for<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.860> what<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.190> drivers<00:05:41.610> want<00:05:41.880> is

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
this for and what the drivers want is

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.580 
this for and what the drivers want is
they<00:05:42.150> want<00:05:42.180> throttle<00:05:42.900> control<00:05:43.320> in<00:05:43.470> other

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
they want throttle control in other

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.070 
they want throttle control in other
words<00:05:43.740> they<00:05:43.830> want

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
words they want

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.899 
words they want
the<00:05:44.259> mash<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.680> gas<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:45.220> then<00:05:45.280> come<00:05:45.520> back<00:05:45.550> off

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909 
the mash the gas and then come back off

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.390 
the mash the gas and then come back off
from<00:05:46.120> it<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.419> lesser<00:05:47.259> horsepower<00:05:47.800> means<00:05:48.129> we

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
from it and lesser horsepower means we

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.920 
from it and lesser horsepower means we
might<00:05:48.879> be<00:05:49.120> able<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.330> get<00:05:49.479> away<00:05:49.569> from<00:05:49.689> our

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
might be able to get away from our

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.869 
might be able to get away from our
stricter<00:05:50.319> plates<00:05:50.560> where<00:05:51.069> they<00:05:51.220> just<00:05:51.400> run<00:05:51.580> wide

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
stricter plates where they just run wide

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.749 
stricter plates where they just run wide
open<00:05:52.509> so<00:05:52.960> there's<00:05:53.199> that<00:05:53.469> factor<00:05:53.979> involved<00:05:54.430> in

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
open so there's that factor involved in

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.330 
open so there's that factor involved in
it<00:05:54.879> as<00:05:55.030> well<00:05:55.330> as<00:05:55.870> some<00:05:56.199> cost<00:05:56.530> savings<00:05:56.680> not

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
it as well as some cost savings not

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.610 
it as well as some cost savings not
necessarily<00:05:58.150> with<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.479> smaller<00:05:58.810> engine<00:05:59.379> size

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
necessarily with the smaller engine size

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.709 
necessarily with the smaller engine size
but<00:05:59.979> one<00:06:00.370> of<00:06:00.460> the<00:06:00.580> things<00:06:00.789> NASCAR's<00:06:01.330> kind<00:06:01.599> of

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
but one of the things NASCAR's kind of

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.270 
but one of the things NASCAR's kind of
floating<00:06:02.050> out<00:06:02.169> there<00:06:02.199> is<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.530> chance<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:03.069> run

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
floating out there is a chance to run

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.129 
floating out there is a chance to run
these<00:06:03.430> engines<00:06:03.909> two<00:06:04.180> weeks<00:06:04.419> or<00:06:04.659> maybe<00:06:04.780> three

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
these engines two weeks or maybe three

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.830 
these engines two weeks or maybe three
races<00:06:05.349> so<00:06:05.770> there's<00:06:06.310> a<00:06:06.430> lot<00:06:06.849> involved<00:06:07.360> in<00:06:07.719> this

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
races so there's a lot involved in this

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.260 
races so there's a lot involved in this
process<00:06:08.169> and<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.740> lot<00:06:08.979> of<00:06:09.159> steps<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.610> go<00:06:09.759> NASCAR

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
process and a lot of steps to go NASCAR

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.730 
process and a lot of steps to go NASCAR
has<00:06:10.629> had<00:06:10.810> some<00:06:11.050> meetings<00:06:11.199> with<00:06:11.469> the<00:06:11.560> team

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
has had some meetings with the team

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.290 
has had some meetings with the team
owners<00:06:12.069> going<00:06:12.340> to<00:06:12.430> have<00:06:12.550> some<00:06:12.759> more<00:06:12.969> meetings

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
owners going to have some more meetings

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.600 
owners going to have some more meetings
before<00:06:13.479> they<00:06:13.780> decide<00:06:14.110> on<00:06:14.289> anything<00:06:14.560> and<00:06:14.889> we'll

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
before they decide on anything and we'll

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.540 
before they decide on anything and we'll
have<00:06:15.759> to<00:06:15.819> see<00:06:16.180> if<00:06:16.389> this<00:06:16.810> is<00:06:16.870> a<00:06:17.020> 2015<00:06:17.919> prospect

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
have to see if this is a 2015 prospect

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.879 
have to see if this is a 2015 prospect
if<00:06:18.969> it's<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.270> prospect<00:06:19.750> for<00:06:19.870> beyond<00:06:20.169> that<00:06:20.379> or<00:06:20.590> if

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
if it's a prospect for beyond that or if

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.379 
if it's a prospect for beyond that or if
it's<00:06:21.159> something<00:06:21.370> that<00:06:21.550> ultimately<00:06:22.180> doesn't

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
it's something that ultimately doesn't

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.089 
it's something that ultimately doesn't
happen<00:06:22.659> at<00:06:22.960> all<00:06:23.050> but<00:06:23.319> there's<00:06:23.710> a<00:06:23.770> lot<00:06:24.069> of

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
happen at all but there's a lot of

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.700 
happen at all but there's a lot of
reasons<00:06:24.639> for<00:06:24.759> it<00:06:25.120> but<00:06:25.569> it's<00:06:25.780> it's<00:06:26.319> cost

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
reasons for it but it's it's cost

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.740 
reasons for it but it's it's cost
savings<00:06:27.250> but<00:06:27.490> not<00:06:27.669> cost<00:06:28.060> savings<00:06:28.539> in<00:06:28.659> a

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
savings but not cost savings in a

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.140 
savings but not cost savings in a
smaller<00:06:29.110> engine<00:06:29.740> me<00:06:29.889> and<00:06:30.039> smaller<00:06:30.310> costs<00:06:30.669> it's

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
smaller engine me and smaller costs it's

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.760 
smaller engine me and smaller costs it's
cost<00:06:31.479> savings<00:06:31.870> in<00:06:32.020> that<00:06:32.169> they're<00:06:32.319> trying<00:06:32.469> to

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
cost savings in that they're trying to

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.830 
cost savings in that they're trying to
design<00:06:33.129> something<00:06:33.460> that<00:06:34.000> maybe<00:06:34.270> they<00:06:34.509> can<00:06:34.719> get

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
design something that maybe they can get

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.959 
design something that maybe they can get
a<00:06:34.900> few<00:06:35.139> races<00:06:35.349> out<00:06:35.680> of<00:06:35.830> so<00:06:36.039> we<00:06:36.430> appreciate<00:06:36.940> that
