00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 I hide that with a knife 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.320

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.659
 the package I was waiting for 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 This package went to me if you believe ali track 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.560

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.549

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 months and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.010
 that is worth the wait worth the wait until the end 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.510
 So I was convinced myself let's 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.940
 let's see what we have on the link she 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.310
 of course the package itself is battered by time 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.050

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.690
 by the way dx.com is logitech mouse 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.959
 here we see compatibility 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.970
 need you see or not with windows 7 and 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.790
 windows 8 vista xp is no longer moq linux 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.989

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.959

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.269

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:42.600
 Here is such a box 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.600
 try though what that neatness 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.320
 the bed she even the coupe even the battery 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.130
 kit so proprietary logitech 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.079
 I also seem to be inscribed as same 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.170
 probably how we sell for the price 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.000

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.820

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.709
 be carried on in the description so here is the mouse itself 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.000
 such a small mark of us will be slips 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.000
 on such a surface is not bad 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:23.530
 Casco it so well button 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.530
 logitech on-off 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:34.450
 something here is the computer connection and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.740
 duracell battery included also 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.720
 we have such a booklet instruction 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.430
 let's open the collar just 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:50.300
 I wonder what that there is a price for about 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:57.140
 20 there may be 5 dollars but it seems to me 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:59.060
 Us such mice will be cheaper such here 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.100
 booklets all in chinese which on 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:09.160
 English like what connects well 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.160
 you understand me now let's try 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.730
 who not only do not understand how 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.730
 site where the battery 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:24.590
 but by 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.419
 against vitesse battery hiding with 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:38.410
 This side and the battery is inserted so 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:45.169
 here's the mouse itself so immaterial 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:52.910
 you got married and we recognize how well 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:55.180
 would be a little dangling inside like this 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.470
 didn't catch fire but 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.759
 I can accomplish my goal or not 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:05.060
 mouse think friends look and honest 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:07.160
 We recognize that wait for the parcel and even if 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.620
 but she leads me a month or two 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.669
