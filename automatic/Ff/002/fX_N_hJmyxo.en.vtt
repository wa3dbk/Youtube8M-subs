00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
free-for-all spawn trap on dome I've

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.929 
free-for-all spawn trap on dome I've
known<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.380> extremely<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> long<00:00:20.369> time<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
known this for extremely a long time and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
known this for extremely a long time and
I<00:00:20.970> thought<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.510> may<00:00:21.869> as<00:00:21.900> well<00:00:22.020> make<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.529> series

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
I thought I may as well make a series

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.029 
I thought I may as well make a series
out<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.699> spawn<00:00:24.689> trapping<00:00:24.960> there's<00:00:25.680> been<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> lot

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
out of spawn trapping there's been a lot

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.269 
out of spawn trapping there's been a lot
of<00:00:26.070> speculation<00:00:26.340> lately<00:00:27.150> where<00:00:28.099> people<00:00:29.099> in

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of speculation lately where people in

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.420 
of speculation lately where people in
pretty<00:00:30.179> much<00:00:30.390> lobbies<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.170> whatnot<00:00:32.040> they're

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
pretty much lobbies and whatnot they're

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
pretty much lobbies and whatnot they're
recording<00:00:33.090> gameplay<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.630> other<00:00:33.809> people

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
recording gameplay of other people

trapping them it spawns and getting them

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.619 
trapping them it spawns and getting them
banned<00:00:36.960> now<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.530> know<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.100> frowned<00:00:38.370> upon<00:00:38.629> but

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
banned now I know it's frowned upon but

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.619 
banned now I know it's frowned upon but
if<00:00:40.379> Infinity<00:00:41.340> Ward<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.760> put<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> into<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> game

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
if Infinity Ward have put it into a game

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.810 
if Infinity Ward have put it into a game
then<00:00:43.100> why<00:00:44.690> why<00:00:45.690> banned<00:00:45.989> people<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.730> abusing<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
then why why banned people for abusing a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.180 
then why why banned people for abusing a
little<00:00:48.140> know<00:00:49.140> something<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:49.950> upper

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
little know something to get an upper

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
little know something to get an upper
edge<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.460> another<00:00:50.700> opponent<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.870> be

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
edge on another opponent there will be

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
edge on another opponent there will be
mixed<00:00:52.199> feelings<00:00:52.500> about<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.510> personally

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
mixed feelings about that but personally

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
mixed feelings about that but personally
I<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.410> especially<00:00:55.649> solo

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
I think if you can do it especially solo

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.490 
I think if you can do it especially solo
like<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.210> free-for-all<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.350> have

to manipulate a spawn with multiple
people<00:01:09.960> fair<00:01:10.320> enough<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.549> out

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

of hand but I go into lobbies where we
we<00:01:14.130> control<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> spawn<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> domination<00:01:15.720> but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
we control the spawn on a domination but

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
we control the spawn on a domination but
that's<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.890> bit<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> fun<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that's just a bit of fun but for a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.270 
that's just a bit of fun but for a
free-for-all<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.710> people<00:01:19.920> banned

basically<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.290> spawn<00:01:58.619> trap<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.189> just<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
basically the spawn trap is just it's a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.539 
basically the spawn trap is just it's a
lot<00:02:01.259> easier<00:02:01.619> than<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.799> ever<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.520> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
lot easier than I ever think like see I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.160 
lot easier than I ever think like see I
always<00:02:02.909> check<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.149> corner<00:02:03.420> there<00:02:03.780> because

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
always check that corner there because

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
always check that corner there because
people<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:05.130> spawn<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.579> no<00:02:05.670> matter<00:02:05.850> where

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
people will spawn and no matter where

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.160
