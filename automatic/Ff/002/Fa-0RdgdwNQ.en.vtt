00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.879
 all squid boys 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.260
 today is this holiday day 23 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.009
 February 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.640
 so to speak field conditions will consider 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:28.449
 and open the natural squid 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.400
 peeled without skin here we see 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:36.480
 image of the squid itself on the side of us 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.590
 the inscription canned squid and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.829
 natural cuttlefish 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.660
 natural shredded squid without 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.610
 skin 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.100
 food and dress up value 100 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.800
 gram of product contains protein 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 16 grams fat 5 grams carbohydrates 0 4 grams 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.320
 calorie 111 giant glory 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.229
 Ingredients squid, skinless salt 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:13.250
 here we see the barcode also here we are 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:16.670
 see a net weight of 240 grams squid 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.410
 so here we are called on top like this 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:26.120
 looks from the bottom of our production date 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:34.780
 lines of validity here but for the beginning we have it 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.780
 open all seconds wait for the address is hidden 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.230
 the matter went 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.619
 so I hid it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.509
 this jar 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.509
 a jar of Crimea is what we have inside 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.890
 let's taste it and what have u 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.990
 us 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.680
 us inside 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.680
 squid 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.460
 This is how it looks 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.790
 natural squid shredded 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.790
 skin try let's taste 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.640
 but there is a taste of squid but I would say 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.640
 Remar 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.010
 tastier fresh 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.010
 boiled 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.760
 canned food loses its taste 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.599
 As you can see 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.599
 so here it looks 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.079
 not canned 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.079
 serve 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.550
 better fresh 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.550
 boiled 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.330
 but this 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.810
 all the more nothing to add all with 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.810
 holiday 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.760
 to all 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 on squid
