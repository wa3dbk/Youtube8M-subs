00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.450 
changed my class accordingly so I set up
this<00:00:39.750> EMP<00:00:40.079> class<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.250> class<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
this EMP class and what this class is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
this EMP class and what this class is
it's<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:42.000> based<00:00:42.239> around<00:00:42.420> assists<00:00:42.899> so

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

amazing it's so powerful maybe a little
bit<00:01:43.259> overpowered<00:01:43.770> unload<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.549> comes

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
bit overpowered unload because it comes

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
bit overpowered unload because it comes
into<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> class<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.570> sudden<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.020> compared<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
into a class of a sudden it compared to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.929 
into a class of a sudden it compared to
concussion<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> flashbang<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> just

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
concussion and the flashbang it just

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.639 
concussion and the flashbang it just
overshadows<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.869> much<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.470> only<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
overshadows it so much and not only that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
overshadows it so much and not only that
obviously<00:01:50.159> i'm<00:01:50.220> using<00:01:50.490> hardline<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.210> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
obviously i'm using hardline as well so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.670 
obviously i'm using hardline as well so
everything<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.960> i'm<00:01:52.140> getting<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.560> the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
effects and also what's different with

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.920 
effects and also what's different with
the<00:02:55.340> EMP<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:55.850> black<00:02:56.030> ops<00:02:56.180> 2<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:56.810> no

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
the EMP in black ops 2 is that it's no

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.690 
the EMP in black ops 2 is that it's no
longer<00:02:56.960> 60<00:02:57.650> seconds<00:02:58.070> in<00:02:58.130> modern<00:02:58.370> warfare<00:02:58.520> 3

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.110 
longer 60 seconds in modern warfare 3
with<00:02:59.060> 60<00:02:59.300> seconds<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.840> boscov's<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:01.010> its<00:03:01.160> 40<00:03:01.640> so

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
with 60 seconds in boscov's to its 40 so

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.910 
with 60 seconds in boscov's to its 40 so
they've<00:03:02.330> actually<00:03:02.480> shave<00:03:02.780> 20<00:03:03.200> seconds<00:03:03.650> off<00:03:03.740> it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
they've actually shave 20 seconds off it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
they've actually shave 20 seconds off it
which<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> little<00:03:04.430> bit<00:03:04.520> annoying<00:03:04.700> cuz

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
which is a little bit annoying cuz

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
which is a little bit annoying cuz
that's<00:03:05.090> 20<00:03:05.300> seconds<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.750> could<00:03:05.870> be

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
that's 20 seconds that you could be

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.510 
that's 20 seconds that you could be
getting<00:03:06.110> extra<00:03:06.440> assists<00:03:06.740> father<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.220> think<00:03:07.370> the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
getting extra assists father I think the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
powerful and they look at the man sis I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.380 
powerful and they look at the man sis I
get<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:12.380> this<00:03:12.770> is<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.490> same<00:03:13.700> when

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
get here this is just in the same when

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.720 
get here this is just in the same when
scorestreaks<00:03:15.080> just<00:03:15.260> go<00:03:15.380> up<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.710> open<00:03:16.070> up<00:03:16.160> so

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
scorestreaks just go up and open up so

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.160 
scorestreaks just go up and open up so
right<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.000> if<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.570> against<00:03:17.840> normal

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
right now if you just against normal

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.930 
right now if you just against normal
players<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:18.709> they<00:03:18.860> use<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.250> UAV<00:03:19.700> con<00:03:19.910> a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
players then they use the UAV con a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.729 
players then they use the UAV con a
movie<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.420> visa<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.080> then<00:03:21.290> if<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.470> come<00:03:21.620> up

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
movie and visa and then if you come up

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.620 
movie and visa and then if you come up
against<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.070> pie<00:03:22.220> then<00:03:22.550> just<00:03:23.000> use<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.239> UMP

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
against the pie then just use the UMP

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.510 
against the pie then just use the UMP
it's<00:03:23.810> going<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:23.989> be<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.110> lot<00:03:24.290> more<00:03:24.320> effective<00:03:24.800> so

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
it's going to be a lot more effective so

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.130 
it's going to be a lot more effective so
as<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.090> see<00:03:26.270> now<00:03:26.450> I'm<00:03:26.570> just<00:03:26.720> building<00:03:26.900> up

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
as you can see now I'm just building up

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.360 
as you can see now I'm just building up
a<00:03:27.230> kill<00:03:27.410> streak<00:03:27.500> cycling<00:03:28.100> through<00:03:28.280> them

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
a kill streak cycling through them

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
the rate of fire all is really good it's

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.960 
the rate of fire all is really good it's
just<00:04:24.560> steady<00:04:24.919> right<00:04:25.190> down<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.520> line<00:04:25.729> and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
just steady right down the line and

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
there now the vector k10 could be for

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.029 
there now the vector k10 could be for
you<00:04:29.659> and<00:04:29.870> it's<00:04:30.349> good<00:04:30.499> they're<00:04:30.650> mixing<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:30.979> up
