00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.000
 ariel spent the first month we're almost 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.360
 ending February after 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.139
 a tough season and already a month with 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.879
 local competition with koppers 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.709
 international we want to know what is the 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.410
 beam balance of what was the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.230
 rivals performance during february 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.369
 I think that still 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.619
 we are starting the season 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.599
 we are trying to add shooting to go 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.660
 adjusting the small details that 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.160
 we still have to adjust and good 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.949
 I think this February has left 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.160
 like out there as a balance that's not a team 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:42.339
 that still needs to adjust some 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.809
 little things and I think it's good because 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.910
 because he talks about this team still 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.640
 has has an even greater potential and that 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.470
 and that we can give a lot more face 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.660
 to everything that to the commitments that 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.030
 we have before us what it was like to start 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.100
 year after a very moved 2014 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.730
 also with two championships that I know 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.190
 they won and the truth is that they go back to 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.520
 renew them I challenge them to renew themselves as 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.380
 as a team because what was achieved in 2014 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.720
 the truth that was very nice was very 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.509
 intense everything that was seen but we must 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.149
 to renew us as a team 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.610
 and what to renew the objectives that are 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.619
 very important to the club everything that 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.100
 we have to play and well we know 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.050
 that we have acquired a transcendence to 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.310
 international level too and that that goes 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.920
 to make the rivals also 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.990
 they do not want to win us in every game that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.880
 Let us play the prayer of the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.039
 international significance that 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.630
 meant for you to have returned to 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.610
 put up the top of so 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.200
 less from america and now it will go back to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.390
 represent river in the cup 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.659
 liberators if something something very nice a 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.299
 Very cute joy and a satisfaction for 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.030
 the work that we have been doing, I think 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.950
 that will come to put up in the place 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.350
 that deserves to be, I think it's a 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.539
 individual satisfaction of each 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.840
 one of us as a group I think 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.929
 that this is going to stay in history 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.399
 of the club and we are going to be part of that 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.679
 rich history that has club so 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.179
 we are very happy as you lived the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.830
 particularly the draw with quilmes 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.049
 how was the costumes also after 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.250
 of the tie they lived it with anger 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.870
 somehow looking at it with 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.250
 positivity knowing that there are many 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.850
 matches ahead still so 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.070
 less in the local 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.980
 the result does not give us anger not us 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.530
 left for nothing according to either the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.080
 party development 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.670
 that's why the positive thing we found in 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.380
 this is that we have recovery that 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.420
 there are still many dates ahead 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.920
 and that it will be important to maintain the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.230
 calm the calm and find a 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.540
 regularity nothing more than that after 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.250
 obviously we did not go with 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.650
 a lot of anger because because we know that 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.450
 our court we must win all 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.800
 the parties that we have good atmosphere 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.450
 We thank you very much as always for the good 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.980
 predisposition and we wish you the best 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.980
 for this 2015 thank you very much thank you
