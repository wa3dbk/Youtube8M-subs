ninja 250 well me and a ninja 250r a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.479 
ninja 250 well me and a ninja 250r a
ninja<00:00:32.040> 250<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.730> could<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> wheelie

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
ninja 250 and I could do a wheelie

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.680 
ninja 250 and I could do a wheelie
so<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:36.020> started<00:00:37.730> revving<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.210> popping
