of their women so I guess according to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.780 
of their women so I guess according to
liquid<00:00:39.899> TLO<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.469> malice<00:00:40.800> ha<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.489> not

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
liquid TLO and malice ha see that is not

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.310

what<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.180> best<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.540> life<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> was

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
what is best in life because if it was

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.400 
what is best in life because if it was
best<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.680> life<00:00:43.770> they'd<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.100> doing<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.430> oh<00:00:44.660> I<00:00:45.660> was

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
best in life they'd be doing it oh I was

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.959 
best in life they'd be doing it oh I was
saying<00:00:46.680> yeah<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.250> battle<00:00:47.550> cruisers<00:00:47.850> are

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
saying yeah these battle cruisers are

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.090 
saying yeah these battle cruisers are
outmatched<00:00:48.360> too<00:00:49.260> many<00:00:49.410> stalkers<00:00:49.710> um<00:00:51.920> hard<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
outmatched too many stalkers um hard to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.889 
outmatched too many stalkers um hard to
say<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.820> lost<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.469> game<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
say what lost a little one this game I

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.340 
say what lost a little one this game I
think<00:00:57.899> my<00:00:58.710> first<00:00:59.039> instinct<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> say<00:01:00.350> there

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
think my first instinct is to say there

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.049 
think my first instinct is to say there
was<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> point<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.100> where<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.609> mobility<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
was a point there where the mobility of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.429 
was a point there where the mobility of
the<00:01:03.149> carrier's<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:03.899> costing<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the carrier's was really costing the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.230 
the carrier's was really costing the
Protoss<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.159> he<00:01:05.400> could<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.700> gone<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
Protoss and he could have gone for the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
Protoss and he could have gone for the
gone<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> kill<00:01:07.350> van<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
gone for the kill van and I think that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.660 
gone for the kill van and I think that
was<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.460> his<00:01:08.580> only<00:01:08.610> window<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:10.430> he<00:01:11.430> waited

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
was really his only window and he waited

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.690 
was really his only window and he waited
so<00:01:12.150> long<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:13.110> he<00:01:13.470> ended<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.890> mining<00:01:14.369> himself

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so long that he ended up mining himself

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.080 
so long that he ended up mining himself
off<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.330> map<00:01:16.580> unfortunately<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> yeah<00:01:20.159> pretty
