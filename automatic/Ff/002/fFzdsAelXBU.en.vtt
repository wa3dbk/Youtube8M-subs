00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
well and against complexity yourself um

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.439 
well and against complexity yourself um
i<00:00:22.410> think<00:00:22.560> i<00:00:22.830> did<00:00:23.010> okay<00:00:23.580> there's<00:00:24.060> still<00:00:24.240> room

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
i think i did okay there's still room

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.990 
i think i did okay there's still room
for<00:00:24.510> improvement<00:00:24.720> i<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> reason<00:00:26.640> why

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
for improvement i think the reason why

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.210 
for improvement i think the reason why
it<00:00:27.060> looked<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.599> i<00:00:27.750> did<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.109> well<00:00:28.289> was<00:00:28.830> because

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it looked like i did so well was because

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.220 
it looked like i did so well was because
uh<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.970> were<00:00:30.090> doing<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.109> got

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
uh we were doing good and then they got

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
uh we were doing good and then they got
a<00:00:31.289> three<00:00:31.560> fro<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.279> then<00:00:32.460> I'm<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.790> okay<00:00:33.210> guys

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
a three fro and then I'm like okay guys

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.889 
a three fro and then I'm like okay guys
I<00:00:33.870> got<00:00:34.410> double<00:00:34.770> Nick<00:00:34.980> whoo<00:00:35.130> CS<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> still

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I got double Nick whoo CS we can still

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.639 
I got double Nick whoo CS we can still
do<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> reason<00:00:39.660> why<00:00:40.020> he

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
do this now I think the reason why he

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.220 
do this now I think the reason why he
had<00:00:41.040> such<00:00:41.280> low<00:00:41.550> CS<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.329> he<00:00:42.960> thought<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
had such low CS because he thought that

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
had such low CS because he thought that
on<00:00:43.680> Jarvan<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.730> still<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> brush

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
on Jarvan was still in the brush

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.360 
on Jarvan was still in the brush
probably<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:45.989> pretended<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.649> Jarvan<00:00:47.219> was

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
probably so I pretended like Jarvan was

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.209 
probably so I pretended like Jarvan was
there<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.050> he<00:00:49.050> missed<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.590> lot<00:00:49.710> more<00:00:49.920> CS

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
there and he missed a lot more CS

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
there and he missed a lot more CS
tanishaa<00:00:50.700> dev<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.360> knew<00:00:51.480> he<00:00:51.629> didn't<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
tanishaa dev and I knew he didn't have a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
tanishaa dev and I knew he didn't have a
ward<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.559> he's<00:00:52.739> probably<00:00:53.010> he<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.940> probably

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
ward so he's probably he was probably

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.889 
ward so he's probably he was probably
like<00:00:54.829> expecting<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.949> gang<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> did

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
like expecting a gang but on what we did

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.599 
like expecting a gang but on what we did
was<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.140> gank<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> first<00:00:58.920> time<00:00:59.100> even

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
was we gank them the first time even

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.830 
was we gank them the first time even
though<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.850> kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
though I was kind of was kind of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
though I was kind of was kind of
shady<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.070> ganked<00:01:02.399> him<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
shady because when we ganked him the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
shady because when we ganked him the
first<00:01:02.850> time<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.409> going

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
first time I was like this is not going

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
first time I was like this is not going
to<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.769> anything<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.250> hit<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> tower<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
to do anything just hit the tower a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.929 
to do anything just hit the tower a
little<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.260> bot<00:01:07.560> Lane<00:01:07.830> comes<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
little bit so when bot Lane comes the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.270 
little bit so when bot Lane comes the
bot<00:01:09.150> Lane<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.860> take<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> tower

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
bot Lane then they can take the tower

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.700 
bot Lane then they can take the tower
easier<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:13.020> didn't<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.470> off<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
easier so we didn't get much off the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
easier so we didn't get much off the
gank<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> did<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> applied

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
gank but what it did was it applied

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.980 
gank but what it did was it applied
pressures<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.520> Nick<00:01:17.759> wound<00:01:18.000> game<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.750> two

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
pressures to not Nick wound game but two

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.179 
pressures to not Nick wound game but two
is<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.320> his<00:01:19.680> mentality<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.950> came

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is like his mentality and that just came

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.240 
is like his mentality and that just came
on<00:01:23.369> top<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.880> us<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:25.380> wasn't<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.860> me

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
on top for us it wasn't really me

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.179 
on top for us it wasn't really me
playing<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.909> well<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:28.110> more<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> if

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
playing really well it was more of if

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.280 
playing really well it was more of if
the<00:01:29.579> enemy<00:01:29.880> makes<00:01:30.090> mistakes<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.170> gonna

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to pull it out was that the fact that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
to pull it out was that the fact that
you<00:01:41.490> had<00:01:41.640> WCS<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.659> big<00:01:42.899> reason<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.770> just

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

team comp we got what we wanted and
we<00:01:52.240> actually<00:01:52.600> had<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.750> plan<00:01:53.079> for<00:01:53.289> them<00:01:53.439> but<00:01:53.619> then

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
we actually had a plan for them but then

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.069 
we actually had a plan for them but then
we<00:01:53.829> just<00:01:54.009> decided<00:01:54.369> play<00:01:54.670> standard<00:01:55.270> something

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
we just decided play standard something

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.200 
we just decided play standard something
that<00:01:56.289> we<00:01:56.619> probably<00:01:57.039> could<00:01:57.369> get<00:01:57.549> away<00:01:57.670> with<00:01:57.820> for

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
that we probably could get away with for

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.219 
that we probably could get away with for
most<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.719> games<00:01:58.979> but<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:01.030> game<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.750> CC

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
most of the games but that game the CC

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.350 
most of the games but that game the CC
has<00:02:02.259> played<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> huge<00:02:02.829> part<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.119> first

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
has played a huge part because the first

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.209 
has played a huge part because the first
dragon<00:02:04.840> fight<00:02:05.079> was<00:02:05.289> really<00:02:05.320> crucial<00:02:05.920> and

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
dragon fight was really crucial and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.150 
dragon fight was really crucial and
that's<00:02:06.310> where<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.700> snowball<00:02:07.149> started<00:02:08.160> since

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
that's where the snowball started since

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.120 
that's where the snowball started since
Nick<00:02:09.399> whoo<00:02:09.580> was<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.849> little<00:02:10.239> bit<00:02:10.360> behind<00:02:11.130> he

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
Nick whoo was a little bit behind he

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.009 
Nick whoo was a little bit behind he
wasn't<00:02:12.430> able<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.730> finish<00:02:12.970> off<00:02:13.300> like<00:02:13.870> there's

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
wasn't able to finish off like there's

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.650 
wasn't able to finish off like there's
so<00:02:14.170> many<00:02:14.260> people<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.680> got<00:02:15.130> away<00:02:15.400> low<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.670> I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
so many people that got away low and I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.449 
so many people that got away low and I
assume<00:02:16.959> if<00:02:17.110> he<00:02:17.230> had<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.590> little<00:02:17.830> bit<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.099> farm

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
assume if he had that little bit of farm

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.250 
assume if he had that little bit of farm
they<00:02:18.730> could<00:02:18.910> have<00:02:19.000> helped<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.330> lot<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:20.110> that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
they could have helped a lot but that

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.440 
they could have helped a lot but that
isn't<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.650> main<00:02:20.860> reason<00:02:21.250> why<00:02:21.400> they<00:02:21.580> lost<00:02:21.730> they

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
isn't the main reason why they lost they

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.339 
isn't the main reason why they lost they
actually<00:02:22.870> got<00:02:23.019> 30<00:02:23.739> they<00:02:24.459> got<00:02:24.610> three<00:02:24.849> kills<00:02:25.349> 40

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
actually got 30 they got three kills 40

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.550 
actually got 30 they got three kills 40
before<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:28.959> created<00:02:29.410> our

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
before that and we just created our

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.520 
before that and we just created our
teeth<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:30.610> okay<00:02:31.390> we<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:32.440> have

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
teeth and just like okay we have we have

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.400 
teeth and just like okay we have we have
a<00:02:32.590> better<00:02:33.370> team<00:02:33.640> fight<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.299> their<00:02:35.019> late<00:02:35.170> game

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
a better team fight and their late game

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.539 
a better team fight and their late game
is<00:02:35.530> better<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.069> we're<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.370> try<00:02:36.459> and

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
is better so we're going to try and

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.600 
is better so we're going to try and
force<00:02:36.819> objectives<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.450> get<00:02:37.599> what<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
force objectives and get what we can the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.150 
force objectives and get what we can the
other<00:02:39.730> reason<00:02:39.940> why<00:02:40.209> or<00:02:40.569> their<00:02:41.560> late<00:02:41.769> game<00:02:41.980> was

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
other reason why or their late game was

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.990 
other reason why or their late game was
better<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:43.150> because<00:02:43.599> I'm<00:02:44.049> we<00:02:44.829> almost<00:02:45.010> threw<00:02:45.549> at

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
better is because I'm we almost threw at

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.229 
better is because I'm we almost threw at
the<00:02:46.269> end<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.599> game<00:02:46.630> where<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:48.010> we<00:02:49.000> didn't

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
the end of the game where we we didn't

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.839 
the end of the game where we we didn't
pay<00:02:49.329> attention<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.810> kha'zix<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.709> oriana<00:02:51.370> got

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
pay attention to kha'zix and oriana got

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.479 
pay attention to kha'zix and oriana got
sniped<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:53.590> got<00:02:53.739> really<00:02:53.920> scary<00:02:54.040> from

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
sniped and it got really scary from

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.949 
sniped and it got really scary from
there<00:02:54.640> we<00:02:54.819> were<00:02:54.940> actually<00:02:55.329> not<00:02:55.480> sure<00:02:55.720> we<00:02:55.870> could

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
there we were actually not sure we could

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.780 
there we were actually not sure we could
take<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.350> but<00:02:56.470> they<00:02:56.829> live<00:02:57.040> skipped<00:02:57.310> fair<00:02:57.609> and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
take it but they live skipped fair and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.590 
take it but they live skipped fair and
so<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.840> was<00:02:58.989> okay<00:02:59.230> but<00:02:59.980> with<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.970> comp<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:01.450> we

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
so it was okay but with the comp that we

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.630 
so it was okay but with the comp that we
had<00:03:01.870> we<00:03:02.079> also<00:03:02.260> can't<00:03:02.620> mess<00:03:02.829> up<00:03:02.859> so<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.370> really

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
had we also can't mess up so it's really

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.379 
had we also can't mess up so it's really
scaring<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.269> kind<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.540> sense<00:03:04.720> also<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.700> curse

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
scaring that kind of sense also so curse

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.259 
scaring that kind of sense also so curse

it bring it back to Europe so right now
i<00:05:23.560> think<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.950> favor<00:05:24.310> is<00:05:24.490> in<00:05:24.700> korea<00:05:25.150> side<00:05:25.599> right

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
i think the favor is in korea side right

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.810 
i think the favor is in korea side right
now<00:05:25.930> so<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.800> would<00:05:26.919> be<00:05:26.950> my<00:05:27.070> prediction<00:05:27.789> for

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
now so that would be my prediction for

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.629 
now so that would be my prediction for
now<00:05:28.150> but<00:05:28.960> i<00:05:29.020> eat<00:05:29.650> regardless<00:05:30.220> i<00:05:30.370> think<00:05:30.550> it's

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
now but i eat regardless i think it's

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.659 
now but i eat regardless i think it's
going<00:05:30.729> to<00:05:30.820> be<00:05:30.910> really<00:05:31.120> good<00:05:31.389> match<00:05:31.599> and<00:05:31.990> that

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
going to be really good match and that
