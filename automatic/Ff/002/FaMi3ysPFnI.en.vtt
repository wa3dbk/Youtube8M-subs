00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
but I was looking on YouTube I never

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.350 
but I was looking on YouTube I never
really<00:00:10.740> had<00:00:10.920> I'd<00:00:11.219> never<00:00:11.580> really<00:00:11.790> saw<00:00:12.000> any<00:00:12.269> of

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
really had I'd never really saw any of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.640 
really had I'd never really saw any of
them<00:00:12.540> they're<00:00:12.690> obviously<00:00:13.049> videos<00:00:13.380> showing

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
them they're obviously videos showing

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.350 
them they're obviously videos showing
this<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.340> don't<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:14.880> had<00:00:15.089> anybody

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
this but I don't really had anybody

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.359 
this but I don't really had anybody
doing<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.080> guess<00:00:16.320> like<00:00:16.500> efficiently<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.190> so

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
doing it I guess like efficiently and so

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.859 
doing it I guess like efficiently and so
I<00:00:17.400> kind<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.880> wanted<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.240> show<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.690> guys

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
exactly the way to go now you don't want

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.099 
exactly the way to go now you don't want
it<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:20.939> don't<00:00:21.060> want<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> use<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.689> other<00:00:21.840> gate

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it you don't want to use the other gate

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.660 
it you don't want to use the other gate
here<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.980> reason<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.490> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
here and your reason for that is just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.769 
here and your reason for that is just
going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.850> walk<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.390> there<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.689> it's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
going to walk you in there and it's

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
going to walk you in there and it's
going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> slow<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.199> down<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.609> you

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
going to slow you down and so what you

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
going to slow you down and so what you
want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> do<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> live<00:00:28.019> set<00:00:28.380> by

want to do is this is on the live set by

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.779 
want to do is this is on the live set by
the<00:00:28.619> way<00:00:28.769> if<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.039> guys<00:00:29.130> don't<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:29.699> are

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
the way if you guys don't know there are
two<00:00:29.939> sides<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.599> Streatham<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.679> live

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
two sides in Streatham there's a live

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
two sides in Streatham there's a live
side<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.520> dead<00:00:32.759> side<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.300> dead<00:00:33.510> side<00:00:33.750> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
side and the dead side the dead side is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.889 
side and the dead side the dead side is
where<00:00:34.290> Baron<00:00:34.710> driven<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.870> there<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
where Baron driven there is and there I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.540 
where Baron driven there is and there I
think<00:00:37.350> isn't<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:37.980> know<00:00:38.070> maybe<00:00:38.340> they

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
think isn't I don't know maybe they

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.549 
think isn't I don't know maybe they
changed<00:00:38.579> him<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.660> guy<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.020> drops<00:00:40.230> her<00:00:40.350> into

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
changed him the guy that drops her into

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.799 
changed him the guy that drops her into
his<00:00:40.649> death<00:00:40.860> charger<00:00:41.250> either<00:00:41.430> way<00:00:41.660> yeah<00:00:42.660> yeah

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
his death charger either way yeah yeah

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.220 
his death charger either way yeah yeah
burner<00:00:43.170> burner<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.950> um<00:00:44.690> he's<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
burner burner and so um he's there and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.650 
burner burner and so um he's there and
this<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> live<00:00:47.100> side<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> dead<00:00:48.059> side

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
this is the live side now the dead side

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.690 
this is the live side now the dead side
I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.260> drop<00:00:49.530> ruin<00:00:49.800> cloth<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.370> also

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
I think they drop ruin cloth and also

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
I think they drop ruin cloth and also
that's<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.360> efficient<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> farm

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that's not efficient at all the farm

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.340 
that's not efficient at all the farm
because<00:00:53.460> they<00:00:53.820> say<00:00:53.879> stun<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.809> they

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
because they say stun you and they

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
because they say stun you and they
silence<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.070> stuff<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
silence you and stuff like that and so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.430 
silence you and stuff like that and so
you<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.170> anything

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you really don't want to have anything

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
you really don't want to have anything
to<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.460> want<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> stick<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
to do with that you want to stick to the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.459 
to do with that you want to stick to the
long<00:01:00.270> side<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> show<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
long side here I was going to show a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.020 
long side here I was going to show a
clip<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> show<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> guys<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
clip of that just to show you guys but I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
clip of that just to show you guys but I
decided<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.470> would<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
decided that it would kind of just be a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.640 
decided that it would kind of just be a
waste<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.909> time<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.110> take<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.320> word

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
waste of time and so just take my word

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.390 
waste of time and so just take my word
for<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
for it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.179 
for it
I<00:01:08.460> pull<00:01:09.330> everything<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> entire<00:01:10.500> instance

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
I pull everything in the entire instance

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
I pull everything in the entire instance
down<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> Balthazar<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.689> guys<00:01:12.840> did

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

just watched one of his old videos and
it<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> inspired<00:01:40.110> me<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.430> through

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it kind of inspired me to go through

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
it kind of inspired me to go through
here<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.329> some<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> these<00:01:42.720> old<00:01:42.960> these<00:01:43.470> old

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
runs because I always really do like AOE

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.350 
runs because I always really do like AOE
things<00:01:46.799> down<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.640> something<00:01:48.000> about

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
things down that's just something about

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.580 
things down that's just something about
it<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.259> cool

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it I just think it's really cool

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
it I just think it's really cool
especially<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.610> doing<00:01:50.880> an<00:01:50.970> entire<00:01:51.270> instance

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
especially like doing an entire instance

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.969 
especially like doing an entire instance
at<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> same<00:01:52.350> time<00:01:52.590> awesome<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:55.799> was

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
at the same time awesome and so it was

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
at the same time awesome and so it was
definitely<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.759> lot<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> fun<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> do

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
definitely really a lot of fun to do

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
definitely really a lot of fun to do
this<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.320> figured<00:01:59.070> I'd<00:01:59.250> make<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.430> video

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
this and so I figured I'd make a video

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.270 
this and so I figured I'd make a video
at<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> same<00:02:00.210> time<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.750> show<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.990> guys<00:02:01.280> what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
much as long as you're level 90 I did

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.100 
much as long as you're level 90 I did
have<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> speed<00:02:12.030> boost<00:02:12.239> obviously<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
have a speed boost obviously with the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.970

burning<00:02:13.349> Russians

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
burning Russians

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.380 
burning Russians
have<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.280> take<00:02:14.489> my<00:02:14.610> health<00:02:14.819> down<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.030> little<00:02:15.180> bit

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
have to take my health down a little bit

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.360 
have to take my health down a little bit
but<00:02:15.930> also<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.319> guys<00:02:16.470> these<00:02:16.680> these<00:02:17.010> are<00:02:17.190> very

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
but also you guys these these are very

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000 
but also you guys these these are very
low<00:02:17.580> levels<00:02:17.970> level<00:02:18.269> forty<00:02:18.569> mobs<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.379> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
low levels level forty mobs and so you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.320 
low levels level forty mobs and so you
really<00:02:20.220> shouldn't<00:02:20.459> expect<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.849> be<00:02:20.909> taking<00:02:21.209> too

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
really shouldn't expect to be taking too

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.570 
really shouldn't expect to be taking too
much<00:02:21.450> damage<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.890> loot<00:02:23.069> let's<00:02:23.370> talk

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
much damage now for the loot let's talk

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.210 
much damage now for the loot let's talk
about<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.030> what<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.019> get<00:02:25.319> about<00:02:25.440> every<00:02:25.799> run<00:02:26.010> is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
about that what I get about every run is

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640 
about that what I get about every run is
eight<00:02:27.030> stacks<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.690> matric<00:02:28.080> woth<00:02:28.319> which

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
eight stacks of matric woth which

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.160 
eight stacks of matric woth which
obviously<00:02:28.950> translates<00:02:29.549> into<00:02:29.730> 160<00:02:30.420> cloth<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
obviously translates into 160 cloth and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.110 
obviously translates into 160 cloth and
so<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.799> means<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.220> ten<00:02:32.430> runs<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.940> eighty

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so that means in ten runs I get eighty

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.869 
so that means in ten runs I get eighty
sacks<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.959> also<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.440> one<00:02:34.950> hundred<00:02:35.129> sixteen

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
sacks and I also get one hundred sixteen

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.559 
sacks and I also get one hundred sixteen
hundred<00:02:36.180> cloth<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:38.160> not<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.790> very

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
hundred cloth that is not a very

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.330 
hundred cloth that is not a very
realistic<00:02:39.930> expectation<00:02:40.709> for<00:02:40.860> most<00:02:41.010> people

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
realistic expectation for most people

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.430 
realistic expectation for most people
and<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:41.910> what<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.989> tell<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.260> guys

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and so what I'm going to tell you guys

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.110 
and so what I'm going to tell you guys
is<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:44.129> guys<00:02:44.280> are<00:02:44.340> probably<00:02:44.579> going<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.940> get

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
is you guys are probably going to get

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.500 
is you guys are probably going to get
within<00:02:45.780> 1300<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.890> 1500<00:02:47.280> calls<00:02:47.790> per<00:02:48.030> hour<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
within 1300 to 1500 calls per hour and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.180 
within 1300 to 1500 calls per hour and
the<00:02:48.959> reason<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.769> less<00:02:49.980> is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the reason it's going to be less is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400 
the reason it's going to be less is
because<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> warlock<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.569> also<00:02:51.780> you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
because I'm a warlock and I also you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.839 
because I'm a warlock and I also you
also<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.769> take<00:02:52.890> time<00:02:53.099> out<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.280> vendor<00:02:53.670> all

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
also have to take time out to vendor all

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.880 
also have to take time out to vendor all
the<00:02:54.030> stuff<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:55.260> unless<00:02:55.500> you're<00:02:55.680> throwing

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the stuff and so unless you're throwing

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.800 
the stuff and so unless you're throwing
everything<00:02:56.220> away<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.879> on<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.450> way<00:02:57.599> back

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
everything away on on the way back

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.300 
everything away on on the way back
you're<00:02:58.410> probably<00:02:58.620> not<00:02:58.829> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.040> maximize

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
you're probably not going to maximize

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.309 
you're probably not going to maximize
ten<00:02:59.760> runs<00:03:00.000> per<00:03:00.180> hour<00:03:00.299> unless<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.019> have<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.290> a

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
ten runs per hour unless you have like a

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.140 
ten runs per hour unless you have like a
constant<00:03:01.799> speed<00:03:01.890> boost<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.849> guys<00:03:03.000> saw

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
constant speed boost now if you guys saw

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.819 
constant speed boost now if you guys saw
the<00:03:03.180> righteous<00:03:03.629> orbit<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.260> guys<00:03:04.379> also<00:03:04.590> get

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
the righteous orbit you guys also get

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.619 
the righteous orbit you guys also get
that<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.609> what<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> think<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.120> funny<00:03:06.390> about

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
that and what I think is funny about

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.930 
that and what I think is funny about
righteous<00:03:07.170> warps<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:08.069> they've<00:03:08.609> never

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
righteous warps is that they've never

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.660 
righteous warps is that they've never
increased<00:03:09.720> or<00:03:10.109> decreased<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.799> price<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.400> that

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
increased or decreased in price and that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.309 
increased or decreased in price and that
means<00:03:11.879> I've<00:03:12.150> never<00:03:12.420> seen<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> righteous<00:03:13.079> orb

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
means I've never seen a righteous orb

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.770 
means I've never seen a righteous orb
for<00:03:13.709> more<00:03:14.190> than<00:03:14.400> fifty<00:03:14.760> gold<00:03:14.940> I've<00:03:15.239> never<00:03:15.510> seen

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
for more than fifty gold I've never seen

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.990 
for more than fifty gold I've never seen
one<00:03:15.900> for<00:03:16.140> more<00:03:16.290> than<00:03:16.470> ten<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:16.980> they've<00:03:17.819> been

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
one for more than ten and they've been

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240 
one for more than ten and they've been
that<00:03:18.180> same<00:03:18.480> price<00:03:18.810> since<00:03:19.290> whenever<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.829> started

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
that same price since whenever I started

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.670 
that same price since whenever I started
playing<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:20.700> game<00:03:20.880> in<00:03:21.060> 2006<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.650> I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
playing this game in 2006 and so I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.800 
playing this game in 2006 and so I
always<00:03:22.950> thought<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.250> was<00:03:23.609> pretty<00:03:23.790> funny<00:03:23.910> but

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
always thought that was pretty funny but

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.900 
always thought that was pretty funny but
either<00:03:25.200> way<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.340> little<00:03:26.370> bit<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.790> money

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
either way that's a little bit of money

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.330 
either way that's a little bit of money
that<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.329> make<00:03:27.510> if<00:03:28.410> you're<00:03:28.859> really<00:03:29.099> doing

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
that you can make if you're really doing

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.039 
that you can make if you're really doing
this<00:03:29.370> for<00:03:29.489> money<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.599> probably<00:03:30.810> do

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
this for money you can probably do

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.289 
this for money you can probably do
something<00:03:31.319> else<00:03:31.620> but<00:03:32.130> if<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.669> kind<00:03:33.180> of

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
something else but if you're kind of

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.210 
something else but if you're kind of
just<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.780> need<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.049> level<00:03:34.169> tailoring<00:03:34.739> or

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
just if you need to level tailoring or

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.860 
just if you need to level tailoring or
if<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.519> if<00:03:35.970> they're<00:03:36.120> not<00:03:36.269> they<00:03:36.450> made<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.780> move

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
if you if they're not they made to move

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.000 
if you if they're not they made to move
on<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.079> auction<00:03:37.230> house<00:03:37.470> where<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.859> would<00:03:37.980> be

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
on the auction house where it would be

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.860 
on the auction house where it would be
effective<00:03:38.370> for<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.849> I<00:03:38.880> gots<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.359> major<00:03:39.569> Eve<00:03:39.720> is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
effective for you I gots a major Eve is

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.050 
effective for you I gots a major Eve is
like<00:03:40.040> twenty<00:03:41.040> golden<00:03:41.340> stack<00:03:41.519> on<00:03:41.730> your<00:03:41.760> server

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
like twenty golden stack on your server

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.849 
like twenty golden stack on your server
like<00:03:42.419> maybe<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.840> would<00:03:42.900> be<00:03:43.049> good<00:03:43.230> or<00:03:43.260> forty

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
like maybe it would be good or forty

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.460 
like maybe it would be good or forty
maybe<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.880> would<00:03:45.030> be<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.150> good<00:03:45.389> good<00:03:45.750> spin<00:03:46.019> way

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
maybe it would be a good good spin way

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.220 
maybe it would be a good good spin way
to<00:03:46.530> spend<00:03:47.160> your<00:03:47.250> time<00:03:47.430> doing<00:03:47.639> this<00:03:47.910> maybe

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
to spend your time doing this maybe

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.729 
to spend your time doing this maybe
other<00:03:49.230> than<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.669> probably<00:03:51.630> it's<00:03:52.620> an

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
other than that it is probably it's an

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.800 
other than that it is probably it's an
easy<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.250> do<00:03:53.400> which<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.060> which<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.359> one<00:03:54.599> thing

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
easy to do which is which is one thing

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.390 
easy to do which is which is one thing
that<00:03:55.109> they<00:03:55.349> do<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.650> knock<00:03:55.829> back<00:03:56.069> which<00:03:56.280> is

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
that they do the knock back which is

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.059 
that they do the knock back which is
pretty<00:03:56.910> fucking<00:03:57.239> annoying<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:57.989> it's<00:03:58.829> not

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
pretty fucking annoying but it's not

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.229 
pretty fucking annoying but it's not
it's<00:03:59.370> not<00:03:59.489> too<00:03:59.790> bad

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
it's not too bad

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.940 
it's not too bad
but<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.870> pretty<00:04:01.019> much<00:04:01.200> just<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.769> said

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
but you pretty much just as I said

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.500 
but you pretty much just as I said
before<00:04:02.069> kite<00:04:02.519> everything<00:04:02.940> into<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.239> room

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
before kite everything into this room

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.900 
before kite everything into this room
and<00:04:03.720> kill<00:04:04.169> everything<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.769> terms<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.669> gold

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
and kill everything in terms of the gold

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.159 
and kill everything in terms of the gold
that<00:04:06.090> you'll<00:04:06.239> make<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:06.629> can<00:04:06.780> maybe<00:04:06.900> make<00:04:07.139> like

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
that you'll make you can maybe make like

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.289 
that you'll make you can maybe make like
1500<00:04:07.950> gold<00:04:08.069> per<00:04:08.370> hour<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:08.879> maybe<00:04:09.150> two

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
1500 gold per hour like maybe two

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.259 
1500 gold per hour like maybe two
thousand<00:04:09.810> maybe<00:04:10.650> but<00:04:11.400> really<00:04:11.879> looking<00:04:12.120> at

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
thousand maybe but really looking at

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.539 
thousand maybe but really looking at
here<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.690> getting<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.349> damage<00:04:14.340> reef

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
here is just getting the damage reef

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.580 
here is just getting the damage reef
cloth<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.690> know<00:04:15.750> I've<00:04:16.019> talked<00:04:16.260> about<00:04:16.380> this

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
cloth and I know I've talked about this

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.589 
cloth and I know I've talked about this
about<00:04:17.070> how<00:04:17.250> terrible<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.209> some<00:04:18.419> other

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
about how terrible this is some other

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.199 
about how terrible this is some other
videos<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.590> there<00:04:19.739> are<00:04:19.889> some<00:04:20.250> transmog<00:04:20.789> items

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
videos but there are some transmog items

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.659 
videos but there are some transmog items
that<00:04:21.449> you<00:04:21.539> can<00:04:21.780> get<00:04:21.989> in<00:04:22.140> here<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.490> could

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
that you can get in here that you could

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.110 
that you can get in here that you could
actually<00:04:23.880> make<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.360> lot<00:04:24.599> of<00:04:24.719> gold<00:04:24.960> from<00:04:25.320> but

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
actually make a lot of gold from but

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.379 
actually make a lot of gold from but
don't

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
don't

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.929 
don't
on<00:04:27.659> it<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.289> probably<00:04:28.889> won't<00:04:29.099> happen<00:04:29.340> because

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:29.939 
on it it probably won't happen because

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.909 
on it it probably won't happen because

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
would I kind of take home for like a

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.360 
would I kind of take home for like a
whole<00:04:52.860> every<00:04:53.520> run<00:04:54.139> as<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.259> said<00:04:55.439> before<00:04:55.590> there

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
whole every run as I said before there

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.800 
whole every run as I said before there
there<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:56.699> be<00:04:56.729> other<00:04:56.909> little<00:04:57.090> things<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:57.599> get

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
there can be other little things you get

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.740 
there can be other little things you get
righteous<00:04:58.620> orbs<00:04:59.009> some<00:04:59.789> transmog<00:05:00.270> gear<00:05:00.569> and

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
righteous orbs some transmog gear and

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.869 
righteous orbs some transmog gear and
obviously<00:05:01.379> every<00:05:01.770> trans<00:05:02.069> lock<00:05:02.310> item<00:05:02.639> is<00:05:02.819> a

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
obviously every trans lock item is a

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.600 
obviously every trans lock item is a
disenchanted<00:05:03.750> item<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.379> so<00:05:04.889> make<00:05:05.250> sure<00:05:05.279> that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
disenchanted item and so make sure that

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.339 
disenchanted item and so make sure that
you<00:05:05.699> do<00:05:05.819> this<00:05:06.000> on<00:05:06.300> hope<00:05:06.569> on<00:05:06.779> hopefully<00:05:07.020> an

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
you do this on hope on hopefully an

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.499 
you do this on hope on hopefully an
enchanter<00:05:07.860> because<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:08.729> not<00:05:08.939> very<00:05:08.969> gear

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
enchanter because it's not very gear

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.779 
enchanter because it's not very gear
dependent<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.250> that's<00:05:11.250> pretty<00:05:11.430> much<00:05:11.550> all

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
dependent and that's pretty much all

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.360 
dependent and that's pretty much all
there<00:05:11.939> is<00:05:11.969> to<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.479> um<00:05:12.919> this<00:05:13.919> would<00:05:14.069> be<00:05:14.159> a<00:05:14.189> good

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
there is to it um this would be a good

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.339

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
would I would just be kind of weird to

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.589 
would I would just be kind of weird to
do<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:25.889> so<00:05:26.460> if<00:05:26.729> you<00:05:26.849> want<00:05:27.029> to<00:05:27.060> do<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:27.300> is<00:05:27.479> like
