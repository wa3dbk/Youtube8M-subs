00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
move back yeah it was it's just a really

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.419 
move back yeah it was it's just a really
lucky<00:02:07.720> thing<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.259> apart<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:09.130> one<00:02:09.280> thing

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
lucky thing to be apart the one thing

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.780 
lucky thing to be apart the one thing
about<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:11.410> sport<00:02:11.890> does<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.489> builds

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
about that that sport does it builds

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.720 
about that that sport does it builds
community<00:02:13.269> like<00:02:13.450> nothing<00:02:13.840> else<00:02:14.019> because<00:02:14.920> so

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
community like nothing else because so

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.930 
community like nothing else because so
much<00:02:15.850> effort<00:02:16.090> has<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:17.130> coalesce<00:02:18.130> around<00:02:18.430> one

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
much effort has to coalesce around one

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.050 
much effort has to coalesce around one
purpose<00:02:19.450> from<00:02:20.320> input<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:21.160> many<00:02:21.340> people<00:02:21.730> it

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
purpose from input so many people it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.670 
purpose from input so many people it
just<00:02:22.120> lends<00:02:22.420> yourself<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.930> building

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
just lends yourself to building

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.860 
just lends yourself to building
community<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.090> you've<00:02:25.209> got<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.840> know

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
community so you've got you know

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.320 
community so you've got you know
different<00:02:26.190> circular<00:02:27.190> concentric<00:02:27.820> circles<00:02:28.209> so

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
different circular concentric circles so

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.729 
different circular concentric circles so
it<00:02:28.390> starts<00:02:28.660> at<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.840> coach<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.470> players

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
it starts at the coach and the players

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.259 
it starts at the coach and the players
are<00:02:30.220> around<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.519> coach<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
are around the coach and then the

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.210 
are around the coach and then the
support<00:02:31.930> staffs<00:02:32.170> around<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.070> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
support staffs around that and then the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.979 
support staffs around that and then the
students<00:02:33.970> are<00:02:34.060> around<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
students are around that and then the

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.620 
students are around that and then the
the<00:02:35.680> fan<00:02:35.890> bases<00:02:36.130> around<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.030> everybody

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
the fan bases around that so everybody

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.420 
the fan bases around that so everybody
has<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.810> coalesce<00:02:38.290> around<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.769> one<00:02:38.950> purpose

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
has to coalesce around that one purpose

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.430 
has to coalesce around that one purpose
there<00:02:40.299> have<00:02:40.420> been<00:02:40.450> things<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.110> world<00:02:41.260> they

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
there have been things in the world they

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.729 
there have been things in the world they
don't<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:41.950> right<00:02:42.190> our<00:02:42.610> culture<00:02:43.150> loves

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
don't like that right our culture loves

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.880 
don't like that right our culture loves
to<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.880> use<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.600> as<00:02:46.840> sort<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.230> defining<00:02:47.680> a

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
to to use that as as sort of defining a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.250 
to to use that as as sort of defining a
binding<00:02:48.310> force<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.660> love<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.019> because

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
binding force and I love that because

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.060 
binding force and I love that because
it's<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:51.310> spades<00:02:51.610> here<00:02:51.940> in
