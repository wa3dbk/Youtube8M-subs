00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.509
 hello today I'm going to show you how it is that 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.250
 I wear semi- permanent eyelashes 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.290
 of these like the ones that put in the spas 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.730
 for eyelashes and well I hope that you 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 like if it's the first time they see no 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.410
 forget to like it and subscribe 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.860
 The first thing I'm going to do is clean 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.160
 perfectly my eyelashes to avoid 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.230
 that there is any receipt of grease and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 of makeup two ways and to you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.369
 makeup but in case the doubts is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.880
 important that you do this to avoid 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.820
 that your lashes are coming off quickly 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.890
 and then with my spoon I go to 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.510
 make my eyelashes if you do not want 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.250
 check them with a spoon, obviously 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.660
 with your curler I like it more because 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.050
 the shape of the curl is much more 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.050
 natural 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.350
 later I will use two types 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.210
 of brushes one like the one that comes in the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.789
 rails and also what has tips of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.920
 metal with the normal I'm going to brush my 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.780
 tabs so they separate and stay 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.549
 nice and better adhere the tab and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.770
 the glue that I will use obviously 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.200
 glue I'm putting it on 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.720
 black glue and the solvent for the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 glue is also very important for 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.470
 when you want to remove them, you do not 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.490
 you start or if you have some speck 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 Well, you can also clean it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.590
 easily and a pair of tweezers you can use 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 also tabs whether normal one 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 for one that comes in little pots that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.060
 they come in extensions and good the one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 want nothing more than obviously with the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 of a door you'll take more I'll 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.509
 use the tab and I'm just going to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.759
 put at the base of the tab a 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 little droplet of glue and I'm going to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.630
 drag around the length of the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.100
 tab so you can stick very 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.110
 all right 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.570
 I am applying it for the part of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.240
 down to see the birth 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.799
 free and there is a very natural effect like that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.659
 when you close your eyes to see that no 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.369
 it is noticed so much and also as well as what 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.920
 Remove the highlights or the tab 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.720
 synthetic and good with your little sister or with 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.350
 the clip then the chest of drawers in such a way 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.729
 that looks natural a believe me is a little 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.960
 difficult when I record this because 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.619
 It has to be very good and in addition 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.810
 accommodating 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.360
 now I am using in this case 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.159
 the lash extensions that are more 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.959
 tabs on one because it's a process 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.150
 faster but it takes less time if you 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.590
 are you going to use the ones that are a 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.659
 for a good you have to ensure that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.340
 You go tab by tab and you take a 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.019
 A little more time for that if it lasts 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.370
 much more or about three to 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.319
 four weeks that is the natural cycle 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.569
 on your tab instead you're good then 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.700
 last about two weeks and the advantage is 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.200
 what can we do in the house and what 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.950
 we can retouch how many times we want 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.769
 once he's a bit already chic he quoted 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.629
 the glue we are going to encapsulate those 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.250
 tabs so that it sticks 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.650
 perfectly with our tab 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.180
 natural try please do not pinch 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.180
 art because the truth is that it hurts a lot 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.720
 preferably look for the glue 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.580
 that they are going to use be and controversial 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.519
 same as the fade because if not 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.319
 they can burn a little and well then you 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.810
 can help a lot the eye is supposed to 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.580
 none of them hurt you now 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.799
 what is this what I did was brush 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.930
 to separate them and give them an effect 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.030
 much more beautiful here you can see 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.970
 the birth because I have the light of 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.040
 front but when they take it off when 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.900
 are normally with people not being 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.900
 note nothing and it looks very nice effect 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.879
 and well this is the most natural way 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.519
 let's say like this and only lashes with 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.139
 just the droplet in the base but if 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.060
 you want an effect a little more 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.040
 recharged what we are going to do is with a 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.239
 cotonete or even with a toothpick but 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.700
 that are new please and 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.409
 perfectly clean, they're going to 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.930
 remove the head in this case to the 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.200
 cotonete and they will submerge it on the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.060
 glue removing the excesses and 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.310
 passing it around the length of 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.290
 eyelashes like mascara 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.810
 good mascara as you 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.489
 like on fire 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.730
 and here what I did was also to put 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.200
 my finger not to stain my eyelid if it 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.510
 they will come to stain remember that 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.069
 have the solvent do not go to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.340
 scratch or nothing because if they are not going to 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.830
 leave red and well do not want that before 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.390
 to dry the glue to avoid 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.130
 there are lumps or sticking eyelashes 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.680
 between each other what I did was pass the 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.380
 metal brush to be separated 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.600
 and they will be nice to extend the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.790
 time of your lashes I recommend that you 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.680
 the first three days more or less 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.720
 put water directly on them and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.430
 less if it's hot for this good 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.229
 when you bathe you can use goals or 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.200
 look for some way to cover the area 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.720
 and also try to use products that 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.580
 do not have oils of any kind you can 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.800
 use your mascara as long as you do not 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.750
 is against water is and well they are going to 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.060
 last much longer I'm not any 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.800
 professional one tab on things 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.540
 that's what I do and it's the way I 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.630
 I wanted to share them with me as I do 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.060
 I hope you have fun, good as 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.310
 come is a super natural look it was like 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.800
 were your eyelashes 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.750
 I wait for you in the next one and you have me 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.750
 Good to have you here bye bye 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.390
 yes
