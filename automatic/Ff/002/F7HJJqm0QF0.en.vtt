to go ahead and double the recipe so
we're<00:01:56.289> going<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.500> go<00:01:56.590> ahead<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.070> form<00:01:57.280> this

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
we're going to go ahead and form this

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.190 
we're going to go ahead and form this
into<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.759> ball<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.060> what<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.659> want<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.020> a

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
into a ball and what you want is a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.590 
into a ball and what you want is a
smooth<00:01:59.649> elastic<00:02:00.039> consistency<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.420> is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
smooth elastic consistency and this is

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.590 
smooth elastic consistency and this is
just<00:02:01.810> about<00:02:01.960> perfect<00:02:05.970> next<00:02:06.970> what<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:07.240> want<00:02:07.270> to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
just about perfect next what you want to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.779 
just about perfect next what you want to
do<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:08.110> drizzle<00:02:08.440> some<00:02:08.739> olive<00:02:08.920> oil<00:02:09.130> into<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.729> bowl

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
to kind of form this out into a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.240 
to kind of form this out into a
rectangle<00:03:20.890> shape

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.770 

then<00:03:27.250> I'm<00:03:27.370> going<00:03:27.490> to<00:03:27.520> take<00:03:27.700> my<00:03:27.910> trusty<00:03:28.240> rolling

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
pin and roll it out until I'd say it's

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.660 
pin and roll it out until I'd say it's
about<00:03:31.120> nine<00:03:31.540> inches<00:03:31.780> wide<00:03:32.200> by<00:03:32.620> 11<00:03:32.980> inches<00:03:33.430> deep

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
about nine inches wide by 11 inches deep

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:42.520 
about nine inches wide by 11 inches deep
somewhere<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.390> neighborhood

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.140 

so<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.620> looks<00:03:43.800> something<00:03:44.130> like<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:44.970> is

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
so it looks something like this this is

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.870 
so it looks something like this this is
