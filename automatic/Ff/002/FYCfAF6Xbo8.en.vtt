00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.130

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.610
 We can use Greek yogurt or yogurt 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.890
 Natural can be sweetened without sugar 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.890
 or any other insurance that we like 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.269
 what we are going to do is cut the 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.510
 strawberries one of the strawberries we're going to 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.870
 contribute half of the rooms to 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 decorate and the rest of the strawberries are going to 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.890
 bring cubes 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.219
 as you can see here 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.710
 the nuts we are going to peel them and apply them 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.990
 not very finite and apples good at 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.530
 We are also going to cut it in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530
 cubes 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.310
 and once we have everything already cut 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.460
 let's start preparing the glass of 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.610
 strawberries 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.860
 we will mix the yogurt and in this case 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.660
 using greek football 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.660
 we mix it with the strawberry syrup 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.380
 and then we add the fruits 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.899

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.219

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.070
 and we will begin to fill the cups 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.659
 taking care not to stain the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.659
 borders 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.400

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.030
 decorate on top with the nuts that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.030
