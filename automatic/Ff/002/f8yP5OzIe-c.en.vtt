00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.760
 Command your fleet and launch a galaxy tour in "Sid Meier: Starship Battleship". 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:16.660
 Star Wars is a risk-oriented strategy game that combines episode missions, resource management, tactical operations, exploration and spacecraft design. 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.480
 Go to the New World and complete the mission on the planets that are all over the Milky Way. 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.900
 With the world of "Beyond Earth" as the stage, after the colonial era, players can play the role of fleet commander. 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.840
 Lead their starships across the Milky Way and make important choices to manage and build the world they control. 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:43.720
 In this video, we will introduce you to some of the mechanisms of Sid Meier: Star Wars, and how you can use them to achieve your unification of the Galaxy. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 Use "energy" to build new ships and modules. 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.000
 Build ships for any tactical purpose, including powerful armored combat cruisers with many short-range artillery pieces. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.360
 Or build a base of fighters and turn your ship into a powerful aircraft carrier. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.300
 Your federal scientist can research upgrades for ship modules. 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.880
 You can also win a scientific victory by unlocking three levels of technology. 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.780
 Use "metal" to build planetary improvement facilities to increase production and revenue in the world. 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.860
 Or, use Metal to build wonders to bring extra benefits to your fleet. 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.260
 Building seven wonders can win a spectacular victory. 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.580
 Use "food" to develop new cities on the planet. 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.340
 As the world's population increases, it will not only allow you to take a step further from winning the population (population accounts for 51% of the entire Galaxy). 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.580
 And each world can produce more resources for your federal output. 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.400
 The task of getting your fleet to perform is the core of this game. 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.680
 Combat missions are turn-based, and your ship can move and take action every turn: 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.860
 Launch a weapon, send a fighter or shoot a torpedo, invisible, or scan with a sensor. 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.000
 A narrow passage that allows ships and fighters to pass between these asteroid belts. 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.360
 You can use these channels, but be careful that the enemy will do the same. 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.080
 Your ship has a certain number of durable points. Once this value is zero, the ship will be destroyed. 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.540
 "Severe damage" can affect the performance of some modules, making your ship vulnerable and allowing you to make choices: 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.020
 Take advantage of an opportunity to repair these severely damaged areas or use the opportunity to fire against unsuspecting targets. 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.660
 Keep in mind that you can use the "energy" to repair your ship between tasks, but not in the mission. 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.480
 There are also battle cards that offer you extra benefits in combat. 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.320
 Some combat cards can affect a ship for a round, and some rare power cards allow the entire fleet to benefit from the entire mission. 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.640
 Don't underestimate these cards, they are often the difference between winning and losing. 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.100
 Even if your people are dedicated to their dedication, those long tasks will cause their casualties. 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.000
 When your staff feels tired, your ship's performance will also deteriorate. 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 When the people of the powerful fleet are tired, they may be defeated by enemies that could have been easily killed. 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.700
 At some point in your turn, you have to decide whether to let the rest and port. 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.780
 When you complete tasks and special errands, you gain influence points. 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.580
 Letting your people rely on Hong Kong will increase your influence in the world at the beginning of the next round. 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.300
 When you gain four influences on a planet, they join your federation. 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.080
 Other factions will also try to join the same world to join them. At this time, it is up to the influence to make a point. 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.680
 Winning a game in Star Wars doesn't just require tactical success in combat. You also need a winning plan. 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.200
 Then think about how to match the strengths of your world with improved facilities. 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.540
 For example, this frozen world will produce additional science. Building a secret laboratory here can make a bigger difference than other worlds. 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.960
 Plan your type of victory. If your federation is weak and surrounded by strong neighbors, 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.540
 You can win by scientific victory. 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.660
 If you have a large number of worlds, try to win by winning the population. 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.780
 "Sid Meier: Starship Battleship" provides a boundless Galaxy, waiting for you and your fleet to defeat the threat, 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.500
 Create a new era of glory for mankind. 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.540
