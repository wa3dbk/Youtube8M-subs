00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
them in multi-purpose solution for

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
them in multi-purpose solution for
around<00:01:36.780> six<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> eight<00:01:37.710> hours<00:01:38.030> personally<00:01:39.030> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
around six to eight hours personally I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
around six to eight hours personally I
do<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.290> day<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> sounds<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
do it for about a day I know it sounds a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520 
do it for about a day I know it sounds a
bit<00:01:41.759> excessive<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.350> sure

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
bit excessive but I like to make sure

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.960 
bit excessive but I like to make sure
that<00:01:43.710> they're<00:01:43.890> fully<00:01:44.070> hydrated<00:01:44.579> I'm<00:01:44.850> they

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that they're fully hydrated I'm they

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
that they're fully hydrated I'm they
gonna<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.299> safe<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.200> them<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.530> eyes

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
gonna be safe when I put them in my eyes

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.480 
gonna be safe when I put them in my eyes
and<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> yeah<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.140> don't<00:01:49.680> tend<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> keep<00:01:50.640> them<00:01:51.360> in

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
and so yeah I don't tend to keep them in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.590 
and so yeah I don't tend to keep them in
multi-purpose<00:01:53.490> solution<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.420> much

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
multi-purpose solution is so much

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
multi-purpose solution is so much
because<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.619> put<00:01:55.799> them<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.130> eyes<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because when I put them in my eyes it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
because when I put them in my eyes it
kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.909> stings<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.259> um<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.979> tend

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
kind of stings a little bit so um I tend

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.630 
kind of stings a little bit so um I tend
to<00:01:59.899> mix<00:02:00.899> them<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.409> saline<00:02:01.770> solution<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.549> put

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
to mix them with saline solution and put

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.420 
to mix them with saline solution and put
