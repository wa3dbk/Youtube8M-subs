00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.719
 we arrived this too before 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.210
 romeo and giulietta is a journey of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 roberto bolle that will interpret point on 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.539
 romeo goal that has a role that has you 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 accompanied throughout his career 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.640
 it is a role that I really started 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.510
 twenty years was my first role from 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.430
 first dancer from performer then a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.920
 role I am very attached to of the year 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.510
 next then with for 21 years are 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.450
 became first dancer with this 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.450
 role and then it really danced from 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.879
 new york in london in many theaters 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.460
 agree metropolitan of that road 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.420
 many times and to be a bit of years 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.730
 who did not interpret that 5-year scale 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 I believe there is a new production a new one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 then a new tribute 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 giulietta therefore many new features in reality 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.899
 and I'm just happy with the production a lot 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 beautiful 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.700
 giulietta in water medi new in the role 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 because the line is the first time 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.570
 who played this version 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.869
 di romeo so we did a job 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.930
 very nice together very interesting 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.960
 always nice to succeed even with mine 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.070
 experience a to help someone who 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.600
 debuts in a role and romeo who say a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.200
 beautiful role because it has a range 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.370
 punitive 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.950
 extraordinary 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.860
 first by the joy of falling in love 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.930
 from passion that ardente other 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 tragedy to the drama to death and therefore 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.300
 the interpreter really has the chance 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.380
 to express everything he has inside 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:58.030
 and so these years is very mature 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.020
 with me with that person of mine with 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.000
 just like what it is 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.310
 changed over the years given its role 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.440
 twenty years and the idea how to have 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.600
 twenty years that romeo has been in for twenty years 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:17.060
 certainly a very naive romeo 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.440
 who tries to express a lot of feelings 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.900
 deep above all those of the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.390
 tragedy of the second high of the third act 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.580
 but that he never lived in life 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.860
 now definitely or an emotional baggage 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 of life lived much more much more 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.040
 strong much more intense and I can 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.709
 interpret all this second part 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.680
 of romeo in more common way more 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:50.560
 convincing the most heartfelt and aware 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.220
 sure and how your cartoon should be 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.120
 giulietta and surely she also has one 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.620
 to this freshness this lightness of 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.060
 all the first part but must have 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.750
 this force is this weight 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.310
 just emotional to interpret everything 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.310
 the third act in this version in 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.880
 particularly the trio is a lot 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.660
 so minimalist are so many moments 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.710
 even where she is immobile then it is 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.820
 something that happens inside her doesn't 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.880
 and a whole process that then leads her to 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.670
 wanting to want to die decided to take 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.660
 this decision is so dramatic then 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.300
 she must also have these opposites 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.290
 then read a deep part 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.060
 intense with this dramatic charge 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.510
 on the other, and then new research nose 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:57.360
 an ideal partner in this now 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.360
 We make good luck thanks
