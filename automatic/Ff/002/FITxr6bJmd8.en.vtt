learning about how to make a battery in
this<00:00:07.259> clip<00:00:07.589> we're<00:00:07.919> going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.189> take<00:00:08.370> an

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
this clip we're going to take an

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.490 
this clip we're going to take an
ordinary<00:00:08.790> household<00:00:09.389> potato<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.139> turn<00:00:10.380> it

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
ordinary household potato and turn it

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.589 
ordinary household potato and turn it
into<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.740> voltage<00:00:11.160> source<00:00:11.340> powerful<00:00:12.000> enough<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
into a voltage source powerful enough to

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.230 
into a voltage source powerful enough to
drive<00:00:12.809> an<00:00:12.960> LED<00:00:13.099> to<00:00:14.099> start<00:00:14.370> off<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:15.059> need<00:00:15.179> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
drive an LED to start off you need to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.269 
drive an LED to start off you need to
get<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> regular<00:00:15.960> household<00:00:16.410> potato<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.130> cut

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
get a regular household potato and cut

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.700 
get a regular household potato and cut
it<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.550> half<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.720> household<00:00:19.199> potato<00:00:19.500> is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it in half because a household potato is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.349 
it in half because a household potato is
relatively<00:00:20.130> large<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.699> don't<00:00:20.910> need<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> whole

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
relatively large we don't need the whole

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.420 
relatively large we don't need the whole
thing<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.230> use<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.710> two<00:00:22.890> halves<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
thing and we can use the two halves to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670 
thing and we can use the two halves to
make<00:00:23.460> two<00:00:23.760> voltage<00:00:24.150> sources<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.560> go

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
make two voltage sources so if you go

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920 
make two voltage sources so if you go
ahead<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> cut<00:00:26.279> your<00:00:26.400> potato<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.910> half<00:00:27.119> you'll

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
ahead and cut your potato in half you'll

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.210 
ahead and cut your potato in half you'll
start<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> notice<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.680> they're<00:00:28.859> relatively

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
start to notice that they're relatively

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.929 
start to notice that they're relatively
juicy

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
juicy

I<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.720> potatoes<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.439> known<00:00:31.619> for

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I don't think potatoes are known for

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
I don't think potatoes are known for
their<00:00:31.920> juices<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.059> exactly<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
their juices but that's exactly what is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
their juices but that's exactly what is
going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> act<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> electrolyte<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.820> need

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
going to act as the electrolyte we need

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.630 
going to act as the electrolyte we need
in<00:00:36.239> order<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.719> produce<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.590> electron<00:00:38.309> flow

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
in order to produce that electron flow

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
in order to produce that electron flow
between<00:00:39.120> our<00:00:39.480> anode<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.930> our<00:00:40.079> cathode<00:00:40.469> and

between our anode on our cathode and
with<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> potato<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.360> electrolyte<00:00:43.170> consists

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
with a potato that electrolyte consists

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.190 
with a potato that electrolyte consists

nail and driving it into the other side
of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.549> potato<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.810> point<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.290> very

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
of the potato at this point it's very

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
of the potato at this point it's very
important<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.549> cathode<00:01:36.060> doesn't<00:01:36.720> touch

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
important that the cathode doesn't touch

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
important that the cathode doesn't touch
the<00:01:37.079> anode<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.070> two<00:01:38.250> touch<00:01:38.520> together

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the anode if the two touch together

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.630

parallel<00:05:43.280> you're<00:05:43.970> going<00:05:44.210> to<00:05:44.300> connect<00:05:44.600> their

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
parallel you're going to connect their

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.650 
parallel you're going to connect their
cathodes<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.800> each<00:05:45.919> other

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
cathodes to each other

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.200 
cathodes to each other
and<00:05:48.190> you're<00:05:49.190> going<00:05:49.370> to<00:05:49.400> connect<00:05:49.700> their<00:05:49.850> anodes

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
and you're going to connect their anodes

and you're going to connect their anodes
to<00:05:50.450> each<00:05:50.570> other<00:05:50.810> and<00:05:52.120> if<00:05:53.120> we<00:05:53.270> recall<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:53.840> first

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
to each other and if we recall the first

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.560 
to each other and if we recall the first
clip<00:05:54.470> I've<00:05:54.650> outlined<00:05:55.430> that<00:05:55.820> connecting

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
clip I've outlined that connecting

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.240 
clip I've outlined that connecting
batteries<00:05:56.960> in<00:05:57.110> parallel<00:05:57.290> doesn't<00:05:57.980> increase

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
batteries in parallel doesn't increase

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.040 
batteries in parallel doesn't increase
their<00:05:58.490> voltage<00:05:58.669> it<00:05:59.060> increases<00:05:59.510> their<00:05:59.660> current

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
their voltage it increases their current

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.770 
their voltage it increases their current
so<00:06:00.560> by<00:06:00.770> connecting<00:06:01.430> three<00:06:01.790> pairs<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.300> parallel

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
so by connecting three pairs of parallel

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.870 
so by connecting three pairs of parallel
batteries<00:06:03.380> together<00:06:03.560> in<00:06:03.919> series<00:06:04.370> you're

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
batteries together in series you're

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.520 
batteries together in series you're
going<00:06:05.150> to<00:06:05.240> increase<00:06:05.600> their<00:06:05.870> voltage<00:06:06.050> and

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
going to increase their voltage and

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.820 
going to increase their voltage and
increase<00:06:07.190> their<00:06:07.370> current<00:06:11.440> now<00:06:12.440> that<00:06:12.590> we<00:06:12.680> have

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
increase their current now that we have

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.440 
increase their current now that we have
three<00:06:13.040> pairs<00:06:13.250> of<00:06:13.490> batteries<00:06:13.850> connected<00:06:14.330> in

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
three pairs of batteries connected in

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.060 
three pairs of batteries connected in
parallel<00:06:14.480> in<00:06:15.080> order<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:15.500> increase<00:06:15.800> the

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
parallel in order to increase the

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.740 
parallel in order to increase the
current<00:06:16.310> which<00:06:16.669> will<00:06:16.880> make<00:06:17.000> the<00:06:17.120> LED<00:06:17.390> brighter

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
current which will make the LED brighter

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.780 
current which will make the LED brighter
we<00:06:18.380> need<00:06:18.560> to<00:06:18.650> connect<00:06:18.950> these<00:06:19.130> three<00:06:19.400> pairs<00:06:19.610> in

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
the camera can see it and as you see the

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.280 
the camera can see it and as you see the
LED<00:07:11.460> is<00:07:11.760> signing<00:07:12.120> a<00:07:12.210> lot<00:07:12.480> brighter<00:07:12.840> than<00:07:13.020> it

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
LED is signing a lot brighter than it

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.750 
LED is signing a lot brighter than it
would<00:07:13.470> have<00:07:13.500> if<00:07:13.890> we<00:07:13.920> only<00:07:14.220> had<00:07:14.490> three

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760 
would have if we only had three

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.970 
would have if we only had three
batteries<00:07:15.090> in<00:07:15.330> series<00:07:15.540> so<00:07:16.350> we've<00:07:16.560> increased

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980 
batteries in series so we've increased

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.860 
batteries in series so we've increased
the<00:07:17.250> voltage<00:07:17.430> by<00:07:17.940> putting<00:07:18.240> the<00:07:18.330> batteries<00:07:18.720> in

the voltage by putting the batteries in

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.660 
the voltage by putting the batteries in
series<00:07:19.080> and<00:07:19.410> increase<00:07:20.010> the<00:07:20.160> current<00:07:20.490> at<00:07:20.580> the

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
series and increase the current at the

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.390 
series and increase the current at the
same<00:07:20.880> time<00:07:21.120> by<00:07:21.450> putting<00:07:21.780> them<00:07:21.900> in<00:07:21.990> parallel

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400
