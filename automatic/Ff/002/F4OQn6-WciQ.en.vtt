red dormant buds have sprung into life

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.770 
red dormant buds have sprung into life
they've<00:01:09.680> produced<00:01:10.220> new<00:01:10.760> stems<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.720> leaves

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
they've produced new stems and leaves

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.910 
they've produced new stems and leaves
along<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.890> stem<00:01:13.270> using<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.930> heading<00:01:15.500> cut

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
along the stem using this heading cut

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.420 
along the stem using this heading cut
we've<00:01:16.700> produced<00:01:17.540> more<00:01:18.170> growth<00:01:18.530> we've<00:01:18.830> forced

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
we've produced more growth we've forced

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.330 
we've produced more growth we've forced
those<00:01:19.640> buds<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.420> grow<00:01:20.780> up<00:01:21.020> along<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.800> stem<00:01:22.070> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
those buds to grow up along the stem and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.790 
those buds to grow up along the stem and
we've<00:01:22.850> used<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:23.390> technique<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:23.960> thicken<00:01:24.680> up

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
we've used this technique to thicken up

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.970 
we've used this technique to thicken up
our<00:01:24.980> plants<00:01:25.610> using<00:01:26.300> up<00:01:26.630> our<00:01:26.780> heading<00:01:27.440> cut<00:01:27.740> we

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
our plants using up our heading cut we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.400 
our plants using up our heading cut we
get<00:01:28.190> thicker<00:01:28.550> hedges<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.240> more<00:01:29.810> stems<00:01:30.170> and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
get thicker hedges and more stems and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.300 
get thicker hedges and more stems and
flowers<00:01:30.980> on<00:01:31.190> flowering<00:01:31.850> annuals<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.510> baskets

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
now the next image shows a thinning cut

now the next image shows a thinning cut
and<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.600> where<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.050> in<00:01:39.230> do<00:01:39.560> indeed<00:01:40.400> take

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
and this is where we in do indeed take

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.930 
and this is where we in do indeed take

entire branch off we remove the branch

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.330 
entire branch off we remove the branch
right<00:01:44.480> back<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.990> where<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.320> started<00:01:45.350> as<00:01:45.980> a<00:01:46.010> bud
