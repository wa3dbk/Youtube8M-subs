00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.399 
out of there so that's caused a lot of
problems<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.979> gotta<00:01:14.130> buy<00:01:14.689> one<00:01:15.689> new<00:01:15.930> injector

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
some of the injection ones I have all

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.389 
some of the injection ones I have all
six<00:01:40.530> only<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> few<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> them

six only have a few of them

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.319 
six only have a few of them
this<00:01:44.399> motor<00:01:44.640> only<00:01:44.820> has<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> hundred

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
this motor only has like a hundred

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.550 
this motor only has like a hundred
thousand<00:01:45.869> miles<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.670 

turbo<00:01:49.560> doesn't<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.040> any<00:01:50.189> planning<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.880> all

turbo doesn't have any planning at all

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.870 
turbo doesn't have any planning at all
so<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.189> good<00:01:54.110> spins<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.320> freely

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.950 

it's<00:01:59.150> good<00:02:01.180> Chuck<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.270> pulled<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.570> out<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.840> was

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
it's good Chuck I pulled it out of was

rusted out

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.040 
rusted out
so<00:02:06.070> odometer<00:02:07.070> only<00:02:07.280> said<00:02:07.539> 120,000<00:02:08.539> miles<00:02:08.690> on

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
so odometer only said 120,000 miles on

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.020 
so odometer only said 120,000 miles on
it<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:10.160> wish<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.340> would<00:02:10.580> have<00:02:10.670> heard<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.880> run

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
but so far just by turning it over by

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.820 
but so far just by turning it over by
hand<00:02:14.480> everything<00:02:14.900> seems<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:16.400> know<00:02:16.550> good

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
hand everything seems you know good

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.310 
hand everything seems you know good
I<00:02:18.860> took<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.850> timing<00:02:20.180> cover<00:02:20.300> off<00:02:20.630> made<00:02:21.080> sure

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
I took the timing cover off made sure

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.740 
I took the timing cover off made sure
