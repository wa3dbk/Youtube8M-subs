is probably why most merchants require a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
is probably why most merchants require a
minimum<00:01:18.210> charge<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.560> their<00:01:19.650> credit<00:01:19.950> cards

minimum charge for their credit cards

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.539 
minimum charge for their credit cards
because<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.000> could<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> same<00:01:21.479> thing<00:01:21.840> with

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
because you could the same thing with

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
because you could the same thing with
credit<00:01:23.549> card<00:01:23.700> readers<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.390> for<00:01:25.020> any

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
credit card readers that you get for any

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.450 
credit card readers that you get for any
POS<00:01:25.650> system<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.970> cases<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:29.280> one's
