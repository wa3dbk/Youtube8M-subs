the<00:02:14.379> gate<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.709> area<00:02:15.099> where<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.610> showed<00:02:15.940> you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the gate is the area where I showed you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.040 
the gate is the area where I showed you
I<00:02:17.760> will<00:02:18.760> also<00:02:19.030> be<00:02:19.150> showing<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.540> how<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.720> do<00:02:19.930> the
