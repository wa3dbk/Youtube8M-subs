00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.640 
back on him and I had no confidence I
didn't<00:02:47.400> know<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.639> was<00:02:47.730> talking<00:02:47.970> about<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
didn't know what I was talking about and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.520 
didn't know what I was talking about and
that<00:02:49.650> was<00:02:49.859> basically<00:02:50.599> that<00:02:51.599> enough<00:02:52.170> right

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
that was basically that enough right

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.099 
that was basically that enough right
there<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:53.459> little<00:02:53.519> criticism<00:02:54.239> was<00:02:54.810> enough

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
there that little criticism was enough

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.949 
there that little criticism was enough
to<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.680> me<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:56.310> tried<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.879> YouTube<00:02:57.239> thinkin<00:02:57.780> I

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
to get me to tried the YouTube thinkin I

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.509 
to get me to tried the YouTube thinkin I
wanted<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.620> try<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.799> now<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.189> I<00:02:59.220> thought<00:02:59.489> I

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
wanted to try it now that I thought I

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.470 
wanted to try it now that I thought I
had<00:02:59.790> some<00:03:00.000> confidence<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.939> since<00:03:02.939> tack<00:03:03.239> was

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
had some confidence and since tack was

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.039 
had some confidence and since tack was
having<00:03:03.780> some<00:03:03.989> success<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:05.189> figured<00:03:05.939> I<00:03:06.150> might<00:03:06.810> be

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
having some success I figured I might be

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.039 
having some success I figured I might be
able<00:03:07.109> to<00:03:07.349> do<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.590> same<00:03:07.769> thing<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:09.000> little<00:03:09.930> did

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
able to do the same thing and little did

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.050 
able to do the same thing and little did
I<00:03:10.170> know<00:03:10.200> how<00:03:10.590> hard<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:11.010> would<00:03:11.099> be<00:03:11.159> but<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:11.970> was

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
I know how hard it would be but it was

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.599 
I know how hard it would be but it was
definitely<00:03:12.299> worth<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:14.159> wouldn't

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
definitely worth it because I wouldn't

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.319 
definitely worth it because I wouldn't
be<00:03:14.730> here<00:03:14.909> now<00:03:14.970> making<00:03:15.480> videos<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.200> guys

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.779 
saw that video I told tak about the site
and<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.159> we<00:04:26.669> should<00:04:27.090> definitely<00:04:27.510> try<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:29.010> do

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
and that we should definitely try to do

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.820 
and that we should definitely try to do
it<00:04:29.969> and<00:04:30.210> that's<00:04:30.690> where<00:04:31.020> we<00:04:31.110> started<00:04:31.500> Hunger

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
it and that's where we started Hunger

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.000 
it and that's where we started Hunger
Games<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.370> since<00:04:32.700> he<00:04:32.849> was<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.469> more<00:04:34.469> popular

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
Games and since he was a more popular

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.480 
Games and since he was a more popular
that<00:04:35.940> helped<00:04:36.360> boost<00:04:36.719> our<00:04:36.990> channels<00:04:37.560> immensely

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
that helped boost our channels immensely

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.089 
that helped boost our channels immensely
since<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.210> both<00:04:39.389> did<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.870> same<00:04:39.900> game<00:04:40.800> plays

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
since we both did the same game plays

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.879 
since we both did the same game plays
and<00:04:41.400> originally<00:04:42.060> we<00:04:42.090> had<00:04:42.210> our<00:04:42.889> number-one

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
and originally we had our number-one

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.529 
and originally we had our number-one
Hunger<00:04:44.130> Games<00:04:44.279> he<00:04:44.520> had<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:44.880> on<00:04:44.940> his<00:04:45.120> original

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
Hunger Games he had it on his original

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.790 
Hunger Games he had it on his original
channel<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.900> don't<00:04:46.050> think<00:04:46.200> he<00:04:46.260> has<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.409> videos

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
channel I don't think he has the videos

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800 
channel I don't think he has the videos
anymore<00:04:47.039> that<00:04:47.940> were<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.300> original<00:04:48.659> ones

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
anymore that were the original ones

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.899 
anymore that were the original ones
because<00:04:48.990> they<00:04:49.110> were<00:04:49.169> not<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.770> best<00:04:50.010> even

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
because they were not the best even

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.250 
because they were not the best even
though<00:04:51.000> they<00:04:51.120> are<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.510> highest<00:04:51.690> viewed<00:04:52.080> on<00:04:52.169> my

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
though they are the highest viewed on my

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.510 
though they are the highest viewed on my
channel<00:04:52.620> just<00:04:52.800> because<00:04:53.039> they're<00:04:53.190> at<00:04:53.400> the

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
channel just because they're at the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.200 
channel just because they're at the
longest<00:04:54.000> um<00:04:54.210> but<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.260> was<00:04:55.380> still<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.919> really<00:04:56.909> fun

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210
