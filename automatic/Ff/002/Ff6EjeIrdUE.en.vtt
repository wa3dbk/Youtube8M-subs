test<00:00:50.489> took<00:00:50.940> through<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> seat<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.160> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
test took through the seat and it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
test took through the seat and it
plugged<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:54.000> molex<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> very<00:00:56.910> wild<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
plugged into molex so very wild or you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.819 
plugged into molex so very wild or you
can<00:00:57.840> tell<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> puts<00:00:58.590> out<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> ton<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> air

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
can tell but it puts out a ton of air

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.190 
can tell but it puts out a ton of air
and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:01.980> here's<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:02.760> vortex<00:01:03.420> CF<00:01:04.409> v12<00:01:05.250> HP<00:01:06.200> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and then here's my vortex CF v12 HP you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
and then here's my vortex CF v12 HP you
can<00:01:07.350> tell<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.580> pulling<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
can tell I see it there pulling the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.050 
can tell I see it there pulling the
receipt<00:01:10.130> about<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.369> same<00:01:11.580> amount<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.880> airflow

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
receipt about the same amount of airflow

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.260

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.350 

so<00:01:18.270> I'm<00:01:18.420> sitting<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.050> uh<00:01:19.400> at<00:01:20.400> idle<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.210> my

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
so I'm sitting here uh at idle with my

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530 
so I'm sitting here uh at idle with my
computer<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:22.050> averaging<00:01:22.830> around<00:01:23.030> 30<00:01:24.030> degrees

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
maximum is around 33 on all my cords

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420 
maximum is around 33 on all my cords
except<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.420> once<00:01:33.750> at<00:01:33.930> 42<00:01:34.440> yeah<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> virgin

of<00:02:41.269> turning<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.140> sound<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:42.560> making

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.009 

so<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.940> still<00:02:50.180> fairly<00:02:50.510> quiet<00:02:52.569> I'm<00:02:53.569> not<00:02:53.750> sure

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
so it's still fairly quiet I'm not sure

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.990 
so it's still fairly quiet I'm not sure
how<00:02:54.290> much<00:02:54.500> fans<00:02:54.920> would<00:02:55.250> make<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> difference<00:02:55.880> as

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
how much fans would make a difference as

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.759 
how much fans would make a difference as
far<00:02:56.030> as<00:02:56.239> cooling<00:02:56.750> goes<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.290> now<00:02:57.470> I'm<00:02:57.560> going<00:02:57.709> to

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
far as cooling goes but now I'm going to

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.509 
far as cooling goes but now I'm going to
switch<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.010> over<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.489> we'll<00:02:58.580> try<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.120> out<00:02:59.330> okay

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
switch it over and we'll try it out okay

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.759 
switch it over and we'll try it out okay
now<00:03:01.519> with<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.090> vortex<00:03:02.360> pin<00:03:03.140> installed<00:03:03.590> you

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
now with the vortex pin installed you

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.550 
now with the vortex pin installed you
can<00:03:03.860> see<00:03:04.130> him<00:03:04.250> hovering<00:03:04.489> around<00:03:05.319> 30<00:03:06.319> degrees

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
can see him hovering around 30 degrees

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.670 
can see him hovering around 30 degrees
about<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.700> same<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.450> mean<00:03:08.780> for<00:03:09.079> idle<00:03:09.500> that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
about the same I mean for idle that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.960 
about the same I mean for idle that
should<00:03:09.920> stay<00:03:10.190> about<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.489> same<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.820> got

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
should stay about the same and I got

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.930 
should stay about the same and I got
this<00:03:14.150> fan<00:03:14.480> installed<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.340> can<00:03:19.519> hear<00:03:19.820> with

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
this fan installed so you can hear with

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.729 
this fan installed so you can hear with
this<00:03:20.120> Finn<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.540> only<00:03:20.750> complaint<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.410> is

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
this Finn the only complaint I have is

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.330 
this Finn the only complaint I have is
it<00:03:22.549> kind<00:03:22.790> of<00:03:22.820> has<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.150> turbine<00:03:23.720> no<00:03:24.049> wine<00:03:24.920> to

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
it kind of has like a turbine no wine to

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.199 
it kind of has like a turbine no wine to
it<00:03:25.489> if<00:03:25.579> you<00:03:25.700> listen<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.299> at<00:03:26.420> low<00:03:26.600> rpms

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.130 

now<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.140> doesn't<00:03:34.319> seem<00:03:34.620> bad<00:03:35.689> but<00:03:36.689> this<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.870> what

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
now it doesn't seem bad but this is what

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.059 
now it doesn't seem bad but this is what
it<00:03:37.260> sounds<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.590> at<00:03:37.860> low<00:03:38.040> rpms<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.680> then<00:03:43.829> here

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
it sounds like at low rpms and then here

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.119 
it sounds like at low rpms and then here
we<00:03:44.159> are<00:03:44.189> running<00:03:44.459> prime95<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:46.769> see<00:03:47.010> I'm

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
we are running prime95 you see I'm

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.339 
we are running prime95 you see I'm
hovering<00:03:47.610> around<00:03:47.760> 50<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:49.829> 55<00:03:50.489> degrees<00:03:51.349> about

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
hovering around 50 to 55 degrees about

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.089 
hovering around 50 to 55 degrees about
the<00:03:52.409> same<00:03:52.920> as<00:03:53.159> our<00:03:53.280> last<00:03:53.519> temperatures

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
the same as our last temperatures

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.660 
the same as our last temperatures
however<00:03:56.329> learning<00:03:57.329> at<00:03:57.629> max<00:03:58.370> whose<00:03:59.370> are<00:03:59.579> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
however learning at max whose are the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.500 
however learning at max whose are the
differences<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:02.430> see<00:04:02.700> it's<00:04:02.939> still<00:04:03.150> pushing<00:04:03.450> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
differences you see it's still pushing a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.819 
differences you see it's still pushing a
lot<00:04:03.599> air<00:04:03.810> but<00:04:03.959> looking<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.319> sound<00:04:04.650> it

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
lot air but looking to the sound it

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.040 
lot air but looking to the sound it
makes

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.090 

kind<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.160> whining<00:04:11.780> turbine<00:04:12.780> sound<00:04:13.380> so

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
kind of like a whining turbine sound so

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.370 
kind of like a whining turbine sound so
this<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:14.760> would<00:04:14.940> say<00:04:15.180> stick<00:04:15.630> with<00:04:15.810> your<00:04:15.990> stock

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
this I would say stick with your stock

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.800 
this I would say stick with your stock
band<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.900> use<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.110> as<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.350> case<00:04:19.860> fan<00:04:20.810> because

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
band and use this as a case fan because

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.270 
band and use this as a case fan because
whenever<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.200> plug<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.530> into<00:04:22.680> molex<00:04:23.100> it

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
whenever you plug it into molex it

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.650 
whenever you plug it into molex it
doesn't<00:04:23.550> make<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:23.850> sound<00:04:24.260> but<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.290> lower<00:04:25.560> rpms

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
doesn't make the sound but a lower rpms

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.490 
doesn't make the sound but a lower rpms
and<00:04:27.660> higher<00:04:28.640> makes<00:04:29.640> this<00:04:29.820> pliny<00:04:30.180> sound

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.900 

however<00:04:34.500> guys<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.190> don't<00:04:35.250> want<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.580> say<00:04:35.700> this

can't<00:05:37.600> even<00:05:37.690> feel<00:05:37.960> para<00:05:38.290> moving<00:05:38.800> behind<00:05:39.340> it<00:05:45.150> so

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
can't even feel para moving behind it so

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.990 
can't even feel para moving behind it so
I<00:05:46.180> decided<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.900> plug<00:05:47.560> in<00:05:47.740> this<00:05:47.980> fin<00:05:48.280> as<00:05:48.520> my<00:05:48.730> case

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
I decided to plug in this fin as my case

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.029 
I decided to plug in this fin as my case
fan<00:05:49.330> now<00:05:49.710> listen<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.800> how<00:05:50.830> loud<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.400> is

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.100 

nice<00:05:57.729> it<00:05:57.879> plugged<00:05:58.090> into<00:05:58.300> a<00:05:58.449> four<00:05:58.810> pin

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
nice it plugged into a four pin

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.820 
nice it plugged into a four pin
connector<00:05:59.680> you<00:05:59.860> can<00:05:59.889> see<00:06:00.189> there<00:06:01.530> but<00:06:02.530> it<00:06:02.620> so

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
connector you can see there but it so

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.200 
connector you can see there but it so
loud<00:06:04.620> I'm<00:06:05.620> gonna<00:06:05.800> switch<00:06:06.159> it<00:06:06.189> over<00:06:06.610> all<00:06:06.789> fast

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.179 

see<00:06:10.210> what's<00:06:10.389> going<00:06:10.689> on<00:06:13.710> well<00:06:14.710> guys<00:06:14.889> I'm<00:06:15.069> not

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:15.189 
see what's going on well guys I'm not

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:17.369 
see what's going on well guys I'm not
sure<00:06:15.400> why<00:06:15.580> this<00:06:15.639> is<00:06:16.060> but<00:06:16.120> whenever<00:06:16.659> I<00:06:16.840> switched

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
sure why this is but whenever I switched

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.760 
sure why this is but whenever I switched
it<00:06:17.680> down<00:06:17.949> from<00:06:18.370> this<00:06:18.610> pin<00:06:18.969> header<00:06:19.379> to<00:06:20.379> this

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
it down from this pin header to this

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.469 
it down from this pin header to this
header<00:06:21.250> down<00:06:21.490> here<00:06:21.729> now<00:06:21.939> the<00:06:22.000> span<00:06:22.449> is

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
header down here now the span is

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:29.399 
header down here now the span is
completely<00:06:23.199> quiet<00:06:27.930> you're<00:06:28.930> still<00:06:29.169> getting<00:06:29.259> a

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
completely quiet you're still getting a

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.189 
completely quiet you're still getting a
pretty<00:06:29.590> good<00:06:29.650> airflow<00:06:29.919> but<00:06:30.520> it's<00:06:30.990> pretty<00:06:31.990> much

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
pretty good airflow but it's pretty much

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.950 
pretty good airflow but it's pretty much
quiet<00:06:32.849> communis<00:06:33.849> connectors<00:06:34.389> I'm<00:06:34.599> not<00:06:34.779> sure

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
quiet communis connectors I'm not sure

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.019 
quiet communis connectors I'm not sure
if<00:06:35.020> it's<00:06:35.169> a<00:06:35.259> setting<00:06:35.620> I<00:06:35.770> have<00:06:35.949> that's<00:06:36.759> set

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
if it's a setting I have that's set

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.540 
if it's a setting I have that's set
wrong<00:06:37.330> or<00:06:37.629> whatever<00:06:37.979> however<00:06:38.979> I<00:06:39.279> don't<00:06:39.370> think

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
wrong or whatever however I don't think

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.149 
wrong or whatever however I don't think
this<00:06:39.819> is<00:06:39.939> a<00:06:39.969> bad<00:06:40.210> fan<00:06:40.750> I<00:06:41.050> think<00:06:41.289> it's<00:06:41.409> just<00:06:41.620> you

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159 
this is a bad fan I think it's just you

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:44.570 
this is a bad fan I think it's just you
know<00:06:42.250> like<00:06:42.279> I<00:06:42.610> said<00:06:42.819> some<00:06:43.000> type<00:06:43.180> of<00:06:43.389> setting

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
know like I said some type of setting

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.670 
know like I said some type of setting
because<00:06:45.580> whenever<00:06:45.849> I<00:06:46.029> tried<00:06:46.330> it<00:06:46.509> out<00:06:46.629> as<00:06:46.900> a<00:06:47.050> CPU

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
because whenever I tried it out as a CPU

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.170 
because whenever I tried it out as a CPU
fan<00:06:47.919> and<00:06:48.219> whenever<00:06:48.430> I<00:06:48.520> plug<00:06:48.729> it<00:06:48.849> into<00:06:48.969> the

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
fan and whenever I plug it into the

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.390 
fan and whenever I plug it into the
connectors<00:06:49.659> right<00:06:49.900> they're<00:06:50.189> making<00:06:51.189> a<00:06:51.219> really

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
connectors right they're making a really

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.550 
connectors right they're making a really
bad<00:06:51.639> whining<00:06:52.240> sound<00:06:52.599> and<00:06:52.870> now<00:06:52.990> it's<00:06:53.199> pretty

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
bad whining sound and now it's pretty

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.700 
bad whining sound and now it's pretty
silent<00:06:54.060> so<00:06:55.060> anyway<00:06:55.389> maybe<00:06:55.659> just<00:06:55.990> keep<00:06:56.319> that<00:06:56.529> in

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
silent so anyway maybe just keep that in

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.029 
silent so anyway maybe just keep that in
mind<00:06:56.889> when<00:06:57.069> you're<00:06:57.189> looking<00:06:57.250> at<00:06:57.580> this<00:06:57.669> fan<00:06:59.039> so

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
mind when you're looking at this fan so

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.040 
mind when you're looking at this fan so
I<00:07:00.069> guess<00:07:00.310> the<00:07:00.460> final<00:07:00.639> verdict<00:07:01.180> on<00:07:01.300> this<00:07:01.509> man<00:07:01.779> if

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
I guess the final verdict on this man if

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.170 
I guess the final verdict on this man if
you<00:07:02.229> were<00:07:02.349> to<00:07:02.560> give<00:07:02.770> a<00:07:03.009> fan<00:07:03.400> one<00:07:03.789> which<00:07:03.969> is<00:07:04.150> a

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
you were to give a fan one which is a

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.850 
you were to give a fan one which is a
little<00:07:04.479> weird<00:07:04.719> but<00:07:04.960> I<00:07:05.020> guess<00:07:05.229> for<00:07:05.409> the<00:07:05.500> purpose

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
little weird but I guess for the purpose

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.249 
little weird but I guess for the purpose
of<00:07:06.009> this<00:07:06.159> video<00:07:06.400> I<00:07:06.819> don't<00:07:07.389> see<00:07:07.839> it<00:07:07.900> as<00:07:07.990> being

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
of this video I don't see it as being

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:12.209 
of this video I don't see it as being
the<00:07:08.650> best<00:07:09.389> CPU<00:07:10.389> fan<00:07:10.659> but<00:07:11.379> as<00:07:11.469> far<00:07:11.740> as<00:07:11.770> a<00:07:11.949> case

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:12.219 
the best CPU fan but as far as a case

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.999 
the best CPU fan but as far as a case
fan<00:07:12.580> in<00:07:12.879> this<00:07:13.060> situation<00:07:13.810> once<00:07:14.500> I<00:07:14.680> got<00:07:14.889> it

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:15.009 
fan in this situation once I got it

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:16.619 
fan in this situation once I got it
figured<00:07:15.190> out<00:07:15.400> for<00:07:15.699> some<00:07:15.879> reason<00:07:16.210> like<00:07:16.360> I<00:07:16.419> said

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:16.629 
figured out for some reason like I said

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:18.029 
figured out for some reason like I said
it<00:07:16.719> was<00:07:16.810> weird<00:07:16.990> whenever<00:07:17.289> I<00:07:17.469> plugged<00:07:17.710> it<00:07:17.889> into

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
it was weird whenever I plugged it into

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.369 
it was weird whenever I plugged it into
these<00:07:18.310> connectors<00:07:18.879> making<00:07:19.870> some<00:07:20.169> kind<00:07:20.289> of

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:20.379 
these connectors making some kind of

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:22.200 
these connectors making some kind of
whining<00:07:20.860> noise<00:07:21.099> whenever<00:07:21.580> I<00:07:21.669> plugged<00:07:21.940> it<00:07:22.089> into

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
whining noise whenever I plugged it into

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.809 
whining noise whenever I plugged it into
a<00:07:22.449> different<00:07:22.690> connector<00:07:23.229> it<00:07:23.409> didn't<00:07:23.800> so<00:07:24.550> maybe

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:24.819 
a different connector it didn't so maybe

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.820 
a different connector it didn't so maybe
that's<00:07:25.060> just<00:07:25.240> me<00:07:25.479> and<00:07:25.659> my<00:07:25.779> settings<00:07:26.229> however

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830 
that's just me and my settings however

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.480 
that's just me and my settings however
now<00:07:27.189> I<00:07:27.219> got<00:07:27.520> it<00:07:27.639> set<00:07:27.879> up<00:07:27.909> and<00:07:28.389> you<00:07:28.509> can<00:07:28.539> hear

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
now I got it set up and you can hear

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.100 
now I got it set up and you can hear
super<00:07:30.490> quiet<00:07:30.819> and<00:07:31.889> really<00:07:32.889> in<00:07:33.310> this<00:07:34.240> situation

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110 
super quiet and really in this situation

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.189 
super quiet and really in this situation
my<00:07:35.379> CPU<00:07:35.650> fans<00:07:36.250> louder<00:07:36.699> than<00:07:37.089> my<00:07:37.240> cakes<00:07:37.569> fan<00:07:37.870> so

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 
my CPU fans louder than my cakes fan so

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.950 
my CPU fans louder than my cakes fan so
it<00:07:38.319> really<00:07:38.849> doesn't<00:07:39.849> make<00:07:40.360> too<00:07:40.569> much<00:07:40.689> of<00:07:40.750> a

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 
it really doesn't make too much of a

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.519 
it really doesn't make too much of a
difference<00:07:41.110> however<00:07:42.599> kind<00:07:43.599> of<00:07:43.689> do<00:07:43.870> see<00:07:44.199> was

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:44.529 
difference however kind of do see was

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.589 
difference however kind of do see was
used<00:07:44.919> for<00:07:45.159> I<00:07:45.219> would<00:07:45.520> use<00:07:45.699> it<00:07:45.879> as<00:07:45.969> a<00:07:46.060> case<00:07:46.240> fan

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 
used for I would use it as a case fan

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:51.570 
used for I would use it as a case fan
rather<00:07:47.560> than<00:07:48.039> a<00:07:49.139> CPU<00:07:50.139> fan<00:07:50.379> and<00:07:50.710> I<00:07:51.400> would

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:51.580 
rather than a CPU fan and I would

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.920 
rather than a CPU fan and I would
definitely<00:07:52.000> make<00:07:52.180> sure<00:07:52.210> your<00:07:52.539> motherboard

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
definitely make sure your motherboard
