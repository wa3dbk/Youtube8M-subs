read the
so<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.740> catch<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.430> even<00:02:19.730> though<00:02:19.850> it's

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
so the catch is that even though it's

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.960 
so the catch is that even though it's
called<00:02:20.360> Lego<00:02:20.750> Batman<00:02:21.010> games<00:02:22.010> more<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.400> Lego

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
DC Universe so it's not just Batman

you're a Lego fan but this is more the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.240 
you're a Lego fan but this is more the
same<00:02:44.930> stuff<00:02:45.170> you've<00:02:45.320> always<00:02:45.500> liked<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.190> the

same stuff you've always liked so the
only<00:02:46.370> question<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:47.060> are<00:02:47.210> you<00:02:47.750> tired<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.290> yet

or more specifically are you interested

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.980 
or more specifically are you interested
in<00:02:51.320> more<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.040> mean<00:02:52.850> on<00:02:53.120> its<00:02:53.150> own<00:02:53.480> merits

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
in more of it I mean on its own merits

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.020 
in more of it I mean on its own merits
this<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> really<00:02:54.950> good<00:02:55.100> Lego<00:02:55.370> game<00:02:55.670> it's<00:02:55.910> got

this is a really good Lego game it's got

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.670 
this is a really good Lego game it's got
the<00:02:56.209> simple<00:02:56.570> beat<00:02:56.810> em<00:02:56.959> up<00:02:57.080> action<00:02:57.530> you'd

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the simple beat em up action you'd

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.980 
the simple beat em up action you'd
expect<00:02:58.100> with<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.640> presentation<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.630> sound

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
expect with the presentation and sound

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.630 
expect with the presentation and sound
and<00:03:00.260> humor<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.680> destructible<00:03:01.340> Lego

everything<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.930> make<00:03:03.080> these<00:03:03.260> games<00:03:03.470> so

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
everything that make these games so

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.920 
everything that make these games so
mindlessly<00:03:04.280> addictive<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.480> mean<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.840> in

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
mindlessly addictive and I mean that in

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.810 
mindlessly addictive and I mean that in
a<00:03:05.990> good<00:03:06.020> way<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.590> know<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.250> game<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.490> play

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
a good way you know it's a game you play

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.310 
a good way you know it's a game you play
when<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.209> don't<00:03:08.510> want<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.840> think<00:03:09.050> when<00:03:09.260> you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
when you don't want to think when you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.900 
when you don't want to think when you
just<00:03:09.380> want<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.680> break<00:03:09.980> stuff<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.520> have<00:03:10.670> fun

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
just want to break stuff and have fun

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.210 
just want to break stuff and have fun
listen<00:03:11.870> I'm<00:03:11.959> all<00:03:12.140> about<00:03:12.350> breaking<00:03:12.590> stuff<00:03:13.010> and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
listen I'm all about breaking stuff and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.160 
listen I'm all about breaking stuff and
having<00:03:13.340> fun<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:14.030> only<00:03:14.180> drawback<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:14.660> in

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
having fun the only drawback is in

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.080 
having fun the only drawback is in
taking<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.800> approach<00:03:16.010> these<00:03:16.730> games<00:03:16.940> have

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
taking that approach these games have

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.780 
taking that approach these games have
really<00:03:17.360> settled<00:03:17.780> into<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:18.020> groove<00:03:18.110> where

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
really settled into a groove where

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.680 
really settled into a groove where
everything's<00:03:19.790> kind<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.090> indistinguishable

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
everything's kind of indistinguishable

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.840 
everything's kind of indistinguishable
like<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.470> could<00:03:21.620> mix<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.070> match<00:03:22.190> levels<00:03:22.640> from

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
like you could mix and match levels from

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.180 
like you could mix and match levels from
all<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.300> Lego<00:03:23.510> Batman<00:03:23.810> games<00:03:24.260> into<00:03:24.650> one<00:03:24.890> game

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
all the Lego Batman games into one game

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.580 
all the Lego Batman games into one game
and<00:03:25.970> it'd<00:03:26.209> be<00:03:26.390> really<00:03:26.720> hard<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.050> tell<00:03:27.290> which<00:03:27.560> is

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
and it'd be really hard to tell which is

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:41.410 
and it'd be really hard to tell which is
which

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.860 

so<00:03:42.380> honestly<00:03:42.830> not<00:03:43.610> much<00:03:43.670> has<00:03:44.060> changed<00:03:44.090> here<00:03:44.690> at

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
so honestly not much has changed here at

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.020 
so honestly not much has changed here at
all<00:03:45.170> from<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.590> previous<00:03:46.010> game<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:46.580> fact<00:03:46.790> if

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
all from the previous game in fact if

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.330 
all from the previous game in fact if
anything<00:03:47.360> feels<00:03:47.750> different<00:03:48.200> it's<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.920> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
anything feels different it's that the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.190 
anything feels different it's that the
game<00:03:49.520> is<00:03:49.640> more<00:03:49.819> streamlined<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:50.930> Lego

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
game is more streamlined like in Lego

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.350 
game is more streamlined like in Lego
Batman<00:03:51.230> 2<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:52.370> can<00:03:52.520> kind<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.730> explore<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
Batman 2 you can kind of explore the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.059 
Batman 2 you can kind of explore the
city<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.720> go<00:03:54.110> at<00:03:54.230> your<00:03:54.350> own<00:03:54.410> pace

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
city and go at your own pace

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.010 
city and go at your own pace
but<00:03:55.490> in<00:03:55.550> this<00:03:55.670> one<00:03:55.880> it's<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.090> okay<00:03:56.600> now<00:03:56.840> you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
but in this one it's like okay now you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.080 
but in this one it's like okay now you
have<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.380> go<00:03:57.500> here<00:03:57.830> not<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.490> bad<00:03:58.730> thing<00:03:58.940> when

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
have to go here not a bad thing when

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.360 
have to go here not a bad thing when
it's<00:03:59.240> done<00:03:59.420> right<00:03:59.660> but<00:03:59.930> obviously<00:04:00.830> that<00:04:01.040> can

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
it's done right but obviously that can

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.400 
it's done right but obviously that can
feel<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.700> bit<00:04:01.910> limiting<00:04:02.360> sometimes<00:04:02.870> but<00:04:03.290> then

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
feel a bit limiting sometimes but then

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.050 
feel a bit limiting sometimes but then
again<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.680> mean<00:04:03.860> there's<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.280> ton<00:04:04.520> of<00:04:04.550> content

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
again I mean there's a ton of content

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.650 
again I mean there's a ton of content
here<00:04:05.209> too

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
here too
