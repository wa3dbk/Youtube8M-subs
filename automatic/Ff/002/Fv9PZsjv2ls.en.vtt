today we're gonna take a close look at

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.200 
today we're gonna take a close look at
the<00:01:11.189> pedal<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.979> I'm<00:01:13.979> gonna<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:15.090> have

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the pedal and I'm gonna kind of we have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.760 
the pedal and I'm gonna kind of we have
this<00:01:15.329> camera<00:01:15.600> set<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> see

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this camera set up so that you can see

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.789 
this camera set up so that you can see
when<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.070> using<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.670> using<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.799> pretty

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
when I'm using it not using it pretty

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.890 
when I'm using it not using it pretty
much<00:01:20.040> set<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> bunch<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.420> different<00:01:21.750> ways

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
much set it in a bunch of different ways

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.389 
much set it in a bunch of different ways
right<00:01:22.829> now<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.579> have<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> set

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
right now the way that I have it set

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.630 
right now the way that I have it set
since<00:01:26.399> I<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> younger<00:01:27.149> younger<00:01:27.509> guy<00:01:28.640> Cesar

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
since I was a younger younger guy Cesar

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.940 
since I was a younger younger guy Cesar
Diaz<00:01:29.909> told<00:01:30.899> me<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.289> way<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.770> Ray

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
Diaz told me that the way that see Ray

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
Diaz told me that the way that see Ray
Vaughn<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.429> it<00:01:32.579> would<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.030> turn<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
Vaughn would use it would to turn the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.450 
Vaughn would use it would to turn the
level<00:01:34.109> pretty<00:01:34.439> much<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
level pretty much all the way up and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.309 
level pretty much all the way up and
have<00:01:35.819> the<00:01:35.939> drive<00:01:36.359> set<00:01:36.689> low<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.109> that<00:01:37.200> would

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
have the drive set low and that would

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.080 
have the drive set low and that would
pretty<00:01:37.499> much<00:01:37.590> make<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.399> pedal<00:01:38.700> sound<00:01:38.939> its

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
pretty much make the pedal sound its

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.950 
pretty much make the pedal sound its
most<00:01:39.329> natural<00:01:42.469> turning<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.530> drive

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
most natural turning the drive

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:55.000 
most natural turning the drive
level<00:01:45.860> up<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.730> get<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.030> real<00:01:47.240> like<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:54.010> really

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
level up you get that real like I really

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.190 
level up you get that real like I really
dig<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.640> kind<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.330> would<00:01:56.720> imagine

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
dig that it's kind of I would imagine

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.660 
dig that it's kind of I would imagine
like<00:01:57.530> if<00:01:57.620> something<00:01:57.830> like<00:01:57.890> Derek<00:01:58.160> Trucks<00:01:58.340> was

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
like if something like Derek Trucks was

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.030 
like if something like Derek Trucks was
to<00:01:58.880> use<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.060> pedal<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.630> probably<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.830> best

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
to use a pedal that probably it the best

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.750 
to use a pedal that probably it the best
way<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.400> him<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.550> go<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.680> you're<00:02:04.430> gonna<00:02:04.550> get

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
way for him to go so you're gonna get

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.190 
way for him to go so you're gonna get
more<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.230> a<00:02:06.310> clean<00:02:07.310> boost<00:02:07.580> with<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.600> mid<00:02:08.869> hump

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
more of a clean boost with a mid hump

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.320 
more of a clean boost with a mid hump
the<00:02:09.380> way<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:09.800> set<00:02:09.979> now<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.940> therefore

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
the way that it's set now so therefore

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.050 
the way that it's set now so therefore
when<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.570> go<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.680> solo<00:02:13.430> or<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.700> need<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.880> do

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
when you go to solo or you need to do

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.310 
when you go to solo or you need to do
like<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.270> jab<00:02:14.630> kind<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.960> think<00:02:15.110> if<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.200> were

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
like a jab kind of think if you were

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:26.860 
like a jab kind of think if you were
like<00:02:15.470> calm<00:02:25.090> really<00:02:26.090> punch<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.570> through<00:02:26.750> the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
like calm really punch you through the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.010 
like calm really punch you through the
mix<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.260> way<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.410> want<00:02:28.630> humbucker<00:02:29.630> guitars

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
mix the way you want humbucker guitars

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.510 
mix the way you want humbucker guitars
have<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.260> set<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.680> way<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.250> driver

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
have you set it this way with the driver

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.670 
have you set it this way with the driver
low<00:02:31.880> level<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:33.080> gonna<00:02:33.230> make<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> guitar

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
low level up it's gonna make the guitar

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.740 
low level up it's gonna make the guitar
sing<00:02:34.190> more<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.580> gonna<00:02:34.670> give<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
sing more it's gonna give you the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.810 
sing more it's gonna give you the
compression<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> circuits<00:02:36.950> famous<00:02:37.580> for

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
compression that the circuits famous for

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.720 
compression that the circuits famous for
TS<00:02:38.570> 9s<00:02:38.990> have<00:02:39.560> compression<00:02:40.040> that's<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.580> what

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
TS 9s have compression that's just what

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.370 
TS 9s have compression that's just what
they<00:02:40.880> do<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.360> when<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.510> hear<00:02:41.720> compression<00:02:42.260> at

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
they do so when you hear compression at

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.670 
they do so when you hear compression at
home<00:02:42.530> folks<00:02:42.770> that's<00:02:43.580> what<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.910> pedal<00:02:44.209> does

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
home folks that's what that pedal does

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.660 
home folks that's what that pedal does
you<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.980> more<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.370> turn<00:02:46.550> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
you know the more that you turn the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.430 
you know the more that you turn the
drive<00:02:46.910> up<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.330> more<00:02:47.480> compression<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.170> so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
drive up the more compression to so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.860 
drive up the more compression to so
pretty<00:02:49.160> much<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.239> how<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:50.600> pedal

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
pretty much this is how this pedal

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:18.870 
pretty much this is how this pedal
sounds

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.740 

so<00:03:19.880> now<00:03:19.970> we're<00:03:20.060> gonna<00:03:20.180> take<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.569> we're<00:03:20.660> gonna

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
so now we're gonna take it we're gonna

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.750 
so now we're gonna take it we're gonna
crank<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.140> level<00:03:21.410> up<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.800> mean<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.250> drive<00:03:22.520> I'm

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
crank the level up I mean the drive I'm

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.340 
crank the level up I mean the drive I'm
sorry<00:03:23.030> we're<00:03:23.540> gonna<00:03:23.600> get<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:23.959> thing<00:03:24.230> we'll

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
sorry we're gonna get this thing we'll

sorry we're gonna get this thing we'll
have<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.680> pull<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:24.980> level<00:03:25.280> back<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.610> says<00:03:25.730> you

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
have to pull the level back it says you

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.130 
have to pull the level back it says you
turn<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> drive<00:03:26.300> up<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.630> pedals<00:03:26.870> gonna<00:03:27.020> get

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
turn the drive up the pedals gonna get

a<00:03:51.970> little<00:03:52.390> bit<00:03:52.480> more<00:03:52.600> level

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.380

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.210 
now let's see completely what we can do
with<00:04:10.540> this<00:04:10.660> we're<00:04:10.870> gonna<00:04:10.930> crank<00:04:11.650> this<00:04:11.920> drive

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220

up<00:04:12.520> and<00:04:12.940> yes<00:04:13.150> it's<00:04:13.390> going<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.690> hiss<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.200> it's

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
up and yes it's going to hiss and it's

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.630

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:51.050 
and I think you can do all kinds of
stuff<00:04:20.080> with<00:04:20.110> this

crack<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.520> level<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.000> max<00:04:55.270> out<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.720> gain

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669
