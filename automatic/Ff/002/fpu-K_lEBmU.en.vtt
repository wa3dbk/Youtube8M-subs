brand<00:00:28.580> new<00:00:28.730> color<00:00:29.180> set<00:00:29.510> today<00:00:29.720> we're

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
brand new color set today we're

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.650 
brand new color set today we're
launching<00:00:30.620> the<00:00:30.740> nebula<00:00:31.340> pearls<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.090> with<00:00:32.480> the

launching the nebula pearls so with the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.690 
launching the nebula pearls so with the
nebula<00:00:33.110> pearls<00:00:33.410> you've<00:00:33.530> got<00:00:33.710> five<00:00:34.100> nebula

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
nebula pearls you've got five nebula

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.330 
colors nebula red blue purple green and
yellow<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.050> yes<00:00:39.320> these<00:00:39.500> are<00:00:39.560> definitely

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
yellow and yes these are definitely

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.710 
yellow and yes these are definitely
different<00:00:40.730> than<00:00:40.820> any<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.240> other<00:00:41.360> pearls

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
different than any of the other pearls

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.260 
different than any of the other pearls
that<00:00:42.110> are<00:00:42.230> out<00:00:42.380> there<00:00:42.590> or<00:00:42.770> that<00:00:42.800> we<00:00:43.070> offer<00:00:43.280> what

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
that are out there or that we offer what

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.090 
that are out there or that we offer what
makes<00:00:44.510> them<00:00:44.750> different<00:00:44.930> is<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.620> instead<00:00:45.980> of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
makes them different is that instead of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.490 
makes them different is that instead of
changing<00:00:46.430> colors<00:00:47.030> like<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.540> chameleon<00:00:48.079> pearl

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
changing colors like a chameleon pearl

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.360 
changing colors like a chameleon pearl
will<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:48.920> actually<00:00:49.430> generates<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.210> very<00:00:50.690> deep

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
will it actually generates a very deep

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370 
will it actually generates a very deep
contrast<00:00:52.370> between<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.150> dark<00:00:53.180> parts<00:00:53.989> your<00:00:54.140> car

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
contrast between the dark parts your car

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.350 
contrast between the dark parts your car
and<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.010> light<00:00:55.250> parts<00:00:55.610> of<00:00:55.670> your<00:00:55.790> car<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.120> for

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
and the light parts of your car so for

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.030 
and the light parts of your car so for
example<00:00:56.810> we're<00:00:57.050> going<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.230> do<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.590> dip<00:00:57.829> your

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
example we're going to do the dip your

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.210 
example we're going to do the dip your
car<00:00:58.280> s8<00:00:58.790> today<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.270> nebula<00:01:00.170> red<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.710> what

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
car s8 today and nebula red and what

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.010 
car s8 today and nebula red and what
would<00:01:01.340> be<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.460> perfect<00:01:02.000> base<00:01:02.180> coat<00:01:02.450> for<00:01:02.600> nebula

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
would be a perfect base coat for nebula

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.749 
would be a perfect base coat for nebula
red<00:01:03.200> which<00:01:03.470> is<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.620> deep<00:01:03.980> deep<00:01:04.189> dark<00:01:04.549> red

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
red which is a deep deep dark red

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.880 
red which is a deep deep dark red
obviously<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.750> black<00:01:05.990> cherry<00:01:06.380> from<00:01:06.590> Plassey

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
obviously the black cherry from Plassey

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.219 
obviously the black cherry from Plassey
so<00:01:07.369> it's<00:01:07.729> already<00:01:08.119> got<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:08.479> storm<00:01:08.780> cloud<00:01:08.990> gray

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
so it's already got the storm cloud gray

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.809 
so it's already got the storm cloud gray
metallic<00:01:09.560> on<00:01:09.829> it<00:01:09.920> right<00:01:10.100> now<00:01:10.249> we're<00:01:10.670> going<00:01:10.759> to

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
metallic on it right now we're going to

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.279 
metallic on it right now we're going to
do<00:01:10.939> two<00:01:11.210> or<00:01:11.299> three<00:01:11.329> coats<00:01:11.719> of<00:01:11.929> the<00:01:12.049> black

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
do two or three coats of the black

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.289 
do two or three coats of the black
cherry<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.859> then<00:01:13.249> we're<00:01:13.369> going<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.520> do<00:01:13.700> three

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
cherry and then we're going to do three

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.989 
cherry and then we're going to do three
to<00:01:14.420> four<00:01:14.630> coats<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:15.109> the<00:01:15.710> nebula<00:01:16.159> red<00:01:16.490> right

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
to four coats of the nebula red right

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.029 
to four coats of the nebula red right
over<00:01:17.270> on<00:01:17.389> top<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:17.899> it<00:01:18.109> has<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.259> very<00:01:18.380> strong

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
over on top of that it has a very strong

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.039 
over on top of that it has a very strong
coverage<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:19.670> we'll<00:01:20.119> see<00:01:20.299> how<00:01:20.450> many<00:01:20.509> coats<00:01:20.840> we

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
coverage so we'll see how many coats we

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.419 
coverage so we'll see how many coats we
need<00:01:21.259> now<00:01:21.709> there's<00:01:21.889> a<00:01:21.950> little<00:01:22.189> bit<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.310> a

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
need now there's a little bit of a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.010 
need now there's a little bit of a
different<00:01:22.759> application<00:01:23.329> process<00:01:23.749> that<00:01:23.780> we

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
different application process that we

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.529 
different application process that we
use<00:01:24.289> with<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.770> nebula<00:01:25.249> colors<00:01:25.639> you're<00:01:26.450> going

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
use with the nebula colors you're going

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.419 
use with the nebula colors you're going
to<00:01:26.630> get<00:01:26.749> the<00:01:26.899> best<00:01:27.259> results<00:01:27.829> with<00:01:27.859> the<00:01:28.039> nebula

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
to get the best results with the nebula

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.779 
to get the best results with the nebula
