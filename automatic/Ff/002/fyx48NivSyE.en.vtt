00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
beer either by mashing in at about 149

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.749 
beer either by mashing in at about 149
to<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.479> 151<00:01:46.380> degrees<00:01:46.610> anywhere<00:01:47.610> around

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that temperature will give you a fairly

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.940 
that temperature will give you a fairly
dry<00:01:49.439> beer<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.070> 150<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:51.119> my<00:01:51.420> goal<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.829> did

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
dry beer so 150 was my goal so I did

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.940 
dry beer so 150 was my goal so I did
enough<00:01:53.159> water<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.700> cover<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:55.079> grain<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> was

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
enough water to cover my grain so it was

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
enough water to cover my grain so it was
a<00:01:55.979> fairly<00:01:57.140> medium<00:01:58.140> medium<00:01:58.560> thick<00:01:58.950> mash<00:01:59.810> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
a fairly medium medium thick mash and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.080 
a fairly medium medium thick mash and
the<00:02:01.649> nice<00:02:01.829> thing<00:02:02.040> about<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.460> beer<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the nice thing about a beer like this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.240 
the nice thing about a beer like this
it's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.570> simple<00:02:04.020> infusion<00:02:04.500> mash<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.920> just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's a simple infusion mash so you just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.029 
it's a simple infusion mash so you just
set<00:02:05.969> your<00:02:06.149> temperature<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.740> let<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
set your temperature and you just let it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.690 
set your temperature and you just let it
rest<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:09.500> after<00:02:10.500> about<00:02:10.679> 15<00:02:11.220> minutes<00:02:11.250> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
rest now after about 15 minutes of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.110 
rest now after about 15 minutes of
resting<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.120> want<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> check<00:02:12.540> my

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
resting I want to check my

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.540 
resting I want to check my
and<00:02:13.599> then<00:02:13.840> after<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.620> just<00:02:14.980> got<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> make

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and then after that I just got to make

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.979 
and then after that I just got to make
sure<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.819> my<00:02:16.030> temperature<00:02:16.390> stays<00:02:16.750> right

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
sure that my temperature stays right

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.860 
sure that my temperature stays right
around<00:02:17.200> 149<00:02:18.040> degrees<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.760> that's<00:02:19.720> pretty

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
around 149 degrees and that's pretty

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.140 
around 149 degrees and that's pretty
much<00:02:19.989> where<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.260> stayed<00:02:20.760> throughout<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.940> mash

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
much where I stayed throughout the mash

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.809 
much where I stayed throughout the mash
so<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.690> missed<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.019> for<00:02:23.200> about<00:02:23.290> 90<00:02:24.220> minutes<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
so I missed this for about 90 minutes to

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.430 
so I missed this for about 90 minutes to
make<00:02:24.970> sure<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.300> got<00:02:25.480> full<00:02:25.780> starsha<00:02:26.260> sure

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
make sure that I got full starsha sure

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.530 
make sure that I got full starsha sure
conversing<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.340> then<00:02:27.430> at<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.730> point<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.239> went

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
conversing and then at that point I went

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.479 
conversing and then at that point I went
ahead<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.840> mashed<00:02:29.500> out<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.190> reversed<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
ahead and mashed out so I reversed the

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.839 
ahead and mashed out so I reversed the
temperature<00:02:30.940> up<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.150> about<00:02:31.360> 170<00:02:32.319> degrees<00:02:32.849> then

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
temperature up to about 170 degrees then

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.780 
temperature up to about 170 degrees then
I<00:02:33.879> just<00:02:34.769> recirculated<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.040> started

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
I just recirculated so I started

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.490 
I just recirculated so I started
draining<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.239> ward<00:02:37.480> anything<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.230> came<00:02:38.379> up

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
draining the ward anything that came up

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380 
draining the ward anything that came up
cloudy<00:02:38.799> went<00:02:39.220> back<00:02:39.430> into<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.819> mash<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.060> then

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
cloudy went back into the mash and then

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.360 
cloudy went back into the mash and then
as<00:02:40.540> soon<00:02:40.690> as<00:02:40.810> my<00:02:41.049> works<00:02:41.470> are<00:02:41.590> coming<00:02:41.890> out<00:02:42.040> clear

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
as soon as my works are coming out clear

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.880 
as soon as my works are coming out clear
then<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.239> started<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.690> collect<00:02:44.049> all<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.739> those

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
then I started to collect all of those

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.640 
then I started to collect all of those
runnings<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.599> out<00:02:46.690> on<00:02:46.810> our<00:02:46.840> half<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.380> during

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
runnings to be out on our half to during

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.039 
runnings to be out on our half to during
the<00:02:47.769> mash<00:02:47.950> tun<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.459> fly<00:02:49.000> sparks<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:49.780> this

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
the mash tun and I fly sparks for this

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.500 
the mash tun and I fly sparks for this
one<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.440> added<00:02:50.739> water<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.940> was<00:02:52.120> straining

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
one so I added water as I was straining

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.080 
one so I added water as I was straining
the<00:02:52.630> work<00:02:52.840> at<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.739> point<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.069> start<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.430> bring

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the work at that point I start to bring

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.390 
the work at that point I start to bring
this<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> boil<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.829> just<00:02:57.069> want<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.250> show

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
this to a boil so you just want to show

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.619 
this to a boil so you just want to show
what<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.610> boil<00:02:57.970> over

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
what a boil over

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.750 
what a boil over
looks<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.799> foam<00:03:00.010> starts<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.400> build<00:03:00.549> up

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
looks like the foam starts to build up

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.360 
looks like the foam starts to build up
and<00:03:01.090> if<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.870> don't<00:03:02.049> stop<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.440> it'll<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.190> keep

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and if you don't stop it it'll just keep

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.479 
and if you don't stop it it'll just keep
going<00:03:03.760> until<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.329> pretty<00:03:04.780> much<00:03:04.870> spills<00:03:05.230> over

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
going until it pretty much spills over

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.309 
going until it pretty much spills over
you<00:03:06.489> know<00:03:06.549> there<00:03:07.360> were<00:03:07.480> two<00:03:07.569> controllers<00:03:07.870> the

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
you know there were two controllers the

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.990 
you know there were two controllers the
easiest<00:03:08.709> ways<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.310> turn<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.760> heat<00:03:09.970> down

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
easiest ways to just turn the heat down

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.020 
easiest ways to just turn the heat down
and<00:03:10.739> basically<00:03:11.739> open<00:03:12.340> up<00:03:12.459> some<00:03:12.700> sort<00:03:12.970> of

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and basically open up some sort of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.869 
and basically open up some sort of
airspace<00:03:13.569> so<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.110> your<00:03:14.860> ward<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.489> able<00:03:15.760> to

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
airspace so that your ward is able to

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.170 
airspace so that your ward is able to
breathe<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.709> build<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.400> about<00:03:21.489> sixty

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
breathe so I build this for about sixty

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.509 
breathe so I build this for about sixty
minutes<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.590> did<00:03:23.739> my<00:03:23.889> first<00:03:24.130> set<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.310> hop

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
minutes and I did my first set of hop

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.490 
minutes and I did my first set of hop
additions<00:03:25.000> thirty<00:03:25.480> minutes<00:03:25.810> into<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.290> boil

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
additions thirty minutes into the boil

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.660 
additions thirty minutes into the boil
so<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.829> headed<00:03:27.630> point<00:03:28.630> 75<00:03:29.049> ounces<00:03:29.349> of<00:03:29.799> all<00:03:30.010> of

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
so I headed point 75 ounces of all of

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.629 
so I headed point 75 ounces of all of
all<00:03:30.910> my<00:03:31.090> hops<00:03:31.359> so<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.810> Amarillo<00:03:32.349> and<00:03:32.859> Cascade

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
all my hops so the Amarillo and Cascade

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.900 
all my hops so the Amarillo and Cascade
hops<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:35.440> when<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.680> had<00:03:35.950> about<00:03:36.430> 50

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
hops and then when I had about 50

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.830 
hops and then when I had about 50
minutes<00:03:37.180> left<00:03:37.329> in<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.510> boil

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
minutes left in the boil

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.309 
minutes left in the boil
I<00:03:37.959> added<00:03:38.349> my<00:03:38.980> aroma<00:03:39.459> hops<00:03:39.549> so<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:39.910> added<00:03:40.420> about<00:03:40.780> a

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
I added my aroma hops so I added about a

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.379 
I added my aroma hops so I added about a
quarter<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.919> an<00:03:42.040> ounce<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.400> all<00:03:42.730> my<00:03:42.880> hops<00:03:43.090> again

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
quarter of an ounce of all my hops again

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.110 
quarter of an ounce of all my hops again
so<00:03:43.569> I'm<00:03:43.720> RELIGIOUS<00:03:44.169> and<00:03:44.530> Cascade<00:03:45.099> hops<00:03:45.250> just

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
so I'm RELIGIOUS and Cascade hops just

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.409 
so I'm RELIGIOUS and Cascade hops just
give<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.419> stir<00:03:46.630> finished<00:03:47.139> the<00:03:47.319> boil<00:03:48.010> and

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
give it a stir finished the boil and

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.240 
give it a stir finished the boil and
went<00:03:49.419> ahead<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.900> cooled<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.590> wort<00:03:50.769> down<00:03:50.950> to

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
went ahead and cooled the wort down to

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.210 
went ahead and cooled the wort down to
70<00:03:51.669> degrees<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.260> then<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.440> just<00:03:53.889> went<00:03:54.099> ahead

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
70 degrees and then I just went ahead

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.909 
70 degrees and then I just went ahead
and<00:03:54.840> transferred<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.959> beer<00:03:56.139> to<00:03:56.349> my<00:03:56.500> fermenter

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
and transferred the beer to my fermenter

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.449

carboy a little too high and didn't give
it<00:04:10.030> enough<00:04:10.180> headspace<00:04:11.169> so<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.910> started<00:04:13.269> to

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
it enough headspace so it started to

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.599 
it enough headspace so it started to
over<00:04:13.810> foam<00:04:14.049> but<00:04:14.349> that's<00:04:14.799> alright<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.250> just

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
over foam but that's alright I just

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.610 
over foam but that's alright I just
ditched<00:04:15.819> the<00:04:16.060> airlock<00:04:16.750> for<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:17.200> first<00:04:17.440> couple

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
ditched the airlock for the first couple

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.770

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
putting the airlock back on

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.659 
putting the airlock back on
I<00:04:22.419> either<00:04:22.960> skim<00:04:23.409> off<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.590> foam<00:04:24.159> a<00:04:24.219> little<00:04:24.550> bit

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.290 
I either skim off the foam a little bit
or<00:04:24.849> I'll<00:04:25.030> just<00:04:25.240> set<00:04:25.510> up<00:04:25.659> a<00:04:25.810> blow

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.869 
or I'll just set up a blow
off<00:04:26.389> tube<00:04:26.720> either<00:04:27.560> way<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:28.039> should<00:04:28.190> be<00:04:28.280> fine<00:04:28.490> so

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
off tube either way it should be fine so

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.159 
off tube either way it should be fine so
that's<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.150> I'll<00:04:29.419> let<00:04:29.659> you<00:04:29.720> guys<00:04:29.960> know<00:04:30.139> how
