this to more than its current digit then

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.820 
this to more than its current digit then
it<00:02:36.790> again<00:02:37.300> messes<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.170> restarts<00:02:38.710> your

amount of money I have right here
so<00:02:44.320> let's<00:02:44.650> write<00:02:44.950> after<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.310> quotation<00:02:45.730> of

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
so let's write after the quotation of

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.640 
so let's write after the quotation of
data<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.910> just<00:02:48.910> changed<00:02:49.420> everything<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.500> just

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
data I just changed everything to just

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.699 
data I just changed everything to just
nine<00:02:51.010> nine<00:02:51.280> nine<00:02:51.310> nine<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:53.470> leave

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
nine nine nine nine and then leave

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.550 
nine nine nine nine and then leave
whatever<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.670> still<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.030> nine<00:02:55.300> so<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:56.140> still

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
whatever is still a nine so it's still

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
whatever is still a nine so it's still
the<00:02:56.680> same<00:02:58.530> there's<00:02:59.530> still<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.980> same<00:03:00.220> amount

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
the same there's still the same amount

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.430 
the same there's still the same amount
of<00:03:00.730> numbers<00:03:01.270> here

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
of numbers here

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.699 
of numbers here
it's<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.760> changed<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.780> numbers<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.410> a

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
it's just that changed the numbers to a

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.460 
it's just that changed the numbers to a
different<00:03:06.130> number<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.510> didn't<00:03:07.959> increase

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
different number so I didn't increase

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.220 
different number so I didn't increase
the<00:03:08.680> amount<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.370> numbers<00:03:10.180> which<00:03:10.900> also

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
the amount of numbers which also

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.990 
the amount of numbers which also
reflects<00:03:11.860> again<00:03:12.130> like<00:03:12.340> if<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:12.610> do

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
reflects again like if you do

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.330 
reflects again like if you do
right<00:03:13.570> click<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.050> insert<00:03:14.320> some<00:03:14.380> numbers<00:03:14.950> yeah

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
right click and insert some numbers yeah

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.310 
right click and insert some numbers yeah
it<00:03:15.580> resets<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.210> game<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> don't<00:03:17.050> know<00:03:17.110> why<00:03:17.290> I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
it resets the game to I don't know why I

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.940 
it resets the game to I don't know why I
just<00:03:17.590> doesn't<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.570> way<00:03:19.720> I've<00:03:19.950> managed

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
just doesn't and so the way I've managed

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.110 
just doesn't and so the way I've managed
to<00:03:21.040> work<00:03:21.340> around<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:23.130> was<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.340> just<00:03:24.430> do

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
to work around that was that I just do

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.730 
to work around that was that I just do
what<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.420> do<00:03:25.510> right<00:03:25.840> here<00:03:25.990> I<00:03:26.020> just<00:03:26.140> changed<00:03:26.680> my

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
what I do right here I just changed my

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.020 
what I do right here I just changed my
numbers<00:03:27.460> to<00:03:27.610> nine<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:30.010> save<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:30.790> and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
numbers to nine and then I save it and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.700 
numbers to nine and then I save it and
then<00:03:32.070> what<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.190> do<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:34.360> then<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.690> drag<00:03:35.530> and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
then what you do is then you drag and

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.340 
then what you do is then you drag and
drop<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.070> back<00:03:36.220> onto<00:03:36.520> your<00:03:36.640> USB<00:03:37.030> stick<00:03:37.260> put<00:03:38.260> it

have a little bit more money now if you

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.620

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.450 
want more money what you're going to do
is<00:03:46.750> you're<00:03:46.930> gonna<00:03:47.080> have<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.290> go<00:03:47.440> into<00:03:47.860> a<00:03:48.100> race

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
get some more money by doing a race so

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.920 
get some more money by doing a race so
it<00:03:50.920> increases<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.520> amount<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.270> digits<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
it increases the amount of digits in the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.280 
it increases the amount of digits in the
number<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:54.100> then<00:03:54.280> once<00:03:55.210> that's<00:03:55.390> done<00:03:55.570> you<00:03:55.900> save

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
number so then once that's done you save

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.070 
number so then once that's done you save
it<00:03:56.500> again<00:03:56.670> go<00:03:57.670> put<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.510> your<00:03:58.660> USB<00:03:58.900> stick

again<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.860> then<00:04:00.300> repeat<00:04:01.300> this<00:04:01.450> process<00:04:01.560> put

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
again and then repeat this process put

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.630 
again and then repeat this process put
it<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:02.890> comm<00:04:04.170> hex<00:04:05.170> editor<00:04:05.620> change<00:04:06.430> the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
it in the comm hex editor change the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.700 
it in the comm hex editor change the
numbers<00:04:06.970> into<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.210> nine<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.870> keep<00:04:08.290> doing<00:04:08.590> that

numbers into a nine and keep doing that

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.420 
numbers into a nine and keep doing that
and<00:04:09.750> eventually<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:11.350> will<00:04:11.560> get<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:12.070> lot<00:04:12.340> of

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
and eventually you will get a lot of

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.240 
and eventually you will get a lot of
money<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:13.350> there's<00:04:14.350> probably<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.220> a

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
money and there's probably is a

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.430 
money and there's probably is a
different<00:04:15.700> way<00:04:15.910> around<00:04:16.269> this<00:04:16.510> but<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:17.200> mean

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
different way around this but I mean

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.770 
different way around this but I mean
this<00:04:17.650> is<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.430> way<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:18.850> figured<00:04:19.299> I'd<00:04:19.419> do<00:04:19.660> it

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
this is the way that I figured I'd do it

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.690 
this is the way that I figured I'd do it
and<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.080> works<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:22.560> yeah<00:04:23.560> knock<00:04:24.100> yourself<00:04:24.130> out

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
and it works so yeah knock yourself out

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.890 
and it works so yeah knock yourself out
and<00:04:24.880> if<00:04:25.360> anyone<00:04:26.400> hates<00:04:27.400> me<00:04:27.669> for<00:04:27.970> putting<00:04:28.810> up

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
and if anyone hates me for putting up

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.360 
and if anyone hates me for putting up
