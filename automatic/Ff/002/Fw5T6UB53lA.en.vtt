going to need is a pickaxe shovel

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.040 
going to need is a pickaxe shovel
preferably<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.619> redstone<00:00:29.720> or<00:00:30.720> whatever

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
preferably some redstone or whatever

preferably some redstone or whatever
block<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.650> want<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> slide<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.399> you're

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
block you want to slide if you're

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.810 
block you want to slide if you're
choosing<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.450> pressure<00:00:33.809> plates<00:00:34.820> sticky

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
choosing for pressure plates sticky

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.950 
choosing for pressure plates sticky
pistons<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.719> some<00:00:37.020> torches<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.840> what<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
pistons and some torches so what you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.350 
pistons and some torches so what you
want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> two<00:00:42.210> by

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
want to do is you want to it's a two by

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.200 
want to do is you want to it's a two by
two<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.230> house<00:00:43.440> needs<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.250> an<00:00:44.460> even

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
two so your house needs to be an even

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840 
two so your house needs to be an even
number<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.629> block<00:00:46.289> length<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:47.280> house<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.730> an

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
number of block length my house is an

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
number of block length my house is an
odd<00:00:47.969> number<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.510> block<00:00:48.809> length<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.770> makes

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
odd number of block length so that makes

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.110 
odd number of block length so that makes
it<00:00:50.340> difficult<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:52.680> make<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> look<00:00:53.160> good<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.000> if

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it difficult to make it look good so if

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.939 
it difficult to make it look good so if
it's<00:00:54.239> even<00:00:54.570> number<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> looks<00:00:55.140> better<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.800> can

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it's even number it looks better you can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
it's even number it looks better you can
also<00:00:56.129> use<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.640> same<00:00:56.850> strategy<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
also use the same strategy to make a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.560 
also use the same strategy to make a
single<00:00:58.350> piston<00:00:58.890> door<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.969> pretty<00:01:00.300> easy

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
single piston door that's pretty easy

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.349 
single piston door that's pretty easy
you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.530> use<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> same<00:01:02.070> kind<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.969> technique

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
you can use the same kind of technique

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
you can use the same kind of technique
i'm<00:01:03.600> about<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> show<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> let<00:01:04.860> me<00:01:04.949> give<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
i'm about to show you let me give you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.660 
i'm about to show you let me give you
all<00:01:05.280> some<00:01:05.460> modding<00:01:06.030> uh<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.369> make<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
all some modding uh so you can make it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.870 
all some modding uh so you can make it
out<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.000> single<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.439> I

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
out of a single if you really want to I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.870 
out of a single if you really want to I
think<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.240> mind<00:01:12.630> down<00:01:12.900> below<00:01:13.640> far<00:01:14.640> enough

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
think if I mind down below far enough

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
think if I mind down below far enough
which<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.360> need<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> mine<00:01:15.810> two<00:01:16.049> blocks<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.799> going

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
which I need a mine two blocks I'm going

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.120 
which I need a mine two blocks I'm going
to<00:01:17.070> hit<00:01:17.250> some<00:01:17.640> rooms<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> stuff<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> don't

cuz I don't really have a definite
length<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.880> how<00:01:36.030> long<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.900> need<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.470> need

Pistons<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.950> supposed<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.180> just

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
Pistons are supposed to be so I'm just

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.399 
Pistons are supposed to be so I'm just
going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> lay<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.170> give<00:01:46.290> me<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
going to lay that out to give me a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.830 
going to lay that out to give me a
marker<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.890> where<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.270> so

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
marker of where it's going to be at so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
marker of where it's going to be at so
that's<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> pressure<00:01:49.920> plates<00:01:50.280> also

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that's what the pressure plates also

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.429 
that's what the pressure plates also
when<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.630> these<00:01:51.750> pressure<00:01:52.079> plates

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
when you have these pressure plates

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.969 
when you have these pressure plates
remember<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:56.299> animals<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.979> baddies

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
remember that animals and and baddies

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.450 
remember that animals and and baddies
and<00:01:59.009> stuff<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> come<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.689> careful

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
and stuff can I come in so be careful

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.889 
and stuff can I come in so be careful
with<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.149> some<00:02:03.299> chasing<00:02:03.750> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
with that if you have some chasing you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.929 
with that if you have some chasing you
on<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.799> side<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.219> could<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> lever

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
on that side you could like a lever

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
on that side you could like a lever
instead<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.020> outside<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
instead if that's the outside and on the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.400 
instead if that's the outside and on the
inside<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.459> could<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.729> your<00:02:09.140> stuff<00:02:10.140> but

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
inside you could have your stuff but

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.110 
inside you could have your stuff but
anyways<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.979> into<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
anyways just get into it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.140 
anyways just get into it
we're<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.930> we're<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> put<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.519> Pistons

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
we're not we're going to put the Pistons

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.800 
we're not we're going to put the Pistons
two<00:02:15.840> blocks<00:02:16.140> away<00:02:16.349> from<00:02:16.530> our<00:02:17.220> doors<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
two blocks away from our doors so the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.600 
two blocks away from our doors so the
two<00:02:18.959> by<00:02:19.080> two<00:02:19.230> doors<00:02:19.500> will<00:02:19.680> be<00:02:19.709> right<00:02:19.890> there<00:02:19.920> so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
two by two doors will be right there so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.509 
two by two doors will be right there so
one<00:02:21.450> block<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:22.080> block<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:23.099> then<00:02:23.400> their

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
one block to block and then their

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.460 
one block to block and then their
Pistons<00:02:23.819> can<00:02:23.940> go<00:02:24.090> here<00:02:24.299> we<00:02:24.690> want<00:02:24.870> them<00:02:24.989> facing

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
Pistons can go here we want them facing

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
we're going to put a redstone down so

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.380 
we're going to put a redstone down so
where<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.489> pressure<00:02:59.670> plates<00:03:00.000> are<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.269> going

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
where the pressure plates are you going

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.210 
where the pressure plates are you going
to<00:03:00.450> mine<00:03:00.930> underneath<00:03:01.349> them<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.709> put<00:03:02.040> redstone

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
to mine underneath them and put redstone

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.509 
to mine underneath them and put redstone
and<00:03:02.579> eat<00:03:02.730> them<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:04.230> let's<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.190> over<00:03:05.459> here

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.789 

so<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.079> we<00:03:10.170> want<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.379> mount<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.560> straight

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
so and then we want to mount a straight

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.160 
so and then we want to mount a straight
line<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.790> where<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.209> right<00:03:12.569> underneath<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
line to where it's right underneath the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.229 
line to where it's right underneath the
piston<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.159> underneath<00:03:14.430> pissing<00:03:14.879> you<00:03:15.030> put

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
piston so underneath pissing you put

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.020 
piston so underneath pissing you put
block<00:03:15.510> ok<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.739> underneath<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.370> piston<00:03:17.819> and

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
block ok so underneath the piston and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.420 
block ok so underneath the piston and
that's<00:03:18.269> with<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.480> redstone<00:03:18.840> stops<00:03:19.109> now<00:03:20.010> put<00:03:20.400> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's with the redstone stops now put a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.159 
that's with the redstone stops now put a
block<00:03:20.730> at<00:03:20.970> each<00:03:21.180> end<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.440> move<00:03:23.400> chicken

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
block at each end like so move chicken

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.539 
block at each end like so move chicken
all<00:03:25.169> right<00:03:25.319> I'm<00:03:25.650> gonna<00:03:25.919> climb<00:03:26.099> out<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.370> here

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
all right I'm gonna climb out of here

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.059 
all right I'm gonna climb out of here
first<00:03:26.760> before<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.329> do<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:27.889> someone<00:03:28.889> need<00:03:29.010> to

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
first before I do that someone need to

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.360 
first before I do that someone need to
get<00:03:29.160> up<00:03:29.280> okay<00:03:29.940> block<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.480> each<00:03:30.599> end<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.370> now

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
get up okay block on each end and now

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.520 
get up okay block on each end and now
when<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.060> press<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.450> power<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.079> gives<00:03:34.200> power

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
when you press this power it gives power

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.440 
when you press this power it gives power
to<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.799> redstone<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.910> powers<00:03:36.269> that

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
to the redstone and that powers that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.750 
to the redstone and that powers that
block<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.290> when<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.280> block<00:03:38.579> is

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
block so when I do that that block is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.569 
block so when I do that that block is
powered<00:03:39.530> now<00:03:40.530> we're<00:03:40.650> going<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.799> put<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:41.220> torch

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
powered now we're going to put a torch

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.330 
powered now we're going to put a torch
on<00:03:41.819> top<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.239> block<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.900> then<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.709> block<00:03:44.099> on

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
on top of this block and then a block on

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.199 
on top of this block and then a block on
top<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.239> Tories<00:03:46.160> okay<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.849> let's<00:03:48.000> get<00:03:48.090> in

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
top of the Tories okay so let's get in

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.240 
top of the Tories okay so let's get in
here<00:03:48.359> look<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.139> we<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.709> redstone<00:03:50.099> to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
here look at it so we have redstone to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.670 
here look at it so we have redstone to
this<00:03:50.340> blog<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.090> blogs<00:03:51.359> are<00:03:51.540> torch<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.169> a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
this blog and the blogs are torch and a
