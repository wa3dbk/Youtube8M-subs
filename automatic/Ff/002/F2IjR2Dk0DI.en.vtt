00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.219
 during the month of this year we are all 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.969
 repeatedly heard in the news as 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.279
 officials are trying to put pressure on 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.989
 oil refineries to 

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:17.939
 keep fuel prices up 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.429
 with every sharp rise in retail 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.210
 gasoline antitrust prices 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.050
 take place in oil companies give 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.159
 explanations about the rise in prices 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.339
 every time not hit 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.439
 the main reason for the rising cost of raw materials with 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.759
 which is produced by this 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.509
 evil 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.660
 since may brent oil ownership 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.699
 municipality $ 90 per barrel 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.920
 fatigue 8 percent increase 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.120
 why kept occupying first 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.489
 petrol production is more expensive and 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.120
 somewhere far behind her 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 black gold is becoming more expensive 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 even processing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.460
 factories don't have to buy Germans 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.520
 abroad at high prices 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.960
 transport her tankers across the ocean 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.040
 the fact is that the high cost of oil and 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.540
 petroleum products overseas stock price 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.660
 if preferred than 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.440
 filing inland 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.540
 the higher the price of oil the more 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.760
 plagiarism 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.430
 thus creating a shortage of this country 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.620
 while there is to play like inside the country 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.280
 gasoline will go up 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100
 such a situation the state can 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.460
 regulate export volume reducing or 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.159
 increasing customs duties with 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.090
 one side 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.560
 increase in fees for 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.650
 additional rooms 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.860
 another country does not export so much 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.300
 so that spit saturation 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.610
 domestic book market price cuts 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.640
 don't know what more than half the cost 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.870
 fuel is taxes 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.990
 so if companies agree to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.900
 decrease in profits from the sale of liters of gasoline 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.290
 but the cost of fuel itself is not enough 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.880
 will affect 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.440
 since the proportion of taxes from the liver cells 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.520
 despite all attempts 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.780
 administrative price regulation 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 also decision punishments 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 oil refining companies in pricing 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.350
 collusion which incidentally was immediately 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.160
 appealed 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.300
 fuel certificate did not stop 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.480
 lately also is in small 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.740
 theater 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.610
 in our previous reviews we are just 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.200
 considered such a development scenario 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.810
 situations 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.000
 so pentagon experts 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240
 assumed our sport 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.619
 tons of gasoline AI 95 continued to grow 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.709
 since May prices have risen by 7 percent 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.980
 reach sensor on January 26 declined if 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.159
 in May it was possible to fill in the form 70 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.369
 liters up to 1708 rubles 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.079
 Now it is necessary to lay out 1825 and more 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:22.889
 rubles 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.149
 using developments 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.979
 kalita finance company tool 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.319
 95 petrol as insurance 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.609
 fuel cost increase 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:30.339
 could be compensated 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.489
 increase budget spending by 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.719
 making a profit buying gasoline au 95 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.219
 after 24 rubles 40 kopecks for sale up to 26 rubles 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.779
 8 kopecks 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.869
 speculators same UAH increase in value 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.939
 gasoline fascinating 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.069
 leverage could increase your 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.749
 deposit several times 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.180
 so from the fact that after 24 4 it would be possible 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.939
 now up to 468 thousand rubles in total 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.929
 commission 1050 rubles 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:59.609
 coming year we expect to continue 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.609
 rising fuel prices 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.199
 and growth will continue even in 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.539
 In that case, if it does not stop going up 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.959
 this is unlikely 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.799
 black gold will go up with any 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:09.519
 scripts 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.680
 in the economic growth itself is a continuation 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.719
 rocking liquidity commodity raw 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.659
 markets and while strengthening the economy 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.370
 our country here are those who are left without 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.289
 answer 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.189
 in stable oil prices we don't care 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.989
 what is the rise in price of fuel 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.900
 from the new year will be reduced twice 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.499
 transportation tax offset 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.260
 the state intends all models of treatment 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.429
 excise on gasoline 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.539
 that is, the cost of gasoline which is also 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.879
 more than half make up different 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.429
 the selection of the state last to exhibit 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.179
 increased by about 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.749
 for 1 ruble per year for three years 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.059
 to explain substantially 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:43.309
 The state has fallen in price 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.519
 refuse to levy amended sight 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.579
 fiction 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.099
 maybe such a new year surprise 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.430
 This is one of the measures of our officials formally 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.209
 Now the topic of dealing with traffic jams I 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.679
 interested 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.299
 hryvnia to the states themselves 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.539
 get answers send various taxes 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.229
 the projects are just the bigger than themselves 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.759
 fuel company 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.429
 so the fas will still be all 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:03.859
 Christine is the reason for the rise in price. 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.129
 gasoline and nothing more 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.999
 even such a widespread fact 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.709
 the fact that the Antonov kidneys managed 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.499
 prove in court violations of oil 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.189
 of the company 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.839
 federal competition law 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:15.869
 the court ruled to fine 

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:17.829
 large-scale accused company 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.689
 nothing changes 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.289
 these court decisions are likely 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.349
 the penalty will be fair lowered them at all 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.539
 canceled 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.379
 thus the price of fuel in Russia 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.409
 practically sentenced to cross 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.849
 rising gas and not only growing 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.519
 goes back to the regular opportunity 

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.610
 to earn 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.590
 company kalita finance spend 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.240
 together with us
