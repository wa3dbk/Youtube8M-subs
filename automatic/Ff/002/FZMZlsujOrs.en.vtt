00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.079
 some uranium will try to stop 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.950
 some of a lot but a little though 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.790
 it would all be strange things 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.620
 you want your friend to stay 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.300
 this is highly strange is better 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.670
 go there or from here via food prepared 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.270
 we leave tonight as we lose tonight 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.520
 I met this beautiful woman 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.190
 little dog of new crops but I can't 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.229
 get out of here or instead trusted or 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.470
 a good reason 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.180
 tonight we leave and I don't want stories 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.140
 trust kidding forever so 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.610
 he 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 I hope I will not ride that I 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.960
 abandons but after 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.770
 sorry 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.700
 but watch this street food commercial that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 what you hear me is me and you have to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.680
 go but you're still sleeping mica 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.729
 we can leave without her I will 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.640
 now I want another nuisance 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.600
 commits around we move down 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 with bill boards and uranium billions 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.570
 urane or you have to explain this to me 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.340
 of the perfect I must say that we could 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 to live here for this night now 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.240
 more words leaves and because I have you 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.240
 bigger bed my very small 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.039
 well maybe because i'm much more serious 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.479
 you are fine but now you explain it to me 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.330
 reason why we had to go immediately 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.400
 away from the village is fine if you 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.560
 I will explain I was walking happily 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.560
 when always between voice calling me 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.340
 so I decide to go to the tent from 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.080
 where the call came from let's say 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.750
 just entered the tent 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.990
 I felt disoriented and so I believe of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.690
 be fainted agreement I dreamed of 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.490
 yes I dreamed of a mare this mare 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.100
 kept telling me we were in 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.710
 danger both because I and someone 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.570
 he tried to stop me when I was 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.540
 woke up i immediately ran out from 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.660
 that tent and then I came to 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.130
 call and here we are 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.110
 but don't you remember that it was a 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.360
 tell you those things no I can't 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.190
 remember oh well anyway now it's late 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.690
 let's go to sleep there is that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.760
 that half-time doesn't have either 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.110
 reason but I hope so 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.110
 I was afraid of myself 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:17.930
 now three things will happen tomorrow one 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.420
 at dawn one at noon and the third at 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.790
 sunset at sunset but you really are 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.220
 Sure you said that this is you 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.290
 also repeated that we must stay 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.260
 be careful because we are in danger 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.850
 okay this reassures me and gives 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.950
 up is not the end of the world 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.840
 that the mare does not have 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.880
 not even right that he wanted to tell us 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.100
 so just to scare us 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.860
 letting go of all these things 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.660
 tells us this mare who tells me 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.650
 I would say to go to the city that el 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.040
 ahead of us a couple of days we arrive 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.030
 by the most we hope by let's go 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.060
 coming bad weather I follow you too that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.890
 the dawn I would say to hurry to look there 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.750
 a grove I would say go there since 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.790
 time does not bode well or much 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.930
 it will probably rain at least soon 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.170
 in alberici proteico a little ok ok i 'm 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.140
 sergeant the dawn tell me so you put me 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.690
 I'm afraid because I told you they are all 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.299
 stories the sun absorbed and it didn't happen 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.400
 nothing therefore less bad 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.120
 from we continue to go towards the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.280
 city spots there is a problem what kind of 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.680
 problem I can't move 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.680
 be trapped in quicksand 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:39.960
 a cabbage ok I'm going to get something 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:45.210
 to get out and hurry up sooner 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:48.020
 that makes us a rope here but here I am Koran 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:53.880
 you are clinging to this agreement 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.980
 ok you're ready now I 'm out 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.110
 ok let's go before it happens 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.110
 something else already better to leave
