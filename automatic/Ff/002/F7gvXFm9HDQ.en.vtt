a defensive type role player you know at

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.660 
a defensive type role player you know at
the<00:00:47.320> next<00:00:47.560> level<00:00:47.680> he<00:00:47.920> may<00:00:48.070> have<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.340> work<00:00:48.490> his

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
the next level he may have to work his

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.490 
the next level he may have to work his
way<00:00:48.700> up<00:00:48.880> you<00:00:49.690> know<00:00:49.810> whether<00:00:50.020> it<00:00:50.110> be<00:00:50.320> through

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
way up you know whether it be through

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.950 
way up you know whether it be through
the<00:00:50.620> d-league<00:00:50.950> or<00:00:51.160> overseas<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.750> still

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
the d-league or overseas because I still

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.300 
the d-league or overseas because I still
think<00:00:53.170> he's<00:00:53.290> got<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.500> lot<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.650> room<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:53.980> grow

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.970 

he's<00:00:57.310> on<00:00:58.240> the<00:00:58.510> bubble<00:00:58.840> probably<00:00:59.440> second-round

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
he's on the bubble probably second-round

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.740 
he's on the bubble probably second-round
undrafted<00:01:00.400> i<00:01:00.700> would<00:01:00.820> guess<00:01:01.000> but<00:01:01.270> because<00:01:01.720> of

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
undrafted i would guess but because of

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.900 
undrafted i would guess but because of
his<00:01:01.960> size<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.650> he's<00:01:02.800> still<00:01:03.040> pretty<00:01:03.220> young<00:01:03.310> I

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
his size and he's still pretty young I

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.280 
his size and he's still pretty young I
think<00:01:04.329> there's<00:01:04.479> probably<00:01:04.600> some<00:01:04.960> intrigue

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
think there's probably some intrigue

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.630 
think there's probably some intrigue
therefore<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.829> some<00:01:06.040> teams<00:01:06.220> in<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.400> second

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
therefore the some teams in the second

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.660 
therefore the some teams in the second
round<00:01:06.759> this<00:01:07.420> one<00:01:07.659> would<00:01:07.750> come<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.130> far<00:01:15.369> I'm<00:01:15.640> not

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670
