for it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.460 
for it
I<00:03:14.400> believe<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.940> opened<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.450> trinity<00:03:16.080> pack<00:03:16.260> that

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
I believe I opened a trinity pack that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.680 
I believe I opened a trinity pack that
had<00:03:16.620> him<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> single<00:03:17.610> pack<00:03:17.820> but<00:03:18.090> we

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
had him in not a single pack but we

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.270 
had him in not a single pack but we
still<00:03:18.930> looked<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.620> them<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.800> plenty<00:03:20.130> of

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
still looked at them in plenty of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.970 
still looked at them in plenty of
in-depth<00:03:21.470> analysis<00:03:22.470> however<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.770> want<00:03:22.890> to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
in-depth analysis however you want to

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.220 
in-depth analysis however you want to
say<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.760> course<00:03:23.820> as<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.300> legs<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.690> fold<00:03:25.020> out

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
say of course as the legs that fold out

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.900 
say of course as the legs that fold out
here<00:03:25.620> there<00:03:26.610> we<00:03:26.760> go<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.300> tail<00:03:27.510> -<00:03:28.730> alright

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
here there we go and the tail - alright

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.400 
here there we go and the tail - alright
most<00:03:30.420> importantly<00:03:30.810> though<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.770> G<00:03:32.100> power

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
most importantly though is this G power

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.070 
most importantly though is this G power
if<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.770> get<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.220> off<00:03:35.430> okay<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.690> his<00:03:36.870> G

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
if I can get this off okay and his G

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.800 
if I can get this off okay and his G
power<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.850> who<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.709> there<00:03:41.239> 910<00:03:42.239> G<00:03:42.540> I

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
power is who the is there 910 G I

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.870 
power is who the is there 910 G I
believe<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:43.980> higher<00:03:44.160> than<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.640> one<00:03:44.670> we

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
believe that is higher than the one we

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.910 
believe that is higher than the one we
got<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.120> be<00:03:45.209> balcony<00:03:45.720> pack<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> remember

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
got to be balcony pack that I remember

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.860 
got to be balcony pack that I remember
was<00:03:47.100> exactly<00:03:47.610> but<00:03:47.820> actually<00:03:48.630> think<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> might

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
was exactly but actually think I might

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.330 
was exactly but actually think I might
have<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:48.989> right<00:03:49.140> behind<00:03:49.290> me<00:03:49.620> one<00:03:50.370> second<00:03:52.160> yes<00:03:53.160> I

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
have it right behind me one second yes I

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.509 
have it right behind me one second yes I
do

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
do

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.070 
do
so<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.269> one<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.450> got<00:03:54.600> in<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.750> back<00:03:54.900> with

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
so the one we got in the back with

stuff full out cuz last seen and stuff
look<00:05:50.130> like<00:05:50.310> things<00:05:50.700> may<00:05:50.880> fold<00:05:51.210> out<00:05:51.330> and<00:05:51.360> stuff

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
look like things may fold out and stuff

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.620 
look like things may fold out and stuff
but<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.350> guess<00:05:53.130> that's<00:05:53.310> just<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.520> design<00:05:54.210> of<00:05:54.390> it

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
but I guess that's just the design of it

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.340 
but I guess that's just the design of it
oh<00:05:55.820> let's<00:05:56.820> see<00:05:56.970> oh<00:05:57.090> these<00:05:57.270> feet<00:05:57.600> here<00:05:57.870> Cherie

oh let's see oh these feet here Cherie
feet<00:05:58.650> are<00:05:58.770> still<00:05:58.890> not<00:05:58.980> full<00:05:59.160> out<00:05:59.250> you<00:05:59.370> would

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
feet are still not full out you would

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.810 
feet are still not full out you would
think<00:05:59.670> but<00:06:00.510> doesn't<00:06:00.960> look<00:06:01.020> like<00:06:01.230> it<00:06:01.670> just<00:06:02.670> cut

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
think but doesn't look like it just cut

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.000 
think but doesn't look like it just cut
looks<00:06:03.060> not<00:06:03.240> weird<00:06:03.450> that<00:06:03.630> GZA<00:06:03.870> many<00:06:04.110> feet<00:06:04.380> I<00:06:04.620> can

Wolverine<00:06:25.040> at<00:06:26.040> least<00:06:26.190> aqua<00:06:26.880> was<00:06:27.000> blue<00:06:27.210> if

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
Wolverine at least aqua was blue if

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.610 
Wolverine at least aqua was blue if
that's<00:06:27.510> one<00:06:27.630> of<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.780> colors<00:06:28.020> on<00:06:28.260> him<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:28.590> I

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
that's one of the colors on him so I

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.410 
that's one of the colors on him so I
guess<00:06:28.680> it<00:06:28.830> makes<00:06:28.920> sense<00:06:29.010> I'm<00:06:29.910> not<00:06:30.060> sure<00:06:30.210> if<00:06:30.300> the

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
guess it makes sense I'm not sure if the

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.590 
guess it makes sense I'm not sure if the
black<00:06:30.660> one<00:06:30.900> the<00:06:31.140> black<00:06:31.860> suited<00:06:32.700> Wolverine<00:06:33.480> is

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
black one the black suited Wolverine is

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.350 
black one the black suited Wolverine is
darkest<00:06:34.020> or<00:06:34.140> not<00:06:34.290> but<00:06:34.950> community<00:06:35.700> unbox<00:06:36.180> and
