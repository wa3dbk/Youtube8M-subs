00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 And then people are beautiful, I am Luiz of Fear. 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.760
 do not read and today I came to make a video about 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.550
 book fragments this sensational book 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.790
 which is the second book in the series pacha o 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.039
 extinct by the author of noel sessa series 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.310
 which was not widely reported here in the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.740
 brazil but the father dystopic world 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.199
 very cool much better than games 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.420
 voracious I think the problem of the end 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.730
 more and was not really disclosed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.189
 that Brazil and very few people know 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 So you there that likes that kind of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.579
 divergent game thing is if 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.129
 these books so face the series pages 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.780
 It's very cool and it's very worth it. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 I'll take a look, you've already reviewed the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:56.520
 first book here on the series channel I 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 I had read it a while ago, jazz 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.469
 do not come the time to come talk about him 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.199
 here for you the very cool book is 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.260
 which was a great first continuation 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.360
 good daniels talking about the book at 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.240
 before talking about the story he 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.369
 basically the same finish as the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.350
 including the first cover that not 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.170
 conquered by the first 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 basically this reason I read the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.200
 cousin passion is basically the same as her 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.080
 changes a little just because it now exists 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.159
 one week here in the romantic couple shot 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.720
 here on the cover but she 's really cool is still 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 well guava 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.750
 I liked it a lot and it's a little bit 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 higher than the first which is not bad to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.729
 history did not have a reality nor 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.070
 spelling linearity attacker baby 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.100
 very good linearity and compensated for 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.969
 these pages over the second volume 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.180
 although he has 519 pages these 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.390
 Pages are very fluid and reading 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 going on here is a glance at a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.729
 snap fingers 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.630
 looks good the second book he starts 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.550
 basically where the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.040
 the first in the woman of a few months 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.770
 then it's basically the same line 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.950
 story here we have one here that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.960
 She's kind of upset because she does not know. 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.750
 more who she is because she discovered that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.300
 she is a band or a middle passion 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.620
 different but it's a passion then 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.500
 first thing that happens in 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.840
 fragments was going out in search of 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.790
 answers to who she is 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.950
 today she will find it out on parade 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.200
 of course then she ends up going to the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.900
 She walks alone because she does not 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.150
 wants anyone along with her and she's gone 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.890
 sometimes discovering some trade 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.370
 some answers 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.920
 there on the stop she meets new 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.050
 characters including the saving that was 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.690
 a guy who worked there for us 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.820
 want no victor logo when 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.490
 head but he set up a collection 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.700
 gigantic information on the 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.460
 company and it starts back there respostos 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.220
 is when the saint appears again the 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.320
 our protagonist zinho along with akira 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.240
 and another character that he 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.110
 arrives had not known very well that 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.900
 the meeting 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.820
 I do not know how they speak Belgium was a 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.540
 name of man but at last is a woman a 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.440
 another passion and then they cable a make on 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.140
 hindrance 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.390
 Nor do we have to go there to the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.460
 stop to really find out what 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.920
 happened because nobody knows how to say 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.610
 very well and then another detail 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.560
 that no one knew also that it is a 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.600
 of validity of the Pashtuns 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.750
 just like the human armadillo dying 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.880
 because they can not have is new 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.330
 babies in this book that they do not 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.000
 still had new babies 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.340
 11 parents are kind of dilemma or 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.980
 because who created them created a 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.010
 device called speech safe then the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.959
 two species of the cast in hand because of 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.480
 one side has a validity or another 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.820
 get procreated and then die 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.530
 everybody until she speaks lion 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.930
 enough of this I need to find out 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.270
 It's happening, let's go there. 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.400
 to the headquarters of the prada for me is a fan or 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.710
 nothing serious for the sad gives to us and 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.570
 let's cover at once the problem is that 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.120
 I remember the city that is here. 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.250
 I think New York 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.620
 but I rather think with myself and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.290
 listed let's see it's new york 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.310
 they are on one side of the coast 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.860
 lech 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.260
 only it 's thirst stop was west coast 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.400
 he interests the United States 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.650
 all 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.720
 What is the problem after the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.940
 apocalypse who wants to see her through war 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.850
 of the parents the human virus with the states 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.030
 united that with extremely polluted 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.160
 that it is impossible to cross it 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.990
 say so in some areas of the front 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.479
 to the west coast because every rain 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.650
 acid is so strong that only take your 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.530
 skin it melts 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.810
 it's more or less so he sees himself in 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.810
 A need dilemma needs to be there and not 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.750
 is how folks Pappé and taking you 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.870
 this she has a pollution time and more 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.669
 some things that stop not create 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.039
 her passion she created the first 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.229
 genetic with all kinds plus types 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.260
 of species and there they created a 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:27.680
 puppy amount get mutants ter 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:29.660
 even a dragon will goes and goes going to 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.650
 in the stop-over series to find out 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.220
 is happening 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.130
 kind of a kind of road trip 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.380
 American drawing only more skull and 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.620
 It's basically what this book brings to 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.050
 people brings new answers to questions 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.510
 that were made there in the passion 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.960
 as it brings several new 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.590
 questions about this trilogy on 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.690
 story about kira life and everything 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.270
 it's happening and everything that goes 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.760
 happen in your series who went to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.800
 people who are the scientists behind the 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.020
 stop is happening is 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.300
 So you 're on the book and keep 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.479
 basically the same footprint as the first 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.120
 which is the xhosa father written of the damage she is 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.639
 extremely fluid it actually maintains 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.349
 those characteristics of white year 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.599
 fact that perhaps for having subscribed for a 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:23.210
 man then so is the avaí 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:26.180
 there is the novel yes the triangle 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.750
 loving that the ice between the loving not there 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:32.870
 yes a move only daniel it 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.580
 talk like this, face it, there's romance more 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.680
 We need to explain the story want 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.820
 tell the story in so much more 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.550
 is in the background and this is a 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.520
 thing that I saw that I celebrated because 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.030
 It was then something that fills the bag is a 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.639
 the protagonist and here 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.340
 he leaves well aside and said there is 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.930
 the beans got sore that they will have more 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.210
 this is the background 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.419
 and he really tells the story of the 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.060
 This fragment is really cool and makes it all 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:05.419
 very dynamic though it makes you 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.520
 if they relate so much in your head - 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.410
 with the characters makes her and 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.009
 everything becomes much more dynamic in my 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:15.229
 opinion but it is illusory long fragments 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:17.720
 sure especially if you already 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.030
 read pachos already liked the history of 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.160
 first book is worth neither 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.750
 fragment is sure that the third 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.690
 book series will also be pretty cool 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.840
 and that will have a good finish to 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.460
 this trilogy written by the wells and 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.039
 I wanted to know what you found 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.949
 this series so far for those who have read 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:39.130
 Why do not you like bands or not? 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:42.229
 like do not leave there in the comments 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:46.810
 so that you liked the video and I 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.810
