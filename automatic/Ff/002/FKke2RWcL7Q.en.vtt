00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone, Timur, we are today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.629
 learn to do simple but at the same time 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.629
 pretty spectacular scraping drove 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.779
 for a start, you will naturally come in handy 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.480
 momentum forward inforia up to both 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.960
 which is needed in any available then 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.980
 paladin and horizontal bar here let's say ears 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 click . 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.579
 and so quietly swinging doing 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.120
 max further bend the knees and do 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.129
 full turn and most importantly keep inertia 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.030
 stable 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.829
 no you slow 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.379
 but naturally the gate will fail 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.350
 I emphasize once again the main thing to do max 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.309
 bend your knees and hold cable inner 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.229
 come across time to start you 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.079
 you can of course just do 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:08.079
 summing up exercises in this way 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.079
 slightly 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.049
 you understand a little bit not to be afraid of the most 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:35.630
 important for this time then gradually you 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:37.500
 soon increase twisting hands water 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.110
 of course there by surprise 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.200
 much easier to do after lung 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.330
 You can build a previous tutorial here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.950
 but since now I will fail 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.369
 make arrows due to frost and wind 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.470
 I put the old frames look here but 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.420
 Nevertheless, we can just as well there 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.360
 already do there under about how you see wrong 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.580
 so this is certainly difficult home 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.679
 move your fear and do it 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.679
 almost flips or somersault 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.590
 forward so you still small 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:15.140
 relocate for a start do it with 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.140
 hand security the same turnover 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.440
 at the end of the day with your hands so that less and less 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.090
 do on the breast until one day you 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.100
 go to a dead end you finally 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.390
 do not insure a couple of ringlets and 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.520
 back bar 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.560
 make a small deflection this is also very 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.950
 more important it will be more beautiful more 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.260
 straight 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:41.800
 accumulation such things are not on those 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.370
 different from the turn ahead i need you 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.470
 will instill you not land on 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:55.890
 squat and fall on your back and so on 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.890
 We take turns doing straddle here 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:10.090
 just send so on so guys 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.980
 let's summarize everything you need for 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.230
 good execution is of course 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.830
 stable high speed so you don't 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.650
 to fall 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.780
 also direct body can be even with a small 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.269
 deflection checks so you do not touch nick here 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.190
 Well, it is desirable to keep the landing feet 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.560
 relatively straight if the height of the turkey 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.530
 it allows of course here and on this 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.510
 perhaps I still add myself to that 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.700
 will help much more able to do 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.459
 at least somersault forward either moss 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.560
 somersault forward since it is already full 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.440
 turnover through the head that's all 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.769
 so all good with you good luck to all 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.769
 new meetings 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.500
 gradually 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.500
 and we are there and do what is burning 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.920
 chest up the steps 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.920
 Dasha just 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.240
 what does it say 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.240
 pulls away from magnetic 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.970
 but 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.040
 work 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.040
 with
