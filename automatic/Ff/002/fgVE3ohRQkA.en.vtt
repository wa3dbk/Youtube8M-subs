 Hello, I want to show you how 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.910
 can easily clean the sole of the iron from 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.830
 Nagara I recently worked with glutinous and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.110
 Here I got to form such 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.900
 carbon we need pills 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.050
 hydroperit can be purchased at the pharmacy 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 are very cheap and some 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.769
 unnecessary fabric in several layers will take 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.390
 need her well tight so fold iron 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.859
 plug in to full power and 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.859
 wait for it to warm up 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:44.680
 here the indicator goes out the iron is hot 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:47.050
 unplug it from the outlet need to work 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.670
 aired after all 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.280
 we take one pill hydroperit 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:02.289
 gently apply to the sole of the iron 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:02.289
 aps can smell and shine 1 scrub 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.040
 my iron was very dirty 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.040
 so I will need two pills 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.610
 good wipe the surface of the tone with us 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.250
 everything cleared 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.010
 without any damage what I like 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.800
 this method is so that it does not spoil the sole 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.720
 iron rag we certainly such here 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.030
 burnt it will have to throw 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.050
 I hope my advice will be useful to you 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.050
 bye bye
