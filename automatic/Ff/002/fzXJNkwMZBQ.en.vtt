with<00:01:58.979> these<00:01:59.159> smaller<00:01:59.490> phones<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.969> that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
with these smaller phones is that

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
with these smaller phones is that
they're<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:00.630> quite<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:01.020> they're<00:02:01.380> not

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
they're just not quite as they're not

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.580 
they're just not quite as they're not
what<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:01.860> fast<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> bigger<00:02:02.700> sibling

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
what as fast is there a bigger sibling

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.230 
what as fast is there a bigger sibling
and<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.070> just<00:02:04.159> makes<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.460> less<00:02:04.670> fun<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.030> use

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
and that just makes the less fun to use

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.149 
and that just makes the less fun to use
and<00:02:05.390> also<00:02:05.960> makes<00:02:06.109> them<00:02:06.289> get<00:02:06.439> outdated<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.950> lot

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
and also makes them get outdated a lot

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.460 
and also makes them get outdated a lot
quicker<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.789> really<00:02:08.629> think<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.899> as<00:02:09.229> more

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
quicker I really think that as more

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.900 
quicker I really think that as more
companies<00:02:09.709> start<00:02:10.099> realizing<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.670> people

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
companies start realizing that people

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.540 
companies start realizing that people
