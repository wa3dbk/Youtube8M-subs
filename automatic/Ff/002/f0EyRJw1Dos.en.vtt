00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
reason why this is all rusty originally
it<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.670> blue<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.140> heat<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> fire

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it was blue and the heat from the fire

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
it was blue and the heat from the fire
melted<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> paint<00:01:06.030> off<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.840> people<00:01:06.960> go

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
melted the paint off so some people go

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
melted the paint off so some people go
they<00:01:07.799> buy<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> high<00:01:08.490> temperature<00:01:08.790> paint<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
they buy a high temperature paint and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
they buy a high temperature paint and

about<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.510> my<00:01:27.840> way<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> doing<00:01:28.230> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
about this is this is my way of doing it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
about this is this is my way of doing it
this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.980> not<00:01:29.160> probably<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.120> do<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this is not probably the way to do it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
this is not probably the way to do it
I've<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> figure<00:01:31.830> this<00:01:31.980> out<00:01:32.160> on<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.430> own

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I've had to figure this out on my own

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.430 
I've had to figure this out on my own
and<00:01:32.850> I'm<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.870> trying<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> share<00:01:34.260> my

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
and I'm just trying to share my

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.660 
and I'm just trying to share my
experience<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.160> I'll<00:01:35.310> let<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.550> know

the<00:01:35.820> things<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.690> gone<00:01:36.900> wrong<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.740> you

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
the things that have gone wrong so you

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.230 
the things that have gone wrong so you
don't<00:01:38.130> repeat<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.490> same<00:01:38.520> mistakes<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.210> did

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.820 
don't repeat the same mistakes I did
there's<00:01:39.630> probably<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.990> right<00:01:40.230> way<00:01:40.410> to<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830
