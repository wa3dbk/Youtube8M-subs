move<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.489> tone<00:02:12.730> spot<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.480> then<00:02:13.989> again

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
move it to the tone spot and then again

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.470 
move it to the tone spot and then again
just<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.739> 3-way<00:02:15.220> switch<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.150> one<00:02:16.360> as

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
just the 3-way switch on this one as

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.369 
just the 3-way switch on this one as
well<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.800> great<00:02:18.010> paint<00:02:18.280> job<00:02:18.599> yeah<00:02:19.599> so<00:02:20.200> those

obviously one is a backup then I have a
backstage<00:02:27.099> guitar<00:02:27.640> where<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> practice<00:02:29.020> in<00:02:29.319> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440

dressing room and stuff like that and
then<00:02:30.879> I<00:02:30.940> have<00:02:31.150> another<00:02:31.269> guitar<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.470> I

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
then I have another guitar that I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.770 
then I have another guitar that I
practice<00:02:32.769> when<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:33.400> at<00:02:33.580> my<00:02:33.610> hotel<00:02:33.910> room<00:02:34.090> but

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
practice when I'm at my hotel room but

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.930 
practice when I'm at my hotel room but
that's<00:02:35.230> about<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.739> really<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:36.280> live<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.760> we

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
that's about it really for live and we

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.320 
that's about it really for live and we
come<00:02:37.120> over<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.900> gear<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:39.330> we

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
come over here to the gear and we

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.270 
come over here to the gear and we
basically<00:02:40.540> start<00:02:41.080> off<00:02:41.230> obviously<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.830> Furman

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
basically start off obviously a Furman

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.190 
basically start off obviously a Furman
power<00:02:42.460> conditioner<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.930> don't<00:02:44.080> get

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
power conditioner so that we don't get

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.510 
power conditioner so that we don't get
too<00:02:44.380> much<00:02:44.500> interference<00:02:44.770> from<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.250> power

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
too much interference from the power

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.910 
too much interference from the power
lines<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.750> get<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> switcher<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.470> Kay

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
lines we get the switcher and Kay

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.740 
lines we get the switcher and Kay
I<00:02:47.950> have<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.310> switch<00:02:48.520> guitars<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.420> I'll<00:02:49.540> have

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
I have to switch guitars so I'll have

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.390 
I have to switch guitars so I'll have
three<00:02:50.110> different<00:02:50.440> possibilities<00:02:51.130> for

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
three different possibilities for

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.309 
three different possibilities for
different<00:02:52.300> guitars<00:02:52.599> that<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.959> could<00:02:53.170> have

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
different guitars that I could have

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.339 
different guitars that I could have
patched<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.910> right<00:02:55.660> now<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:55.900> using<00:02:56.050> a

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
patched in to that right now I'm using a

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.170 
patched in to that right now I'm using a
shure<00:02:56.770> wireless<00:02:57.340> --is<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.880> then<00:02:58.000> we're

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
shure wireless --is and then we're

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.500 
shure wireless --is and then we're
demoing<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.930> x2<00:02:59.770> unit<00:03:00.190> from<00:03:00.880> line<00:03:01.090> six<00:03:01.390> I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
demoing the x2 unit from line six I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.839 
demoing the x2 unit from line six I
think<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:01.900> right<00:03:02.080> yeah<00:03:02.680> down<00:03:03.220> here<00:03:03.280> we<00:03:03.760> get

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
think it is right yeah down here we get

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.030 
think it is right yeah down here we get
to<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.030> heart<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.959> tone<00:03:05.230> which<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.650> these

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
to the heart of the tone which is these

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.910 
to the heart of the tone which is these
fractal<00:03:07.000> Ultra<00:03:07.569> units<00:03:07.959> which<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.470> am<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.739> love

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
fractal Ultra units which I am in love

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.920 
fractal Ultra units which I am in love
with<00:03:08.950> right<00:03:09.370> now<00:03:09.400> we<00:03:10.090> go<00:03:10.209> straight<00:03:10.239> into<00:03:10.720> this

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
with right now we go straight into this

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.949 
with right now we go straight into this
unit<00:03:11.290> with<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.830> guitars<00:03:12.160> go<00:03:13.150> straight<00:03:13.630> out<00:03:13.900> of

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
unit with the guitars go straight out of

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.620 
unit with the guitars go straight out of
this<00:03:14.410> unit<00:03:14.739> into<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.280> Marshall<00:03:16.000> power<00:03:16.180> amps

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
this unit into the Marshall power amps

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.410 
this unit into the Marshall power amps
which<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> stereo<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.769> power<00:03:18.580> up<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:19.120> hundred

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
which is a stereo of power up to hundred

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.830 
which is a stereo of power up to hundred
watts<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:21.190> then<00:03:21.580> out<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:22.030> some<00:03:22.420> Marshall

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
watts and then out to some Marshall

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.960 
watts and then out to some Marshall
cabinets<00:03:23.260> loaded<00:03:23.890> with<00:03:24.040> vintage<00:03:24.430> thirty

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
cabinets loaded with vintage thirty

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.780 
cabinets loaded with vintage thirty
so<00:03:25.209> overall<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.620> setup<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.130> pretty<00:03:27.340> simple

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
so overall the setup is pretty simple

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.420 
so overall the setup is pretty simple
but<00:03:28.450> when<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.380> get<00:03:29.530> into<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.860> complexity<00:03:30.400> of

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
but when you get into the complexity of

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.729 
but when you get into the complexity of
this<00:03:30.640> unit<00:03:31.090> then<00:03:31.360> that's<00:03:31.600> where<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.900> get<00:03:32.260> you

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
this unit then that's where you get you

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.140 
this unit then that's where you get you
know<00:03:32.830> all<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.190> different<00:03:33.489> pedals<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.060> the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
know all of the different pedals and the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.729 
know all of the different pedals and the
different<00:03:34.420> effects<00:03:34.750> combinations<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.590> you

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
different effects combinations that you

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.740 
different effects combinations that you
can<00:03:35.890> possibly<00:03:36.310> use<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.940> let<00:03:37.390> me<00:03:37.450> get<00:03:37.600> into

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
can possibly use and let me get into

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.390 
can possibly use and let me get into
that<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.989> little<00:03:38.200> bit<00:03:38.350> more<00:03:38.590> for<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:38.980> I'll<00:03:39.220> show

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
that a little bit more for you I'll show

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.500 
that a little bit more for you I'll show
you<00:03:39.489> what<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.670> use<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.030> for<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.269> some<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.450> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
you what I use it for and some of the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.509 
you what I use it for and some of the
cool<00:03:40.720> things<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.590> like<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.040> use<00:03:42.190> them<00:03:42.340> for

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
cool things that I like to use them for

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.850 
cool things that I like to use them for
let's<00:03:43.450> bring<00:03:43.569> up<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.870> interface<00:03:44.290> for<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> axe

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
let's bring up the interface for the axe

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.270 
let's bring up the interface for the axe
effects<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.390> them<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:47.260> right<00:03:47.560> here<00:03:47.980> where

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
effects one of them is right here where

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.430 
effects one of them is right here where
if<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:49.120> notice<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.540> take<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.870> input<00:03:50.260> right

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
if you notice I take the input right

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.800 
if you notice I take the input right
here<00:03:50.769> and<00:03:50.950> bring<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.700> off<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.390> line<00:03:52.630> right

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
here and bring it off to this line right

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.710 
here and bring it off to this line right
here<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.560> reason<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.130> to<00:03:54.160> do<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.609> is<00:03:54.880> for

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
here the reason I like to do that is for

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.759 
here the reason I like to do that is for
a<00:03:55.780> DI<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.100> when<00:03:57.310> we<00:03:57.459> play<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:58.410> show<00:03:59.410> where

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
a DI so that when we play a show where

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.680 
a DI so that when we play a show where
we<00:03:59.799> want<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.160> react<00:04:00.579> or<00:04:00.910> something<00:04:01.299> like<00:04:01.450> that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
we want to react or something like that

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.220 
we want to react or something like that
later

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
later

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.349 
later
people<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.160> just<00:04:03.280> plug<00:04:03.549> in<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.120> left

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
people can just plug in to the left

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.009 
people can just plug in to the left
output<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.109> output<00:04:05.709> one<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.370> get<00:04:07.120> that<00:04:07.269> that

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
output of output one and get that that

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.840 
output of output one and get that that
di<00:04:08.350> signal<00:04:08.859> so<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.489> don't<00:04:09.640> have<00:04:09.760> to

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
di signal so that you don't have to

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.759 
di signal so that you don't have to
worry<00:04:10.060> about<00:04:10.180> putting<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.750> box<00:04:11.049> in<00:04:11.320> front<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.680> it

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
worry about putting a box in front of it

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.229 
worry about putting a box in front of it
as<00:04:11.890> well

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
as well

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.569 
as well
and<00:04:13.510> then<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:14.440> know<00:04:14.530> we<00:04:14.680> take<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.070> main<00:04:15.310> line

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
and then you know we take the main line

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:16.979 
and then you know we take the main line
that<00:04:15.880> you're<00:04:16.090> going<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.239> run<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.660> your<00:04:16.750> power

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that you're going to run to your power

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.319 
that you're going to run to your power
amp<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:18.340> have<00:04:18.489> your<00:04:18.669> amp<00:04:18.850> model<00:04:19.239> right

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
amp and you have your amp model right

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.360 
amp and you have your amp model right
here<00:04:19.390> now<00:04:20.260> for<00:04:20.530> this<00:04:20.680> one<00:04:20.859> I'm<00:04:20.979> using<00:04:21.190> an

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
here now for this one I'm using an

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.969 
here now for this one I'm using an
energy<00:04:21.579> ball<00:04:22.110> which<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.140> a<00:04:23.289> clone<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.560> an<00:04:23.830> amp

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
energy ball which is a clone of an amp

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.409 
energy ball which is a clone of an amp
and<00:04:25.229> you've<00:04:26.229> got<00:04:26.440> tons<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.550> controls<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.330> know

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
and you've got tons of controls you know

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.630 
and you've got tons of controls you know
your<00:04:28.900> standard<00:04:29.260> controls<00:04:29.800> right<00:04:30.010> here<00:04:30.070> but

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
your standard controls right here but

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.570 
your standard controls right here but
then<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:30.850> get<00:04:31.240> into<00:04:31.979> things<00:04:32.979> where<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.430> get

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
then you get into things where you get

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.120 
then you get into things where you get
into<00:04:33.789> your<00:04:33.910> depth<00:04:34.180> dab<00:04:34.539> damping<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.740> your<00:04:35.860> sag

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
into your depth dab damping and your sag

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.060 
into your depth dab damping and your sag
and<00:04:36.520> all<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.590> then<00:04:38.590> we<00:04:38.710> come<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.950> the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
and all of that then we come to the

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.370 
and all of that then we come to the
cabinet<00:04:39.430> simulator<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:40.060> right

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
cabinet simulator and right

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.440 
cabinet simulator and right
the<00:04:40.620> cabinet<00:04:41.010> simulator<00:04:41.430> for<00:04:41.640> me<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:41.940> more<00:04:42.210> for

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
the cabinet simulator for me is more for

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.500 
the cabinet simulator for me is more for
my<00:04:42.570> in-ears<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.350> that's<00:04:43.680> just<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.070> have<00:04:44.460> a

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
my in-ears and that's just so I have a

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.070 
my in-ears and that's just so I have a
constant<00:04:45.510> consistent<00:04:46.410> volume<00:04:46.740> from<00:04:47.730> there<00:04:48.080> we

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
constant consistent volume from there we

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.200 
constant consistent volume from there we
look<00:04:49.350> at<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.680> effects<00:04:50.100> loop<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.730> use<00:04:50.940> this

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
look at the effects loop and I use this

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.820 
look at the effects loop and I use this
to<00:04:51.420> actually<00:04:51.570> these<00:04:51.930> these<00:04:52.350> are<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.650> outs

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
to actually these these are the outs

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.350 
to actually these these are the outs
that<00:04:53.160> are<00:04:53.310> actually<00:04:53.640> running<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.150> power

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
that are actually running to the power

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.970 
that are actually running to the power
amp<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.870> if<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.050> notice<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.350> splits<00:04:55.800> off

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
amp so if you notice that splits off

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.940 
amp so if you notice that splits off
before<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.640> cabinet<00:04:56.820> simulator<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.740> run

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
before the cabinet simulator and I run

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.860 
before the cabinet simulator and I run
that<00:04:59.100> directly<00:04:59.490> into<00:04:59.670> my<00:04:59.820> power<00:05:00.060> out<00:05:00.300> out<00:05:00.540> to

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
that directly into my power out out to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.800 
that directly into my power out out to
the<00:05:00.990> cabinets<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.670> live<00:05:02.940> sound<00:05:03.480> is

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
the cabinets and so the live sound is

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.570 
the cabinets and so the live sound is
going<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.110> be<00:05:04.200> through<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.680> real<00:05:04.890> cabinet<00:05:05.370> and

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
going to be through the real cabinet and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.310 
going to be through the real cabinet and
then<00:05:05.940> my<00:05:06.150> in-ear<00:05:06.390> sound<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.990> through<00:05:07.200> the

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
then my in-ear sound is through the

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.440 
then my in-ear sound is through the
cabinet<00:05:07.740> simulator<00:05:08.060> another<00:05:09.060> thing<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.420> I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
cabinet simulator another thing that I

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.540 
cabinet simulator another thing that I
use<00:05:09.660> quite<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.020> bit<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.770> intelligent<00:05:11.340> pitch

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
use quite a bit is the intelligent pitch

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.460 
use quite a bit is the intelligent pitch
shift<00:05:11.850> when<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.300> need<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.750> do<00:05:12.900> some<00:05:13.170> sort<00:05:13.290> of<00:05:13.380> a

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
shift when I need to do some sort of a

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.060 
shift when I need to do some sort of a
harmony<00:05:13.890> like<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.760> do<00:05:14.820> in<00:05:15.770> 1320<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.800> have<00:05:17.040> a

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
harmony like I do in 1320 I have a

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.250 
harmony like I do in 1320 I have a
harmony<00:05:17.610> that's<00:05:17.820> a<00:05:18.000> diminished<00:05:18.540> fifth<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:19.110> also

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
harmony that's a diminished fifth I also

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.580 
harmony that's a diminished fifth I also
have<00:05:19.620> one<00:05:19.920> that's<00:05:20.130> an<00:05:20.400> a-minor<00:05:21.270> up<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.290> third

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
have one that's an a-minor up a third

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.000 
have one that's an a-minor up a third
and<00:05:22.950> f-sharp<00:05:23.340> minor<00:05:24.030> down<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.600> third<00:05:25.080> for<00:05:25.680> small

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
and f-sharp minor down a third for small

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.070 
and f-sharp minor down a third for small
little<00:05:26.340> parts<00:05:26.700> within<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.210> solo<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.990> know

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
little parts within that solo you know

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.810 
little parts within that solo you know
things<00:05:28.320> that<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.560> harmonized<00:05:29.100> in<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.490> studio

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
things that I harmonized in the studio

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.850 
things that I harmonized in the studio
that<00:05:30.450> you<00:05:30.540> just<00:05:30.750> couldn't<00:05:31.050> recreate<00:05:31.470> live

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
that you just couldn't recreate live

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.940 
that you just couldn't recreate live
without<00:05:32.540> you<00:05:33.540> know<00:05:33.630> harmonizer<00:05:34.200> doing<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:34.740> for

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
without you know harmonizer doing it for

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.400 
without you know harmonizer doing it for
you<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.550> again<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.420> could<00:05:36.540> route<00:05:36.780> these<00:05:37.050> so

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
you and again you could route these so

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.500 
you and again you could route these so
differently<00:05:37.950> than<00:05:38.250> most<00:05:38.790> any<00:05:39.030> other<00:05:39.240> unit
