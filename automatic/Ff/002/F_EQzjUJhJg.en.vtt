500 just to show off for the cameras and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.790 
500 just to show off for the cameras and
stuff<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.630> me<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:12.230> I'm<00:02:12.740> really

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
stuff but for me I just I'm really

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800 
stuff but for me I just I'm really
focused<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:13.670> okay<00:02:13.940> how<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.660> gonna

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
focused on okay how is this gonna

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.080 
focused on okay how is this gonna
contract<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.440> best<00:02:15.650> my<00:02:16.310> legs<00:02:16.520> were<00:02:16.700> ripped<00:02:16.910> at

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
contract the best my legs were ripped at

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.860 
contract the best my legs were ripped at
ten<00:02:17.270> weeks<00:02:17.650> from<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.770> front<00:02:19.040> side<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:20.750> me

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
ten weeks from the front side so for me

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.540 
ten weeks from the front side so for me
the<00:02:21.020> rep<00:02:21.230> range<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:22.040> be<00:02:22.160> very<00:02:22.340> high

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
the rep range that can be very high

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.240 
the rep range that can be very high
because<00:02:22.730> I'll<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.180> deplete<00:02:23.510> my<00:02:23.660> legs<00:02:23.870> down

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
because I'll just deplete my legs down

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.830 
because I'll just deplete my legs down
so<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.610> keep<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.880> weights<00:02:26.090> very<00:02:26.630> heavy

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
so I like to keep the weights very heavy

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.230 
so I like to keep the weights very heavy
and<00:02:27.140> do<00:02:27.410> lower<00:02:27.680> reps<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.190> obviously<00:02:28.490> what

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
and do lower reps and obviously what

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.449 
and do lower reps and obviously what
happens<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.780> when<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.080> train<00:02:30.980> with<00:02:31.160> as<00:02:31.310> much

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
happens is when you train with as much

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.729 
happens is when you train with as much
volume<00:02:31.670> as<00:02:32.000> me<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.930> can't<00:02:33.260> do<00:02:33.440> as<00:02:33.560> many

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
volume as me you can't do as many

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.260 
volume as me you can't do as many
repetitions<00:02:33.980> because<00:02:34.580> you'll<00:02:34.910> just<00:02:35.090> burn

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
repetitions because you'll just burn

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.390 
repetitions because you'll just burn
yourself<00:02:35.720> up<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.110> mean<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.320> have<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.709> have<00:02:36.890> one

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
yourself up I mean you have to have one

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.530 
yourself up I mean you have to have one
of<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.580> other<00:02:37.700> either<00:02:37.880> you're<00:02:38.060> gonna<00:02:38.180> do<00:02:38.330> less

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
of the other either you're gonna do less

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.710 
of the other either you're gonna do less
weight<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:40.190> know<00:02:40.310> more<00:02:40.790> repetitions<00:02:41.450> and

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
weight you know more repetitions and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.350 
weight you know more repetitions and
less<00:02:42.050> sets<00:02:42.560> or<00:02:43.310> you're<00:02:43.459> going<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:44.120> lot

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
less sets or you're going to do a lot

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.610 
less sets or you're going to do a lot
more<00:02:44.390> sets<00:02:44.810> heavier<00:02:45.170> weights<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.770> less<00:02:46.190> reps

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.809 

I<00:02:51.560> have<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> very<00:02:52.799> good<00:02:53.069> system<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> way<00:02:53.700> it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
I have a very good system the way it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.750 
I have a very good system the way it
works<00:02:54.000> now<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.599> trained<00:02:55.530> by<00:02:55.650> myself<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.430> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
training and we film the sets in the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.750 
training and we film the sets in the
reps<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.319> what<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:07.920> go<00:03:08.280> back<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.730> I

okay how come my form be a little better

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.869 
okay how come my form be a little better
and<00:03:13.319> as<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.680> noticed<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.099> had<00:03:14.280> him<00:03:14.459> watching<00:03:14.670> my

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
and as you noticed I had him watching my

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.550 
and as you noticed I had him watching my
form<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.239> little<00:03:15.360> bit<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.110> say<00:03:16.260> okay<00:03:16.470> I'm

form a little bit and I say okay I'm

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.860 
form a little bit and I say okay I'm
gonna<00:03:16.650> take<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:16.920> one<00:03:17.250> down<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.640> here<00:03:17.870> most

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
gonna take this one down to here most

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.660 
gonna take this one down to here most
importantly<00:03:19.379> on<00:03:19.530> legs<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.950> depth<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.489> I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
importantly on legs is the depth that I

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.490 
importantly on legs is the depth that I
go<00:03:20.879> in<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.329> speed<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.900> travel<00:03:22.349> through

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
go in the speed that I travel through

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.410 
go in the speed that I travel through
the<00:03:22.560> repetitions<00:03:23.129> because<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.000> want<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.239> fire

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the repetitions because I want to fire

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.199 
the repetitions because I want to fire
the<00:03:24.629> quad<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.579> have<00:03:26.579> someone<00:03:26.879> there<00:03:26.940> watch

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
it you know it's there's a lot of arcs

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.619 
it you know it's there's a lot of arcs
and<00:03:29.099> angles<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.730> whatnot<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.299> have<00:03:30.420> so

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
and angles and whatnot that I have so

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.830 
and angles and whatnot that I have so
you<00:03:30.810> know<00:03:30.840> okay<00:03:31.319> watch<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:33.060> beneficially
