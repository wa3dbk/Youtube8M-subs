smart he's going to get a few drones to
get<00:00:40.530> an<00:00:40.620> expansion<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> trying<00:00:42.510> even<00:00:42.660> things

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
get an expansion and trying even things

up<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.230> Jayde<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.800> way<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.040> again<00:00:44.969> J

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
up with Jayde on that way but again J

up with Jayde on that way but again J
don't<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> second<00:00:46.020> base<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.500> once

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
don't have the second base so once

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
don't have the second base so once
things<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.420> under<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.289> catch<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
things get under way you can catch up in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
things get under way you can catch up in
a<00:00:49.800> second<00:00:50.070> gas<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.640> earlier<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.449> could

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
a second gas going earlier and so could

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200 
a second gas going earlier and so could
go<00:00:51.719> by<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.899> way<00:00:52.079> although<00:00:52.620> again<00:00:52.829> Jews<00:00:53.250> jvz<00:00:53.910> so

go by the way although again Jews jvz so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.049 
go by the way although again Jews jvz so
right<00:00:54.570> right<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.559> gonna<00:00:55.680> lie<00:00:55.890> zero<00:00:56.520> with

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
against Jay Don despite I have to say

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.610 
against Jay Don despite I have to say
that<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.910> did<00:04:53.510> not<00:04:53.660> expect<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.200> last<00:04:54.320> that

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
that I did not expect it to last that

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.159 
that I did not expect it to last that
long<00:04:54.830> there<00:04:55.220> was<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.460> point<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:56.180> know<00:04:56.450> where

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
long there was a point you know where

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.779 
long there was a point you know where
you're<00:04:57.470> right<00:04:57.650> both<00:04:57.889> have<00:04:58.100> been<00:04:58.310> there<00:04:58.550> was<00:04:58.760> a

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
you're right both have been there was a

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.820 
you're right both have been there was a
point<00:04:59.090> where<00:04:59.360> I<00:04:59.389> thought<00:04:59.810> Jada<00:05:00.470> was<00:05:00.680> in

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
point where I thought Jada was in

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.440 
point where I thought Jada was in
trouble<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.430> end<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.910> think<00:05:02.120> it<00:05:02.210> could<00:05:02.330> have

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
trouble in the end I think it could have

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.010 
trouble in the end I think it could have
swung<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.500> yeah<00:05:03.800> Jaedong<00:05:04.280> is<00:05:04.460> just<00:05:04.610> too<00:05:04.729> good

anyway<00:05:24.860> i<00:05:25.040> think<00:05:25.340> that<00:05:25.699> j<00:05:25.880> dawgs<00:05:26.090> didn't<00:05:26.330> put

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
anyway i think that j dawgs didn't put

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.110 
anyway i think that j dawgs didn't put
up<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.630> better<00:05:26.750> fight<00:05:26.870> against<00:05:27.470> fantasy<00:05:28.460> so

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
up a better fight against fantasy so

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.450 
up a better fight against fantasy so
it'll<00:05:29.600> be<00:05:29.630> a<00:05:29.720> better<00:05:29.990> semifinal<00:05:30.949> I<00:05:31.009> think<00:05:31.280> good

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
it'll be a better semifinal I think good

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.100 
it'll be a better semifinal I think good
luck<00:05:31.610> 20<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.360> next<00:05:32.630> round<00:05:32.840> oh<00:05:33.729> yeah<00:05:34.729> but

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
luck 20 in the next round oh yeah but

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.659 
luck 20 in the next round oh yeah but
that<00:05:36.110> was<00:05:36.229> a<00:05:36.259> crazy<00:05:36.530> game<00:05:36.740> pretty<00:05:37.190> back<00:05:37.460> and

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
that was a crazy game pretty back and

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.320 
that was a crazy game pretty back and
forth<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:38.389> think<00:05:39.229> there<00:05:39.350> was<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.620> point<00:05:39.979> where<00:05:40.330> it

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
forth I think there was a point where it

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.180 
forth I think there was a point where it
was<00:05:41.479> on<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.750> edge<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.229> 0<00:05:42.500> might<00:05:42.830> have<00:05:42.949> had<00:05:43.070> an

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
was on the edge and 0 might have had an

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.909 
was on the edge and 0 might have had an
advantage<00:05:43.509> but<00:05:44.509> jail<00:05:45.229> and<00:05:45.410> he<00:05:45.470> just<00:05:45.620> makes<00:05:45.800> all

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
advantage but jail and he just makes all

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.120 
advantage but jail and he just makes all
the<00:05:46.070> right<00:05:46.220> decisions<00:05:46.340> and<00:05:46.960> 0<00:05:47.960> not<00:05:48.830> quite

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
the right decisions and 0 not quite

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.379 
the right decisions and 0 not quite
experienced<00:05:49.550> enough<00:05:49.759> to<00:05:49.789> be<00:05:49.970> able<00:05:50.030> to<00:05:50.180> take

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
experienced enough to be able to take

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:51.999 
experienced enough to be able to take
complete<00:05:50.750> advantage<00:05:50.810> of<00:05:51.320> his<00:05:51.440> advantages

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
complete advantage of his advantages

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.010 
complete advantage of his advantages
right<00:05:52.550> either<00:05:52.759> and<00:05:53.150> I<00:05:53.270> think<00:05:53.509> to<00:05:53.570> be<00:05:53.750> cooling

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
right either and I think to be cooling

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.920 
right either and I think to be cooling
us<00:05:54.169> I<00:05:54.289> think<00:05:54.320> it's<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.919> little<00:05:55.039> unlucky<00:05:55.580> if<00:05:55.930> he'd

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
us I think it's a little unlucky if he'd

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.100 
us I think it's a little unlucky if he'd
scouted<00:05:57.260> Jade<00:05:57.650> on<00:05:57.800> first<00:05:58.130> and<00:05:58.370> he'd<00:05:58.520> been<00:05:58.669> in<00:05:58.760> a

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
scouted Jade on first and he'd been in a

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.400 
scouted Jade on first and he'd been in a
position<00:06:00.110> on<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.800> same<00:06:01.389> edge<00:06:02.389> of<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.900> map<00:06:03.110> and

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
position on the same edge of the map and

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.040 
position on the same edge of the map and
not<00:06:03.530> cross<00:06:03.770> positions<00:06:04.280> so<00:06:05.150> taken<00:06:05.570> then<00:06:05.870> he

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
not cross positions so taken then he

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.510 
not cross positions so taken then he
could<00:06:06.229> have<00:06:06.350> done<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.530> lot<00:06:06.680> more<00:06:06.740> damage<00:06:07.070> early

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
could have done a lot more damage early

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.490 
could have done a lot more damage early
on<00:06:07.550> instead<00:06:08.449> it<00:06:08.570> took<00:06:08.690> too<00:06:08.870> long<00:06:08.900> and<00:06:09.229> Jade<00:06:09.380> own

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
on instead it took too long and Jade own

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.240 
on instead it took too long and Jade own
hands<00:06:09.710> organs<00:06:10.100> out<00:06:10.310> by<00:06:10.520> then<00:06:10.669> so<00:06:10.699> yeah<00:06:12.250> it's

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
hands organs out by then so yeah it's

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.920 
hands organs out by then so yeah it's
interesting<00:06:13.550> to<00:06:13.850> see<00:06:14.030> because<00:06:14.210> fantasy<00:06:14.780> and

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
interesting to see because fantasy and

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.270 
interesting to see because fantasy and
jayden<00:06:15.229> are<00:06:15.410> going<00:06:15.530> to<00:06:15.590> go<00:06:15.680> up<00:06:15.710> against<00:06:16.190> each

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
jayden are going to go up against each

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.730 
jayden are going to go up against each
other<00:06:16.490> so<00:06:16.880> a<00:06:16.990> semifinal<00:06:17.990> rematch<00:06:18.349> of<00:06:18.560> the

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
other so a semifinal rematch of the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.589 
other so a semifinal rematch of the
finals<00:06:19.160> match<00:06:19.280> to<00:06:19.430> the<00:06:19.520> last<00:06:19.699> of<00:06:19.849> my<00:06:19.940> cells<00:06:20.210> and

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
finals match to the last of my cells and

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:21.939 
finals match to the last of my cells and
then<00:06:20.930> you're<00:06:21.080> going<00:06:21.169> to<00:06:21.229> be<00:06:21.349> seeing<00:06:21.560> yellow

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
then you're going to be seeing yellow

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.520 
then you're going to be seeing yellow
and<00:06:22.340> type<00:06:22.550> B<00:06:22.849> go<00:06:23.090> up<00:06:23.210> against<00:06:23.509> each<00:06:23.690> other<00:06:23.930> so

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
and type B go up against each other so

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.730 
and type B go up against each other so
we<00:06:25.250> could<00:06:25.610> potentially<00:06:25.820> see<00:06:26.419> a<00:06:26.449> ZBZ<00:06:27.080> final

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
we could potentially see a ZBZ final

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.219 
we could potentially see a ZBZ final
which<00:06:28.190> would<00:06:28.340> be<00:06:28.430> crazy<00:06:28.669> either<00:06:29.389> way<00:06:29.750> I<00:06:29.780> feel

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
which would be crazy either way I feel

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.260 
which would be crazy either way I feel
like<00:06:30.410> this<00:06:31.010> next<00:06:31.340> semifinal<00:06:31.849> match<00:06:32.000> between

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
like this next semifinal match between
