would<00:02:17.000> go<00:02:17.120> up<00:02:17.300> more<00:02:17.570> now<00:02:18.200> i'm<00:02:18.260> pretty<00:02:18.680> sure

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
would go up more now i'm pretty sure

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.640 
would go up more now i'm pretty sure
that<00:02:19.010> they<00:02:19.310> allah<00:02:19.520> made<00:02:19.730> stuff<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.480> that

that they allah made stuff like that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.190 
that they allah made stuff like that
occurring<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.820> they<00:02:23.090> did<00:02:23.300> say<00:02:23.570> that<00:02:23.840> they

occurring and they did say that they

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.680 
occurring and they did say that they
were<00:02:24.260> tweaking<00:02:24.830> um<00:02:25.070> what<00:02:25.940> will<00:02:26.120> make<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.450> rank

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
know it there's an extent to how far you

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.080 
know it there's an extent to how far you
can<00:02:33.410> go<00:02:33.560> up<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.770> one<00:02:33.950> day<00:02:34.160> or<00:02:34.190> how<00:02:34.550> far<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.940> can

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
can go up in one day or how far you can

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.960 
can go up in one day or how far you can
go<00:02:35.240> down<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.840> day<00:02:36.020> etc<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:37.370> really<00:02:37.820> thought

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
go down in one day etc I really thought

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.940 
go down in one day etc I really thought
there<00:02:38.210> would<00:02:38.360> be<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.780> I'm<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.560> hoping

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
there would be and I'm really hoping

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.920 
there would be and I'm really hoping
that<00:02:40.010> they<00:02:40.250> made<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.910> very<00:02:40.940> competitive

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
that they made this a very competitive

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.220 
that they made this a very competitive
base<00:02:42.650> system<00:02:43.520> considering<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> fact<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:44.930> it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
base system considering the fact that it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.670 
base system considering the fact that it
is<00:02:45.460> csr<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:47.020> it's<00:02:48.020> supposed<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.530> be

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
is csr and it's supposed to be

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.920 
is csr and it's supposed to be
competitive<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.370> how<00:02:50.000> competitive<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
competitive but how competitive is the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.150 
competitive but how competitive is the
question<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.440> know<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.620> lot<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:51.830> people<00:02:51.920> are

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
question that I know a lot of people are

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.100 
question that I know a lot of people are
gonna<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.550> personally<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.450> also<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:53.990> that

will allow you to rank up winning games

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.830 
will allow you to rank up winning games
you<00:03:06.860> know<00:03:06.950> being<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.520> top<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.540> you

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
wrong having the most kills in the game

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.890

and most assists in a game what are they

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.080 
and most assists in a game what are they
basing<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.470> off<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.489> know<00:03:16.610> because<00:03:16.820> if

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
basing it off of you know because if

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.000 
basing it off of you know because if
it's<00:03:17.300> like<00:03:17.510> arena<00:03:18.020> where<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.739> know<00:03:18.830> they

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
it's like arena where you know they

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.390 
it's like arena where you know they
eventually<00:03:19.520> based<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.120> off<00:03:20.180> win<00:03:20.480> loss<00:03:21.040> or<00:03:22.040> will

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
eventually based it off win loss or will

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.020 
eventually based it off win loss or will
it<00:03:22.430> be<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:23.360> know<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.989> old<00:03:24.110> halo<00:03:24.530> 3

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
it be you know like the old halo 3

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.180 
it be you know like the old halo 3
system<00:03:26.030> or<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.330> more<00:03:26.870> even<00:03:27.260> harder<00:03:27.739> system

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
system or the more even harder system

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.900 
system or the more even harder system
being<00:03:28.520> halo<00:03:28.970> 2<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.400> with<00:03:31.400> all<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.700> knowledge

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
being halo 2 so with all the knowledge

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.090 
being halo 2 so with all the knowledge
that<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:32.360> have<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.900> previous<00:03:33.380> games<00:03:33.680> and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
that we have of the previous games and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.220 
that we have of the previous games and
the<00:03:34.190> flaws<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.910> think<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:35.630> they<00:03:35.750> took<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.020> lot

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the flaws I think that they took a lot

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.060 
the flaws I think that they took a lot
of<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.590> information<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.520> fixed<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.709> um<00:03:39.709> and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
of that information and fixed it um and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.260 
of that information and fixed it um and
that's<00:03:40.340> why<00:03:40.580> you're<00:03:40.730> not<00:03:40.880> gonna<00:03:40.970> be<00:03:41.090> able<00:03:41.150> to

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
that's why you're not gonna be able to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.240 
that's why you're not gonna be able to
see<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> ring<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.900> game<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.500> my<00:03:42.650> knowledge<00:03:42.860> and

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
see a ring in game to my knowledge and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.490 
see a ring in game to my knowledge and
that<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:44.000> why<00:03:44.209> I'm<00:03:44.510> assuming<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.380> will<00:03:45.470> be

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
that is why I'm assuming that it will be

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.720 
that is why I'm assuming that it will be
a<00:03:45.620> little<00:03:46.040> bit<00:03:46.190> easier<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.970> get<00:03:47.660> up<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.730> the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
a little bit easier to get up in the
