00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello speaks to you Luis Marion and I invite you to 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.480
 theoretical-practical course of networks of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.340
 marion tech academy in the next 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.349
 minutes let's study the definition 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 computer network as well as 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.719
 the functions of the administrator of the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.719
 net 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.369
 what is a computer network are we going to 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.080
 define a computer network or 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.689
 configure the network as a set of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.300
 computers connected to each other with the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.640
 goal of sharing resources and for 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.940
 abbreviate we are going to refer simply 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.790
 as the network what are some of the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.270
 resources that we can share and we can 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.220
 share a hard drive or hard drive 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.720
 also a high laser printer 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.060
 speed a connection to the internet or 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.890
 it can be a server on which you are 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.260
 running a type application 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.710
 server as say let's say now with 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.200
 a peoplesoft application or it can be 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.930
 let's say the s400 acting as a 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.240
 server all these are resources that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.780
 We want to share from several 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.780
 computers 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.840
 what will your role be like 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.700
 network administrator that is if you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.979
 they hire as a network administrator 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.149
 what did he have to do inside that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.369
 company 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.740
 the network administrator controls the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.640
 devices that are connected to the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.829
 network and that they have a communication 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.759
 optimal and without interruptions notice that 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.890
 I purposely emphasized the word 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.859
 communication let's spend a lot of time 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.829
 studying the concept of protocols of 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.039
 communication since they are a part 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.340
 essential to understand how they work 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.099
 computer networks what are 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.679
 some of the administrator's tasks 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:52.370
 we have to connect a new pc or a 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.880
 printer to the network 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.040
 the diagnosis or troubleshooting as 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.720
 dices is in English that is if there is 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.850
 a connection that is slow to a 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.800
 server has been interrupted or if the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.880
 connection that communication then the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.790
 network administrator has to take 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.330
 quick action because imagine if that 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.770
 server runs the company's payroll 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.720
 that can not be stopped 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.580
 that is to say that immediately the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.230
 network administrator has to be 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.840
 very effective is to solve this problem 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.299
 the security control or firewall is 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.879
 say you have to try to avoid that 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.370
 have attacks either from outside the 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.310
 internet or from within the network the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.260
 Most attacks are launched from 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.970
 within the network and how it is 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.000
 they detect is because the network has put 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.340
 very slow in that case the administrator 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.530
 it has to be able to isolate the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.850
 problem and take corrective action 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.430
 immediately 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.080
 it can also be the configuration of 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.080
 cisco switches and routers look sometimes 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.650
 when a company has many 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.990
 branches the frauds and switches 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.550
 they are left out ie they are left towards 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.500
 the one of the true company are 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.470
 administered by the people who are 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.600
 giving the service whether haiti anti 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.210
 clear or verizon but the frauds and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.520
 switches that are internal to the company 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.920
 then he is the administrator of the network 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.920
 that you have to do that configuration and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.960
 it is possible that it is directed from some 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.270
 way by the company that is giving you 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.740
 the service of the one but in the end it is the 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.680
 network administrator who has to 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.840
 configure it and especially that you have to 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.150
 diagnose any problem that has 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.790
 like this talk and switches and take 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.500
 immediate corrective action in the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.460
 next videos let's see some 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.680
 specific examples 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.080
 the teams that are in a network and 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.420
 also from some of the functions that 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.250
 run the administrator so that you 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.250
 see in a practical way
