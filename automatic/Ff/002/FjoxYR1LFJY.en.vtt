00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
look at the setup I basically went to a

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.490 
look at the setup I basically went to a
squat<00:01:39.580> rack<00:01:39.790> I<00:01:40.090> put<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:40.900> Olympic<00:01:41.290> bar

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
there's actually 205 pounds on here so

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.010 
there's actually 205 pounds on here so
there's<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.950> 35<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.580> inside<00:01:45.909> it's<00:01:46.570> 45

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
there's a 35 on the inside it's 45

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.620 
there's a 35 on the inside it's 45
outside<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:48.130> put<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.460> band<00:01:48.729> around<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.170 
outside and I put the band around the
bar<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.290> now<00:01:50.320> we<00:01:51.130> got<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.400> on<00:01:51.520> both<00:01:51.640> sides

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180

what<00:01:56.770> it's<00:01:56.890> going<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.100> do<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:57.670> going<00:01:57.700> to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
what it's going to do is it's going to

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.330 
what it's going to do is it's going to
allow<00:01:57.880> me<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.659> do<00:01:58.840> was<00:01:59.530> possibly<00:02:00.070> one<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
allow me to do was possibly one of the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.610 
allow me to do was possibly one of the
greatest<00:02:00.960> exercises<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.080> possibly<00:02:02.440> do

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
greatest exercises you can possibly do

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.030 
greatest exercises you can possibly do
the<00:02:03.220> vent<00:02:04.120> over<00:02:04.299> row<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.440> bent<00:02:05.620> over<00:02:05.770> row

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
the vent over row and the bent over row

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.009 
the vent over row and the bent over row
is<00:02:06.430> somewhat<00:02:07.390> of<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.540> difficult<00:02:07.720> exercise

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
is somewhat of a difficult exercise

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.160 
is somewhat of a difficult exercise
because<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.890> will<00:02:09.250> compromise<00:02:09.660> bad<00:02:10.660> form<00:02:11.049> will

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
because it will compromise bad form will

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.870 
because it will compromise bad form will
compromise<00:02:11.530> how<00:02:12.100> much<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.370> can<00:02:12.459> lift<00:02:12.640> and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
compromise how much you can lift and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.050 
compromise how much you can lift and
also<00:02:13.510> set<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.230> up<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.380> injury<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.489> we<00:02:15.970> know

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
also set you up for injury and we know

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
also set you up for injury and we know
that<00:02:16.209> low<00:02:16.360> backs<00:02:16.630> are<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.200> know<00:02:17.290> commonly

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
that low backs are you know commonly

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.039 
that low backs are you know commonly
injured<00:02:18.190> especially<00:02:18.790> with<00:02:18.880> bad<00:02:19.090> posture<00:02:19.420> so

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
injured especially with bad posture so

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.020 
injured especially with bad posture so
let's<00:02:20.680> say<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.890> was<00:02:21.070> down<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.670> hardest

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
let's say I was down here the hardest

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.560 
let's say I was down here the hardest

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
me at the hardest part of the motion

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.850 
me at the hardest part of the motion
which<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.880> down<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.989> get<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.350> going

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
which is down here to get it going

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.890 
which is down here to get it going
once<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.580> pass<00:02:36.850> through<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.450> neutral

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
position here I'll be able to still

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.839 
position here I'll be able to still
squeeze<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.440> up<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:42.160> no<00:02:42.400> more<00:02:42.550> help<00:02:42.760> from

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
the bands and that's fine because we

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
the bands and that's fine because we
want<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.860> be<00:02:44.950> able<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.130> have

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
peak contraction at the top without the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.400 
peak contraction at the top without the
assistance<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> band<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:50.110> sort<00:02:50.380> of
