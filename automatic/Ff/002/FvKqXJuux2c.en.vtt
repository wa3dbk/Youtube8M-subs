shot is brilliant really really fun and

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.460 
shot is brilliant really really fun and
at<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.150> end<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.389> day<00:04:10.510> if<00:04:10.750> you've<00:04:11.200> got<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
at the end of the day if you've got the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.920 
at the end of the day if you've got the
ball<00:04:11.650> your<00:04:12.370> opponent<00:04:12.819> can't<00:04:13.030> score<00:04:13.389> it's

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
ball your opponent can't score it's

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.210 
ball your opponent can't score it's
simple<00:04:14.319> as<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.470> I'd<00:04:14.680> like<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.859> do<00:04:14.950> something

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
simple as that I'd like to do something

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.490 
simple as that I'd like to do something
very<00:04:15.250> very<00:04:15.519> silly<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:16.060> it's<00:04:16.389> it's<00:04:17.139> what<00:04:17.380> you

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
very very silly but it's it's what you

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.810 
very very silly but it's it's what you
want<00:04:17.769> in<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.070> team<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.489> think<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.789> really

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
want in a team and I think it really

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.599 
want in a team and I think it really
works<00:04:19.030> for<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.139> new<00:04:20.349> patch<00:04:20.590> because<00:04:20.859> the

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
works for this new patch because the

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.029 
works for this new patch because the
strikers<00:04:22.090> are<00:04:22.120> both<00:04:22.390> bulky<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.169> quick<00:04:23.710> enough

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
strikers are both bulky and quick enough

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.460 
strikers are both bulky and quick enough
to<00:04:24.909> over-the-top<00:04:25.599> through<00:04:25.900> ball

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
to over-the-top through ball

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.920 
to over-the-top through ball
they're<00:04:26.680> also<00:04:26.950> good<00:04:27.670> enough<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.210> dribble<00:04:28.630> past

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
they're also good enough to dribble past

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.020 
they're also good enough to dribble past
people<00:04:29.320> they've<00:04:29.410> got<00:04:29.590> these<00:04:29.770> skills<00:04:30.310> as<00:04:30.550> well

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
people they've got these skills as well

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.750 
people they've got these skills as well
and<00:04:31.360> they<00:04:32.320> have<00:04:32.500> high<00:04:32.710> attacking<00:04:33.310> work<00:04:33.460> rates

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
and they have high attacking work rates

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.400 
and they have high attacking work rates
not<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.390> mention<00:04:34.540> their<00:04:34.780> finishing<00:04:35.110> is

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
not to mention their finishing is

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.320 
not to mention their finishing is
brilliant<00:04:35.980> that<00:04:36.100> was<00:04:36.250> nearing<00:04:36.850> goal<00:04:37.090> like

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
brilliant that was nearing goal like

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.810 
brilliant that was nearing goal like
probably<00:04:37.870> neues<00:04:38.290> felt<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.590> be<00:04:38.620> fair<00:04:38.860> but<00:04:39.070> it's

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
probably neues felt to be fair but it's

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.810 
probably neues felt to be fair but it's
really<00:04:40.390> good<00:04:40.600> even<00:04:41.080> against<00:04:41.380> super<00:04:42.070> super

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
really good even against super super

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.490 
really good even against super super
strong<00:04:43.060> teams<00:04:43.360> like<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:43.750> guy<00:04:43.960> had<00:04:44.230> a

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
in this formation of course you could

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.800 
in this formation of course you could
throw<00:04:58.600> them<00:04:58.930> at<00:04:59.110> stryker<00:04:59.950> if<00:05:00.280> you're<00:05:00.460> feeling

it's really open my own so actually like
I'd<00:05:14.170> never<00:05:14.200> thought<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:15.070> using<00:05:15.790> this

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
I'd never thought of using this

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.670 
I'd never thought of using this
formation<00:05:16.300> after<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.930> patch<00:05:17.110> because<00:05:17.380> before

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
formation after the patch because before

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.620 
formation after the patch because before
a<00:05:17.740> batch<00:05:17.980> I<00:05:18.250> don't<00:05:18.640> like<00:05:18.790> it<00:05:19.000> that<00:05:19.060> much<00:05:19.180> but

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
a batch I don't like it that much but

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.970
