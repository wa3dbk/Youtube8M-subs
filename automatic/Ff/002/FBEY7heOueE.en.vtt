just walking up the a string to the B's

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.190 
just walking up the a string to the B's
here<00:01:22.230> going<00:01:23.230> open<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.680> 1st<00:01:24.580> fret<00:01:25.020> 2nd<00:01:26.020> fret<00:01:26.670> b7

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
here going open a 1st fret 2nd fret b7

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.690 
here going open a 1st fret 2nd fret b7
in<00:01:29.200> context<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:29.830> would<00:01:29.980> throw<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.430> in<00:01:30.610> the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
in context you would throw this in the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.820 
in context you would throw this in the
last<00:01:30.880> measure<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.690> last<00:01:32.080> four<00:01:32.350> bars<00:01:32.590> that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
last measure so the last four bars that

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:42.469 
last measure so the last four bars that
we<00:01:32.920> did<00:01:33.159> were<00:01:33.460> B<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:37.530> B<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.390> B<00:01:40.420> again

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
we did were B a B and then the B again

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.120 
we did were B a B and then the B again
so<00:01:43.479> I'm<00:01:43.659> actually<00:01:43.870> replacing<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.710> last<00:01:44.920> B

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
so I'm actually replacing that last B

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.840 
so I'm actually replacing that last B
with<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:45.880> turnaround<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.260> get<00:01:47.440> B<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
with this turnaround so I to get B a and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.760 
with this turnaround so I to get B a and
then<00:01:52.000> he

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.100 

and<00:01:55.770> let's<00:01:56.100> turn<00:01:56.220> around<00:01:56.810> another<00:01:57.810> thing<00:01:58.020> we

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and let's turn around another thing we

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649 
and let's turn around another thing we
could<00:01:58.200> add<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.800> slight<00:01:59.100> variation<00:01:59.670> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
could add to this slight variation this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.540 
could add to this slight variation this
one<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.020> probably<00:02:01.380> use<00:02:01.560> predominantly

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
one you would probably use predominantly

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.010 
one you would probably use predominantly
through<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.760> blues<00:02:02.970> song<00:02:03.180> especially<00:02:03.690> during

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
through a blues song especially during

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.420 
through a blues song especially during
solos<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.590> stuff<00:02:04.800> like<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.220> kind<00:02:05.400> of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
solos and stuff like that it kind of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.640 
solos and stuff like that it kind of
cues<00:02:05.670> people<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.150> where<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.420> form<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
cues people to where the form is and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.190 
cues people to where the form is and
it's<00:02:07.800> useful<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:09.240> help<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.570> people<00:02:09.630> kind<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's useful to help other people kind of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.230 
it's useful to help other people kind of
know<00:02:10.320> where<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.709> if<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:10.890> get<00:02:11.039> lost<00:02:11.240> hard

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
know where you are if they get lost hard

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.840 
know where you are if they get lost hard
to<00:02:12.300> do<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> blues<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.020> happens<00:02:13.850> the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
to do in the blues but it happens the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.460 
to do in the blues but it happens the
last<00:02:15.030> thing<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.900> variation<00:02:16.140> will<00:02:16.380> add

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
last thing is so this variation will add

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.780 
last thing is so this variation will add
in<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:16.920> actually<00:02:17.220> gonna<00:02:17.490> add<00:02:17.640> some

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
in here I'm actually gonna add some

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.180 
in here I'm actually gonna add some
sixth<00:02:18.180> intervals<00:02:18.570> which<00:02:19.200> look<00:02:19.440> like<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.920> I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
sixth intervals which look like this I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
sixth intervals which look like this I
prefer<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.940> use<00:02:21.030> my<00:02:21.120> second<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.900> third<00:02:21.930> finger

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
prefer to use my second and third finger

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.870 
prefer to use my second and third finger
but<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.830> could<00:02:23.010> also<00:02:23.130> use<00:02:23.340> your<00:02:23.370> first<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
but you could also use your first and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.479 
but you could also use your first and
second<00:02:24.320> in<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.500> case<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:26.010> am<00:02:26.100> putting<00:02:26.310> my

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
second in this case I am putting my

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.640 
second in this case I am putting my
second<00:02:27.060> finger<00:02:27.239> on<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> g<00:02:27.480> string<00:02:27.660> my<00:02:28.380> third

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
second finger on the g string my third

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.600 
second finger on the g string my third
finger<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> high<00:02:29.280> E<00:02:29.310> string<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.959> am

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
finger on the high E string and I am

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.190 
finger on the high E string and I am
picking<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.630> use<00:02:33.840> your<00:02:33.989> pick

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
picking like this you can use your pick

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.110 
picking like this you can use your pick
if<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.709> use<00:02:34.920> your<00:02:35.070> pick<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.610> probably<00:02:35.970> will

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
if you use your pick you probably will

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.970 
if you use your pick you probably will
find<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.810> alternate<00:02:37.260> picking<00:02:37.410> works<00:02:37.680> best

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
find that alternate picking works best

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.160 
find that alternate picking works best
in<00:02:38.790> which<00:02:38.970> case<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.420> will<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.570> picking<00:02:39.840> down

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
in which case you will be picking down

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.310 
in which case you will be picking down
on<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.100> g<00:02:41.280> string<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.080> high<00:02:43.290> E

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
on the g string and up on the high E

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.410 
on the g string and up on the high E
string<00:02:43.500> I'm<00:02:44.489> kind<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.700> doing<00:02:44.790> triplets<00:02:45.269> here

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
string I'm kind of doing triplets here

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.780 
string I'm kind of doing triplets here
so<00:02:45.570> it's<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.780> 1<00:02:46.170> triplet<00:02:46.560> 2<00:02:46.860> triplet<00:02:47.130> 3

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
so it's like 1 triplet 2 triplet 3

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.790 
so it's like 1 triplet 2 triplet 3
triplet<00:02:48.180> getting<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.200> kind<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.440> rhythm

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
triplet getting that kind of rhythm

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.190 
triplet getting that kind of rhythm
I<00:02:51.370> prefer<00:02:51.970> use<00:02:52.120> hybrid<00:02:52.360> picking<00:02:52.810> which<00:02:52.990> is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
I prefer use hybrid picking which is

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.650 
I prefer use hybrid picking which is
actually<00:02:53.680> combining<00:02:54.010> my<00:02:54.280> finger<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.060> my<00:02:55.360> pic

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
actually combining my finger and my pic

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.750 
actually combining my finger and my pic
together<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.500> I'm<00:02:56.650> using<00:02:56.830> my<00:02:57.070> pick<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
together so I'm using my pick on the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.480 
together so I'm using my pick on the
g-string<00:02:58.260> exclusively<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.530> my<00:02:59.920> second

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
g-string exclusively and my second

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.130 
g-string exclusively and my second
finger<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.850> high<00:03:01.060> E<00:03:01.090> string<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.660> I'm

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
finger on the high E string and I'm

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.660 
finger on the high E string and I'm
doing<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.440> same<00:03:02.620> rhythm<00:03:05.400> what<00:03:06.400> I'm<00:03:06.490> doing

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
doing the same rhythm what I'm doing

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.100 
doing the same rhythm what I'm doing
from<00:03:06.760> there<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.120> I'm<00:03:07.270> actually<00:03:07.540> sliding<00:03:07.840> into

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
from there is I'm actually sliding into

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.500 
from there is I'm actually sliding into
that<00:03:08.320> no<00:03:08.470> from<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.770> half-step<00:03:09.250> below<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.420> I'm

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
that no from a half-step below so I'm

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.000 
that no from a half-step below so I'm
starting<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.900> third<00:03:10.960> fret<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.680> sliding

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
starting on the third fret and sliding

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.610 
starting on the third fret and sliding
into<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.220> fourth

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
into the fourth

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.550 
into the fourth
and<00:03:13.709> then<00:03:14.250> doing<00:03:14.370> interplay<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.560> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
and then doing interplay so I get that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.140 
and then doing interplay so I get that
I'm<00:03:16.680> going<00:03:16.890> back<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.129> half<00:03:17.370> step<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.940> third

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
I'm going back a half step to the third

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.089 
I'm going back a half step to the third
fret<00:03:19.220> into<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.340> second<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.230> I'm<00:03:22.379> adding

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
fret into the second and then I'm adding

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.490 
fret into the second and then I'm adding
a<00:03:23.190> hammer<00:03:23.519> on<00:03:23.760> here

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
a hammer on here

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.990 
a hammer on here
hammer<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> technique<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.459> may<00:03:26.760> or<00:03:26.970> may

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
hammer on is a technique you may or may

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.220 
hammer on is a technique you may or may
not<00:03:27.150> be<00:03:27.300> familiar<00:03:27.450> with<00:03:27.720> depending<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.170> how

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
not be familiar with depending on how

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.449 
not be familiar with depending on how
long<00:03:28.319> you've<00:03:28.470> been<00:03:28.500> playing

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
long you've been playing

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.880 
long you've been playing
what<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.360> anytime<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:31.110> want<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> play<00:03:31.860> a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
what it is is anytime I want to play a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.800 
what it is is anytime I want to play a
note<00:03:32.099> without<00:03:32.700> using<00:03:33.209> my<00:03:33.330> pick

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
note without using my pick

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.559 
note without using my pick
I<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:34.620> hammer<00:03:34.890> my<00:03:35.129> finger<00:03:35.430> into<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.760> hence<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
I can hammer my finger into it hence the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.449 
I can hammer my finger into it hence the
name<00:03:36.660> amuro's<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.040> case<00:03:38.250> you're

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
name amuro's so in this case you're

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.520 
name amuro's so in this case you're
hammering<00:03:38.879> from<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.450> open<00:03:39.750> g<00:03:39.930> string<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
hammering from the open g string to the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.160 
hammering from the open g string to the
first<00:03:40.769> fret<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.629> then<00:03:42.629> you're<00:03:42.750> picking<00:03:43.049> the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
first fret and then you're picking the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.580 
first fret and then you're picking the
open<00:03:43.470> e<00:03:43.790> all<00:03:44.790> together<00:03:45.150> we<00:03:45.299> did<00:03:47.329> then<00:03:48.329> your

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
open e all together we did then your

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.990 
open e all together we did then your
your<00:03:49.590> same<00:03:49.799> walk-up<00:03:50.220> at<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> very<00:03:50.579> end<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.849> it

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
your same walk-up at the very end of it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.970 
your same walk-up at the very end of it
once<00:03:51.840> again

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.990 

now<00:03:56.980> I'll<00:03:57.070> do<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.250> one<00:03:57.370> time<00:03:57.520> kind<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.820> slow

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
now I'll do it one time kind of slow

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.520 
now I'll do it one time kind of slow
just<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.450> can<00:03:58.570> kind<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.810> break<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.290> down<00:03:59.380> if

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
just so you can kind of break it down if

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:08.120 
just so you can kind of break it down if
you<00:03:59.560> need<00:03:59.620> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.070 

in<00:04:08.700> context<00:04:09.240> it's<00:04:09.360> going<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.750> exact

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
in context it's going to go in the exact

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.750 
in context it's going to go in the exact
same<00:04:10.260> place<00:04:10.560> you're<00:04:11.070> gonna<00:04:11.160> take<00:04:11.490> out<00:04:11.610> that

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
same place you're gonna take out that

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.280 
same place you're gonna take out that
last<00:04:12.000> measure<00:04:12.300> of<00:04:12.390> b5<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.110> you're<00:04:13.200> gonna

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
last measure of b5 and you're gonna

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.960 
last measure of b5 and you're gonna
throw<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.710> in<00:04:13.920> there<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.940> you'd<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.750> B

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
throw this in there so you'd have the B

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.590 
throw this in there so you'd have the B
okay

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.570 

I'm<00:04:24.140> sorry<00:04:24.380> actually<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.890> isn't<00:04:25.010> exactly<00:04:25.220> the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
I'm sorry actually it isn't exactly the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.010 
I'm sorry actually it isn't exactly the
