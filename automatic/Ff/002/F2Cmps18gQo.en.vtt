00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.100 
begin as I leaned back in my chair and
look<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> calendar<00:01:30.979> June<00:01:31.979> 1st<00:01:32.540> 2015<00:01:33.540> it's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
look at the calendar June 1st 2015 it's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.060 
look at the calendar June 1st 2015 it's
going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.530> run<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:34.920> June<00:01:35.189> 1st<00:01:35.579> until<00:01:36.500> June<00:01:37.500> 15

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.860 
sightseeing we got to do a little bit in
Boulder<00:04:52.370> but<00:04:52.580> our<00:04:52.789> entire<00:04:53.120> road<00:04:53.419> trip<00:04:53.660> was

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
Boulder but our entire road trip was

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.350 
Boulder but our entire road trip was

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
just hotels and the highway at

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.290 
just hotels and the highway at
Interstate<00:04:56.840> 80<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.430> we're<00:04:58.789> gonna<00:04:58.910> take<00:04:59.150> it

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
Interstate 80 so we're gonna take it

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.990 
Interstate 80 so we're gonna take it
easier<00:04:59.750> this<00:04:59.960> time<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:01.400> we're<00:05:01.639> only<00:05:01.760> gonna

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
easier this time and we're only gonna

film<00:05:02.330> at<00:05:03.370> probably<00:05:04.370> only<00:05:04.610> ten<00:05:04.820> cars<00:05:05.740> that<00:05:06.740> will

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
film at probably only ten cars that will

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.400 
film at probably only ten cars that will
be<00:05:07.130> there<00:05:07.460> we<00:05:07.820> will<00:05:07.940> make<00:05:08.120> five<00:05:08.479> stops<00:05:08.900> in<00:05:09.169> five

a<00:06:07.310> sucker<00:06:07.550> for<00:06:07.669> ferries<00:06:08.240> although<00:06:08.630> I<00:06:08.659> don't

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900

so<00:06:11.830> four<00:06:12.830> stops<00:06:13.250> well<00:06:13.970> Florida<00:06:14.599> would<00:06:14.870> be<00:06:14.900> stop

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
so four stops well Florida would be stop

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.510 
so four stops well Florida would be stop
number<00:06:15.229> five<00:06:16.419> coming<00:06:17.419> all<00:06:17.659> the<00:06:17.780> way<00:06:17.810> down
