recently we started noticing a little
bit<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:18.170> it's<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.320> noise<00:00:19.800> coming<00:00:20.220> out<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.369> the

front suspension just driving real slow

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.900 
front suspension just driving real slow
through<00:00:23.849> a<00:00:23.880> gravel<00:00:24.179> parking<00:00:24.329> lot<00:00:24.599> right<00:00:24.749> now<00:00:24.900> I

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.100 

don't<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:33.060> if<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.270> guys<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.600> hear<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.810> but

don't know if you guys can hear that but

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100 
don't know if you guys can hear that but
a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> creaking<00:00:35.910> noise<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.570> then

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
a little bit of creaking noise and then

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.190 
a little bit of creaking noise and then
when<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:37.920> hit<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.370> bigger<00:00:38.550> bumps<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.990> kind

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
when we hit some bigger bumps get kind

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.400 
when we hit some bigger bumps get kind
of<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.350> thunk<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:41.330> kind<00:00:42.330> of<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> dull<00:00:42.750> honking

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
of a thunk or kind of a dull honking

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.140 
of a thunk or kind of a dull honking
noise<00:00:45.650> and<00:00:46.650> I<00:00:46.740> think<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> might<00:00:47.310> be<00:00:47.340> sway<00:00:47.910> bar

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
noise and I think it might be sway bar

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.580 
noise and I think it might be sway bar
related<00:00:48.950> but<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.190> don't<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.210> sure<00:00:51.590> I'm

if we go down here in here for some
light<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:10.100> move<00:02:10.310> this<00:02:17.290> definitely

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
light so we move this definitely

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.720 
light so we move this definitely
somewhere<00:02:18.680> there<00:02:20.019> so<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.080> don't<00:02:21.170> know<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.730> just

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
somewhere there so I don't know if just

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.600 
somewhere there so I don't know if just
this<00:02:23.060> sway<00:02:23.510> bar<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.440> bad<00:02:24.769> I'm<00:02:25.070> not<00:02:25.130> sure<00:02:25.459> how

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
this sway bar is bad I'm not sure how

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.370 
this sway bar is bad I'm not sure how
it's<00:02:25.760> sold<00:02:29.320> but<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:31.450> think<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.570> this<00:02:33.170> piece

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
it's sold but I think it's this piece

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.690 
it's sold but I think it's this piece
right<00:02:33.650> here

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.080 

it's<00:02:37.360> bad<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.460> there's<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.520> bulb<00:02:39.700> here<00:02:39.760> on<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
it's bad so there's a bulb here on the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.110 
it's bad so there's a bulb here on the
back<00:02:40.240> side<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:42.430> then<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.270> bolt<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
back side and then a bolt up here so a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.870 
back side and then a bolt up here so a
bar

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
bar

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.699 
bar
take<00:02:48.880> take<00:02:49.420> run<00:02:49.840> over<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> other<00:02:50.230> side<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
take take run over to the other side and

00:02:50.709 --> 00:03:02.670 
take take run over to the other side and
show<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:55.680> here's<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.740> other<00:02:56.950> side<00:02:57.959> and<00:03:01.680> that

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
show you here's the other side and that

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.660 
show you here's the other side and that
side<00:03:04.050> no<00:03:05.050> play<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.489> definitely<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.640> other

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
side no play so definitely the other

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.290 
side no play so definitely the other
side<00:03:10.000> needs<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.270> be<00:03:10.360> replaced<00:03:11.520> I'll<00:03:12.520> check<00:03:13.270> to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
side needs to be replaced I'll check to
