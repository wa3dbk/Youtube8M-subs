00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.810
 the zf practice tests 2014 on the 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.120
 test bench 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.219
 the most popular bands of the german 10 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.679
 Family transporter press on one 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.209
 independent reader jury all notes are 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:22.449
 distributed and here the result 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:24.310
 9th place of the mazda5 has been developed since 2005 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.439
 the mazda 5 becomes a real one 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.359
 success model of japan also the 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.009
 Of course, current generation has 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.719
 standard the practical sliding doors 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.579
 and a flexible seating system is the basis 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.110
 comes as a five-seater at the two 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.430
 other equipments are two 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 additional seats then series 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.879
 I have three children always great 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.340
 Sliding rear doors because you do not have 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.109
 the problem in the tight parking spaces or 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.960
 that you have to pay attention to the cars 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.910
 next door despite sliding doors belongs the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.719
 mazda at the static rating too 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.620
 the lose 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.640
 but there are also a lob interior 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.570
 I succeed 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.250
 he is airy or how to get out of it 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.600
 the operability and variability 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.909
 the readers' jury thinks well and can do that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.920
 here to the armrest makes the middle 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.020
 Part fold away and that's one 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.520
 particularity 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.380
 negatively the testers are the small ones 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 luggage compartment missing storage options 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.049
 and the quality in the interior 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.940
 patina plastic is shaking many thirds 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.680
 also fell the entrance in front and the 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.730
 Seats are in need of improvement 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.210
 mazda5 so the tester is big that's real 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.510
 problems 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.350
 I would already have my foot pedals 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.490
 push past 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.260
 to get out at keyboard on the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.180
 highway the mazda 5 readers came 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.910
 tester not impressive shows here 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.190
 many weaken the outside noise 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.210
 wind and through the tires are still 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.210
 not to lead there 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.560
 the readers see a need for optimization 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.100
 tester at engine shutdown and the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.810
 Chassis tuning of the Japanese 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.860
 It was the first with real Spain 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.680
 Chassis we had to go 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.530
 he's strong with his big ones 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.700
 live weight to fight the six gears 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.320
 comes I knew about switching back 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.450
 wants to come double-wing high so 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.250
 that suits you last when handling 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.830
 the mazda can compete with the competitors 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.720
 No more make up for agility and 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.720
 fractional get rather bad notes 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.870
 handling in short he is very sporty 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.930
 Both many know the puff of the gross 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.730
 the motto of the hood of the mazda5 has to be 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.769
 especially in color evaluations of 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.769
 stronger competition
