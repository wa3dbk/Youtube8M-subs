notice is that the graphics look just a

notice is that the graphics look just a
little<00:01:41.820> bit<00:01:41.970> blurry<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> didn't<00:01:43.049> create

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
little bit blurry now I didn't create

this<00:01:43.320> map<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.770> downloaded<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.399> off<00:01:44.640> the

this map I downloaded this off the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.300 
this map I downloaded this off the

again in the description if I can find
them<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.180> I've<00:01:51.329> had<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.750> image<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
them because I've had this image for a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.499 
them because I've had this image for a
while<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:53.159> basically<00:01:53.640> you'll<00:01:54.000> run<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.299> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
while but basically you'll run into this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.090 
while but basically you'll run into this
problem<00:01:54.840> where<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> graphics<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.770> look<00:01:55.979> as

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
problem where the graphics don't look as

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499 
problem where the graphics don't look as
sharp<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.670> did<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> native

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
sharp as they did at the native

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.810 
sharp as they did at the native
resolution<00:01:58.189> so<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> native

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
resolution so this is the native

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.100 
resolution so this is the native
resolution<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.479> image<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.869> if<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.049> turn

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
resolution of that image and if I turn

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
resolution of that image and if I turn
the<00:02:01.439> snap<00:02:01.649> off<00:02:01.860> you'll<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.640> looks<00:02:02.820> great

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the snap off you'll see it looks great

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.149 
the snap off you'll see it looks great
