this<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.530> our<00:00:01.680> larva<00:00:02.040> bands<00:00:02.280> we've<00:00:02.580> got<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:03.030> set

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
this is our larva bands we've got to set

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.249 
this is our larva bands we've got to set
up<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.600> year<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.460> we<00:00:05.460> did<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> modification

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
up this year and we did a modification

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.680 
up this year and we did a modification
today<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.490> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> help<00:00:09.030> us<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.300> as

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
today that is going to help us out as

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.289 
today that is going to help us out as
far<00:00:09.960> as<00:00:11.059> to<00:00:12.059> keep<00:00:12.240> from<00:00:12.450> losing<00:00:12.740> larva<00:00:14.299> we've

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
far as to keep from losing larva we've

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.420 
far as to keep from losing larva we've
had<00:00:15.570> as<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.049> see<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.100> our<00:00:17.279> original

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
had as you see here this is our original

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.689 
had as you see here this is our original
diverter<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.230> see<00:00:19.410> there<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.369> original

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
diverter like you see there the original

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.099 
diverter like you see there the original
diverter<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> stain

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
diverter as you can see with the stain

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.970 
diverter as you can see with the stain
they<00:00:22.380> were<00:00:22.439> crawling<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> corner<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
they were crawling up at the corner and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.679 
they were crawling up at the corner and
on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.279> other<00:00:26.460> side<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:28.140> made<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> taller

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
on the other side so we made a taller

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.380 
on the other side so we made a taller
diverter<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:32.279> screwed<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> tighter<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
diverter and we screwed it tighter to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
diverter and we screwed it tighter to
the<00:00:33.540> plywood<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:34.980> can't<00:00:35.219> crawl

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the plywood so that they can't crawl

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.490 
the plywood so that they can't crawl
underneath<00:00:35.730> there<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.329> strongly<00:00:36.690> Carl

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
underneath there pretty strongly Carl

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.810 
underneath there pretty strongly Carl
pretty<00:00:37.739> hard<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.960> today<00:00:39.960> they're<00:00:40.820> right

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pretty hard and today they're right

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.900 
pretty hard and today they're right
there<00:00:42.920> now<00:00:43.920> I've<00:00:44.100> gotten<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> lot<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.610> questions

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
there now I've gotten a lot of questions

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.680 
there now I've gotten a lot of questions
about<00:00:45.329> how<00:00:45.690> much<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.110> harvest<00:00:46.920> every<00:00:47.219> day<00:00:47.690> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
about how much I harvest every day it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.209 
about how much I harvest every day it
all<00:00:48.930> depends<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> weather<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
all depends on the weather if it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.610 
all depends on the weather if it's
really<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.820> warm<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.199> bin<00:00:52.379> gets

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
really really warm and the bin gets

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.720 
really really warm and the bin gets
really<00:00:52.829> warm<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.250> lot<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> mature<00:00:54.629> larvae

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
really warm a lot of the mature larvae

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.080 
really warm a lot of the mature larvae
decide<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.360> time<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.820> this

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
decide it's time to go and so in this

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.119 
decide it's time to go and so in this
pot<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.170> probably<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> thousand<00:01:02.010> down

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
pot we probably have a thousand down

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.340 
pot we probably have a thousand down
there<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.210> far<00:01:03.420> we'll<00:01:03.690> probably<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> bunch

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
there so far we'll probably get a bunch

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.070 
there so far we'll probably get a bunch
tonight<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.979> mean<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.450> they're<00:01:06.869> boiling

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
tonight I mean we there they're boiling

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.179 
tonight I mean we there they're boiling
away<00:01:09.830> there's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> little<00:01:11.010> bit<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.310> there

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.690 

now<00:01:16.090> this<00:01:16.299> bin<00:01:16.539> probably<00:01:17.140> has<00:01:17.700> approximately

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
now this bin probably has approximately

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.950 
now this bin probably has approximately
a<00:01:19.299> hundred<00:01:19.659> thousand<00:01:20.409> larva<00:01:20.710> in<00:01:20.829> it<00:01:21.840> give<00:01:22.840> or

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
a hundred thousand larva in it give or

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.950 
a hundred thousand larva in it give or
take<00:01:23.109> a<00:01:23.289> hundred<00:01:23.469> thousand<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:25.060> has<00:01:25.719> got

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
take a hundred thousand it has got

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.209 
take a hundred thousand it has got
plenty<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:27.179> we<00:01:28.179> feed<00:01:28.539> it<00:01:28.719> probably<00:01:31.859> two<00:01:32.859> to

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
plenty and we feed it probably two to

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.169 
plenty and we feed it probably two to
three<00:01:33.250> gallons<00:01:33.819> of<00:01:34.149> love<00:01:35.369> spent<00:01:36.369> barley<00:01:36.849> a<00:01:36.880> day

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
three gallons of love spent barley a day

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.630 
three gallons of love spent barley a day
I<00:01:37.450> do<00:01:38.079> throw<00:01:38.409> some<00:01:38.649> produce<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.130> there<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.609> I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
I do throw some produce in there and I

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.089 
I do throw some produce in there and I
do<00:01:39.700> throw<00:01:40.119> some<00:01:40.359> bread<00:01:40.599> in<00:01:40.780> there<00:01:41.020> one<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
do throw some bread in there one of the

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:43.199 
do throw some bread in there one of the
things<00:01:42.219> you<00:01:42.310> got<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.429> watch<00:01:42.609> out<00:01:42.819> for<00:01:42.969> is<00:01:43.090> you

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
things you got to watch out for is you

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.649 
things you got to watch out for is you
want<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.569> bin<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.959> be<00:01:44.079> hot<00:01:44.969> they<00:01:45.969> prefer<00:01:46.630> it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
want this bin to be hot they prefer it

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.389 
want this bin to be hot they prefer it
to<00:01:46.899> be<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.079> hundred<00:01:47.289> degrees<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.799> their<00:01:47.920> compost

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
to be a hundred degrees in their compost

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.899 
to be a hundred degrees in their compost
so<00:01:49.209> when<00:01:49.659> you<00:01:49.780> set<00:01:49.989> up<00:01:50.020> your<00:01:50.170> bin<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.670> want<00:01:51.819> to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
so when you set up your bin you want to

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.559 
so when you set up your bin you want to
set<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.179> in<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.390> Sun<00:01:53.099> this<00:01:54.099> one<00:01:54.340> gets<00:01:54.610> got

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
set it in the Sun this one gets got

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.649 
set it in the Sun this one gets got
trees<00:01:55.840> on<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> east<00:01:56.349> side<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:56.619> we<00:01:57.310> get

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
trees on the east side so we get

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.850 
trees on the east side so we get
afternoon<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.869> evening<00:01:59.170> Sun<00:01:59.409> when<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.679> days

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
afternoon and evening Sun when the days

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.619 
afternoon and evening Sun when the days
warmed<00:02:00.219> up<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.549> this<00:02:00.700> bin<00:02:00.879> gets<00:02:01.090> pretty<00:02:01.299> hot

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:03.629 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:07.529 

and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:05.829> to<00:02:06.489> keep<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.849> hot<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.209> got<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.420> watch

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
and then to keep it hot you got to watch

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.050 
and then to keep it hot you got to watch
your<00:02:07.750> moisture<00:02:08.109> so<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.190> barley<00:02:09.489> here<00:02:09.670> is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
your moisture so the barley here is

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.170 
your moisture so the barley here is
moist<00:02:10.359> that<00:02:10.629> is<00:02:10.690> not<00:02:10.929> real<00:02:11.170> wet<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.879> my

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
moist that is not real wet if my

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.910 
moist that is not real wet if my
composter<00:02:13.750> gets<00:02:13.959> too<00:02:14.109> dry<00:02:14.349> I'll<00:02:14.530> put<00:02:14.739> some

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
composter gets too dry I'll put some

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.890 
composter gets too dry I'll put some
fruit<00:02:15.099> in<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.879> if<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.299> gets<00:02:16.450> too<00:02:16.629> wet

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
fruit in it and if it gets too wet

a<00:02:42.489> day<00:02:42.660> another<00:02:43.660> modification<00:02:44.019> we<00:02:44.380> did<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.620> our

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
a day another modification we did to our

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.699 
a day another modification we did to our
band<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.160> put<00:02:45.849> a<00:02:45.880> circle<00:02:46.299> up<00:02:46.450> on<00:02:46.630> top<00:02:46.930> just

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
band is we put a circle up on top just

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.020 
band is we put a circle up on top just
so<00:02:47.859> that<00:02:48.010> they<00:02:48.099> learn<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.430> get<00:02:48.579> so<00:02:48.760> close<00:02:48.970> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
so that they learn to get so close to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.020 
so that they learn to get so close to
the<00:02:49.299> edge<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:50.620> make<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.859> into<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.280> tote<00:02:51.519> so

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the edge to make it into the tote so

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.460 
the edge to make it into the tote so
togas<00:02:52.389> been<00:02:52.540> drifting<00:02:52.720> away<00:02:53.019> from<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.380> edge

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
togas been drifting away from the edge

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.550 
togas been drifting away from the edge
and<00:02:54.450> then<00:02:55.450> although<00:02:55.599> stop<00:02:55.959> are<00:02:56.169> here<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.440> keep

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and then although stop are here to keep

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.289 
and then although stop are here to keep
from<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.859> keep<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.310> lid<00:02:57.519> from<00:02:57.639> closing<00:02:58.120> but

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
from the keep the lid from closing but

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.729 
from the keep the lid from closing but
closes<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.840> enough<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.139> the<00:02:59.230> chickens<00:02:59.560> don't

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
closes it enough so the chickens don't

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.250 
closes it enough so the chickens don't
get<00:02:59.859> in<00:02:59.950> there

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
get in there

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.229 
get in there
