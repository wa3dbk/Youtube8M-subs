your Mac so data transfer obviously but

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.750 
your Mac so data transfer obviously but
the<00:00:40.260> coax<00:00:40.559> cable<00:00:40.920> actually<00:00:41.190> allows<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.610> much

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the coax cable actually allows for much

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.729 
the coax cable actually allows for much
more<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> allows<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.110> plug<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.530> maybe

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
more it allows for you to plug in maybe

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.610 
more it allows for you to plug in maybe
your<00:00:43.950> existing<00:00:44.370> cable<00:00:44.730> or<00:00:44.930> maybe<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.079> video

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
your existing cable or maybe a video

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.709 
your existing cable or maybe a video
game<00:00:46.890> platform<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.390> wanted<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
game platform so if you wanted to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.840 
game platform so if you wanted to
capture<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:50.010> any<00:00:50.250> other<00:00:50.340> analog

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.119 
capture or a or other any other analog
input<00:00:51.270> such<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> VCR<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> wanted<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
input such as a VCR so if you wanted to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.209 
input such as a VCR so if you wanted to
capture<00:00:53.430> old<00:00:54.379> analog<00:00:55.379> content<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.980> could<00:00:56.129> do

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
capture old analog content you could do

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.990 
capture old analog content you could do
it<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.399> way<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.850> well<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> I'm<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.670> jump

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it that way as well so I'm going to jump

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700 
it that way as well so I'm going to jump
into<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> screencast<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.199> show<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
into a screencast now and show you the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.729 
into a screencast now and show you the
different<00:01:02.100> features<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.090> elgato<00:01:03.570> eyetv

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
different features of the elgato eyetv

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
different features of the elgato eyetv
once<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.890> hook<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:06.000> Mac<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
once you hook it up to your Mac and in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.030 
once you hook it up to your Mac and in
this<00:01:06.990> case<00:01:07.200> i'll<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> using<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.799> external

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
this case i'll be using an external

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
this case i'll be using an external
antenna<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.090> it'll<00:01:09.420> still<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> picking<00:01:10.020> up

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
antenna so it'll still be picking up

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
antenna so it'll still be picking up
over<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> air<00:01:10.619> content<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> won't<00:01:11.790> be

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
over the air content but it won't be

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
over the air content but it won't be
doing<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> antennas<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.530> because

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
doing just the antennas in here because

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.219 
doing just the antennas in here because
I<00:01:14.100> need<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.700> larger<00:01:15.060> antenna<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:16.049> some

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I need a larger antenna to get some

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
I need a larger antenna to get some
chance<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:16.979> let's<00:01:17.280> jump<00:01:17.520> over<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
chance for you so let's jump over to the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.840 
chance for you so let's jump over to the
mac<00:01:18.299> alright<00:01:19.020> guys<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.860> how<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.310> well

mac alright guys so this is how it well

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
mac alright guys so this is how it well
it<00:01:21.030> looks<00:01:21.060> something<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.960> when<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it looks something like this when you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
it looks something like this when you
start<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.740> gotta<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.759> channels

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
start it up gotta get these channels

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.320 
start it up gotta get these channels
here<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> auto<00:01:25.470> tune

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
here you're going to need to auto tune

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.370 
here you're going to need to auto tune
now<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.570> different<00:01:27.720> choices<00:01:28.080> for

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
now you have different choices for

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.270 
now you have different choices for
tuning<00:01:28.770> analog<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.640> tsc<00:01:30.390> cable<00:01:31.070> ATSC<00:01:32.070> for

digital and of course that's in the
united<00:01:34.200> states<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.189> press<00:01:35.369> auto-tune

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
united states you just press auto-tune

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
united states you just press auto-tune
you<00:01:36.509> press<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:37.140> advanced<00:01:37.439> settings

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you press that there's advanced settings

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.100 
you press that there's advanced settings
if<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.250> updates<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.360> wear<00:01:39.600> channels

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
if you want updates can wear channels

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800 
if you want updates can wear channels
will<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.290> added<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.950> removed<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.060> scan

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
will be added but not removed and a scan

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
will be added but not removed and a scan
that<00:01:43.020> will<00:01:43.259> scan<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.220> frequencies<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:44.820> just

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that will scan more frequencies not just

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.370 
that will scan more frequencies not just
the<00:01:45.210> standard<00:01:45.479> ones<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:45.960> take<00:01:46.140> much

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the standard ones it will take much

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.700 
the standard ones it will take much
longer<00:01:46.880> but<00:01:47.880> you'll<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.450> channels<00:01:48.780> most

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
longer but you'll get more channels most

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
longer but you'll get more channels most
likely<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.909> after<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.390> done<00:01:51.540> scanning

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
likely so after it's done scanning

starting<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.229> pull<00:02:09.530> back<00:02:09.800> because<00:02:10.190> it's

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
starting to pull back because it's

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.640 
starting to pull back because it's
actually<00:02:10.759> starting<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.150> remember<00:02:11.959> what<00:02:12.500> you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
actually starting to remember what you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.070 
actually starting to remember what you
were<00:02:12.830> watching<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:14.690> move<00:02:14.870> forward

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
were watching so I can move forward

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.840 
were watching so I can move forward
again<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.800> it'll<00:02:15.920> move<00:02:16.070> me<00:02:16.280> back<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
again and it'll move me back to the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.760 
again and it'll move me back to the
current<00:02:17.090> time<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.080> also<00:02:18.200> move<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.560> back

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
current time but I can also move it back

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.250 
current time but I can also move it back
and<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:20.510> opened<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.900> little<00:02:21.140> bit

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
and I just have this opened a little bit

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.990 
and I just have this opened a little bit
before<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.830> started<00:02:22.370> recording<00:02:22.640> too<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:22.940> I

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
before I started recording too so I

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.780 
before I started recording too so I
could<00:02:23.150> show<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:24.130> it'll<00:02:25.130> actually<00:02:25.340> and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
could show you this it'll actually and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.610 
could show you this it'll actually and
you<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:26.000> see<00:02:26.150> here<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:27.050> changing

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
you can see here that it's changing

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.770 
you can see here that it's changing
because<00:02:27.950> different<00:02:28.400> channels<00:02:29.120> have

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
because different channels have

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.720 
because different channels have
different<00:02:30.110> resolution<00:02:30.680> but<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> can<00:02:31.459> go<00:02:31.550> back

are<00:03:57.320> pretty<00:03:57.590> large<00:03:57.769> that<00:03:57.980> because<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.280> is

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
are pretty large that because this is

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
five gigabytes now remember quality is

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.980 
five gigabytes now remember quality is
not<00:04:11.540> going<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.780> be<00:04:11.930> as<00:04:12.139> good

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
not going to be as good

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.710 
not going to be as good
as<00:04:13.050> say<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.850> actual<00:04:15.320> digital<00:04:16.320> copy<00:04:16.620> +<00:04:16.920> HD

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
as say the actual digital copy + HD

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.030 
as say the actual digital copy + HD
that's<00:04:18.720> just<00:04:19.020> because<00:04:19.140> you're<00:04:19.470> capturing<00:04:19.890> it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
that's just because you're capturing it

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.340 
that's just because you're capturing it
over<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> air<00:04:20.520> so<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.030> by<00:04:21.780> no<00:04:21.840> means<00:04:22.170> is<00:04:22.320> it

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
over the air so it by no means is it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.810 
over the air so it by no means is it
going<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.680> be<00:04:22.800> perfect<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.670> does<00:04:23.790> look

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
going to be perfect but it does look

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.740 
going to be perfect but it does look
pretty<00:04:24.120> good<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:25.080> let's<00:04:25.350> pull<00:04:25.830> up<00:04:25.860> just<00:04:26.430> uh<00:04:27.030> I

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
pretty good so let's pull up just uh I

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:39.610 
pretty good so let's pull up just uh I
guess<00:04:28.500> an<00:04:28.650> episode<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.040> 24<00:04:34.100> go<00:04:35.100> fullscreen<00:04:35.430> and
