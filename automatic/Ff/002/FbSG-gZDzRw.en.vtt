00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
calculated through my macro calculator

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
calculated through my macro calculator
guide<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.760> you're<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> put

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
again you can change other things in

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
again you can change other things in
here<00:01:47.400> like<00:01:47.640> fiber<00:01:48.090> how<00:01:49.080> much<00:01:49.260> sugar<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> want

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
here like fiber how much sugar you want

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.170 
here like fiber how much sugar you want
to<00:01:49.830> limit<00:01:49.980> yourself<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.730> things<00:01:50.940> like

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to limit yourself to all things like

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.840 
to limit yourself to all things like
that<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.870> basically<00:01:52.110> gives<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.850> good

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that and it basically gives you a good

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.340 
that and it basically gives you a good
understanding<00:01:53.910> of<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.250> this<00:01:56.250> is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
understanding of what to go for this is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.820 
understanding of what to go for this is
basically<00:01:59.090> what<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.300> work<00:02:00.570> how<00:02:00.870> based<00:02:01.560> off

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
basically what they work how based off

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.650 
basically what they work how based off
their<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.250> many<00:02:02.460> wipeouts<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
their how many wipeouts you have this is

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.360 
their how many wipeouts you have this is
probably<00:02:04.050> something<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.500> might<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.830> no

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
probably something you might like no

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.580 
probably something you might like no
it's<00:02:05.970> not<00:02:06.150> very<00:02:06.330> accurate<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.050> I<00:02:07.080> wouldn't<00:02:07.380> use

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
it's not very accurate so I wouldn't use

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.040 
it's not very accurate so I wouldn't use
it<00:02:08.540> same<00:02:09.540> with<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.930> that<00:02:10.820> TD<00:02:11.820> in<00:02:12.240> calculation

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
it same with the that TD in calculation

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.260 
it same with the that TD in calculation
it's<00:02:13.230> not<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:13.830> accurate<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.580> will<00:02:14.760> dare<00:02:15.000> I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's not very accurate I will dare I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.540 
it's not very accurate I will dare I
would<00:02:15.630> ignore<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.320> basically<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:17.310> go

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
would ignore that and basically just go

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.150 
would ignore that and basically just go
off<00:02:17.700> what<00:02:17.970> you've<00:02:18.120> wiped<00:02:18.330> out<00:02:18.600> myself<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:20.070> I'm

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
off what you've wiped out myself so I'm

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.410 
off what you've wiped out myself so I'm
not<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> save<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.270> don't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
not going to save that because I don't

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.870 
not going to save that because I don't
mature<00:02:21.570> with<00:02:21.900> him<00:02:22.110> okay<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.370> food<00:02:23.640> tab

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
mature with him okay so on the food tab

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.000 
mature with him okay so on the food tab
here<00:02:24.120> you've<00:02:24.690> got<00:02:24.750> basically<00:02:25.110> meals<00:02:25.770> for<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
here you've got basically meals for the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.070 
here you've got basically meals for the
day<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.520> can<00:02:26.970> change<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.480> names<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.900> all

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
day now you can change the names of all

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.630

of<00:02:28.110> these<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.680> everyone<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.550> don't

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
following intermittent fasting so

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.090 
following intermittent fasting so
generally<00:02:51.390> i<00:02:51.420> do<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.900> breakfast<00:02:52.709> preserve

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
generally i do have breakfast preserve

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.910 
generally i do have breakfast preserve
but<00:02:53.489> i<00:02:53.640> will<00:02:53.880> have<00:02:54.060> meal<00:02:54.239> one<00:02:54.540> how'd<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.739> keep

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
but i will have meal one how'd you keep

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
but i will have meal one how'd you keep
them<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.670> because<00:02:56.880> i<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:57.209> i'm<00:02:57.570> doing

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
them like this because i know i'm doing

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
them like this because i know i'm doing
so<00:02:58.170> i'm<00:02:58.320> not<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.709> first<00:02:59.130> about<00:02:59.430> what

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
so i'm not really that first about what

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.990 
so i'm not really that first about what
it<00:02:59.760> says<00:03:00.830> one<00:03:01.830> thing<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.070> take<00:03:02.610> into<00:03:02.670> account

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
it says one thing to take into account

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.360 
it says one thing to take into account
is<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.330> intend<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.690> split<00:03:04.140> things<00:03:04.380> up<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:05.100> to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
is I intend to split things up just to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370 
is I intend to split things up just to
make<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> bit<00:03:05.850> more<00:03:05.880> manageable<00:03:06.170> even<00:03:07.170> though

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
make a bit more manageable even though

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.640 
make a bit more manageable even though
as<00:03:07.739> an<00:03:07.920> example<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.580> all<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.690> at<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.500> same

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
as an example I all of this at the same

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.690 
as an example I all of this at the same
time<00:03:10.920> as<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.860> could<00:03:14.580> have

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
time as this and this so I could have

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.160 
time as this and this so I could have
put<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:14.970> all<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.209> one<00:03:15.300> place<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:15.810> that's<00:03:15.959> just

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
put it all in one place but that's just

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.320 
put it all in one place but that's just
how<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.380> do<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.830> entitled<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.730> all<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.060> matters

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
how I do is entitled to all that matters

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.850 
how I do is entitled to all that matters
is<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.720> actually<00:03:18.870> track<00:03:19.260> things<00:03:19.560> and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
is that you actually track things and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.550 
is that you actually track things and
you<00:03:19.980> keep<00:03:20.250> them<00:03:20.870> keep<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.989> all<00:03:22.080> together<00:03:22.260> and

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
you keep them keep it all together and

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.250 
you keep them keep it all together and
you<00:03:22.680> know<00:03:23.070> what<00:03:23.280> what<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.880> eat<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.260> what

you know what what you eat it what

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.630 
you know what what you eat it what
you've<00:03:25.380> got<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.890> obviously<00:03:26.400> your

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
you've got here is obviously your

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.680 
you've got here is obviously your
calories<00:03:27.000> for<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.180> day<00:03:27.680> 2201<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:30.360> I'm<00:03:30.450> one

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
calories for the day 2201 so I'm one

blah<00:03:40.850> protein<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:41.880> quite<00:03:42.209> hard<00:03:42.390> for<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.660> deer

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
blah protein is quite hard for the deer

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.540 
blah protein is quite hard for the deer
mainly<00:03:43.230> because<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.739> some<00:03:43.890> quest<00:03:44.130> bars<00:03:44.370> in

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
mainly because I have some quest bars in

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.070 
mainly because I have some quest bars in
the<00:03:44.640> house<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.209> have<00:03:45.330> been<00:03:45.480> eating<00:03:45.720> then

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
the house and I have been eating then

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.170 
the house and I have been eating then
the<00:03:46.290> practical<00:03:46.860> protein<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.670> like<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.970> have

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
the practical protein and I like to have

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.140 
the practical protein and I like to have
them<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:48.630> obviously<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.709> could<00:03:49.890> argue<00:03:50.880> that

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
them so obviously you could argue that

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.460 
them so obviously you could argue that
the<00:03:51.390> whole<00:03:51.540> point<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.810> if<00:03:52.050> it<00:03:52.170> fits<00:03:52.350> your

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the whole point of if it fits your

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.230 
the whole point of if it fits your
macros<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.310> make<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.970> fit<00:03:54.120> your

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
macros is that you make it fit your

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.500 
macros is that you make it fit your
macro<00:03:54.630> sir

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
macro sir

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.119 
macro sir
I<00:03:55.569> haven't<00:03:55.870> done<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.080> because<00:03:56.620> I'm<00:03:56.860> missing

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
I haven't done that because I'm missing

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.039 
I haven't done that because I'm missing
out<00:03:57.220> on<00:03:57.280> carbs<00:03:57.730> here<00:03:57.909> but<00:03:58.299> really<00:03:58.720> there's<00:03:58.930> not

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
out on carbs here but really there's not

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.679 
out on carbs here but really there's not
much<00:03:59.230> in<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.439> and<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.890> be<00:04:00.010> honest<00:04:00.370> i<00:04:00.610> would<00:04:01.540> say

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
much in it and to be honest i would say

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.960 
much in it and to be honest i would say
that<00:04:01.720> those<00:04:01.989> micronutrients<00:04:02.670> best<00:04:03.670> off<00:04:03.879> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
that those micronutrients best off the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.280 
that those micronutrients best off the
calories<00:04:04.180> I've<00:04:04.450> got<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:04.689> I'm<00:04:04.840> not<00:04:05.049> one

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
calories I've got that I'm not one

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.960 
calories I've got that I'm not one
hundred<00:04:05.349> percent<00:04:05.560> accurate<00:04:06.340> but<00:04:06.700> they<00:04:06.849> will

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
hundred percent accurate but they will

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.670 
hundred percent accurate but they will
be<00:04:07.030> somewhere<00:04:07.420> near<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.019> I'm<00:04:08.140> not<00:04:08.290> really<00:04:08.349> that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
be somewhere near so I'm not really that

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.000 
be somewhere near so I'm not really that

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.029 
put in any random food say slice bread
you<00:04:39.370> would<00:04:39.490> set<00:04:39.760> that<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.449> there<00:04:41.229> you<00:04:41.289> go<00:04:41.320> it

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
you would set that and there you go it

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.950 
you would set that and there you go it
bring<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.400> up<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.610> lot<00:04:42.789> of<00:04:42.820> brands<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.750> pick

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
bring you up a lot of brands you pick

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.420 
bring you up a lot of brands you pick
the<00:04:44.050> one<00:04:44.169> that<00:04:44.199> you<00:04:44.350> want<00:04:44.650> make<00:04:45.070> shop<00:04:45.280> with

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
the one that you want make shop with

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.860 
the one that you want make shop with
calories<00:04:45.760> are<00:04:45.880> somewhere<00:04:46.150> near<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.630> then<00:04:46.720> you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
calories are somewhere near and then you

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.810 
calories are somewhere near and then you
would<00:04:47.050> just<00:04:47.080> add<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.380> as<00:04:47.620> simple<00:04:47.889> as<00:04:48.039> that<00:04:48.070> so

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
would just add it as simple as that so

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.520 
would just add it as simple as that so
anyway<00:04:49.090> really<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.840> all<00:04:50.080> there<00:04:50.260> is<00:04:50.320> to

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
anyway really that is all there is to

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.500 
anyway really that is all there is to
this<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.250> not<00:04:51.580> very<00:04:51.610> difficult<00:04:51.910> at<00:04:52.300> all<00:04:52.330> to

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
this it is not very difficult at all to

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.480 
this it is not very difficult at all to
our<00:04:52.930> track<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.410> follow<00:04:53.800> things<00:04:54.100> all<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.340> need

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
our track and follow things all you need

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.420 
our track and follow things all you need
is<00:04:54.669> a<00:04:54.699> set<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.120> scales<00:04:55.530> just<00:04:56.530> remember<00:04:56.800> 20<00:04:56.979> your

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
is a set of scales just remember 20 your

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.830 
is a set of scales just remember 20 your
skills<00:04:57.669> before<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:58.030> start<00:04:58.240> waving<00:04:58.510> things<00:04:58.539> if

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
skills before you start waving things if

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.770 
skills before you start waving things if
you're<00:04:58.960> going<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.110> use<00:04:59.229> a<00:04:59.289> bar<00:04:59.530> on<00:04:59.560> top<00:04:59.740> of<00:05:00.010> it

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
you're going to use a bar on top of it

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.650 
you're going to use a bar on top of it
pretty<00:05:01.780> much<00:05:01.960> this<00:05:02.110> is<00:05:02.490> for<00:05:03.490> me<00:05:03.639> I<00:05:03.880> found<00:05:04.449> that

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
pretty much this is for me I found that

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.570 
pretty much this is for me I found that
tracking<00:05:05.289> macros<00:05:05.770> has<00:05:06.190> been<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.460> most

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
tracking macros has been the most

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.060 
tracking macros has been the most
effective<00:05:07.180> way<00:05:07.360> for<00:05:07.389> me<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.710> manage<00:05:08.710> my<00:05:09.039> weight

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
effective way for me to manage my weight

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.540 
effective way for me to manage my weight
loss<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.910> my<00:05:10.270> way<00:05:10.449> again<00:05:11.130> it's<00:05:12.130> probably<00:05:12.250> been

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
loss and my way again it's probably been

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.980 
loss and my way again it's probably been
the<00:05:12.639> single<00:05:12.849> most<00:05:13.150> effective<00:05:13.360> thing<00:05:13.840> that

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
the single most effective thing that

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.080 
the single most effective thing that
I've<00:05:14.080> done<00:05:14.289> whilst<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.669> all<00:05:15.789> this<00:05:15.880> body

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
transformation so I do recommend you do

transformation so I do recommend you do
it<00:05:18.610> does<00:05:18.940> seem<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.210> little<00:05:19.330> bit<00:05:19.539> daunting<00:05:19.990> at

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
it does seem a little bit daunting at

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.110 
it does seem a little bit daunting at
first<00:05:20.110> it<00:05:20.530> seems<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.860> little<00:05:20.979> bit<00:05:21.130> like<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.580> lot

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
first it seems a little bit like a lot

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.240 
first it seems a little bit like a lot
of<00:05:22.240> effort<00:05:22.599> a<00:05:22.720> lot<00:05:22.750> of<00:05:22.930> hard<00:05:23.199> work<00:05:23.320> but<00:05:23.830> really

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
of effort a lot of hard work but really

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.830 
of effort a lot of hard work but really
all<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.970> means<00:05:25.060> is<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.270> you'll<00:05:25.510> be<00:05:25.630> able<00:05:25.660> to

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
all it means is that you'll be able to

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.320 
all it means is that you'll be able to
continue<00:05:26.169> eating<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.710> things<00:05:26.919> you<00:05:27.130> like<00:05:27.430> not

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
continue eating the things you like not

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.390 
continue eating the things you like not
not<00:05:28.690> worry<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.169> much<00:05:29.199> about<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.830> but<00:05:29.979> if<00:05:30.130> you're

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
not worry so much about it but if you're

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.240 
not worry so much about it but if you're
so<00:05:31.090> for<00:05:31.270> example<00:05:31.330> you've<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.260> met<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.680> lot<00:05:33.190> of

so for example you've just met a lot of

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.909 
so for example you've just met a lot of
nice<00:05:33.460> salads<00:05:33.940> and<00:05:34.210> whatever<00:05:34.840> got<00:05:35.680> some
