00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.870 
and draw a curve that goes all the way
down<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.759> eye<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:54.560> point<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.189> wouldn't

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
down to that eye this point I wouldn't

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.120 
down to that eye this point I wouldn't
draw<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> straight<00:01:56.390> line

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
draw a straight line

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.469 
draw a straight line
aiming<00:01:58.130> sort<00:01:58.399> of<00:01:58.490> towards<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:59.030> center<00:01:59.329> of<00:01:59.390> the

aiming sort of towards the center of the

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.169 
aiming sort of towards the center of the
head<00:02:00.009> from<00:02:01.009> here<00:02:01.520> I'm<00:02:01.670> going<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.880> draw<00:02:02.030> another

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
head from here I'm going to draw another

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.289 
head from here I'm going to draw another
straight<00:02:02.570> line<00:02:02.719> out<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.429> left<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.939> second

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
to pull this and try to create a sort of

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.399 
to pull this and try to create a sort of
around<00:02:10.610> circles<00:02:11.090> for<00:02:11.300> wrapping<00:02:11.659> around<00:02:11.750> here

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
around circles for wrapping around here

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.750 
around circles for wrapping around here
so<00:02:12.680> starting<00:02:13.670> here

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so starting here

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.009 
so starting here
Kirt<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:16.489> Kurt<00:02:17.489> back<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.939> again<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.840> now

Kirt in and Kurt back out again so now

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.390 
Kirt in and Kurt back out again so now
I'm<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.379> start<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> try<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.860> create<00:02:20.129> a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
I'm going to start to try to create a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.270 
I'm going to start to try to create a
circle<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.780> goes<00:02:21.989> around<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.379> head<00:02:22.590> but

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
circle that goes around the head but

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.130 
circle that goes around the head but
there<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> gap<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.329> because<00:02:24.659> Bryna<00:02:24.930> we

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
there is a gap here because Bryna we

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.210 
there is a gap here because Bryna we
don't<00:02:25.260> want<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.470> draw<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.680> line<00:02:25.829> straight

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
don't want to draw the line straight

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.369 
don't want to draw the line straight
through<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:27.180> come<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.870> stop<00:02:28.170> right

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
through to come here and stop right

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.740 
through to come here and stop right
there<00:02:28.640> leave<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> gap<00:02:29.939> so<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.420> gonna<00:02:30.510> put<00:02:30.659> my

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
there leave a gap so I'm gonna put my

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.229 
there leave a gap so I'm gonna put my
finger<00:02:31.019> here<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.440> I'll<00:02:32.159> start<00:02:32.370> again<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
finger here and I'll start again and

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.850 
finger here and I'll start again and
continue<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.930> circle<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.610> other<00:02:35.760> side

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
continue that circle on the other side

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.470 
continue that circle on the other side
now<00:02:37.860> from<00:02:38.069> here<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.310> don't<00:02:38.579> draw<00:02:38.700> some<00:02:38.940> detail

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
now from here I don't draw some detail

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.899 
now from here I don't draw some detail
in<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.629> head<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.019> right<00:02:40.440> about<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.489> left<00:02:41.760> side

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
in the head so right about the left side

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.210 
in the head so right about the left side
of<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> eye<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.510> uh<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.859> live<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> higher

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
of the eye just uh you can live a higher

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
of the eye just uh you can live a higher
than<00:02:44.400> half<00:02:44.579> way<00:02:44.819> I'm<00:02:45.659> gonna<00:02:45.780> curve<00:02:46.170> around<00:02:46.739> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
than half way I'm gonna curve around and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.789 
than half way I'm gonna curve around and
down<00:02:47.359> and<00:02:48.359> from<00:02:48.569> here<00:02:48.840> I'm<00:02:49.019> gonna<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.440> an<00:02:49.530> upper

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
down and from here I'm gonna do an upper

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.130 
down and from here I'm gonna do an upper
curve<00:02:50.129> in<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.670> back<00:02:50.849> of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> head<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:52.019> then

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
curve in the back of the head and then

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.319 
curve in the back of the head and then
do<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.379> reverse<00:02:52.709> curve<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.579> above<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:54.000> like

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
fingers I know in some drawings and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.629 
fingers I know in some drawings and
images<00:03:16.290> these<00:03:16.379> got<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.799> five<00:03:17.040> fingers<00:03:17.430> or

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
images these got like five fingers or

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.240 
images these got like five fingers or
only<00:03:18.629> three<00:03:19.139> so<00:03:19.440> I'm<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.709> gonna<00:03:19.799> bail<00:03:19.980> three

only three so I'm just gonna bail three

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.509 
only three so I'm just gonna bail three
here<00:03:20.519> from<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.269> point<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:22.560> curve<00:03:22.799> up<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
here from this point and we curve up and

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.680 
here from this point and we curve up and
then<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.629> curve<00:03:24.900> back<00:03:25.109> down<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.910> curl<00:03:27.180> up<00:03:27.419> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
then the curve back down and curl up in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.080 
then the curve back down and curl up in
the<00:03:27.780> same<00:03:27.989> angle<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.669> then<00:03:29.669> I'm<00:03:29.760> gonna<00:03:29.849> curve

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the same angle and then I'm gonna curve

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.759 
the same angle and then I'm gonna curve
back<00:03:30.269> down<00:03:30.540> then<00:03:31.260> from<00:03:31.410> here<00:03:31.829> when<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.669> curve<00:03:33.030> up

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
back down then from here when I curve up

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.680 
back down then from here when I curve up
and<00:03:34.769> back<00:03:35.069> up<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.549> I'm<00:03:35.940> not<00:03:36.090> going<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.329> connect

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and back up but I'm not going to connect

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.689 
and back up but I'm not going to connect
to<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.169> neck<00:03:37.560> I'm<00:03:37.949> school<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.340> little<00:03:38.549> gap

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
to that neck I'm school you a little gap

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.270 
to that neck I'm school you a little gap
like<00:03:38.879> that<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.870> here<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.889> middle<00:03:40.949> of<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
like that and here in the middle of the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.819 
like that and here in the middle of the
arm<00:03:41.430> he's<00:03:41.730> got<00:03:41.879> two<00:03:42.120> big<00:03:42.449> stripes<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:43.079> I'm

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
arm he's got two big stripes so I'm

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.580 
arm he's got two big stripes so I'm
gonna<00:03:43.980> do<00:03:44.280> an<00:03:45.000> upward<00:03:45.299> curve<00:03:45.359> like<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.810> and

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
gonna do an upward curve like this and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.839 
gonna do an upward curve like this and
go<00:03:46.709> up<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.889> little<00:03:47.040> bit<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.250> draw<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.519> same

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
go up a little bit and draw that same

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.080 
go up a little bit and draw that same
exact<00:03:48.389> line<00:03:48.629> on<00:03:49.049> top<00:03:49.379> I'll<00:03:50.280> leave<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> gap<00:03:50.730> and

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
exact line on top I'll leave a gap and

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.780 
exact line on top I'll leave a gap and
do<00:03:51.449> it<00:03:51.540> again<00:03:52.340> one<00:03:53.340> two<00:03:55.250> all<00:03:56.250> right<00:03:56.459> let's<00:03:56.669> go

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
do it again one two all right let's go

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.220 
do it again one two all right let's go
to<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:56.970> front<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.299> body<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.810> right<00:03:58.049> about

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
to the front of the body so right about

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.770 
to the front of the body so right about
here<00:03:58.459> right<00:03:59.459> with<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.790> line<00:04:00.239> hands<00:04:00.569> I'm

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
here right with that line hands I'm

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.990 
here right with that line hands I'm
gonna<00:04:00.989> move<00:04:01.109> over<00:04:01.199> to<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> right<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.000> then

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
gonna move over to the right and then

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.210 
gonna move over to the right and then
draw<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> curve<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.199> kind<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.500> comes<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:04.889> words

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
draw a curve that kind of comes in words

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.030 
draw a curve that kind of comes in words
inwards<00:04:05.849> towards<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.269> body<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.889> then<00:04:07.889> it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
inwards towards the body and then it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.530 
inwards towards the body and then it
starts<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.400> straighten<00:04:08.879> out<00:04:09.000> as<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.329> comes

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
starts to straighten out as it comes

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.000 
starts to straighten out as it comes
down<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:10.349> not<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.709> go<00:04:10.769> all<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:10.919> way

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
down I'm not going to go all the way

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.409 
down I'm not going to go all the way
down<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.519> bottom<00:04:11.699> of<00:04:11.909> the<00:04:11.970> fingers<00:04:12.269> I'm

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
down to the bottom of the fingers I'm

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.300 
down to the bottom of the fingers I'm
going<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.569> try<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:12.959> end<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.680> body<00:04:13.859> right<00:04:14.099> about

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
going to try to end the body right about

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.560 
going to try to end the body right about
here<00:04:14.669> so<00:04:14.900> I'm<00:04:15.900> going<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.049> curve<00:04:16.289> this<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.650> and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
here so I'm going to curve this in and

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.500 
here so I'm going to curve this in and
tuck<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.599> in<00:04:18.930> behind<00:04:19.349> that<00:04:19.409> arm<00:04:20.180> let's<00:04:21.180> draw

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
tuck that in behind that arm let's draw

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.330 
tuck that in behind that arm let's draw
some<00:04:21.780> legs<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.199> draw<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.530> front<00:04:22.830> leg<00:04:23.070> first

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
some legs so I draw the front leg first

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.070 
some legs so I draw the front leg first
up<00:04:23.669> before<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.210> do<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.599> draw<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.810> center

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
up before I do that and draw the center

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.320 
up before I do that and draw the center
separation<00:04:25.800> line<00:04:25.950> for<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:26.159> chest<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:26.610> right

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
separation line for the chest so right

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.470 
separation line for the chest so right
about<00:04:27.510> here

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
about here

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.180 
about here
it's<00:04:28.630> got<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.960> little<00:04:29.050> line<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.620> goes

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
it's got like a little line that goes

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.460 
it's got like a little line that goes
down<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:31.540> while<00:04:31.720> we're<00:04:31.840> at<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:31.990> might<00:04:32.320> as<00:04:32.380> well

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
down and while we're at it might as well

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.410 
down and while we're at it might as well
do<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.770> tail<00:04:32.980> feathers<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:33.550> we're<00:04:34.180> gonna<00:04:34.270> buck

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
do the tail feathers so we're gonna buck

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.850 
do the tail feathers so we're gonna buck
you've<00:04:34.600> got<00:04:34.720> three<00:04:34.960> feathers<00:04:35.140> that<00:04:35.350> stick<00:04:35.710> out

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
you've got three feathers that stick out

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.460 
you've got three feathers that stick out
so<00:04:36.130> start<00:04:37.000> down<00:04:37.360> here<00:04:37.390> so<00:04:37.960> I'm<00:04:38.080> imagining<00:04:38.260> this

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
so start down here so I'm imagining this

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.740 
so start down here so I'm imagining this
line<00:04:38.710> coming<00:04:39.010> around<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.850> bottom<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
line coming around the bottom the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.030 
line coming around the bottom the
feather<00:04:40.990> would<00:04:41.140> kind<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.470> come<00:04:41.620> up<00:04:41.740> this<00:04:41.860> way

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
feather would kind of come up this way

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.760 
feather would kind of come up this way
so<00:04:42.090> we<00:04:43.090> draw<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.300> curve<00:04:43.750> up<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.370> then<00:04:45.370> back<00:04:45.640> in

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
so we draw a curve up and then back in

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.750 
so we draw a curve up and then back in
we'll<00:04:47.770> draw<00:04:47.920> another<00:04:48.100> one<00:04:48.220> but<00:04:48.460> slightly

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
we'll draw another one but slightly

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.130 
we'll draw another one but slightly
smaller<00:04:49.150> curve<00:04:49.870> up<00:04:50.550> back<00:04:51.550> in<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.330> then<00:04:52.990> the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
smaller curve up back in and then the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.870 
smaller curve up back in and then the
third<00:04:53.380> one<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.830> then<00:04:54.040> it's<00:04:54.220> smaller<00:04:54.490> so

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.150 

you've<00:04:57.880> got<00:04:58.090> two<00:04:58.420> stripes<00:04:58.840> on<00:04:59.140> each<00:04:59.650> tail<00:04:59.920> so

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
you've got two stripes on each tail so

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.560 
you've got two stripes on each tail so
two<00:05:00.370> lines<00:05:00.400> across<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.390> top<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:02.800> here<00:05:03.280> and

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
two lines across the top to here and

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.650 
two lines across the top to here and
then<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.960> there<00:05:05.940> give<00:05:06.940> them<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.300> leg<00:05:07.480> so

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
then to there give them to the leg so

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.600 
then to there give them to the leg so
you've<00:05:07.750> got<00:05:07.870> two<00:05:08.170> really<00:05:08.740> thin<00:05:09.190> legs<00:05:09.400> that

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
you've got two really thin legs that

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.000 
you've got two really thin legs that
come<00:05:09.760> down<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.780> I'm<00:05:10.840> going<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:10.990> start<00:05:11.200> imagine

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
come down so I'm going to start imagine

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.890 
come down so I'm going to start imagine
this<00:05:12.160> body<00:05:12.550> coming<00:05:13.240> down<00:05:13.360> this<00:05:13.480> way<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:13.660> the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
this body coming down this way so the

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.170 
this body coming down this way so the
leg<00:05:14.050> would<00:05:14.200> be<00:05:14.290> here<00:05:14.710> we're<00:05:15.610> doing<00:05:15.820> inward

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
leg would be here we're doing inward

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.980 
leg would be here we're doing inward
curve<00:05:16.710> like<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:18.120> then<00:05:19.120> draw<00:05:19.360> out<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.660> same

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
curve like so then draw out the same

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.350 
curve like so then draw out the same
exact<00:05:20.530> line<00:05:20.850> but<00:05:21.850> making<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.150> little<00:05:22.270> bit

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
exact line but making a little bit

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
exact line but making a little bit
thicker<00:05:22.630> on<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:24.210> right<00:05:25.210> side<00:05:25.480> now<00:05:26.020> come<00:05:26.350> down

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
thicker on the right side now come down

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.720 
thicker on the right side now come down
but<00:05:26.740> I'm<00:05:26.800> not<00:05:26.860> going<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.040> go<00:05:27.130> all<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.430> way<00:05:27.460> down

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
but I'm not going to go all the way down

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.190 
but I'm not going to go all the way down
to<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:27.970> bottom<00:05:28.120> like<00:05:28.420> I<00:05:28.510> did<00:05:28.690> with<00:05:28.810> this<00:05:28.930> line

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
to the bottom like I did with this line

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.750 
to the bottom like I did with this line
just<00:05:29.770> because<00:05:29.980> I<00:05:30.040> want<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.220> be<00:05:30.310> room<00:05:30.520> for<00:05:30.670> the

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
just because I want to be room for the

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.940 
just because I want to be room for the
foot<00:05:31.050> sole<00:05:32.050> on<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.320> bottom<00:05:32.380> here<00:05:32.710> I'm<00:05:32.800> going

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
foot sole on the bottom here I'm going

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.780 
foot sole on the bottom here I'm going
to<00:05:33.010> draw<00:05:33.190> one<00:05:33.490> big<00:05:33.790> toe<00:05:34.090> it's<00:05:34.810> an<00:05:34.900> upward<00:05:35.230> curve

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
to draw one big toe it's an upward curve

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.240 
to draw one big toe it's an upward curve
then<00:05:36.790> curl<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:37.210> back<00:05:37.270> in<00:05:37.750> leaving<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.680> gap<00:05:38.890> now

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
then curl that back in leaving a gap now

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.420 
then curl that back in leaving a gap now
I'm<00:05:39.970> go<00:05:40.180> back<00:05:40.330> up<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.630> this<00:05:40.750> point<00:05:40.990> here<00:05:41.430> I'm

I'm go back up to this point here I'm

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.370 
I'm go back up to this point here I'm
going<00:05:42.580> to<00:05:42.640> go<00:05:42.700> out<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.660> same<00:05:43.870> distance<00:05:44.200> of

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
going to go out to the same distance of

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.550 
going to go out to the same distance of
that<00:05:44.530> toe<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:45.700> then<00:05:45.820> bring<00:05:46.060> that<00:05:46.090> back<00:05:46.390> in<00:05:46.630> now
