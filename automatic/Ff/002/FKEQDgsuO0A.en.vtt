unit<00:00:31.290> which<00:00:31.950> is<00:00:32.099> our<00:00:32.250> most<00:00:32.430> affordable<00:00:33.000> option

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
unit which is our most affordable option

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
unit which is our most affordable option
it<00:00:34.500> works<00:00:34.710> by<00:00:34.890> simply<00:00:35.339> dipping<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.940> end<00:00:36.179> into

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
it works by simply dipping one end into

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.369 
it works by simply dipping one end into
a<00:00:37.019> container<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.890> new<00:00:38.039> fresh<00:00:38.429> water<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
a container of your new fresh water and

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.810 
a container of your new fresh water and
reading<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.859> parts-per-million

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
reading it out in parts-per-million

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
reading it out in parts-per-million
so<00:00:42.059> unit<00:00:42.329> also<00:00:42.510> includes<00:00:43.050> temperature

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so unit also includes temperature

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.160 
so unit also includes temperature
compensation<00:00:44.339> and<00:00:44.730> comes<00:00:45.659> with<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.899> nice

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
compensation and comes with a nice

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.520 
compensation and comes with a nice
leather<00:00:46.530> case<00:00:48.199> important<00:00:49.199> to<00:00:49.289> note<00:00:49.499> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
leather case important to note that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
leather case important to note that
while<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.129> unit<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> extremely<00:00:51.179> accurate

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
while this unit is extremely accurate

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.229 
while this unit is extremely accurate
it's<00:00:52.289> only<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.739> accurate<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.429> a<00:00:53.460> sample<00:00:53.850> given

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it's only as accurate as a sample given

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
it's only as accurate as a sample given
so<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.929> is<00:00:55.050> extremely<00:00:55.589> important<00:00:55.979> to<00:00:56.010> make

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so it is extremely important to make

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
so it is extremely important to make
sure<00:00:56.429> that<00:00:56.609> your<00:00:56.760> container<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.269> clean<00:00:57.719> before

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sure that your container is clean before

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.529 
sure that your container is clean before
you<00:00:58.679> add<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.010> water<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.519> testing<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.269> next

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.149 
place one line coming out of the RO
system<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:48.899> know<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.289> RO<00:01:49.560> system<00:01:50.039> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
system so they know how the RO system is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.520 
system so they know how the RO system is
performing<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.780> tell<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.289> change

quality of your water the next unit is
the<00:02:03.570> DM<00:02:03.899> 2<00:02:04.289> which<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> designed<00:02:05.729> for

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the DM 2 which is designed for

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.810 
the DM 2 which is designed for
commercial<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> industrial<00:02:06.990> applications

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
commercial and industrial applications

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.669 
commercial and industrial applications
but<00:02:08.820> can<00:02:08.970> also<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.270> used<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.780> home<00:02:09.990> there's<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
but can also be used at home there's a

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.890 
but can also be used at home there's a
much<00:02:10.920> larger<00:02:11.370> screen<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.209> again<00:02:12.330> reads<00:02:12.690> out

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
much larger screen and again reads out

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.190 
much larger screen and again reads out

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
as a button for in-and-out lines one of

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.410 
as a button for in-and-out lines one of
the<00:02:17.830> big<00:02:18.010> advantages<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.819> longer

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the big advantages is the longer

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.960 
the big advantages is the longer
waterproof<00:02:20.319> shielded<00:02:20.890> cables<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.550> the

waterproof shielded cables and the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.809 
waterproof shielded cables and the
stronger<00:02:22.440> water-resistant<00:02:23.440> casing<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.640> is

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
stronger water-resistant casing this is

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.820 
stronger water-resistant casing this is
obviously<00:02:25.209> important<00:02:25.780> since<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.140> unit<00:02:26.470> will<00:02:26.650> be

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
obviously important since a unit will be

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.890 
obviously important since a unit will be
used<00:02:27.069> near<00:02:27.340> water<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:28.239> also<00:02:28.360> comes<00:02:28.750> with

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
used near water it also comes with

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.930 
used near water it also comes with
calibration<00:02:29.590> screws<00:02:29.920> for<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.280> end<00:02:30.459> or<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
calibration screws for the end or the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.080 
calibration screws for the end or the
out<00:02:31.120> as<00:02:31.530> well<00:02:32.530> as<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> simultaneous<00:02:33.220> one<00:02:33.819> on<00:02:33.970> the

side

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.420 
side
the<00:02:34.900> last<00:02:35.140> advantage<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.830> removable

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the last advantage is a removable

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.120 
the last advantage is a removable
bracket<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.959> bracket<00:02:37.989> can<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.620> attached<00:02:38.950> to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
bracket the bracket can be attached to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.400 
bracket the bracket can be attached to
its<00:02:39.280> home<00:02:39.489> with<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> adhesive<00:02:40.120> strips<00:02:40.690> or

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
its home with the adhesive strips or

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.890 
its home with the adhesive strips or
with<00:02:41.830> screws<00:02:42.220> this<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:42.940> particularly<00:02:43.360> nice

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
with screws this is particularly nice

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.199 
with screws this is particularly nice
when<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.319> becomes<00:02:44.650> time<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.190> calibrate<00:02:45.459> or

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
when it becomes time to calibrate or

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.890 
when it becomes time to calibrate or
change<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.750> batteries<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.349> your<00:02:47.380> unit
