00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
a very strong determination about the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.760 
a very strong determination about the
c-13<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> season<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.810> PAS<00:02:00.990> seasons<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770

and everyone is starting to believe so
therefore<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.270> think<00:02:06.990> over<00:02:07.469> 2.5<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.450> also

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
therefore I think over 2.5 that's also

therefore I think over 2.5 that's also
4.8<00:02:10.050> Apache<00:02:10.440> 65<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.129> very<00:02:11.370> good<00:02:11.489> value
