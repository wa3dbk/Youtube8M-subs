00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello you probably love today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.090
 rather a banal video but still on 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.940
 itself would have been quite happy if I 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.029
 earlier thought it would be about 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.250
 Document folder Everyone knows that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.519
 think everyone has their own system, we the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.260
 kept 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.550
 everything important is official 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.560
 documents certificates employment contracts 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 I just keep special memories 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.300
 in a document folder and was on me 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.590
 that is not aware when you enter 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.520
 Child gets a lot of documents tide 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:48.260
 it is true yes one closes one 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 home savings contract or grandparents 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.020
 close each one off now and give 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.140
 then write one 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.730
 alone the registration in the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.800
 civic name 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.550
 birth certificate registration passport 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 all such a thing 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.970
 also the newspapers of the birth than we 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 Namely have a newspaper of the day 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.720
 kept the birth or even 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.799
 brochures from the hospital and all 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.009
 things are in one of us 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.590
 Document folder and I'm really 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.939
 now added to my son one 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 to buy and have all the time 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.270
 thought I would have known that in the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.180
 You somehow have more pregnancy 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.369
 time as you can do such things well 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.780
 organize and then think well 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 How to do all the things 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 kept and I will get you today 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.420
 show or say how we do that now 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.189
 want to handle 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.900
 it starts with it 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.939
 everyone in our family gets one 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.729
 own document folder and yes I am 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.369
 a little sacrifice and wanted all that 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.880
 to have the same model and I will 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.310
 then every so fonts that are used to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.200
 For example, no documents will be 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.440
 different documents so mean 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.480
 and that will be daddy andreas documents 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.100
 are 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.319
 and yes I think so too 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.560
 very nice if it is so on the shelf 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.450
 and everyone knows where he is 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.450
 important documents can be found 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.040
 me and my friends are sitting naturally 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.569
 already have a document folder on us 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.900
 but both decided that we 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.260
 that also have to sort through 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.709
 and here we come to the next one 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.580
 I hope each of us such a register 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.560
 bought with ten register sheets 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.930
 Just to make it a bit of a structure 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.630
 because we currently have this 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.239
 problem that our documents in 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.790
 a folder but somehow if 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.640
 you look for something you are looking for decent 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.709
 long and what we also bought 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.019
 by the way have all berlin where I have 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.299
 everything together cost 14 euros 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.209
 as it really is not a great one 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.260
 Investment and you really have 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.459
 hopefully in his life a rest 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.530
 I also bought classic poles 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.650
 just like documents 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.300
 somehow not be laid I hope 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 at all that this video is interesting 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.190
 otherwise it's easy on you 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.459
 watch the next video which I also 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.870
 still house is such a pin with the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.950
 then the register sheets 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.590
 can label and everything just that 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.450
 folder and so on and then 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.950
 even so, they have two 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.519
 euro 69 tasted in different colors 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.090
 and just to make a good one 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.940
 order in his documents I have 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.360
 that's really very important 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.830
 and maybe it will be now 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.170
 actually a few times than me 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.269
 think it's important that you do that 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.580
 child then somehow that way 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.830
 Gives it important that its important 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.220
 documents where to arrange to organize 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.489
 and it 's all a bit like that 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.919
 yes, although the small one 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.010
 probably only at 14 or sauce 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.750
 Document folder of me but gets up 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.330
 I will try to do that 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.370
 to lead properly and it was really 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.550
 for us so we have so many documents 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.370
 got and all then 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.710
 were stacked somewhere and we did not 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.360
 had space to see where to go 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.340
 then I did not want her in his 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.020
 temporary but that did not want 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.070
 just do not buy your own wallet and 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.870
 we have finally done that 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.610
 so as a tip so if you are a brother 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.710
 time makes you think like he did 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.090
 Keep documents of your child 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.100
 we want so we have maybe it is 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.250
 quite interesting for the one or 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.169
 other of you and much more I can 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.240
 Now do not say anything 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.680
 Thank you in any case up to 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.910

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.900
