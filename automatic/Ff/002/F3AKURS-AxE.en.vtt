00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.420
 I'm not particularly picky about everything but y 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.200
 I am the main thing that the room was 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.290
 clean and did not stink everything else as it were 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.810
 the peephole here is our fan 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.360
 on the handle but snaps in there is a lock 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.900
 there is one more latch here here 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.630
 we have a mirror here we have a wardrobe there 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.790
 things are already hanging but not very visible on 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.540
 In fact, in the photos the number looks like 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.760
 more here are the size of the room 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.850
 but everything is decent in good condition 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.190
 Here is such a bathroom here with us 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.820
 there is also a mirror here a towel 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.870

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.959
 you can call here the hotel itself is 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.230
 on the second floor we could not find 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.620
 the taxi driver worked us drove into one here and 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.110
 then only found even with us goes such 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.550
 here is the kitchenette 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.440
 that's what we have here at all 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.320
 set we had two glasses here's a teapot 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.200
 we had here an extract of everything that 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.780
 here it is here it is like this 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.549
 old all but i am there with it 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.260
 We will not use the values 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.440
 originally planned maybe something 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.430
 prepare for yourself to understand what conditions 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.560
 on a plate and pan here a couple there 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.250
 an hour I'll show you how everything in this 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.430
 the form is not very good 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.970
 cook but you can do without 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.019
 microwave we have here 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.540
 here is the crane that you are so reeling this 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.840
 also cons of counting but it should not be 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.140
 here we have a slow cooker 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.989
 I opened two glasses of the slow cooker there too 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.470
 all in a sad state here but she 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.980
 there is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.760
 next we have such a hanger 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.769
 for things dryer without knowing 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.549
 as anyone here were slippers and this is mine 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.010
 on there there is still rubber below 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.810
 here is such a table on the table is nothing 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.700
 it was next we have such a plasma 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.549
 how many inch here I don't even know 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.659
 32 not more than 37 somewhere, and an inch in 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.329
 plasma here tuner there is here a chair 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.609
 there is no computer like the photos were 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.940
 maybe I understand it is a separate bed 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.010
 Here is such a big nightstand here 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.670
 light one light 2 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.099
 in principle, what else is it here 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.069
 the main thing is the view from the window of course now I 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.359
 I'll show you the view from the window. 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.780
 just to the next building 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.580
 water so understood there hospital because 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.430
 here 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:19.459
 it can be seen that it is a hospital here I am 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:21.790
 noticed in the morning that people lay like this 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.760
 see everything in the robes 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.850
 Here with flowers this hospital that there higher 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.810
 I don't know everything to dry here 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.380
 people on the balcony at TPA threw things 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:41.330
 Here is such a view but actually 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.640
 yard here such here we mean Nozick mom 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.580
 so not very important that the window 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.960
 open and fresh air in the room 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:54.200
 there is such a number 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:59.180
 inexpensive relative to other price target at 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.500
 this city is basically everything I think and so 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.900
 all clear 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.830
 ordinary number is nothing extra natural 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.470
 the main thing that is more or less clean and smell 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.620
 was to a little crash or kinda became 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.870
 normal air conditioning still like that 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:28.480
 affairs 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:28.480
