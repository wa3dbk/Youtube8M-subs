wicks<00:01:38.700> did<00:01:38.970> however<00:01:39.180> form<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> mushroom<00:01:40.409> tops

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
wicks did however form the mushroom tops

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.780 
wicks did however form the mushroom tops
and<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.009> wicks<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> mushroom

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
and when your wicks have the mushroom
touts<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> tip<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> wick<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.229> always

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
touts at the tip of the wick that always

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.569 
touts at the tip of the wick that always
helps<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.920> ensure<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> claims<00:01:44.520> are

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
helps to ensure that the claims are

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.219 
helps to ensure that the claims are
going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> lot<00:01:45.060> bigger<00:01:45.299> thicker<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
going to get a lot bigger thicker and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.480 
going to get a lot bigger thicker and
wider<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.799> flames<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.310> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
wider and when you have flames like that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
wider and when you have flames like that
it's<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> melt<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.090> wax<00:01:48.329> smoothly

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it's going to melt that wax smoothly

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
it's going to melt that wax smoothly
consistently<00:01:49.890> giving<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> better<00:01:51.180> burn

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
consistently giving you a better burn

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.289 
consistently giving you a better burn
not<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.649> much<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> throw<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> better<00:01:54.030> burn
