better<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:43.409> I'd<00:01:43.979> rated<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.429> 5<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
better and I'd rated a 5 just because it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.950

was<00:01:46.500> my<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.039> foot<00:01:47.420> when<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.509> went<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
was my right foot when I went in the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.510 
was my right foot when I went in the
goal<00:01:50.479> well<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> mean<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.100> goals<00:01:53.369> were

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
goal well I mean the other goals were

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.919 
goal well I mean the other goals were
really<00:01:53.700> good<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.479> I'd<00:01:54.780> probably

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
really good but I think I'd probably

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.910 
really good but I think I'd probably
rate<00:01:55.289> by<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.679> 1<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.340> half<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:57.920> well

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
rate by like a 1 and a half because well

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
rate by like a 1 and a half because well

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.330 
Alex got a really good touch on it and
then<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.899> tapped<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
then I just kind of tapped it in so I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.009 
then I just kind of tapped it in so I
mean<00:02:08.819> I'll<00:02:08.940> give<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> one<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.509> two<00:02:09.750> but

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
mean I'll give it a one or two but

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.750 
mean I'll give it a one or two but
overall<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.829> was<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.130> very<00:02:11.370> nice<00:02:11.549> school

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
