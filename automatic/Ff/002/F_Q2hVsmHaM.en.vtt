Heisman I wanted to be a little bit more

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.580 
Heisman I wanted to be a little bit more
realistic<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.650> there<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.830> could<00:01:39.979> see<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.250> good

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
realistic and there you could see a good

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.840 
realistic and there you could see a good
opportunity<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.860> be<00:01:42.979> using<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.369> reaction

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
opportunity to be using the reaction

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.640 
opportunity to be using the reaction
timing<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:44.479> I<00:01:44.689> wanted<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.259> be<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.409> little<00:01:45.470> more

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
timing but I wanted to be a little more

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.109 
timing but I wanted to be a little more
realistic<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.280> thought<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.790> played<00:01:47.000> an

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
realistic I thought if I played an

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.880 
realistic I thought if I played an
all-american<00:01:47.960> i<00:01:48.049> would<00:01:48.170> probably<00:01:48.530> average

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
all-american i would probably average

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.890 
all-american i would probably average
like<00:01:49.040> 150<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.790> 200<00:01:50.210> rushing<00:01:50.390> yards<00:01:50.720> per<00:01:50.840> game

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
like 150 to 200 rushing yards per game

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.109 
like 150 to 200 rushing yards per game
once<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.290> started<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.890> as<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:52.880> know<00:01:53.000> as<00:01:53.060> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
system really emphasizes not losing yard

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.780

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
so when your speed back like me you

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.010 
so when your speed back like me you
always<00:02:14.970> want<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> go<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> outside<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
always want to go to the outside but a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.280 
always want to go to the outside but a
lot<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.170> time<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.680> risks<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:18.420> getting

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290

tackled<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.830> loss<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:22.230> you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
tackled for a loss because it just you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.530 
tackled for a loss because it just you
know<00:02:22.770> it's<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.310> longer<00:02:23.520> distance<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.090> travel<00:02:24.210> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
know it's a longer distance to travel to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.390 
know it's a longer distance to travel to
gets<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> outside<00:02:24.990> which<00:02:25.860> means<00:02:26.070> it's<00:02:26.220> more

gets the outside which means it's more

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.560 
gets the outside which means it's more
time<00:02:26.580> for<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> defenders<00:02:27.150> come<00:02:27.330> off<00:02:27.420> their

obviously some my tip for you guys just
play<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> little<00:02:33.180> bit<00:02:33.330> more<00:02:33.420> conservative

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
play a little bit more conservative

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.390 
play a little bit more conservative
really<00:02:34.200> stressed<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.710> at<00:02:34.980> least<00:02:35.130> getting

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
really stressed just at least getting

really stressed just at least getting
back<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> line<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.210> scrimmage<00:02:36.240> because

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
back to the line of scrimmage because

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.060 
back to the line of scrimmage because
that's<00:02:37.020> really<00:02:37.110> where<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.440> coach<00:02:37.590> trust<00:02:37.920> goes

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
that's really where the coach trust goes

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.530 
that's really where the coach trust goes
wrong<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.760> four<00:02:38.940> running<00:02:39.090> backs<00:02:39.210> at

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
wrong I think four running backs at

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.570 
wrong I think four running backs at
least<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.440> also<00:02:40.650> don't<00:02:40.830> fumble<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.250> ball<00:02:41.280> cuz

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
least and also don't fumble the ball cuz

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.520 
least and also don't fumble the ball cuz
you<00:02:41.700> lose<00:02:41.880> 50<00:02:42.270> for<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> lot

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
you lose 50 for that and that is a lot

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.650 
you lose 50 for that and that is a lot
of<00:02:43.590> coach<00:02:43.950> trust<00:02:44.310> especially<00:02:45.060> considering

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
of coach trust especially considering

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.850 
of coach trust especially considering
how<00:02:45.690> hard<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.380> earn<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.620> back<00:02:48.410> now<00:02:49.410> a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
how hard it is to earn that back now a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.560 
how hard it is to earn that back now a
couple<00:02:50.100> extra<00:02:50.370> things<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.180> get<00:02:51.330> for

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
couple extra things that you get for

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.600 
couple extra things that you get for
coach<00:02:51.840> trust<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.350> if<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.100> get<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.250> first<00:02:53.520> down

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
coach trust is if you get a first down

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.970 
coach trust is if you get a first down
that's<00:02:54.300> an<00:02:54.390> extra<00:02:54.660> five<00:02:54.930> if<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.710> do<00:02:55.800> like<00:02:55.950> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
that's an extra five if you do like a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.740 
that's an extra five if you do like a
spin<00:02:56.310> move<00:02:56.340> or<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.700> Juke<00:02:56.940> move<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.300> someone<00:02:57.720> I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
spin move or a Juke move on someone I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.900 
spin move or a Juke move on someone I
think<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.110> an<00:02:58.200> extra<00:02:58.440> two<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.680> believe<00:02:59.130> so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
think that's an extra two I believe so

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.370 
think that's an extra two I believe so
if<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.210> those<00:03:00.360> things<00:03:00.660> those<00:03:00.900> will<00:03:01.050> add<00:03:01.200> up

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
if you do those things those will add up

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.810 
if you do those things those will add up
over<00:03:01.560> time<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.610> nice<00:03:02.790> little

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
over time you see I do a nice little

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.490 
over time you see I do a nice little
Juke<00:03:03.210> move<00:03:03.240> there<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.870> will<00:03:03.990> pay<00:03:04.170> off<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
Juke move there and it will pay off of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.930 
Juke move there and it will pay off of
the<00:03:04.590> coach<00:03:04.740> Tressel<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.310> guys<00:03:05.430> won't<00:03:05.580> see<00:03:05.820> it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
get it off a little bit easy just

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.460 
get it off a little bit easy just
because<00:04:33.330> these<00:04:33.449> kid<00:04:33.690> returns<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:34.050> power<00:04:34.229> turns

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
because these kid returns a power turns

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.610 
because these kid returns a power turns
helped<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:34.860> much<00:04:35.750> but<00:04:36.750> obviously<00:04:37.260> i<00:04:37.350> think<00:04:37.530> you

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
helped so much but obviously i think you

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.050 
helped so much but obviously i think you
know<00:04:37.650> quarterbacks<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.280> easier<00:04:38.580> position<00:04:38.970> to

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
know quarterbacks the easier position to

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.400 
know quarterbacks the easier position to
play<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.630> because<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:39.960> have<00:04:40.050> complete

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
play just because you have complete

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.969 
play just because you have complete
control<00:04:40.500> over<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:41.010> game<00:04:41.220> such<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:42.030> so

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
control over the game such like that so

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.520 
control over the game such like that so

in the descriptions my Heisman slider
said<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.090> like<00:06:24.270> them<00:06:24.419> a<00:06:24.449> lot<00:06:24.780> and<00:06:25.080> this<00:06:25.680> video<00:06:25.949> is

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
said I like them a lot and this video is

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.589 
said I like them a lot and this video is
going<00:06:26.099> to<00:06:26.160> wrap<00:06:26.370> up<00:06:26.520> soon<00:06:26.849> as<00:06:27.090> you're<00:06:27.510> gonna

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
going to wrap up soon as you're gonna

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.960 
going to wrap up soon as you're gonna
see<00:06:27.840> where<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.680> ball<00:06:28.830> should<00:06:29.099> stand<00:06:29.340> for<00:06:29.370> 37

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
see where the ball should stand for 37

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.320 
see where the ball should stand for 37
to<00:06:30.030> seven<00:06:30.090> and<00:06:31.490> now<00:06:32.490> we<00:06:32.550> actually<00:06:33.000> get<00:06:33.150> into

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
to seven and now we actually get into

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.460 
to seven and now we actually get into
the<00:06:33.570> game

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
the game

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.930 
the game
this<00:06:34.680> is<00:06:34.800> a<00:06:34.830> huge<00:06:34.920> blowout<00:06:35.490> so<00:06:35.730> you're<00:06:35.820> gonna

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
this is a huge blowout so you're gonna

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.390 
this is a huge blowout so you're gonna
see<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.180> few<00:06:36.360> carries<00:06:36.840> here<00:06:37.110> take<00:06:38.040> that<00:06:38.070> one<00:06:38.310> up

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
see a few carries here take that one up

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.070 
see a few carries here take that one up
for<00:06:38.610> a<00:06:38.640> couple<00:06:38.820> yards<00:06:39.120> you<00:06:39.480> see<00:06:39.660> if<00:06:39.780> you're

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
for a couple yards you see if you're

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.450 
for a couple yards you see if you're
basically<00:06:40.560> what<00:06:40.680> I'm<00:06:40.770> doing<00:06:40.800> is<00:06:41.100> just<00:06:41.160> trying

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
basically what I'm doing is just trying

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.340 
basically what I'm doing is just trying
to<00:06:41.520> stave<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:42.000> middle<00:06:42.270> make<00:06:42.810> sure<00:06:43.020> I<00:06:43.050> gained

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
to stave the middle make sure I gained

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.590 
to stave the middle make sure I gained
positive<00:06:43.770> yardage<00:06:44.430> and<00:06:44.820> that's<00:06:45.150> really<00:06:45.420> the

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
positive yardage and that's really the

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.300 
positive yardage and that's really the
way<00:06:45.630> you<00:06:45.720> can<00:06:45.990> keep<00:06:46.260> your<00:06:46.410> consistency<00:06:46.950> up<00:06:47.190> and

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
way you can keep your consistency up and

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.620 
way you can keep your consistency up and
then<00:06:47.400> eventually<00:06:47.520> get<00:06:48.060> nice<00:06:48.210> little<00:06:48.450> holes

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
then eventually get nice little holes

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.300 
then eventually get nice little holes
like<00:06:48.780> that<00:06:48.990> and<00:06:49.140> break<00:06:49.620> off<00:06:49.800> eight<00:06:50.010> to<00:06:50.160> ten

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
like that and break off eight to ten

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.160 
like that and break off eight to ten
yard<00:06:50.550> runs<00:06:50.790> which<00:06:51.570> is<00:06:51.600> really<00:06:51.870> where<00:06:52.080> you're

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
yard runs which is really where you're

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.020 
yard runs which is really where you're
gonna<00:06:52.290> earn<00:06:52.560> most<00:06:53.160> your<00:06:53.340> coach<00:06:53.550> dress<00:06:53.820> and

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
gonna earn most your coach dress and

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.550 
gonna earn most your coach dress and
then<00:06:54.360> you<00:06:54.510> know<00:06:54.600> sometimes<00:06:55.020> you<00:06:55.170> can<00:06:55.320> get<00:06:55.440> to

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
then you know sometimes you can get to

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.410 
then you know sometimes you can get to
the<00:06:55.650> outside<00:06:56.010> which<00:06:56.760> you'll<00:06:56.940> see<00:06:57.090> here<00:06:57.300> I<00:06:57.330> do

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
the outside which you'll see here I do

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.990 
the outside which you'll see here I do
on<00:06:57.630> this<00:06:57.780> plan<00:06:57.990> on<00:06:58.080> this<00:06:58.170> little<00:06:58.290> misdirection

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
on this plan on this little misdirection

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.700 
on this plan on this little misdirection
you<00:07:00.000> know<00:07:00.120> you<00:07:00.180> can<00:07:00.360> get<00:07:00.450> to<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.690> outside<00:07:01.080> and

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
you know you can get to the outside and

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.810 
you know you can get to the outside and
use<00:07:01.860> your<00:07:02.010> speed<00:07:02.250> a<00:07:02.280> little<00:07:02.400> bit<00:07:02.580> but<00:07:02.760> I

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
use your speed a little bit but I

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.610 
use your speed a little bit but I
definitely<00:07:03.000> think<00:07:03.330> that<00:07:03.450> power<00:07:04.320> running

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
definitely think that power running

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.080 
definitely think that power running
backs<00:07:04.860> are<00:07:05.010> probably<00:07:05.310> the<00:07:05.430> way<00:07:05.520> oh<00:07:05.700> actually<00:07:05.940> I

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
backs are probably the way oh actually I

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.660 
backs are probably the way oh actually I
didn't<00:07:06.300> gets<00:07:06.420> the<00:07:06.540> outside<00:07:06.660> there<00:07:06.960> nevermind

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.670 
didn't gets the outside there nevermind

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.770 
didn't gets the outside there nevermind
but<00:07:08.670> we<00:07:08.880> actually<00:07:08.970> get<00:07:09.210> tapped<00:07:09.360> for<00:07:09.540> a<00:07:09.600> loss

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
but we actually get tapped for a loss

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.870 
but we actually get tapped for a loss
there<00:07:10.110> but<00:07:10.620> I<00:07:10.800> think<00:07:11.100> power<00:07:11.310> running<00:07:11.520> back<00:07:11.700> to

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
there but I think power running back to

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.160 
there but I think power running back to
the<00:07:11.970> way<00:07:12.060> to<00:07:12.120> go<00:07:12.330> because<00:07:12.570> this<00:07:13.020> game

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.170 
the way to go because this game

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.900 
the way to go because this game
definitely<00:07:13.320> emphasizes<00:07:13.980> consistency<00:07:14.670> and

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
definitely emphasizes consistency and

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.090 
definitely emphasizes consistency and
positive<00:07:15.870> yardage<00:07:16.230> not<00:07:16.440> necessarily<00:07:16.830> the<00:07:16.950> big

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
positive yardage not necessarily the big

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.160 
positive yardage not necessarily the big
plays<00:07:17.370> but<00:07:17.820> let's<00:07:18.540> going<00:07:18.690> to<00:07:18.750> wrap<00:07:18.900> up<00:07:19.050> this
