00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
left-hand rotation all right we got

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.680 
left-hand rotation all right we got
interrupted<00:00:05.279> when<00:00:05.670> they<00:00:05.759> got<00:00:05.910> brought<00:00:06.509> the

secondary technique for a left-hand

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.339 
secondary technique for a left-hand
rotation<00:00:10.759> as<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:12.030> step<00:00:12.360> across<00:00:12.540> myself<00:00:13.170> slow

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
rotation as I step across myself slow

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.799 
rotation as I step across myself slow
slow<00:00:13.620> though<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> step<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.370> torque<00:00:14.639> okay<00:00:15.360> can

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
slow though I step in torque okay can

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.450 
slow though I step in torque okay can
see<00:00:15.990> from<00:00:16.170> there<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.890> were<00:00:17.010> standing<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.400> front

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
see from there we were standing in front

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.970 
see from there we were standing in front
of<00:00:17.730> me<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:18.300> right<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.990> my<00:00:19.470> secondary

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
of me all right so my secondary

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.180 
of me all right so my secondary
technique<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.730> slam<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.180> feet<00:00:21.420> together

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.670 

my<00:00:27.000> head<00:00:27.210> which<00:00:27.420> these<00:00:27.690> three<00:00:27.990> corners<00:00:28.440> of<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
my head which these three corners of a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.269 
my head which these three corners of a
rotation<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.880> watch<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.540> next<00:00:30.960> piece<00:00:31.279> all

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
rotation now watch this next piece all

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.720 
rotation now watch this next piece all
right

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
right

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 
right
I'm<00:00:32.850> looking<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.540> direction<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
I'm looking in that direction but the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
I'm looking in that direction but the
problem<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.220> if<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.030> felt<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.660> needed

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
problem is if I if I felt like I needed

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080 
problem is if I if I felt like I needed
to<00:00:36.989> keep<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.829> how<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.400> keep<00:00:38.640> going

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to keep going how would I keep going

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.920 
to keep going how would I keep going
with<00:00:39.420> my<00:00:39.450> head<00:00:39.930> watch<00:00:41.360> when<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> step<00:00:42.720> inside

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
with my head watch when you step inside

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.369 
with my head watch when you step inside
I<00:00:43.910> haven't<00:00:44.910> gotten<00:00:45.120> through<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> my<00:00:46.079> pivot

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I haven't gotten through to my pivot

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.070 
I haven't gotten through to my pivot
yeah<00:00:46.739> watch<00:00:47.309> me<00:00:47.340> pass<00:00:47.820> through<00:00:48.150> my<00:00:48.270> pivot<00:00:48.570> by

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
yeah watch me pass through my pivot by

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.630 
yeah watch me pass through my pivot by
turning<00:00:49.710> forward

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.300 

that's<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.690> secondary<00:00:54.230> advanced<00:00:54.860> technique

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
that's a secondary advanced technique

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.370 
that's a secondary advanced technique
will<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.360> get<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.660> right<00:00:56.810> away

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
will you get it right away

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.710 
will you get it right away
practice<00:00:57.950> it<00:00:58.130> see<00:00:58.580> if<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:58.790> can<00:00:58.970> get<00:00:59.150> it<00:00:59.270> right

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
practice it see if you can get it right

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.590 
practice it see if you can get it right
so<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.410> we'll<00:01:00.620> practice<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:01.160> again<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.760> step

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
so so we'll practice it again a step

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.400 
so so we'll practice it again a step
