00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.380 
activation of the lap of answer possible
so<00:05:00.610> we<00:05:00.850> will<00:05:01.060> pass<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.330> turn<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:03.580> an<00:05:03.700> attack

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
the kill fiend bigger so it can trade

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.930 
the kill fiend bigger so it can trade
with<00:05:33.450> zombie<00:05:33.960> token<00:05:34.380> but<00:05:35.310> now<00:05:35.520> we're<00:05:35.700> down<00:05:35.880> to

zombie tokens so the game ends and it's

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.580 
zombie tokens so the game ends and it's
1:1<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.910> now<00:05:48.150> we<00:05:48.210> have<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.660> option<00:05:48.840> once<00:05:49.230> again

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
1:1 so now we have the option once again

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.800 
1:1 so now we have the option once again
to<00:05:49.770> signboard<00:05:50.310> but<00:05:50.670> we<00:05:50.820> don't<00:05:51.060> make<00:05:51.330> any<00:05:51.600> major

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
to signboard but we don't make any major

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.680 
to signboard but we don't make any major
changes<00:05:52.470> we<00:05:53.250> have<00:05:53.280> to<00:05:53.490> Mulligan<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.330> first

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
changes we have to Mulligan the first

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.750 
changes we have to Mulligan the first
two<00:05:54.840> hands<00:05:55.290> and<00:05:55.440> go<00:05:55.590> down<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.980> six<00:05:56.250> we<00:05:56.460> keep<00:05:56.640> a

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
two hands and go down to six we keep a

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.300 
two hands and go down to six we keep a
hand<00:05:56.970> with<00:05:57.210> pillar<00:05:57.480> arsonists<00:05:58.380> sulfuric

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
hand with pillar arsonists sulfuric

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.390 
hand with pillar arsonists sulfuric
vortex<00:05:59.790> and<00:06:00.060> we<00:06:00.630> draw<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.900> six<00:06:01.290> drop<00:06:01.530> we<00:06:02.130> play

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
vortex and we draw a six drop we play

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.540 
vortex and we draw a six drop we play
out<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.760> arsonist<00:06:03.420> and<00:06:03.770> I'm<00:06:04.770> going<00:06:05.100> to<00:06:05.130> attack

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550

with it and no place from our opponents

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.630 
with it and no place from our opponents
so<00:06:09.660> we<00:06:09.810> slammed<00:06:10.140> down<00:06:10.350> a<00:06:10.410> sulfuric<00:06:10.890> vortex<00:06:11.460> on

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
so we slammed down a sulfuric vortex on

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.000 
so we slammed down a sulfuric vortex on
turn<00:06:11.820> three<00:06:12.150> we<00:06:12.930> get<00:06:13.080> in<00:06:13.200> with<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.500> arsonist

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.720 
turn three we get in with the arsonist
and<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.370> sulfuric<00:06:14.580> vortex<00:06:15.330> hits<00:06:15.780> for<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.290> a

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
and the sulfuric vortex hits for to a

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.070 
and the sulfuric vortex hits for to a
Liliana<00:06:17.730> rivers<00:06:18.240> gonna<00:06:18.450> hit<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.780> battlefield

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
Liliana rivers gonna hit the battlefield

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.030 
Liliana rivers gonna hit the battlefield
and<00:06:20.240> now<00:06:21.240> we<00:06:21.750> attack<00:06:22.260> first<00:06:22.530> with<00:06:22.920> the

arsonists but no blocks happened so now

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.560 
arsonists but no blocks happened so now
we<00:06:25.320> are<00:06:25.560> forced<00:06:26.010> to<00:06:26.130> use<00:06:26.760> both<00:06:27.060> pillar<00:06:27.420> of
