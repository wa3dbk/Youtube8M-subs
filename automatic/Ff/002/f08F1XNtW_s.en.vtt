thing<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.030> need<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.049> check<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
thing we need to do is to check the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
thing we need to do is to check the
surfaces<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> design<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.270> make<00:00:18.300> sure

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
surfaces and the design to make sure

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.870 
surfaces and the design to make sure
we've<00:00:18.930> set<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> surface<00:00:19.619> usage<00:00:20.189> correctly

we've set up the surface usage correctly

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.210 
we've set up the surface usage correctly
the<00:00:21.600> best<00:00:21.810> way<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> do<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the best way to do that is in the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
the best way to do that is in the
services<00:00:23.730> window<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.869> tabulates<00:00:25.439> each<00:00:25.619> of

see<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> some<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.410> services<00:00:40.620> are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
see here that some of the services are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100 
see here that some of the services are
set<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> hull<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.879> others<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.690> set<00:00:42.930> to

internal structure the best way to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.590 
internal structure the best way to
review<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.280> turn<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.820> using<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
review that is just to turn on using the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.930 
review that is just to turn on using the
visibility<00:00:49.140> column<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.980> surfaces<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:50.789> are

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
visibility column the surfaces which are

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.299 
visibility column the surfaces which are
visible<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.600> turn<00:00:52.289> off<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.680> ones<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.160> are

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
visible and turn off the ones which are

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.330 
visible and turn off the ones which are
just<00:00:53.489> internal<00:00:54.120> structure<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.190> review

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
just internal structure so we can review

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.810 
just internal structure so we can review
that<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.820> 3d<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:58.230> also<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> check<00:00:59.489> our

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that in 3d we also want to check our

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
that in 3d we also want to check our
trimming<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.410> take<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> look<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.890> our

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
trimming so we can take a look at our

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
trimming so we can take a look at our
own<00:01:02.250> services<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.660> sure<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> each

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
own services and make sure that each

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
own services and make sure that each
surface<00:01:04.619> has<00:01:04.769> been<00:01:04.979> trimmed<00:01:05.280> off<00:01:05.489> such<00:01:06.030> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
surface has been trimmed off such that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
surface has been trimmed off such that
the<00:01:06.630> hull<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> surfaces<00:01:08.700> form<00:01:09.090> a

closed watertight volume another thing
that<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.170> need<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> check<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.040> should<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that we need to check we should go to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
that we need to check we should go to
the<00:01:14.610> body<00:01:14.850> plan<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> check<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the body plan and check that the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
the body plan and check that the
orientation<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.920> our<00:01:17.070> surfaces<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> correct

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
orientation of our surfaces is correct

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.740 
orientation of our surfaces is correct
by<00:01:18.720> using<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.380> outside<00:01:19.650> arrows<00:01:20.250> command<00:01:20.790> the

by using the outside arrows command the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
by using the outside arrows command the
outside<00:01:22.259> arrows<00:01:22.650> allows<00:01:23.280> us<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.850> show<00:01:24.119> which

to put them in the right direction also

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
to put them in the right direction also
in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> body<00:01:54.329> plan<00:01:54.600> view<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.560> should<00:01:55.590> validate

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
in the body plan view we should validate

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
in the body plan view we should validate
that<00:01:56.759> our<00:01:57.119> sections<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> form

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that our sections are going to form

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
that our sections are going to form
correctly<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.700> best<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
correctly and the best way to do that is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.959 
correctly and the best way to do that is
to<00:02:01.140> turn<00:02:01.350> off<00:02:01.409> all<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> edges<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.670> other

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to turn off all of the edges and other

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.590 
to turn off all of the edges and other
contours<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.950> show<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.490> current<00:02:05.909> section

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
contours and just show a current section

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.080 
contours and just show a current section
then<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.710> start<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.369> forward<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
then we can start up forward in the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.309 
then we can start up forward in the
design

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
multiple parts than then the other parts

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.679 
multiple parts than then the other parts
must<00:02:31.079> be<00:02:31.200> closed<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.730> let's<00:02:33.000> keep<00:02:33.209> walking<00:02:33.390> our

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
must be closed so let's keep walking our

aft<00:02:37.019> we<00:02:37.230> come<00:02:37.439> to<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> bow<00:02:37.829> thruster<00:02:38.430> again

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
aft we come to the bow thruster again

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.059 
aft we come to the bow thruster again
it's<00:02:39.329> okay<00:02:39.719> they<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.079> separate<00:02:40.530> parts<00:02:40.920> we

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
it's okay they have separate parts we

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.069 
it's okay they have separate parts we
can<00:02:41.189> have<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> closed<00:02:41.700> section<00:02:42.000> down<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
can have a closed section down here and

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.920 
can have a closed section down here and
then<00:02:43.739> we<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.129> have<00:02:44.400> an<00:02:44.939> open<00:02:45.060> section<00:02:45.629> here

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
then we can have an open section here

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.050 
then we can have an open section here
where<00:02:46.079> charge<00:02:46.349> max<00:02:46.650> will<00:02:46.889> close<00:02:47.189> off<00:02:47.430> with<00:02:48.030> a

where charge max will close off with a
straight<00:02:48.419> line<00:02:48.629> at<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> top<00:02:49.159> if<00:02:50.159> we<00:02:50.250> walk<00:02:50.549> our

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
straight line at the top if we walk our

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
straight line at the top if we walk our
way<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.540> remainder<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.139> model<00:02:52.500> I've

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
way down the remainder of the model I've

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.129 
way down the remainder of the model I've
got<00:02:52.950> trimming<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.849> can<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
got trimming on so we can see that the

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.649 
got trimming on so we can see that the
lines<00:02:55.349> are<00:02:55.560> trimmed<00:02:55.829> correctly<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:57.450> we

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
lines are trimmed correctly and as we

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.440 
lines are trimmed correctly and as we
get<00:02:57.870> down<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.319> where<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> Box<00:02:58.859> keel<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.489> we<00:03:00.180> can

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
get down to where the Box keel is we can

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.129 
get down to where the Box keel is we can
see<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.769> trimming<00:03:02.189> here<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.480> keel<00:03:03.900> has

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
see that the trimming here the keel has

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.349 
see that the trimming here the keel has
been<00:03:04.349> trimmed<00:03:04.620> off<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.129> hull<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:05.939> just<00:03:06.209> as

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
been trimmed off to the hull but just as

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.420 
been trimmed off to the hull but just as
importantly<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.260> hole<00:03:07.560> has<00:03:07.769> been<00:03:07.980> trimmed<00:03:08.250> in

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
importantly a hole has been trimmed in

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.550 
importantly a hole has been trimmed in
the<00:03:08.579> hole<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.750> end<00:03:09.959> up<00:03:10.109> with<00:03:10.290> one

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
the hole so that we end up with one

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.129 
the hole so that we end up with one
closed<00:03:10.980> boundary<00:03:11.579> formed<00:03:12.450> by<00:03:12.659> all<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.989> those

where we want to start the aft end of
our<00:04:17.600> tank<00:04:18.430> then<00:04:19.430> I<00:04:19.519> can<00:04:19.700> start<00:04:19.940> using<00:04:20.180> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
tank are going to be so I'm just going

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.370 
tank are going to be so I'm just going
to<00:04:27.740> quickly<00:04:27.919> sketch<00:04:28.340> in<00:04:28.610> some<00:04:29.510> straight<00:04:30.110> lines

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380

here<00:04:30.710> for<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.070> tank<00:04:31.360> boundaries<00:04:32.360> so<00:04:32.840> I'm

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
here for the tank boundaries so I'm

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.980 
here for the tank boundaries so I'm
defining<00:04:33.350> an<00:04:34.070> irregularly<00:04:34.700> shaped<00:04:34.850> tank<00:04:35.630> here

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
defining an irregularly shaped tank here

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.159 
defining an irregularly shaped tank here
and<00:04:37.120> one<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.270> important<00:04:38.660> things<00:04:38.870> when<00:04:39.050> we

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
and one of the important things when we

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.350 
and one of the important things when we
come<00:04:39.350> out<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.770> wing<00:04:39.919> tanks<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:41.270> we

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
come out to the wing tanks is that we

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.690 
come out to the wing tanks is that we
need<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.690> close<00:04:42.050> off<00:04:42.320> all<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.890> way<00:04:43.100> around<00:04:43.520> the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
need to close off all the way around the

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.760 
need to close off all the way around the
outside<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.510> wing<00:04:44.720> tank<00:04:45.050> so<00:04:45.230> I'll<00:04:45.290> go<00:04:45.530> all

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
outside of the wing tank so I'll go all

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.930 
outside of the wing tank so I'll go all
the<00:04:45.919> way<00:04:45.950> around<00:04:46.190> here<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.620> can<00:04:49.610> close

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
the way around here so that I can close

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.120 
the way around here so that I can close
off<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.510> tank<00:04:50.870> before<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.440> gets<00:04:51.650> trimmed<00:04:51.950> off

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
off that tank before it gets trimmed off

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.730 
off that tank before it gets trimmed off
to<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.430> hull<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:53.180> then<00:04:53.600> finally<00:04:54.200> another

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
to the hull and then finally another

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.680 
to the hull and then finally another
surface<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.400> can<00:04:55.610> close<00:04:55.820> off<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.389> double

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
surface so I can close off the double

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.980 
surface so I can close off the double
bottom<00:04:57.490> so<00:04:58.490> if<00:04:58.550> I<00:04:58.639> turn<00:04:58.850> off<00:04:58.970> my<00:04:59.150> grid<00:04:59.450> I<00:04:59.660> can

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
bottom so if I turn off my grid I can

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.530 
bottom so if I turn off my grid I can
see<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.710> curves<00:05:01.280> that<00:05:01.580> I've<00:05:01.700> sketched<00:05:02.060> here

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
see the curves that I've sketched here

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.920 
see the curves that I've sketched here
and<00:05:03.430> they<00:05:04.430> going<00:05:04.700> to<00:05:04.790> form<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.300> boundaries<00:05:05.870> of

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
and they going to form the boundaries of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.640 
and they going to form the boundaries of
my<00:05:06.440> various<00:05:06.860> tanks<00:05:07.370> if<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:08.510> switch<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.140> 3d

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
my various tanks if I switch to a 3d

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.150 
my various tanks if I switch to a 3d
view<00:05:10.120> then<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.419> can<00:05:11.750> use<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:12.200> extrude<00:05:12.650> surface

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
view then I can use the extrude surface

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.270 
view then I can use the extrude surface
command<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:14.390> extrude<00:05:14.840> those<00:05:15.080> forward<00:05:15.590> by<00:05:15.800> 5

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
command to extrude those forward by 5

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.650 
command to extrude those forward by 5
meters<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:18.100> that<00:05:19.100> will<00:05:19.250> make<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:20.090> surfaces

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
meters and that will make the surfaces

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.110 
meters and that will make the surfaces
of<00:05:20.720> my<00:05:21.050> design<00:05:21.500> that<00:05:22.010> are<00:05:22.039> going<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.640> be<00:05:22.789> used

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
of my design that are going to be used

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.020 
of my design that are going to be used
to<00:05:23.240> define<00:05:23.720> my<00:05:24.110> tanks<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.620> compartments<00:05:25.280> so

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
to define my tanks and compartments so

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.640 
to define my tanks and compartments so
we<00:05:26.150> can<00:05:26.300> see<00:05:26.479> if<00:05:26.570> I<00:05:26.690> want<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.960> make<00:05:27.080> a<00:05:27.110> tank<00:05:27.440> in

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
we can see if I want to make a tank in

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.490 
we can see if I want to make a tank in
here<00:05:28.070> I<00:05:28.250> can<00:05:28.880> select<00:05:29.090> these<00:05:29.539> surfaces<00:05:30.229> and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
here I can select these surfaces and

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.670 
here I can select these surfaces and
Hydra<00:05:30.830> max<00:05:31.039> to<00:05:31.490> make<00:05:31.520> an<00:05:31.970> internal<00:05:32.390> tank<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.110> I

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
Hydra max to make an internal tank and I

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.140 
Hydra max to make an internal tank and I
can<00:05:33.890> select<00:05:34.310> these<00:05:34.580> surfaces<00:05:35.240> here<00:05:35.950> to<00:05:36.950> make<00:05:37.820> a

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
can select these surfaces here to make a

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.740 
can select these surfaces here to make a
a<00:05:38.840> wing<00:05:39.140> tank

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
a wing tank

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.930 
a wing tank
so<00:05:41.320> starting<00:05:41.830> out<00:05:41.920> with<00:05:42.100> curves<00:05:42.430> can<00:05:42.790> be<00:05:42.910> a

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
so starting out with curves can be a

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.380 
so starting out with curves can be a
good<00:05:43.150> way<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:44.370> define<00:05:45.370> your<00:05:45.610> tank<00:05:45.820> boundaries
