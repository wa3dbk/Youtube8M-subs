00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you would is if you were in the GTA 5

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.819 
you would is if you were in the GTA 5
folder<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.059> pretend<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> GTA<00:00:54.960> 5<00:00:55.230> folder<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
folder so pretend the GTA 5 folder is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
folder so pretend the GTA 5 folder is
called<00:00:56.129> mods<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.030> into<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
called mods and when you go into it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.119 
called mods and when you go into it
that's<00:00:57.989> how<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.199> should<00:00:58.469> address<00:00:58.680> everything

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
that's how you should address everything

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's how you should address everything
so<00:00:59.940> say<00:01:00.270> these<00:01:00.960> fault<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
so say these fault these are going to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.310 
so say these fault these are going to
actually<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.270> certain<00:01:03.510> RPF<00:01:04.110> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
actually go in a certain RPF so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
actually go in a certain RPF so
basically<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> find<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:05.610> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
basically going to find that which is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.590 
basically going to find that which is
actually<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.890> update<00:01:08.090> x64<00:01:09.090> DLC
