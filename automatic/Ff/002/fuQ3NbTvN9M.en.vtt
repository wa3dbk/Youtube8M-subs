 Mr. Mourinho Luisa Sanchez Flower Journal 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.210
 brand 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.020
 I think it is a lost one 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.160
 opportunity to cut points to the 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.410
 barcelona that had played before had 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.430
 pinched and that his team has been close 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.430
 of power in the party 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.360
 It is not 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.810
 our ambition in this league since 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.990
 some time 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.870
 it will win 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.690
 and to the title again we already know what 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.230
 what is a matter of finishing 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.520
 to 12 11 to 19 8 but it's not a question 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.890
 to win with today's draw 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.460
 what we can lose is the second 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.370
 plaza el atlético de madrid wins 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.640
 will be one point ahead of 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.740
 us and this is one more and more point 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.460
 important of 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.890
 we will see tied 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.299
 hello love and leonard chess raúl campillo 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.250
 from zaragoza 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.260
 first thank you for your presence here 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.000
 and the second how can it affect from 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.700
 be the Tuesday match of this 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.110
 point the party that has departed 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.250
 champions how this can affect you 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.890
 party does not affect does not have any 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.120
 We all know that our goals 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.460
 they are at the end of the cup 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.430
 to the quarterfinals of champions and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.640
 that the league I have already got 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.710
 long ago the qualification 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.300
 for the next champions ending in 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.950
 the first three that is one thing that 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.439
 is guaranteed for a long time 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.490
 our goal is to try to finish 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.170
 second and obviously try to win every 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.500
 every game but 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.200
 facing our goal of Wednesday 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.560
 He does not have any 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.479
 you do not get any salvation if some 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.369
 nights to 'radio brand' I wanted to know that 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.020
 it was similar to the performance of diego lopez 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.280
 and if he's going to be his starting goalkeeper here 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.310
 at the end of the season 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.020
 I can not 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.730
 how can you ever say that a player 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.600
 must do everything until the end of 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.810
 of season not 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.090
 I can not 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.210
 I can not say what I can say is 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.180
 what 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.060
 once again he has made a match 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.240
 important one more time 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.819
 has helped my team get 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:37.310
 we have resulted because 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.840
 for two balls for treble and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.099
 judging how he 's playing since 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.609
 enter our goal and going through 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.609
 many matches 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.240
 of difficulty of degree of difficulty 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.950
 quite high like those of now 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.640
 barcelona- that playing as it was 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.170
 Playing 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.690
 no football we have to try to be 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.430
 when these with ourselves and with 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.990
 our players 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.370
 and following this line 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.290
 it is very difficult to leave the goal 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.150
 good afternoon javeriana of the chain be 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.370
 following the same line iker boxes 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.890
 it can be Diego's substitute next 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.640
 Wednesday against the trick team 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.069
 and I think I recourse to good but 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.280
 a week more match against 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.790
 lift I think and want to be there 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.790
 as a cape 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.200
 with the angel Miguel and the chain cope 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.760
 he worries about the state of his strikers 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.110
 that are not scoring many goals in 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.810
 the last matches 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.160
 if we are not we are marking ourselves 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.550
 many goals is one 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.190
 is a reality maybe one of our 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.080
 differences 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.910
 for last season that season 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.760
 passed on 4 22 36 we put 4 marked the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.700
 goals with great ease and the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.640
 only player who have maintained 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.489
 an average of goals similar to that of 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.550
 last season has been Christian all 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.190
 others have lowered their number from their number 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.970
 of goals and obviously the team feels 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.329
 but 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.610
 the goals will come to bind in this 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.040
 the next action will come to the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.700
 to arrive on Wednesday we have experience 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.250
 that arrives in the next match but it's 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.590
 a reality that we are having 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.680
 some difficulties to get so many 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.430
 goals that has been a feature that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.570
 has brought us last season to the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.510
 championships at 100 points to the 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.200
 goal record and this season not 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.200
 we are doing 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.090
 Thus ends the press conference Jose 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.090
 mourinho in the
