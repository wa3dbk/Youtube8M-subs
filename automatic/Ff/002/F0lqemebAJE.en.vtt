opinion<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
opinion then you just have to go up to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.200 
opinion then you just have to go up to
the<00:02:03.420> top<00:02:03.829> off-camera<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> arms

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the top off-camera and get all the arms

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.240 
the top off-camera and get all the arms
just<00:02:06.600> position<00:02:07.200> correctly<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:10.440> finally<00:02:11.009> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
just position correctly and finally just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.900 
just position correctly and finally just
get<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> head<00:02:11.730> pointing<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
get the head pointing up and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.020 
get the head pointing up and
take<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> gun<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.890> unfold<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.070> gun<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
take the gun and unfold the gun and that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.850 
take the gun and unfold the gun and that
actually<00:02:19.450> unfolds<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.110> snaps<00:02:20.410> into<00:02:20.650> place

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
actually unfolds and snaps into place

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.710 
actually unfolds and snaps into place
then<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.370> harm<00:02:21.580> them<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.150> you're<00:02:22.540> good<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
then you harm them up and you're good to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.800 
then you harm them up and you're good to
go

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
go

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.670 
go
except<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:25.990> little<00:02:26.170> part<00:02:26.410> which<00:02:26.560> I'll

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
except for that little part which I'll

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.160 
except for that little part which I'll
talk<00:02:26.800> about<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.220> second<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.570> here<00:02:31.960> we<00:02:32.050> have

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
talk about in a second and here we have

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.770 
talk about in a second and here we have
jazz<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.740> robot<00:02:33.340> mode<00:02:33.370> now<00:02:33.880> as<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.150> can<00:02:34.270> see<00:02:34.330> he

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
jazz in robot mode now as you can see he

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.830 
jazz in robot mode now as you can see he
is<00:02:35.020> actually<00:02:36.010> pretty<00:02:36.340> darn<00:02:36.580> poseable<00:02:37.270> his

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
is actually pretty darn poseable his

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.380 
is actually pretty darn poseable his
head<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> ball-joint<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.040> has<00:02:39.400> full<00:02:39.700> 360

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
head is on a ball-joint and has full 360

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.560 
head is on a ball-joint and has full 360
degrees<00:02:40.750> his<00:02:41.410> arms<00:02:41.500> are<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.430> ball<00:02:42.910> joints<00:02:43.360> and

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
degrees his arms are on ball joints and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.300 
degrees his arms are on ball joints and
then<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.020> swivel<00:02:44.350> joint<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.920> double

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
then you have a swivel joint a double

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.480 
then you have a swivel joint a double
hinge<00:02:45.610> for<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.030> elbow<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.890> even<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> wrists

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
hinge for the elbow and even the wrists

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.390 
hinge for the elbow and even the wrists
on<00:02:48.670> ball<00:02:49.510> joints<00:02:49.990> so<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.410> get<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.800> lot<00:02:51.250> of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
on ball joints so you can get a lot of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.700 
on ball joints so you can get a lot of
poseability<00:02:51.820> out<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> arms<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.350> hips<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
poseability out of the arms the hips the

poseability out of the arms the hips the
torso<00:02:54.340> turns<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:56.140> hips<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.770> full<00:02:57.100> range<00:02:57.370> of

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
motion swivel on the thighs double

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.370 
motion swivel on the thighs double
jointed<00:03:01.030> knees

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
jointed knees

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.110 
jointed knees
you've<00:03:02.380> got<00:03:02.590> somewhat<00:03:03.160> limited<00:03:03.640> you've<00:03:03.910> got

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
you've got somewhat limited you've got

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.150 
you've got somewhat limited you've got
limited<00:03:04.300> articulation<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.560> feet<00:03:05.830> because

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
limited articulation in the feet because

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160 
limited articulation in the feet because
you<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.370> an<00:03:06.460> entire<00:03:06.550> end<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.270> car<00:03:07.600> sticking

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
you have an entire end of a car sticking

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.750 
you have an entire end of a car sticking
off<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.650> but<00:03:09.100> that's<00:03:09.280> okay

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
off of it but that's okay

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.960 
off of it but that's okay
the<00:03:10.540> only<00:03:10.900> real<00:03:11.560> problem<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.580> figure

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
the only real problem with this figure

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.720 
the only real problem with this figure
is<00:03:13.210> the<00:03:14.170> chest

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
is the chest

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.610 
is the chest
it<00:03:15.730> doesn't<00:03:16.240> actually<00:03:16.420> peg<00:03:17.050> in<00:03:17.260> anywhere

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
it doesn't actually peg in anywhere

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.410 
it doesn't actually peg in anywhere
because<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> way<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.670> transformation

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
because of the way the transformation

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.930 
because of the way the transformation
works<00:03:19.600> with<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.959> weird<00:03:20.490> with<00:03:21.490> those<00:03:21.670> weird

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
works with that weird with those weird

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.840 
works with that weird with those weird
gears<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:25.120> it'll<00:03:25.780> stay<00:03:26.410> down<00:03:26.830> because<00:03:27.730> of

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
gears it just it'll stay down because of

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.540 
gears it just it'll stay down because of
friction<00:03:28.390> but<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.780> much<00:03:29.050> else

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
friction but not much else

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.290 
friction but not much else
there's<00:03:30.550> also<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:32.010> groove<00:03:33.010> cut<00:03:33.310> out<00:03:33.490> here<00:03:34.000> to

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
there's also a groove cut out here to

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.330 
there's also a groove cut out here to
actually<00:03:34.690> fit<00:03:34.959> over<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.380> gears<00:03:35.680> underneath

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
actually fit over the gears underneath

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.990 
actually fit over the gears underneath
and<00:03:37.020> then<00:03:38.020> these<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:39.100> don't<00:03:39.580> know<00:03:39.730> if<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.880> can

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
and then these I don't know if you can

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.260 
and then these I don't know if you can
see<00:03:40.180> them<00:03:40.360> these<00:03:40.540> little<00:03:40.870> tabs<00:03:41.320> right<00:03:41.800> here

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
see them these little tabs right here

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.780 
see them these little tabs right here
will<00:03:43.270> actually<00:03:43.690> peg<00:03:44.050> into<00:03:44.739> these<00:03:44.980> slots<00:03:45.190> but

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
will actually peg into these slots but

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.150 
will actually peg into these slots but
they<00:03:46.390> don't<00:03:46.570> hold<00:03:46.840> all<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.380> well<00:03:47.650> there's<00:03:47.950> not

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
they don't hold all the well there's not

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.640 
they don't hold all the well there's not
much<00:03:48.550> I<00:03:48.970> think<00:03:49.959> you're<00:03:50.050> supposed<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.470> be<00:03:50.530> able

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
much I think you're supposed to be able

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.250 
much I think you're supposed to be able
to<00:03:50.800> lock<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.250> down<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:51.970> my<00:03:52.600> figure<00:03:52.959> does<00:03:53.230> not

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
to lock it down but my figure does not

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
to lock it down but my figure does not
want<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.720> chest<00:03:56.050> lock<00:03:56.320> down<00:03:56.590> at<00:03:56.800> all

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
want to have the chest lock down at all

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.310 
want to have the chest lock down at all
lock<00:03:57.580> down<00:03:57.610> in<00:03:58.060> pops<00:03:58.930> right<00:03:59.140> up<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:01.209> that's<00:04:01.810> a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
lock down in pops right up so that's a

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
lock down in pops right up so that's a
huge<00:04:02.830> design<00:04:03.580> flaw<00:04:03.910> for<00:04:04.180> me<00:04:04.300> and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
huge design flaw for me and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.979 
huge design flaw for me and
unfortunately<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.760> really<00:04:07.390> takes<00:04:07.690> away<00:04:07.959> from

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
unfortunately it really takes away from

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.750 
unfortunately it really takes away from
the<00:04:08.260> figure<00:04:08.500> because<00:04:08.770> I've<00:04:08.890> had<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.340> really

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
the figure because I've had it in really

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.270 
the figure because I've had it in really
cool<00:04:09.910> poses<00:04:10.420> only<00:04:11.110> to<00:04:11.290> have<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.680> weight<00:04:12.040> of

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
cool poses only to have the weight of
