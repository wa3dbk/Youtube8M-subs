 do with coffee 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.970
 I remember the story that coffee 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.890
 comes from arabia and I remember this 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.480
 story that tell a goat and the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.330
 goats were grazing and they eat the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 berries 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.550
 how is the coffee is a red dot like that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.009

 the stage of this development the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
 growth in a plant usually in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.200

 June 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 the flower that leaves the plant 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.860
 later in the development of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.770
 time two more months it becomes in the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.820
