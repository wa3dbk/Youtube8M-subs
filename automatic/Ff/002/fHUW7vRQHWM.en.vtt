 with the back of the spoon you can 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.280
 quite well the edge of the press made 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.050
 about two inches high and afterwards 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.050
 pressed the ground really well 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.280
 if it have everything down good 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.039

 you also replace diarrhea extract and 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.660
 a quarter teaspoon of salt and to 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.239
 We need our marshmallows

 whose with me now about 25 pieces 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.940
 dance to that a little bit more need 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.579
 it comes to the size of one 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.130
 springform the butter we heat 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.110
 Now just with the cocoa powder in the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:45.640
 sugar and salt until well 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:49.329
 melted and joined the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.870
 exact quantities and below 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.519
 Video 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.230
 there would just have to show more 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.230
 click there I always link conversion 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.970
 and then when everything connects well 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.140
 has melted and then turns 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.500
 it's short to say it up 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 room temperature can cool down again 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.709
 in the meantime I can already 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.470
 times your eggs until frothy hit the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.060
 I do now with the vanilla sugar 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.620
 relax tag used could but a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.620
 pinch salt into it 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.890
 I have my eggs now pretty frothy 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.810
 pitched and in the meantime 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.879
 is the cooled down to room temperature 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.590
 and there we give our chocolates 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.330
 mix and add it more and touching 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.049
 it just so long under until it's fine 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.049
 has mixed 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.340
 and then we get such a sticky c 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.859
 chocolate then tastes great 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.540
 later our cake and want to fill 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.540
 just do it to springform 1 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.160
 and it should be very careful now 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.000
 they do not pass the floor 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.000
 damaged 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.250
 if it is reasonably fit then 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.040
 then the cake comes for about 30 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.200
 minutes at 170 degrees above bottom heat in 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.240
 the notes with me the cake last 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.770
 half an hour in the oven and now advantage 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.770
 still the marshmallows on top 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.510
 if you distributed them then 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.970
 the cake comes again for about three 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.449
 to five minutes in the oven and me 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.479
 just pay now 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.479
 the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.030
 The cake was even something for me now 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.950
 was open longer 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.410
 the above is a nice caramel color 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.150
 It takes about ten minutes 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.800
 By the way, you have to be careful that 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.480
 he still holds the marshmallows close together 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.130
 sets because for me it was now not closely 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.030
 enough now measured a few gaps 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.220
 arose 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.960
 but the taste he is still the 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.010
 same and now we are still triggering it 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.520
 in front of it and cake I am going to take part now 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.520
 my death 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.199
 The cake is served best when 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.389
 he is still slightly warm because it is so 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.189
 you taste the best you can of course 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.319
 pick up the pieces and then 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.240
 cut in and then the pieces completely 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.710
 give it to the microwave so that the 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.900
 marshmallows or slightly 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.759
 the better the cake tastes 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.620
 Of course I hope that I will 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.870
 I like the recipe 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.629
