00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and that match really sent me into a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.150 
and that match really sent me into a
two-year<00:00:53.230> tailspin<00:00:55.200> proactively

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
two-year tailspin proactively

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.330 
I felt 141 in the world
I<00:01:03.700> never<00:01:04.269> liked<00:01:04.629> myself<00:01:04.900> so<00:01:05.320> little<00:01:05.680> I've

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
I never liked myself so little I've

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.920 
I never liked myself so little I've
never<00:01:06.610> hated<00:01:06.850> tennis<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:07.510> much<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:07.900> that

never hated tennis so much in that

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
never hated tennis so much in that
moment

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
moment

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.180 
moment
and<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> moment<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.350> said<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.620> myself<00:01:10.740> what

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
and at that moment I said to myself what

and at that moment I said to myself what
if<00:01:11.340> now

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
if now

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.230 
if now
for<00:01:12.829> the<00:01:12.920> first<00:01:13.159> time<00:01:13.399> I<00:01:14.170> choose<00:01:15.170> it

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
for the first time I choose it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.210 
for the first time I choose it
what<00:01:17.570> now<00:01:17.780> if<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.140> play<00:01:18.320> tennis<00:01:18.500> not<00:01:18.920> for<00:01:19.159> the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
what now if I play tennis not for the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.210 
what now if I play tennis not for the
pressures<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.670> life<00:01:20.979> not<00:01:21.979> because<00:01:22.280> I<00:01:22.400> have<00:01:22.580> to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
pressures of life not because I have to

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.170 
pressures of life not because I have to
but<00:01:24.340> because<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.880> find<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.240> reason<00:01:25.420> to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.530 

being<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.020> determined

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
being so determined

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.280 
being so determined
forward<00:01:32.410> again

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
forward again

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.120 
forward again
doesn't<00:01:34.070> happen

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
doesn't happen

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.179 
doesn't happen
because<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> skill<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
because you're you got the skill it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.270 
because you're you got the skill it
doesn't<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:39.119> doesn't<00:01:39.450> happen<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:40.280> you're

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
doesn't it doesn't happen because you're

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
doesn't it doesn't happen because you're
focused<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.000> being<00:01:42.060> number

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
focused on being number

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
focused on being number
it<00:01:43.620> can't<00:01:44.010> be<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> mean<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.120> much<00:01:45.150> harder

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it can't be I mean it's so much harder

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.100 
it can't be I mean it's so much harder
the<00:01:46.110> second<00:01:46.590> time<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.270> easy<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.960> be

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the second time it's not easy to be

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.160 
the second time it's not easy to be
number<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> world<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.340> anything<00:01:51.170> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
number one in the world at anything the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.280 
number one in the world at anything the
first<00:01:52.470> time<00:01:53.300> but<00:01:54.300> it's<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.750> much<00:01:54.930> harder<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
first time but it's so much harder the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.900 
first time but it's so much harder the
second<00:01:55.620> time<00:01:55.770> because<00:01:55.950> unlike<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> first

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
second time because unlike the first

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.359 
second time because unlike the first
time<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.990> bad<00:01:58.260> day<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
time it's not just a bad day that you

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.250 
time it's not just a bad day that you
have<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> get<00:01:59.700> past<00:01:59.940> it's<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.690> day<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.229> are

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
have to get past it's a day we are

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.249 
have to get past it's a day we are
clearly<00:02:01.800> aware<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.369> where<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:04.080> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
clearly aware of where you're not so the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.650 
clearly aware of where you're not so the
amount<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> discouragement<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:06.180> happen

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
amount of discouragement that can happen

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.350 
amount of discouragement that can happen
on<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.200> journey<00:02:07.560> when<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.520> feel<00:02:08.880> certain
