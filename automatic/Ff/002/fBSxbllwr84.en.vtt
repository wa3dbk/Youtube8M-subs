00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
two-stroke Ryobi gas unit and then I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.920 
two-stroke Ryobi gas unit and then I
have<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.550> 40<00:00:21.000> volt<00:00:21.180> unit<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.810> going

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
have the 40 volt unit and I'm just going

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.720 
have the 40 volt unit and I'm just going
to<00:00:22.020> demonstrate<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.590> 40<00:00:22.890> volt<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.400> because

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
to demonstrate the 40 volt first because

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.670 
to demonstrate the 40 volt first because
I<00:00:23.760> already<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.090> trimmer<00:00:24.390> hooked<00:00:24.630> up<00:00:24.810> now

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
I already have the trimmer hooked up now

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
I already have the trimmer hooked up now
I'm<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> take<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> trimmer<00:00:27.029> piece<00:00:27.300> off

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
I'm going to take the trimmer piece off

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.250 
I'm going to take the trimmer piece off
and<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.840> attach<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> gas<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.260> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
and just attach it to the gas and you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
and just attach it to the gas and you
can<00:00:31.410> see<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> difference<00:00:33.059> between

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
can see you know the difference between

00:00:33.180 --> 00:02:47.589 
can see you know the difference between
the<00:00:33.450> two

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.259 

so<00:02:48.599> it's<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:49.170> lot<00:02:50.069> louder<00:02:50.249> and<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.760> spins<00:02:50.969> a<00:02:51.120> lot

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
so it's a lot louder and it spins a lot

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.970 
so it's a lot louder and it spins a lot
faster<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.810> now<00:02:52.079> I'm<00:02:52.170> going<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.379> take<00:02:52.560> over<00:02:52.739> to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
faster and now I'm going to take over to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
faster and now I'm going to take over to
a<00:02:53.010> little<00:02:53.099> bit<00:02:53.249> taller<00:02:53.579> grass<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.420> give<00:02:54.810> it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
a little bit taller grass and give it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:30.920 
a little bit taller grass and give it
another<00:02:55.109> go

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.089 

see<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> problem<00:03:32.709> with<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:32.950> doesn't

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
see this is a problem with it doesn't

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.599 
see this is a problem with it doesn't
spin<00:03:33.519> as<00:03:33.670> fast<00:03:33.959> we<00:03:34.959> can<00:03:35.140> get<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.530> long<00:03:36.310> grass

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
spin as fast we can get the long grass

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.539 
spin as fast we can get the long grass
tangled<00:03:37.150> up<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.890> pulls<00:03:39.099> out<00:03:39.280> but<00:03:39.430> it's

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
tangled up and it pulls out but it's

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.490 
tangled up and it pulls out but it's
just<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.760> pain<00:03:39.939> in<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.090> ass<00:03:46.019> be<00:03:47.019> careful<00:03:47.379> this

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
just a pain in the ass be careful this

00:03:47.500 --> 00:04:03.070 
just a pain in the ass be careful this
piece<00:03:48.430> right<00:03:48.579> here<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.939> get<00:03:49.060> hot

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.880 

see<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:07.280> gas<00:04:08.280> works<00:04:08.610> way<00:04:08.760> better<00:04:09.500> but<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.560> guess

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
see so gas works way better but I guess

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.480 
see so gas works way better but I guess
that<00:04:11.010> was<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.250> be<00:04:11.340> expected<00:04:13.310> all<00:04:14.310> right<00:04:14.490> thanks
