00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.590 

welcome<00:00:01.290> in<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:02.190> example<00:00:02.610> we<00:00:03.060> want<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.360> write

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
welcome in this example we want to write

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.760 
welcome in this example we want to write
the<00:00:03.899> linear<00:00:04.560> function<00:00:05.220> given<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.240> f<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:07.379> 3<00:00:07.740> is

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the linear function given that f of 3 is

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.000 
the linear function given that f of 3 is
negative<00:00:07.980> 2<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.880> f<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.750> negative<00:00:09.780> 12<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.559> equal

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
negative 2 and f of negative 12 is equal

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.030 
negative 2 and f of negative 12 is equal
to<00:00:11.099> 4<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:12.139> this<00:00:13.139> will<00:00:13.200> basically<00:00:13.500> look<00:00:13.980> like

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
to 4 and this will basically look like

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.010 
to 4 and this will basically look like
writing<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> equation<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.540> line<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.960> goes

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
writing the equation of a line that goes

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.230 
writing the equation of a line that goes
through<00:00:16.170> two<00:00:16.560> points<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.699> don't<00:00:17.910> want<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
through two points but we don't want the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.349 
through two points but we don't want the
notation<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> mess<00:00:19.080> us<00:00:19.260> up<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:21.000> our

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
notation to mess us up and this our

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.509 
notation to mess us up and this our
function<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.350> looking<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.830> has<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
function that we're looking for has a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.429 
function that we're looking for has a
few<00:00:24.000> inputs<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.570> outputs<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.080> here's<00:00:25.230> how<00:00:25.380> we

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
few inputs and outputs and here's how we

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.130 
few inputs and outputs and here's how we
read<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.180> says<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.779> when<00:00:28.019> we

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
read them so this one says that when we

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
read them so this one says that when we
give<00:00:28.320> 3<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.830> an<00:00:28.949> input<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.910> negative<00:00:30.269> 2<00:00:30.720> as

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
give 3 as an input we get negative 2 as

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.040 
give 3 as an input we get negative 2 as
an<00:00:31.410> output<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.090> give<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> an<00:00:33.540> input<00:00:33.750> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
an output and if we give it an input of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.119 
an output and if we give it an input of
negative<00:00:34.440> 12<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.579> an<00:00:35.700> output<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.239> 4<00:00:37.100> now<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
negative 12 we get an output of 4 now a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.190 
negative 12 we get an output of 4 now a
good<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> look<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.090> inputs<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.780> outputs

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
good way to look at inputs and outputs

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.030 
good way to look at inputs and outputs
is<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.950> terms<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:42.120> X's<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.750> Y's<00:00:43.040> our

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
is in terms of say X's and Y's our

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.549 
is in terms of say X's and Y's our
inputs<00:00:44.579> are<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> exes<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.719> our<00:00:45.840> outputs<00:00:46.350> are

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
inputs are the exes and our outputs are

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.459 
inputs are the exes and our outputs are
the<00:00:47.010> Y's<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.960> first<00:00:49.200> bit<00:00:49.379> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the Y's so from this first bit of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.959 
the Y's so from this first bit of
information<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.879> an<00:00:51.000> XY<00:00:51.300> pair<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.430> 3<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
information we have an XY pair a 3 and a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.350 
information we have an XY pair a 3 and a
negative<00:00:54.000> 2<00:00:55.820> from<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> next<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
negative 2 from the next bit of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.650 
negative 2 from the next bit of
information<00:00:57.949> we<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.190> an<00:00:59.489> input<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.329> negative

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
information we have an input of negative

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.820 
information we have an input of negative
12<00:01:00.840> an<00:01:01.469> output<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.129> 4<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> these<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> two

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
12 an output a 4 so these are the two

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.969 
12 an output a 4 so these are the two
points<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:06.590> first<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.890> use

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
points I will use first I'm gonna use

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.780 
points I will use first I'm gonna use
them<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> find<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.180> slope<00:01:10.460> recall<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
them to find my slope recall that the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.469 
them to find my slope recall that the
formula<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.330> slope<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.750> y2<00:01:13.290> minus<00:01:13.830> y1<00:01:14.479> divided

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
formula for slope is y2 minus y1 divided

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.060 
formula for slope is y2 minus y1 divided
by<00:01:15.570> x2<00:01:15.689> minus<00:01:17.119> x1

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
by x2 minus x1

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
by x2 minus x1
well<00:01:20.070> let's<00:01:20.220> plug<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.790> information<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
well let's plug in our information and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.859 
well let's plug in our information and
see<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.960> turns<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.430> 4<00:01:23.869> minus

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
see what this turns out to be so 4 minus

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.749 
see what this turns out to be so 4 minus
a<00:01:24.990> negative<00:01:25.290> 2<00:01:26.090> all<00:01:27.090> over<00:01:27.890> 8<00:01:28.890> negative<00:01:29.280> 12

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
a negative 2 all over 8 negative 12

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
a negative 2 all over 8 negative 12
minus<00:01:30.119> 3<00:01:31.400> all<00:01:32.400> right<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.759> simplify<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
minus 3 all right we simplify this so I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.569 
minus 3 all right we simplify this so I
have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> 4<00:01:35.700> plus<00:01:36.030> 2<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> top<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.369> looks

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
have a 4 plus 2 on the top and looks

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.440 
have a 4 plus 2 on the top and looks
like<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> negative<00:01:39.030> 15<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.140> bottom<00:01:41.450> giving

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
like a negative 15 on the bottom giving

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.700 
like a negative 15 on the bottom giving
me<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> final<00:01:42.899> answer<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.320> 6<00:01:44.100> over<00:01:44.520> negative<00:01:44.729> 15

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
me a final answer of 6 over negative 15

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.370 
me a final answer of 6 over negative 15
very<00:01:46.710> good<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.000> gives<00:01:48.299> us<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.780> slope<00:01:48.990> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
very good so this gives us the slope of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.219 
very good so this gives us the slope of
our<00:01:49.950> linear<00:01:50.310> function<00:01:50.899> now<00:01:51.899> let's<00:01:52.049> continue

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
our linear function now let's continue

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
our linear function now let's continue
on<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.700> use

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
on just a little bit more and use

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.800 
on just a little bit more and use
another<00:01:54.509> formula<00:01:55.140> known<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.619> point-slope

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.570 

we<00:02:02.810> were<00:02:02.990> we<00:02:03.470> are<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.890> plug<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.220> one<00:02:04.460> of

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
we were we are going to plug in one of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.999 
we were we are going to plug in one of
our<00:02:04.670> points<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:06.259> slope<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:06.830> found

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
our points and the slope we just found

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.670 
our points and the slope we just found
to<00:02:07.820> create<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.360> equation<00:02:09.550> alright<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:10.849> Y

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
to create that equation alright so Y

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.339 
to create that equation alright so Y
minus<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.780> keep<00:02:14.930> things<00:02:15.110> nice<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
minus and just to keep things nice and

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.780 
minus and just to keep things nice and
simple<00:02:15.620> I'm<00:02:15.830> just<00:02:16.040> gonna<00:02:16.130> borrow<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.550> first

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
simple I'm just gonna borrow the first

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.390 
simple I'm just gonna borrow the first
point<00:02:18.010> negative<00:02:19.010> 2<00:02:20.290> there's<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.650> slope<00:02:22.220> we

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
point negative 2 there's the slope we

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.110 
point negative 2 there's the slope we
found<00:02:22.670> negative<00:02:23.510> 6<00:02:23.900> 15<00:02:25.060> X<00:02:26.060> minus<00:02:26.870> 3<00:02:28.120> alright

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
found negative 6 15 X minus 3 alright

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
found negative 6 15 X minus 3 alright
that's<00:02:29.330> looking<00:02:29.450> pretty<00:02:29.599> good

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
that's looking pretty good

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.820 
that's looking pretty good
well<00:02:30.769> let's<00:02:30.920> simplify<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:33.050> then<00:02:33.709> we'll

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
well let's simplify this and then we'll

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.479 
well let's simplify this and then we'll
be<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.010> good<00:02:34.280> shape<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.760> y<00:02:35.360> plus<00:02:35.390> 2<00:02:36.160> equals<00:02:37.160> and

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
be in good shape so y plus 2 equals and

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.860 
be in good shape so y plus 2 equals and
of<00:02:37.970> course<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.360> will<00:02:38.569> distribute<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.470> in

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
of course we will distribute that in

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.410 
of course we will distribute that in
negative<00:02:41.870> 6<00:02:42.200> 15<00:02:42.980> X<00:02:45.730> positive<00:02:46.730> 6<00:02:47.739> fifths<00:02:49.420> all

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
negative 6 15 X positive 6 fifths all

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.289 
negative 6 15 X positive 6 fifths all
right<00:02:50.600> let's<00:02:50.840> see<00:02:51.019> one<00:02:51.260> last<00:02:51.530> step

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
right let's see one last step

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.580 
right let's see one last step
wouldn't<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.420> subtract<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
wouldn't you just subtract it to the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.090 
wouldn't you just subtract it to the
other<00:02:54.739> side<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:57.200> y<00:02:58.150> equals<00:02:59.150> negative<00:03:00.160> 6<00:03:01.450> 15<00:03:02.450> X

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
other side so y equals negative 6 15 X

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.460 
other side so y equals negative 6 15 X
and<00:03:04.390> 6<00:03:05.390> fifths<00:03:06.079> minus<00:03:06.140> 2<00:03:07.959> let's<00:03:08.959> see<00:03:09.140> what<00:03:09.350> will

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
and 6 fifths minus 2 let's see what will

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.990 
and 6 fifths minus 2 let's see what will
that<00:03:09.500> give<00:03:09.799> us<00:03:09.950> well<00:03:10.160> let's<00:03:10.670> do<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:10.940> way

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
that give us well let's do it this way

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.740 
that give us well let's do it this way
minus<00:03:11.959> 10<00:03:12.920> fifths<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.640> work<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.220> negative<00:03:17.440> 4/5

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
minus 10 fifths I work so a negative 4/5

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.080 
minus 10 fifths I work so a negative 4/5
now<00:03:20.750> that's<00:03:20.959> pretty<00:03:21.140> good<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.700> when<00:03:22.880> working

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
now that's pretty good but when working

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.910 
now that's pretty good but when working
with<00:03:23.329> functions<00:03:23.510> we<00:03:24.230> want<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.500> make<00:03:24.650> sure<00:03:24.769> that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
with functions we want to make sure that

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.509 
with functions we want to make sure that
we<00:03:25.040> use<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.459> notation<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.239> functions<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
we use the notation of functions so the

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.920 
we use the notation of functions so the
only<00:03:28.730> thing<00:03:29.060> I'm<00:03:29.150> going<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.329> do<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.570> this<00:03:29.690> is

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
only thing I'm going to do to this is

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.310 
only thing I'm going to do to this is
I'm<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.829> take<00:03:31.040> out<00:03:31.220> this<00:03:31.370> Y<00:03:31.870> or<00:03:32.870> replace

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
I'm going to take out this Y or replace

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.580 
I'm going to take out this Y or replace
it<00:03:33.350> with<00:03:33.920> an<00:03:34.190> f<00:03:34.579> of<00:03:34.940> X<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.840> my<00:03:38.989> final<00:03:39.260> answer

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
it with an f of X so my final answer

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.009 
it with an f of X so my final answer
becomes<00:03:40.810> f<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:42.140> X<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:42.620> equal<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:44.060> negative<00:03:44.569> 6

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
becomes f of X is equal to a negative 6

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.930 
becomes f of X is equal to a negative 6
15<00:03:45.530> X<00:03:46.489> minus<00:03:47.359> 4/5<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:49.190> you'd<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.609> see<00:03:49.790> some

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
15 X minus 4/5 if you'd like to see some

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.770 
15 X minus 4/5 if you'd like to see some
