00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello here is channel and handy today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.880
 the essay from way already comes with it 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.759
 times seen on the ces 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.929
 It is a very nice fountain as you 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.230
 already a bit to pack 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.390
 she is a yes is already one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.720
 smartphone actually a smartphone resp 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.310
 1 fans a really big device with the man 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 on the phone but can also call 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.519
 quasi a few advantages of a tablets 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.929
 Let's see what I am here 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.710
 hidden in the pack that it is now 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.079
 just arrived at our office 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.329
 yes here's the device it fills the whole 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.100
 pack it out it's over again 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.890
 Really bigger than me in my mind 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.160
 he found on the ces at the presentation 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 really gigantic and you have 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.250
 probably not one now 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 sunscreen conditions device because yes 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.360
 Everything only my hand is compared 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.629
 I would like to have two three devices 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.070
 but first of all you might hear it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.590
 Here in the packaging you can see it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.519
 here is still in it with me who one 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.460
 nice envelope with the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.490
 user manual here is everything 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.049
 currently in chinese is for me 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 a little hard to understand because of me 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.140
 this language has not been rated yet 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 Also this application here in Chinese 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.299
 otherwise in the packaging ago me that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.720
 micro usb cable with the connection on 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.210
 us 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.729
 that can be done here in the network 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 be plugged in here right now 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.630
 no european plug on it though 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 if you sell yourself that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 Here's why it does not come out here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.520
 pureblood in and then we would have here 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.600
 also a few headphones like that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.600
 button headphones that's what I 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.890
 Generally not so that's it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.729
 but that she really is with me 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.009
 but they are also very bad 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.210
 I would say 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.819
 you buy the team from them now but 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.340
 not necessarily the headphones here 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.330
 still a remote control with it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.680
 you can use your tablet on tv and then 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.830
 only just now shown from the really 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 which is really very big 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.510
 next very neat part 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.510
 quite his brummer for comparison 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:40.079
 The Samsung Galaxy S3 looks here 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.450
 Comparing how the s 3 and s tear 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.030
 now a little help and in comparison 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.989
 maybe also the htc evo 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.000
 And here you quickly realize that it 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.310
 So it really is a phone 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.359
 the best sake is no longer the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.299
 maybe it will happen then 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.829
 compare a bit better with that 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.450
 not so much bigger nexus 7 anymore 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.709
 one wants to part with the exclusive devices 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.019
 Of course you do not lead with me 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.290
 expresses the forms is also possible 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.520
 to call but we have more 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.010
 as a smartphone or 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.960
 is to brand you have to stop 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.190
 think about having such a thing on 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.770
 We would like to call on the phone 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.650
 have already as I said if she the 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.240
 Possibility us the device a bit 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.670
 to look more closely at the first hands-on 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.790
 from the processing here in any case 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.990
 everything alright clear all polycarbonate 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 So much plastic behind but what me 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.500
 Quite well, there are no limits 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.720
 surface by causing grease stains 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.430
 not so fast so fingerprints 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.960
 In any case we find our dream 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.310
 Quite ok because this is the device 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.840
 just generally longer clean out 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.920
 otherwise the processing as I said 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.480
 is decent up here as well 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.530
 the sd card in or out 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.410
 micro sd card machine is getting on 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:16.760
 which is then inserted here and yes 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 down here space for the micro usb cable 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.280
 connection and yes a little funny 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.740
 that on this monstrous device here 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.960
 such an unbelievably small speaker 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.890
 is installed 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.480
 if you now probably still a 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.360
 a bit more space around there 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.030
 install a little more 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.590
 So 6 1 inch display is already real 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.540
 I can be quite tall for you 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.980
 I think I'm usually 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.830
 use the 0 2 I currently have 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.830
 unfortunately not what is broken 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:55.930
 But I think that as a device to which 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.970
 just at the top are 55 55 inches 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.010
 461 is really just a bit too 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.360
 Of course, it's great for me 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.100
 handy if you are somebody who 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.900
 very little defined and so now and then 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.280
 Maybe then a phone call 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.370
 one can accept then also over the 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.479
 make headphones 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.289
 bluetooth headset or so then you have to 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.120
 the ear hold otherwise yes i 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.400
 find it up to small from 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.400
 Tablets like mad are perfect for me 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.840
 and just too big for a value of 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.319
 smartlab too big for a smartphone 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.720
 anyway 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.970
 yes I'll leave this one here 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.120
 set up a bit so good then 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.330
 here in the green puts more emphasis on it 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.889
 even survive in everyday life 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.659
 and let's see if she gets upset 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.340
 I hope you are in the first place 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.750
 Boxing has pleased you so much 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.219
 As I said, then something follows 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.379
 more detailed fans 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.240
 otherwise you can also confess 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.050
 should look at that we end ts 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.419
 have turned 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.800
 I wish the clock until the next 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.800
 goodbye
