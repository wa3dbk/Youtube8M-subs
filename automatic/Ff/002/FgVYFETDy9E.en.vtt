now he's an 84 rated center defensive it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.770 
now he's an 84 rated center defensive it
so<00:01:53.610> he<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:54.030> declined<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> much

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so he really has declined that much

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
so he really has declined that much
either<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> he<00:01:55.710> still<00:01:55.950> got<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:56.130> nice<00:01:56.399> stats

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.980 
either and he still got some nice stats
and<00:01:56.939> then<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> legend<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.810> himself
