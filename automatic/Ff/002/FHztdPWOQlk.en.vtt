00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.970
 And here's the game from the middle of the ps4 site. 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 also linked to that channel on youtube 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.750
 beauty people who speaks open 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.969
 bringing another video in this video as 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 You can see I'm going to talk and get it. 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.430
 or do not buy the 1886 order won from 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.160
 my opinion about the game that I're 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 here are some topics to talk about and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.000
 I will not really get very good 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.189
 of the opinion that I think about the game and there 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.590
 in the end I'll give you a little note there 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.750
 It's up to you and you decide if you buy 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.340
 or so it is not then there is first 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 starting with the history of the game, I 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.210
 I think the story of the game is one of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.640
 his strongest points do not order 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.920
 because the order size that unification 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.140
 they created a very fucking storyline 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.850
 not only within the game but a universe 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.219
 in yes they created the fictitious city 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 that you have elements of real life there 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.910
 in the story that we already know by 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.940
 example with historical characters such as 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.530
 renato nor has ponticelli is the city 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.020
 who are walking that we know and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.129
 I did not even see them mention various things in the world. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 reality that we know only 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.600
 The game universe is very cool because 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 so you know a little bit of history 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.860
 on which is game based will you have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.540
 some points of the law, for example with a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.180
 round table that many historians 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.820
 They already told us at school and that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.159
 has also in the game is with a table 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.259
 round that has several knights is to give 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.509
 an order is the order that is also 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.700
 done in the game is a very cool thing to 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.920
 The story of the game is very deep. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.020
 Only she has a problem, it's not so well. 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.270
 I told you in the game, when, for example, 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.530
 When I started I was kind of strong. 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.840
 snow including the first and second 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.430
 video I was well put on because I did not 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.890
 I knew what was happening she has 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.140
 many things that happen during the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.540
 game you get lost in the history of 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.220
 The way she's told it's so shallow. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.170
 do not know basically what is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 happening I would say until you have 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.530
 that being in-depth she out of the game 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.939
 to be able to understand what is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.880
 happening then this is something that 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.130
 complicates because if you kind of oblige 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.860
 the guy is playing research a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 thing outside that is outside the game of 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.670
 independent movie and game review 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.020
 search anything out of that for 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.780
 understand what's going on I think this 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.179
 It's a faulty point and the time has it. 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 he puts several things there several 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.989
 elements already exist dialog well the rÃ©ver 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.630
 there are some of them that have to do with 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.520
 story that I 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.080
 I did not understand why he did not make a 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.110
 right presentation of that character 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.790
 or that moment at last and you end up 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.620
 getting lost half europe for example 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.210
 in the beginning i got well in caracas 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 story is unfolding I think 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.590
 that the story is not cool but then I do not 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.550
 I'll insist, let's play and then 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.530
 story was beginning to get 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.840
 interesting there through the game started 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.390
 to understand almost what was happening 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.890
 I decide to search the internet for a 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.060
 A little more about the game understands some 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.530
 thing was happening 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.630
 but I think as I said just one point 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.910
 failed because the game tells a story 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.460
 very interesting but he does not know 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.500
 So tell me is I think this is the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.150
 biggest problem of order in his history. 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 is very good but producers do not 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.510
 they knew about her 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.430
 Because there's a lot going on now, see what 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.230
 happens there that no one cares and 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.660
 unfortunately the game catches on this question is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.100
 Another cool thing is the gameplay of 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.990
 game think the game the gameplay 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.060
 interesting things, but it may not 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.260
 to please most people because 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.330
 there are people who do not like for example 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.130
 reveals a style of play that you do not 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.560
 play you always go pressing buttons 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.360
 you expect the game to play for you 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.100
 see what will happen and some 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.720
 actually order only happen because the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.910
 game does not give you a big freedom I 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.500
 I would say until what time he has elements of 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.960
 several games knew that the euro has 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.600
 elements of heavy rain elements of 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.090
 quick time events flower group many 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.220
 things mixed there a single game and I have 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.840
 the cinematic camera jueb 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.100
 I think if they pulled 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.140
 pretty boring, huh? 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 then all this mixed leave one 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.280
 complicated there depending on the 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.570
 style of your playing style instead of 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.220
 when you are walking you 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.810
 simply can not run the 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.750
 things take a while to happen 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.980
 you are one has a huge 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.630
 a dialogue between the corridors 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.910
 character talking when you are 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.590
 walking you're bound to bounce 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.600
 analogue and listen 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.830
 that dialogue then this can be annoying 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.480
 Some players do not want me. 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.910
 It bothers me because I find this interesting. 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.890
 type is gameplay but for some 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.840
 players can be annoying because you 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.330
 really does not play the game is giving a 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.220
 freedom for you to control and 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.390
 character but you are required to see the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.700
 dialogue is bound to pass that 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.130
 huge corridor can two minutes 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.630
 times seven minutes of dialogue that the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.240
 The secretary is seeing in the pool that 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.220
 would be more interesting then this is the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.290
 gameplay I find interesting but 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.800
 It's up to you whether you like this 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.169
 style of 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.449
 or is not another point that I found well 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.099
 annoying thing is his cover system . 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.110
 It's a lot of people said it very well, but I 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.940
 I did not like it so much because when you pick it up 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.750
 the cover in this game depending on where 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.500
 You get it, you get into the scenario. 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.479
 a wall 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.159
 You take like that wall and this love. 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.509
 simply does not let you see what's on 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.310
 happening you have to put a 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.020
 logic up the character gives a 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.970
 Standing there you can see the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.159
 what is happening just that it 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.020
 it bothers a bit because actually games 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.460
 no one has the cover right 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.020
 when the character of 5 is mine 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.610
 the camera to adapt to when you 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.139
 can see your character and 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.060
 able to see the scenery that you 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.319
 You can see the enemies to have you 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.090
 get up and shoot right 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.219
 In this game you have to do an action to 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.020
 beyond the cover ie you press the 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.729
 circle to get the cover 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.009
 You have to put it in the store and 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.479
 Watch then every once in a while I finish 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.090
 forgetting that I have put myself in the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.560
 shop up the cable is the world look me 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.030
 I get a little annoyed after I get 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.169
 remember and put the camera up at 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.639
 times the angle also 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.289
 even when the camera is facing up is not 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.180
 so cool then I think the system of 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.250
 run a little bad but nothing that 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.960
 hinder the gameplay from having you in 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.810
 some moments really in some 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.270
 places that have a very strange run 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.639
 but overall I think when you pick it up 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.810
 occur on the standing wall looks great 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.580
 but when you take the government in a 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.919
 so some boxes really wall 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.169
 bothers some guys okay and 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.060
 basically this is opinion about the 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.509
 I play a quick game here. 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.610
 on history or become law 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.349
 I think it is worth it but if you have 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.029
 a price a playstation 4 is worth 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.069
 you bought oil to play 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.259
 okay I think it's a game is a good 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:04.629
 exclusive of playstation 4 far from being 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.330
 what companies ride they do 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.219
 reviews said of the game that since the 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.659
 game is very game has this that the game only 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.490
 have to finish the game is far from 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.110
 Being this game is an interesting game to 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.000
 His story is very fucking if you like 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.169
 of a game that has a good story and 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.120
 your game for you 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.979
 only that business is not a game that 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.229
 Comes console I think it's not a game 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.759
 that comes from playstation 4 if you want 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.080
 buy one of these packages work reveals 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.819
 order I think you should not do 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.500
 this but if you have a prestige 14 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.389
 obviously going to buy for those 14 to 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.979
 play a boring in the future think it's worth 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.460
 Worth it but it's not the game that sells 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:38.289
 playstation 4 is not a weight exclusive 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.020
 that bob that puts the mark 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.490
 playstation made and leave loading 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.530
 no but it's not bad it's not like 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.250
 this review was saying none of this 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.020
 I'd give you a note to 8.5 he's I 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.970
 I think it's a lack of cooperative in 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.759
 a copy photo of a line in the game 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.919
 greatly diminished this note because I think 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.569
 that the cooperative the law would be too fucking 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.819
 since it has four characters four 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.590
 knights put copy to play 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.659
 with four friends it would be well outside places 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.680
 parallel history is a spin-off beyond 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:05.970
 of the campaign 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.129
 It would be interesting but unfortunately 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.039
 does not have the game ends up putting 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:13.560
 all the pressure in the campaign and 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:15.360
 failed in some points but as I said it is 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.849
 An interesting game I think it's worth 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.289
 Worth playing but if you do not have much 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.479
 money for example you do not have 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:23.340
 money to buy or have no precision 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:26.880
 four do not do not with playstation 4 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.440
 to play it and do not despair 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.819
 to buy it it waits a little bit 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.340
 money milk for him to lower the price 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.900
 to be able to buy and beauty then guys 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.039
 basically it does not seem like this 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.719
 video of my opinion about the game 

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.280
 I hope it has become clear what 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:40.199
 I talked about the gameplay about 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.419
 history and must have complicated a 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:44.729
 little but it 's just my opinion on the 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.319
 game if you played it gives your opinion 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:48.060
 here in the comments also that you 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.740
 found it ok I saw many people 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.539
 speaking in the comments my videos of 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.800
 game time was not so bad that 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:55.139
 the game was really interesting not 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.699
 comment below you have already reset the 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:58.889
 game are you still playing 

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:59.940
 You think it's beauty, that's it. 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:01.590
 stay with God 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.599
 until the next video here on channel one 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.599
 I hug people and I was well
