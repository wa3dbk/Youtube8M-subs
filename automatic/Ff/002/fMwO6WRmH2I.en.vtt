 snow avalanche

 alltours weird Kenzie 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.670
 the film images and the eruption of a large avalanche, the author has strange 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.649
 Kenzie 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.319
 even filmed in Colorado 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.259
 As a guideline are primarily large masses of snow or ice 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.440
 designated 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.510
 which detach themselves from mountain slopes and slip or tumble Tom Tal 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.769
 the term avalanche is also used in connection with other slips 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.039
 Materials used 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.770
 Common examples are only pours the 1 Gorilla or mudslides 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.990
 reluctant hand 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.990
 take again and again 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.230
 the big Sachs 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.580
 Persons or environmental damage cause besides counted to the natural disasters 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.460
 A roof avalanche is a snow avalanche in the small 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.000
 Mark for slab avalanches is a lines Farmiga declared to respect 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.240
 close 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.340
 Extensive layers of snow cover often spew snow first 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.150
 connected 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.640
 In the course of departure, a slab avalanche can turn into a floor 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.110
 Develop Lena 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.200
 they represent the classic driven avalanche for snow sports and 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.030
 Climber dar 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.300
 Victims of such an avalanche often do not die of suffocation 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.390
 but of injuries due to circles on rocks 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.490
 crashes or pressure of tons heavy snow masses 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.800
 the term slab is a bit misleading so he came one 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 hard modesty 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.119
 in reality, however, also come in many areas 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.180
 hard to recognize drifting snow 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.270
 plane avalanches trigger 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.760
 There are many factors involved in the formation of an avalanche 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 reinforce or weaken each other 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.140
 One can not imagine the emergence of an avalanche regardless of the type of avalanche 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.620
 For example, there are snow avalanches on snowboards and in the castle 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.870
 are pretty different processes 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.870
 Even the dangers of skin healing is very different 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 for all varieties of avalanche money 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.479
 the risk of an avalanche loss is between 25 degrees signs on Hong lines 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.780
 and 45 ° mark especially high 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.530
 a stronger slope generally favors avalanche loss 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.849
 Compare the forces on the inclined plane 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.739
 The most important thing is the steepest point 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.030
 about 10 times 10 m 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.359
 in trade 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.789
 a significant role is played by the slope 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.910
 north and northeast we are 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.380
 in northern latitudes 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.800
 Sun exposure least exposed 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.640
 which causes the slowdown of relaxation and degradation 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.030
 Hardening of the snowpack slows down and danger spots are conserved longer 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.109
 become 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.049
 Land cover is another factor in the formation of avalanches 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.679
 affected 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.929
 Dense forest can complicate the departure of snowboards Kelsey the 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:03.099
 Ground favoring the departure of Gunter Wienen favored depressed 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.800
 Ehlert Chen 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.879
 as a grass and honest 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.069
 the departure of Grundler Wienen 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.739
 snow-covered mature or as layers »favor avalanches 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.849
 especially for lay the snow and dust avalanches is just no obstacle 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.430
 smith 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.269
 especially fresh snow 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.209
 can be shipped by the wind 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.889
 clearly asks Dieter Schmied 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.530
 so called snowdrift 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.120
 lay on the windward side of roast in gutters and hollows 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120
 or leaning facing foot from hanging 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.739
 At Gratin it forms snowdrifts and snow surfaces 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.069
 this shipped snow can be under great stress 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.259
 so even the smallest pieces of an outside flow for a trip 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.969
 can suffice 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.559
 Drift snow can be both hard and soft and is therefore not easy 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:53.909
 to recognize 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.460
 even after snowing through the following snowfall 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.599
 he retains his danger potential 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.629
 when a lot of snow comes to rest on a slope in a short time 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.319
 the load on the snowpack increases faster due to the additional weight 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.319
 as the session and consolidation can progress 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.029
 the pressure on the lower layers becomes so great 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.489
 that they no longer withstand the load 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.960
 already low additional load, for example, the weight of a skier 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.870
 can lead to 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.870
 that the snow layers slip and make it an avalanche 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.289
 coming 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.279
 especially in Serbia, wet snow and drifting snow are down to the bottom 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.489
 embedded in the snow cover intermediate layers, for example hoarfrost 

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.870
 Floating snow or ice paralyzing Allan 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.880
 contribute to the aggravation of the situation and form the dress horizons 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.029
 which the overlying snow cover slips off 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.720
 the lower the temperature the longer it takes 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.789
 until layers of fresh snow solidify 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.949
 however, rising temperatures can increase the avalanche danger 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.069
 when the snowpack is destabilized 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.340
 this instability is caused by the transformation of snow crystals or 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:11.740
 Moisture to the ground 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.590
 basically every change of temperature has a change of 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.560
