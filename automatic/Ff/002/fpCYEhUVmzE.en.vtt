00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:18.960 

I<00:00:16.320> couldn't<00:00:17.320> sleep<00:00:17.560> one<00:00:17.859> night<00:00:17.890> and<00:00:18.100> I<00:00:18.670> was

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
I couldn't sleep one night and I was

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.430 
I couldn't sleep one night and I was
just<00:00:19.000> stifled<00:00:19.720> hopes<00:00:19.840> of<00:00:19.990> things<00:00:20.170> going

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
just stifled hopes of things going

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.410 
just stifled hopes of things going
around<00:00:20.560> in<00:00:20.800> my<00:00:20.890> head<00:00:21.070> and<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.820> think<00:00:22.060> I'd<00:00:22.180> like

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
around in my head and I think I'd like

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.270 
around in my head and I think I'd like
bought<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.780> map<00:00:23.110> from<00:00:23.320> a<00:00:23.470> charity<00:00:23.860> shop<00:00:24.039> that

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
bought a map from a charity shop that

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.990 
bought a map from a charity shop that
day<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:25.289> very<00:00:26.289> rarely<00:00:26.430> work<00:00:27.430> on<00:00:27.640> anything

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
day I very rarely work on anything

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.510 
day I very rarely work on anything
that's<00:00:28.210> not<00:00:28.420> figurative<00:00:29.320> it's<00:00:30.310> just

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
that's not figurative it's just

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.859 
that's not figurative it's just
something<00:00:30.730> about<00:00:30.850> the<00:00:31.180> human<00:00:31.330> figure<00:00:31.720> that<00:00:31.840> I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
something about the human figure that I

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.349 
something about the human figure that I
like<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.469> get<00:00:32.590> across<00:00:32.800> in<00:00:32.980> my<00:00:33.100> work<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:33.789> it's

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
like to get across in my work and it's

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.170 
like to get across in my work and it's
always<00:00:34.570> interesting<00:00:34.840> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.850> a<00:00:36.910> lot<00:00:37.090> of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
always interesting I think a lot of

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.139 
always interesting I think a lot of
people<00:00:37.510> think<00:00:38.140> that<00:00:38.410> perhaps<00:00:38.890> I<00:00:39.430> kind<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.880> look

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
people think that perhaps I kind of look

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.210 
people think that perhaps I kind of look
for<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.750> face<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.350> perhaps<00:00:41.470> in<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:41.860> map<00:00:42.010> to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
for a face and perhaps in the map to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.280 
for a face and perhaps in the map to
begin<00:00:42.489> with<00:00:42.700> or<00:00:42.880> I'll<00:00:43.660> look<00:00:43.870> for<00:00:44.110> certain

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
begin with or I'll look for certain

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.530 
begin with or I'll look for certain
structures<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.220> know<00:00:45.370> almost<00:00:45.700> like<00:00:45.880> seeing

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
structures you know almost like seeing

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.139 
structures you know almost like seeing
shapes<00:00:46.899> in<00:00:47.140> clouds<00:00:47.170> but<00:00:47.860> generally<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:48.790> find

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
shapes in clouds but generally I find

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.350 
shapes in clouds but generally I find
that<00:00:49.450> any<00:00:50.140> portrait<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:51.219> can<00:00:51.550> fit<00:00:51.820> onto<00:00:52.030> almost

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
that any portrait I can fit onto almost

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.069 
that any portrait I can fit onto almost
any<00:00:52.809> map<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.340> more<00:00:54.489> closer<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:55.030> map<00:00:55.210> the

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
any map but the more closer the map the

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.440 
any map but the more closer the map the
best<00:00:56.469> of<00:00:56.590> escape<00:00:56.920> because<00:00:57.250> there's<00:00:58.120> so<00:00:58.300> much

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
best of escape because there's so much

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.450 
best of escape because there's so much
pattern<00:00:58.899> there<00:00:59.140> there<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.530> just<00:00:59.770> so<00:00:59.980> much<00:01:00.190> as

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
pattern there there is just so much as

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.520 
pattern there there is just so much as
it's<00:01:00.790> all<00:01:00.969> sitting<00:01:01.629> there<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.079> it's<00:01:02.230> just<00:01:02.289> a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
it's all sitting there and it's just a

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.499 
it's all sitting there and it's just a
case<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.739> burning<00:01:03.219> out<00:01:03.370> those<00:01:03.579> particular

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
case of burning out those particular

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.580 
case of burning out those particular
details

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.969 

I<00:01:07.880> look<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.810> person<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I look at the person that I'm going to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
I look at the person that I'm going to
draw<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> portrait<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.299> subjects

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
draw the portrait or look at my subjects

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
draw the portrait or look at my subjects
in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> figure<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.250> I'll<00:01:14.460> look<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> map

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
in the figure and I'll look at the map

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
in the figure and I'll look at the map
as<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.740> I'll<00:01:16.890> try<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> make<00:01:17.369> links

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
as well and I'll try to make links

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.090 
as well and I'll try to make links
between<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.360> my<00:01:18.810> head<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.200> could<00:01:19.470> look<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
between them my head I could look at a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910 
between them my head I could look at a
map<00:01:20.579> for<00:01:21.210> maybe<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.539> hour<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:22.289> just<00:01:22.560> sitting<00:01:22.770> on

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
map for maybe an hour or just sitting on

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.649 
map for maybe an hour or just sitting on
I<00:01:23.189> look<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.000> I'll<00:01:24.210> compare<00:01:24.539> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I look at the two and I'll compare the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
I look at the two and I'll compare the
two<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.320> head<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.890> make<00:01:26.100> bridges<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
two in my head or I make bridges and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.190 
two in my head or I make bridges and
that's<00:01:27.179> when<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> start<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> build<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that's when I start to build with the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.100 
that's when I start to build with the
framework<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:30.110> can

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
framework and then from there I can

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:46.959 
framework and then from there I can
pretty<00:01:31.710> much<00:01:31.799> synchronize<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.939> two<00:01:32.970> across

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.270 

the<00:01:47.840> one<00:01:47.990> thing<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.320> I<00:01:48.409> really<00:01:49.009> enjoyed

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
the one thing that I really enjoyed

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.370 
the one thing that I really enjoyed
about<00:01:49.369> working<00:01:49.909> on<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.210> Bartholomew<00:01:51.020> series

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
about working on the Bartholomew series

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.919 
about working on the Bartholomew series
was<00:01:51.679> that<00:01:51.819> it<00:01:52.819> was<00:01:52.969> nice<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.420> be<00:01:53.450> able<00:01:53.630> to

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
was that it was nice to be able to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.160 
was that it was nice to be able to
illustrate<00:01:54.969> those<00:01:55.969> people<00:01:56.420> actually<00:01:56.780> had<00:01:57.140> a

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
illustrate those people actually had a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.249 
illustrate those people actually had a
hand<00:01:57.409> in<00:01:57.679> making<00:01:58.270> their<00:01:59.270> respective<00:01:59.780> maps<00:02:00.020> it

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
hand in making their respective maps it

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.380 
hand in making their respective maps it
was<00:02:00.380> almost<00:02:00.530> like<00:02:00.859> paying<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.789> kind<00:02:01.999> of<00:02:02.090> homage

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
was almost like paying a kind of homage

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:16.680 
was almost like paying a kind of homage
to<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.990> bottle<00:02:03.319> in<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.530> family

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.320 

I<00:02:16.720> was<00:02:17.350> pleased<00:02:17.650> with<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.890> final<00:02:18.040> outcome<00:02:18.340> it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
I was pleased with the final outcome it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.880 
I was pleased with the final outcome it
was<00:02:19.450> great<00:02:19.660> working<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.350> new<00:02:20.650> Bartholomew

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
was great working on the new Bartholomew

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.160 
was great working on the new Bartholomew
series<00:02:21.640> particularly<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.990> their

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
series particularly on to their

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:51.640 
series particularly on to their
respective<00:02:23.650> Maps<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.270> was<00:02:25.450> happy<00:02:25.630> over
