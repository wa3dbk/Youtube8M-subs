mine<00:03:07.670> over<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.090> entire<00:03:08.420> nose<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.109> more

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
mine over the entire nose for a more

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.289 
mine over the entire nose for a more
deadly<00:03:09.590> appearance<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.760> can<00:03:10.940> draw<00:03:11.150> it

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299
