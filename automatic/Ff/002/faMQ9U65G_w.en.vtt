here's<00:00:04.410> my<00:00:05.660> 1989<00:00:06.660> Kawasaki<00:00:07.499> Jet<00:00:07.529> made<00:00:07.890> project

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
here's my 1989 Kawasaki Jet made project

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.430 
here's my 1989 Kawasaki Jet made project
I've<00:00:09.150> been<00:00:09.210> working<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.929> put<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.379> ZX<00:00:11.509> 900<00:00:12.509> ZXI

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
I've been working on I put a ZX 900 ZXI

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.040 
I've been working on I put a ZX 900 ZXI
900<00:00:13.950> engine<00:00:15.200> see<00:00:16.200> here<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:18.000> wiring<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.510> I'm

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
900 engine see here the wiring and I'm

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.929 
900 engine see here the wiring and I'm
still<00:00:19.320> adjusting<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.220> wiring<00:00:20.519> and<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.730> that

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
still adjusting the wiring and all that

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.410 
still adjusting the wiring and all that
as<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.779> see<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> had<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> cut<00:00:23.090> cut<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.210> out

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
as you can see I had to cut cut this out

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.210 
as you can see I had to cut cut this out
to<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> fit<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:27.539> original<00:00:27.810> motor<00:00:28.650> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
to get it to fit the original motor that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.490 
to get it to fit the original motor that
was<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> had<00:00:29.759> a<00:00:29.789> smaller<00:00:30.210> tub<00:00:30.900> area<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
was in it had a smaller tub area so I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
was in it had a smaller tub area so I
had<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> actually<00:00:32.610> cut<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.090> invert<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
had to actually cut it and invert it and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.049 
had to actually cut it and invert it and
glass<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.770> there<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> ZXI<00:00:35.850> motor

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
glass it in there to get the ZXI motor

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.299 
glass it in there to get the ZXI motor
to<00:00:36.210> fit<00:00:36.440> but<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> used<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> stock

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
to fit but you can see I used a stock

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.110 
to fit but you can see I used a stock
pipe<00:00:38.989> no<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.230> box<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.860> had<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.520> trim

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
pipe no water box I had to actually trim

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.549 
pipe no water box I had to actually trim
the<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.800> inner<00:00:43.950> tub<00:00:44.460> area<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.910> fit<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:46.379> fit

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the the inner tub area to fit the to fit

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.880 
the the inner tub area to fit the to fit
the<00:00:46.649> pipe<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.239> had<00:00:48.660> also<00:00:48.930> put<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the pipe so and I had also put in a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
the pipe so and I had also put in a
larger<00:00:50.250> exhaust<00:00:50.640> diameter<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
larger exhaust diameter here so that it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.400 
larger exhaust diameter here so that it
can<00:00:52.770> accommodate<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.489> low<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.120> flow<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
can accommodate and low to flow so it's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
can accommodate and low to flow so it's
just<00:00:55.620> gonna<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.949> baffled<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.789> water<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
just gonna be baffled with the water so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
just gonna be baffled with the water so
I'll<00:00:58.289> add<00:00:58.530> another<00:00:58.680> jet<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.640> water

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I'll add another jet in there of water

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
I'll add another jet in there of water
to<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.600> too<00:01:00.899> loud<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.250> see

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to see if it's too loud so you can see

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
to see if it's too loud so you can see
the<00:01:02.519> paint<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.600> here

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the paint that I got on here

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
the paint that I got on here
it's<00:01:04.620> just<00:01:05.450> custom<00:01:06.450> colors<00:01:06.750> by<00:01:07.460> TCB<00:01:08.460> global

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's just custom colors by TCB global

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.170 
it's just custom colors by TCB global
they<00:01:09.600> sell<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.960> paint<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:11.550> use<00:01:11.700> candy<00:01:12.150> I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they sell a paint that they use candy I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.670 
they sell a paint that they use candy I
just<00:01:12.420> decided<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.080> use<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.410> silver

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
just decided just to use the silver

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.400 
just decided just to use the silver
sparkling<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.550> then<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.540> holographic

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
sparkling and then this holographic

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.850 
sparkling and then this holographic
stuff<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.360> micro<00:01:18.360> prism<00:01:18.870> holographic

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
stuff is just micro prism holographic

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.310 
stuff is just micro prism holographic
flake<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> put<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> clear<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.170> can

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
flake that I put in the clear so you can

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.860 
flake that I put in the clear so you can
see<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.980> got<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:24.030> candy<00:01:24.510> painted

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
see so I got these are candy painted

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.020 
see so I got these are candy painted
they're<00:01:25.050> not<00:01:25.200> anodized<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.070> used<00:01:26.550> candy

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
they're not anodized so I used candy

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
they're not anodized so I used candy
paint<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.900> paint<00:01:28.050> this<00:01:28.260> I<00:01:28.380> got<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.620> touch<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
paint to paint this I got to touch this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.940 
paint to paint this I got to touch this
up<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.550> put<00:01:30.120> it<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.330> rub<00:01:30.510> rails

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
up a little bit put it in the rub rails

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.190 
up a little bit put it in the rub rails
you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.580> so<00:01:32.910> I'm<00:01:33.660> still<00:01:33.900> working<00:01:34.140> on

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you can see here so I'm still working on

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.650 
you can see here so I'm still working on
the<00:01:34.320> project<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.030> hopefully<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.150> wrap<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> up

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
the project so hopefully we wrap it up

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.620 
the project so hopefully we wrap it up
by<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.870> Easter<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.400> mount<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.150> hardware

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
by this Easter it up mount the hardware

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
by this Easter it up mount the hardware
back<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.710> had<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.420> navigation

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
back on here and I also had a navigation

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.360 
back on here and I also had a navigation
light<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.170> some<00:01:43.770> lead<00:01:43.980> level<00:01:44.310> in

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
light up here to some lead level in

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.610 
light up here to some lead level in
darker<00:01:44.970> hours<00:01:45.300> so<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.260> other<00:01:46.410> thing<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
darker hours so and the other thing that

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.230 
darker hours so and the other thing that
I<00:01:46.770> did<00:01:46.980> on<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.160> modification<00:01:47.730> is<00:01:47.880> put<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.150> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
I did on the modification is put in a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.230 
I did on the modification is put in a
chime<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.410> is<00:01:49.590> big<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.130> jet<00:01:50.370> mates<00:01:50.580> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
chime this is big with jet mates you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
chime this is big with jet mates you
have<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> actually<00:01:51.800> if<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.160> want<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
have to actually if you don't want to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
have to actually if you don't want to
get<00:01:53.460> wet<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.850> happens<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.600> water

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
get wet what happens is the water

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.620 
get wet what happens is the water
splashes<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.190> then<00:01:56.790> sprays<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
splashes up and then sprays you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.480 
splashes up and then sprays you
so<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.110> deflects<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.740> water<00:01:58.920> downward<00:01:59.190> you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
so this deflects the water downward you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.400 
so this deflects the water downward you
can<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.270> small<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.080> but<00:02:01.230> it's

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
can see it's just a small one but it's

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.010 
can see it's just a small one but it's
very<00:02:01.560> effective<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.940> I've<00:02:03.120> basically<00:02:03.270> built

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
very effective so I've basically built

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.590 
very effective so I've basically built
it<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.260> of<00:02:04.290> wood<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.910> bondo<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.060> fiberglass

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
it out of wood and bondo and fiberglass

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.070 
it out of wood and bondo and fiberglass
so<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.680> works<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.340> does<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> job<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
so and it works it does the job so

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.650 
so and it works it does the job so
anyways

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
anyways

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.080 
anyways
see<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.140> other<00:02:12.170> modifications<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.160> here<00:02:13.790> you

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
see the other modifications on here you

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.530 
see the other modifications on here you
can<00:02:14.210> see<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:14.510> using<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> ZXI<00:02:15.440> gauges<00:02:16.430> here<00:02:16.610> so

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
can see I'm using the ZXI gauges here so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.200 
can see I'm using the ZXI gauges here so
I'll<00:02:17.930> have<00:02:18.260> but<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.740> took<00:02:18.860> away<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.340> trim<00:02:19.610> and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
I'll have but I took away the trim and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.330 
I'll have but I took away the trim and
I'm<00:02:20.360> adding<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.890> temperature<00:02:21.890> gauge<00:02:22.070> so<00:02:22.280> I'm

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
I'm adding a temperature gauge so I'm

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.250 
I'm adding a temperature gauge so I'm
going<00:02:22.460> to<00:02:22.490> put<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.670> number<00:02:22.940> three<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:24.110> we'll

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
going to put on number three so we'll

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.780 
going to put on number three so we'll
see<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.070> see<00:02:25.100> what<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.370> did<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.700> took

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
see but you can see what I did is I took

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.860 
see but you can see what I did is I took
the<00:02:25.940> ZXI<00:02:27.730> plastic<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.240> used<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.510> heat<00:02:29.660> gun

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the ZXI plastic and I used the heat gun

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.810 
the ZXI plastic and I used the heat gun
and<00:02:29.900> melted<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.410> out<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.740> cut<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.670> can

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
and melted it out and cut it and you can

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.120 
and melted it out and cut it and you can
see<00:02:32.000> here<00:02:32.240> how<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.450> would<00:02:32.690> slit<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.950> I'm<00:02:34.010> going

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
see here how I would slit so I'm going

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.290 
see here how I would slit so I'm going
to<00:02:34.190> mount<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> board<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.150> I

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
to mount this on a board that I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.960 
to mount this on a board that I
fiberglassed<00:02:36.250> rezoned<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.460> I'm<00:02:37.850> gonna

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
fiberglassed rezoned and I'm gonna

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.020 
fiberglassed rezoned and I'm gonna
pollster<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.020> gonna<00:02:39.110> bolt<00:02:39.380> into<00:02:39.620> it

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
pollster so this is gonna bolt into it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.270 
pollster so this is gonna bolt into it
so<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.900> wires<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.380> basically<00:02:42.830> just<00:02:42.980> ran

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
so the wires that basically just ran

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.240 
so the wires that basically just ran
here<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:44.420> cut<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.930> hole<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.170> I'm<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:45.950> gonna<00:02:46.040> go

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
here I cut a hole and I'm just gonna go

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.620 
here I cut a hole and I'm just gonna go
underneath<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.640> carpet<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.210> keep<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.600> hid<00:02:49.630> oh

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
underneath the carpet so keep it hid oh

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.460 
underneath the carpet so keep it hid oh
this<00:02:51.350> is<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> oxide<00:02:51.860> gas<00:02:52.610> pump<00:02:53.020> or<00:02:54.020> if<00:02:54.110> not<00:02:54.260> gas

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
this is the oxide gas pump or if not gas

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.270 
this is the oxide gas pump or if not gas
pump<00:02:54.740> at<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.890> get<00:02:55.160> ZXI<00:02:56.410> adjustable<00:02:57.410> resort

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
pump at the get ZXI adjustable resort

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.210 
pump at the get ZXI adjustable resort
reservoir<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.510> off<00:02:59.660> I<00:03:00.020> got<00:03:00.710> mounted<00:03:01.130> on

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
reservoir on and off I got mounted on

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.350 
reservoir on and off I got mounted on
here<00:03:01.490> on<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.690> jet<00:03:03.110> mate<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:04.250> then<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.940> used<00:03:05.240> the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
here on the jet mate and then I used the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.810 
here on the jet mate and then I used the
sensor<00:03:05.720> here<00:03:05.990> from<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.460> I<00:03:07.490> can<00:03:07.640> have<00:03:07.760> a

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
sensor here from this so I can have a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.030 
sensor here from this so I can have a
fuel<00:03:08.060> measurement<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.990> where<00:03:09.290> my<00:03:09.410> gas<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.860> this

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
fuel measurement of where my gas is this

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.570 
fuel measurement of where my gas is this
is<00:03:10.190> an<00:03:10.310> 8<00:03:10.430> gallon<00:03:10.580> tank<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.920> yeah<00:03:13.370> eight

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
is an 8 gallon tank and so yeah eight

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.700 
is an 8 gallon tank and so yeah eight
gallons<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.300> I<00:03:14.330> wanted<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.780> know<00:03:15.200> what<00:03:15.350> my<00:03:15.470> fuel

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
gallons so I wanted to know what my fuel

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.090 
gallons so I wanted to know what my fuel
was<00:03:15.950> without<00:03:16.340> actually<00:03:16.850> having<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:18.290> open

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
was without actually having to to open

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.860 
was without actually having to to open
the<00:03:19.400> seat<00:03:19.580> up<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.910> look<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.420> then<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.750> other

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
the seat up and look and then the other

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.020 
the seat up and look and then the other
modification<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.560> did<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:22.250> my<00:03:22.370> jet<00:03:22.610> mate<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.910> I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
modification I did to my jet mate is I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.550 
modification I did to my jet mate is I
used<00:03:23.210> a<00:03:23.330> ZXI<00:03:23.870> pump<00:03:24.800> here

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
used a ZXI pump here

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.110 
used a ZXI pump here
actually<00:03:27.560> not<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.800> pump<00:03:28.010> but<00:03:28.220> 6:50<00:03:28.850> pump

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
actually not the pump but 6:50 pump

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120 
actually not the pump but 6:50 pump
which<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:29.450> bored<00:03:29.900> bored<00:03:30.320> out<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.650> blueprinted

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
which I bored bored out and blueprinted

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.360 
which I bored bored out and blueprinted
but<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:31.820> used<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.270> nozzle<00:03:32.720> from<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.050> ZXI<00:03:33.560> which

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
but I used the nozzle from the ZXI which

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.060 
but I used the nozzle from the ZXI which
has<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:34.640> trim<00:03:35.120> up<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.720> down<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:36.890> don't<00:03:36.920> know

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
has a trim up and down so I don't know

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.530 
has a trim up and down so I don't know
if<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.280> see<00:03:37.460> how<00:03:37.550> high<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.790> goes<00:03:38.150> it's

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
if you can see how high that goes it's

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.120 
if you can see how high that goes it's
almost<00:03:38.810> gonna<00:03:39.110> put<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:39.740> gonna<00:03:39.890> put<00:03:40.010> out<00:03:40.100> a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
almost gonna put it's gonna put out a

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.090 
almost gonna put it's gonna put out a
nice<00:03:40.400> root<00:03:40.610> little<00:03:40.790> rooster<00:03:41.120> there<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:42.500> while

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
nice root little rooster there and while

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.880 
nice root little rooster there and while
maintaining<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.850> reverse<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:45.350> jet<00:03:45.710> ski

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
maintaining the reverse of this jet ski

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.590 
maintaining the reverse of this jet ski
so<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:46.220> have<00:03:46.400> or<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.940> jet<00:03:47.150> mates<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:47.450> can

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
so I can have or the jet mates I can

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.840 
so I can have or the jet mates I can
have<00:03:47.690> reverse<00:03:47.990> so<00:03:48.500> as<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.740> can<00:03:48.890> see<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:49.520> then

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
have reverse so as you can see and then

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.220 
have reverse so as you can see and then
the<00:03:49.970> other<00:03:50.090> thing<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.840> added<00:03:50.990> the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the other thing is is I added the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.810 
the other thing is is I added the
speedometer<00:03:53.020> speedometer<00:03:54.020> sensor<00:03:54.920> here<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:55.760> I

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
speedometer speedometer sensor here so I

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.430 
speedometer speedometer sensor here so I
can<00:03:55.940> get<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> somewhat<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.840> an<00:03:56.930> idea<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.230> where

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
can get a somewhat of an idea of where

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.290 
can get a somewhat of an idea of where
I'm<00:03:57.530> at<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.950> have<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.280> compare<00:03:58.580> with<00:03:58.730> GPS<00:03:59.090> but

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
I'm at I have to compare with GPS but

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.900 
I'm at I have to compare with GPS but
anyways<00:03:59.540> yeah<00:04:00.470> here<00:04:01.280> on<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.490> back<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.790> can

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
anyways yeah here on the back you can

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.050 
anyways yeah here on the back you can
see<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.650> custom<00:04:03.650> candide<00:04:04.070> handles<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:04.970> I

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
see the custom candide handles that I

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.360 
see the custom candide handles that I
put<00:04:05.240> in<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:08.380> basically<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.650> got<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.860> rule

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
put in so and basically it I got a rule

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.580 
put in so and basically it I got a rule
1100<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:12.050> put<00:04:12.290> in<00:04:12.410> here<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.840> custom<00:04:15.380> fab

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
1100 that I put in here so I custom fab

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.760 
1100 that I put in here so I custom fab
dat<00:04:15.800> this<00:04:15.950> bracket<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.580> had<00:04:16.730> laying<00:04:17.299> around<00:04:17.770> for

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
dat this bracket I had laying around for

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.630 
dat this bracket I had laying around for
the<00:04:18.859> rule<00:04:19.070> but<00:04:19.640> anyways<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:21.640> speedometer

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
the rule but anyways the speedometer

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.920 
the rule but anyways the speedometer
cable<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:23.120> actually

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
cable I actually

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.689 
cable I actually
and<00:04:24.080> tapped<00:04:24.350> through<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.009> hole<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.490> can

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
and tapped through the hole so you can

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.159 
and tapped through the hole so you can
see<00:04:25.850> it's<00:04:26.090> coming<00:04:26.389> through<00:04:26.419> here<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:26.990> that's

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
see it's coming through here so that's

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.650 
see it's coming through here so that's
the<00:04:27.259> speedometer<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.949> sensor<00:04:28.430> wires<00:04:28.880> then

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
the speedometer the sensor wires then

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.260 
the speedometer the sensor wires then
I'm<00:04:29.750> keeping<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.199> stock<00:04:30.440> plugs<00:04:31.120> excuse<00:04:32.120> me

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
I'm keeping the stock plugs excuse me

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.600 
I'm keeping the stock plugs excuse me
the<00:04:32.389> stock<00:04:32.630> carbs<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:34.220> can<00:04:34.370> see<00:04:34.520> I'm

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
the stock carbs and you can see I'm

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.900 
the stock carbs and you can see I'm
using<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.940> Rd<00:04:35.860> higher<00:04:36.860> compression<00:04:37.490> not<00:04:37.759> to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
using the Rd higher compression not to

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.279 
using the Rd higher compression not to
hide<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.270> middle<00:04:38.509> one<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.690> can't<00:04:38.930> remember<00:04:39.110> the

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
hide the middle one I can't remember the

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.480 
hide the middle one I can't remember the
compression<00:04:39.740> but<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:39.979> should<00:04:40.820> be<00:04:40.970> about<00:04:41.150> 135

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
compression but it should be about 135

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.279 
compression but it should be about 135
psi<00:04:43.490> per<00:04:44.060> cylinder<00:04:44.240> we'll<00:04:44.570> see<00:04:44.720> I'll<00:04:44.990> have<00:04:45.050> to

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
psi per cylinder we'll see I'll have to

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.600 
psi per cylinder we'll see I'll have to
I'll<00:04:45.500> let<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:45.710> know<00:04:45.830> what<00:04:45.949> that<00:04:46.100> is<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.490> then

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
I'll let you know what that is and then

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.879 
I'll let you know what that is and then
of<00:04:46.729> course<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:47.060> CDI<00:04:47.330> box<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:47.900> mounted<00:04:48.530> up<00:04:48.620> front

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
of course the CDI box I mounted up front

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.379 
of course the CDI box I mounted up front
here<00:04:49.190> so<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.820> mounted<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.460> case<00:04:52.669> here

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
here so I mounted it to the case here

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.409 
here so I mounted it to the case here
and<00:04:53.539> then<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.289> built<00:04:55.009> these<00:04:55.160> fabricated<00:04:56.150> these

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
and then I built these fabricated these

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.110 
and then I built these fabricated these
stainless<00:04:56.900> steel<00:04:57.229> brackets<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.460> mount<00:04:58.729> here<00:04:59.060> I

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
stainless steel brackets to mount here I

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.150 
stainless steel brackets to mount here I
got<00:04:59.330> three<00:04:59.570> of<00:04:59.599> them<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.770> got<00:05:01.009> because

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
got three of them so that I got because

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.189 
got three of them so that I got because
it's<00:05:01.400> gonna<00:05:01.550> take<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.000> beating<00:05:02.419> bouncing<00:05:02.960> so

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
it's gonna take a beating bouncing so

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.020 
it's gonna take a beating bouncing so
the<00:05:03.770> only<00:05:03.889> other<00:05:04.039> places<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:04.669> where<00:05:04.849> I'm<00:05:04.940> gonna

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
the only other places is where I'm gonna

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.520 
the only other places is where I'm gonna
put<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> battery<00:05:05.599> I<00:05:05.630> think<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.930> might<00:05:06.110> mount<00:05:06.380> it

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
put the battery I think I might mount it

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.020 
put the battery I think I might mount it
right<00:05:06.560> here<00:05:07.099> if<00:05:07.280> it'll<00:05:07.520> fit<00:05:07.699> I'll<00:05:07.849> go<00:05:07.970> to

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
right here if it'll fit I'll go to

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.640 
right here if it'll fit I'll go to
autozone<00:05:08.389> and<00:05:08.509> see<00:05:08.599> what<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.750> can<00:05:08.900> find<00:05:09.080> or<00:05:09.620> I

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
autozone and see what I can find or I

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.200 
autozone and see what I can find or I
may<00:05:09.949> put<00:05:10.160> it<00:05:10.250> back<00:05:10.400> here<00:05:10.580> but<00:05:10.759> I<00:05:10.789> still<00:05:10.880> want

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
may put it back here but I still want

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.390 
may put it back here but I still want
that<00:05:11.270> for<00:05:11.539> storage<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.949> you<00:05:13.039> can<00:05:13.160> see<00:05:13.280> the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
that for storage so and you can see the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.140 
that for storage so and you can see the
carpeting<00:05:13.849> I<00:05:13.970> have<00:05:14.150> there<00:05:14.419> I'm<00:05:14.750> gonna<00:05:14.930> put<00:05:15.050> a

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
carpeting I have there I'm gonna put a

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.700 
carpeting I have there I'm gonna put a
upholstered<00:05:17.150> rail<00:05:17.449> here<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.930> I<00:05:17.960> built<00:05:18.259> to

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
upholstered rail here that I built to

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.589 
upholstered rail here that I built to
kind<00:05:18.979> of<00:05:19.039> conceal<00:05:19.520> this<00:05:19.729> all<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:20.479> way<00:05:20.570> up

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
kind of conceal this all the way up

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.529 
kind of conceal this all the way up
front<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:22.370> we'll<00:05:22.880> have<00:05:23.389> an

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
front to so and we'll have an

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.360 
front to so and we'll have an
opportunity<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:24.289> to<00:05:24.860> make<00:05:24.979> it<00:05:25.099> look<00:05:25.220> real

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
opportunity to to make it look real

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.830 
opportunity to to make it look real
custom<00:05:25.729> and<00:05:25.940> then<00:05:26.090> get<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.300> upholstery<00:05:26.660> down

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
custom and then get the upholstery down

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.600 
custom and then get the upholstery down
so<00:05:27.110> this<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.710> what<00:05:27.830> I<00:05:27.860> got<00:05:28.039> so<00:05:28.250> far<00:05:28.280> on<00:05:28.580> my

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
so this is what I got so far on my

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.779 
so this is what I got so far on my
project<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.780> got<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.680> total<00:05:31.220> time<00:05:31.520> probably

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
project I got a total time probably

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.350 
project I got a total time probably
about<00:05:31.940> three<00:05:32.599> weeks<00:05:32.810> in<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.889> pretty<00:05:34.820> solid<00:05:35.210> I

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
about three weeks in it pretty solid I

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.339 
about three weeks in it pretty solid I
got<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.050> rub<00:05:36.349> to<00:05:36.380> clear<00:05:36.979> out<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.750> polish<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:39.080> so

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
got a rub to clear out and polish it so
