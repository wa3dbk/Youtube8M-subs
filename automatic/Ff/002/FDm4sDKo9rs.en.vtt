00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
now I don't know what to expect so I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.650 
now I don't know what to expect so I
might<00:00:50.280> die<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.969> hope<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> don't<00:00:53.480> seems<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> be

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
might die but I hope I don't seems to be

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
might die but I hope I don't seems to be
a<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:54.809> easier<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.559> game<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.120> monster

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
a bit easier now the game on a monster

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.979 
a bit easier now the game on a monster
power<00:00:57.300> level<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:59.000> what<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> fuck

new checkpoints also okay so I had like

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.960 
new checkpoints also okay so I had like
a<00:01:15.060> little<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.600> lag<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.460> side<00:01:17.460> pull<00:01:17.790> him

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
a little bit of lag right side pull him

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.810 
a little bit of lag right side pull him
and<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.080> instantly<00:01:19.500> died<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:20.159> meteors

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and I just instantly died from meteors

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.420 
and I just instantly died from meteors
raining<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> sky<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.049> something<00:01:22.560> like

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
raining from the sky or something like

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.359 
raining from the sky or something like
what<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> hell<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:25.159> just<00:01:26.159> quickly

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
what the hell was that I just quickly

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.060 
what the hell was that I just quickly
run<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:29.810> ray<00:01:30.810> me<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.500> soon<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.890> hit

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
run back ray me as soon as I hit

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.429 
run back ray me as soon as I hit
something<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.610> fells<00:01:32.880> oh<00:01:35.509> there's<00:01:36.509> also<00:01:36.750> quite

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
something it fells oh there's also quite

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.749 
something it fells oh there's also quite
a<00:01:37.560> lot<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.829> lack<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> bed<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:40.520> that's<00:01:41.520> why

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
a lot of lack on the bed so that's why

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.889 
a lot of lack on the bed so that's why
it<00:01:41.820> might<00:01:42.090> sounds<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.530> crappy<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.899> just

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
it might sounds like a bit crappy I just

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
it might sounds like a bit crappy I just
hope<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> lag<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
hope the lag is just because it's on the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
hope the lag is just because it's on the
better<00:01:48.149> server<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
better server and not because of the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.980 
better server and not because of the
batch<00:01:49.680> holding<00:01:50.100> stuff<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.540> okay<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:51.720> he's<00:01:51.869> in

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
batch holding stuff up okay now he's in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.660 
batch holding stuff up okay now he's in
a<00:01:52.079> better<00:01:52.200> area<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.799> fight<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.249 

okay<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:58.729> he<00:01:59.000> has<00:01:59.119> like<00:01:59.299> blue<00:01:59.509> circles<00:02:00.049> on<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
okay so he has like blue circles on the

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.859 
okay so he has like blue circles on the
ground<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.909> have<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.210> run<00:02:02.360> out<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:02.570> those

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
ground and you have to run out of those

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.310 
ground and you have to run out of those
okay<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:04.600> apparently<00:02:05.600> he's<00:02:05.960> an<00:02:06.080> illusionist

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
okay and apparently he's an illusionist

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.580
