00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 the live and dark 92 there are very good at 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.290
 all vaquitas we are here in bancroft 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.750
 and good guys today I bring something 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.160
 decoration and good this these stairs 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 With carpet we can put any 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.760
 items are left this way, and not 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.529
 we need the natural rest because the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.970
 rest is worth it with a very command 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.699
 simple that you are going to see I am going to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 explain you are going to learn third then 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.970
 well let's see it from above and how 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.000
 First we can put any ladder 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 with decoration voucher is very well left 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 especially for houses or whatever we want 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 is very very very well and also not 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.500
 affects for nothing because it is a block 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 invisible what we can lower upload it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.670
 no problem it is not a solid block 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 and he directs as well as the facts 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.690
 have you done re - apply vale I'm going to 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.430
 come here a little bit out of here 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 society here and we're going to put a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 command block is worth to get the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 command block you already know how it is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.530
 steve and very dark is worth your name 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 of user the 137 that is the one of del 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 command block none to get 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.420
 a block itself is worth and good once 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 done this let's catch let's go 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.170
 and we are going to copy the command that has 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.850
 left in the description that is posted 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.860
 perfect so good for you to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.750
 they are an ideal height and here 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.040
 we just give it to that and now 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.899
 I will explain how we change any 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.759
 block ok we're going to put a button and 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.770
 we execute it, and as you can see 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.350
 good position now see the glass 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 it is very good and good is set 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.000
 so that at height number five 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.460
 you're going to see one two three four and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 five vouchers I'm going to take away all this and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.890
 you are going to see that we say that just 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.600
 that height what it does is merge with 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 another block that we put for example if 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.990
 I put the staircase here, you will see what 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.610
 stays 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.280
 excelling because it is a mini block 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 thanks to the wagon it's worth and here it is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.450
 the trick is worth here what do you have then 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.280
 for example if we want to change and not 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.899
 we want the crystal we are going to remove 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.789
 first the van we are going to enter here 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.340
 to what is the command block and here 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.780
 on display from there you see that puts 2020 is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.899
 the number of the crystal is worth and now 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.179
 you will say as a seal the block that the air 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.069
 of the block that I want to put worth 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.720
 As you can see it was worth half the block 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.600
 solids for example the beige diamond 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.860
 that puts 57 worth I get the shtick of 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 each block then simply because 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.170
 you come here to what is the block of 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.630
 commands 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.580
 and in time you put the 57 and there you have it 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.930
 and so with all the blocks to you 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.550
 the numbers are going to come out I'm going to 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.650
 explain how to do it because it 's a 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.860
 simple command is not a command is 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.239
 just look at it worth and expelling f 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.590
 3 + h of our keyboard is now valid 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.260
 to see that I no longer get the numbers of 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.069
 each block is worth nothing to look at any 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.709
 now I'm going to do efe 3 + h 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.650
 quito / efe 3 and as you can see now I 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.540
 turn out all blocks you have 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.769
 seen for example the luminous stone the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.370
 like in '89 if I go I want to put 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 I put the 89 executed and there I have it 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.060
 and so in this way we can put everything 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.130
 what we want is worth but I have to 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.900
 explain something else and it's that good when 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.600
 this is locked underground now you go 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.790
 to see I'm going to go down 4 down 1 2 3 and 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.330
 4 exact, you already know that the fifth 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.680
 I already excelled the block so I'm going to 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.690
 re-copying the command I'm going to put 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.280
 the 89 that is even good I 'm not going to 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.450
 put the 57 that is the block of 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.640
 diamonds 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.610
 a button executed it 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.750
 and if he lets me leave now we can see him 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.790
 block just at the height that 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.890
 we want to put the staircase, but there are 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.110
 a problem and is that if we cover here 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.490
 how to see the block does not light up 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.080
 because because it is underground 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.750
 there is no light, it is necessary to enter light 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.310
 then a trick is that we put 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.350
 luminous stone 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.630
 exactly there is valid so that when 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.610
 now let's close the block is illuminated 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.500
 will not have problems because the cave is 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.090
 illuminated is worth it and it's something I wanted 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.290
 say because just because a lot 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.240
 people do not know it's worth now we can 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.760
 put the ladder and we can do many 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.410
 plus another one here and another here like pÃ©rez 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.260
 it's great for a castle or what 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.780
 we want to cover it 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.190
 It seems like a fountain and everything and good 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.570
 we can only use it in 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.470
 stairs we can do a lot of 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.180
 things with this as tables for example 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.480
 I'm going to go down four down 12 good 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.310
 3 I'm going to put it in 3 I'll put it 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.230
 I'm going to put the 89 that is the cloister 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.100
 we can make it a visit to 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.530
 night 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.200
 if you let me out again it's worth it 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.210
 we put here and now is now I put the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.150
 cloister as I said there for example 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.470
 same applies to I will not cover and I 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.560
 we can make a small table worth 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.560
 example 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.480
 it is very well worth pretty well it seems 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.980
 a little table of this look then good 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.990
 we can do a lot of things that 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.430
 we each have the imagination that 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.440
 have but you can leave in comments 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.210
 what can you do with this and nothing guys 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.860
 I hope you count like so that 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.480
 people know him I'm going to leave with the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.460
 decoration block that I made worth 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.230
 block inside the block and see you 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.419
 tomorrow in the next gameplay tomorrow 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.380
 it costs late a photo is worth voting 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.380
 blake goodbye
