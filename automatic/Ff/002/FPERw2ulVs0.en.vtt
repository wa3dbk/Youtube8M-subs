even though it is rose gold plated like
real<00:01:01.890> rose<00:01:02.160> gold<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.449> take<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
real rose gold I just take it off when I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.260 
real rose gold I just take it off when I
shower<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> back<00:01:06.000> on

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
shower and then put it back on

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
shower and then put it back on
afterwards<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.380> otherwise<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.040> think<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
afterwards because otherwise I think the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
afterwards because otherwise I think the
water<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.540> skin<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> middle

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
water and the skin in the middle

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.960 
water and the skin in the middle
reaction<00:01:10.920> together<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> good

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
reaction together is just not a good

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
reaction together is just not a good
combo<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.380> chest<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> clearing<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
combo so my chest is clearing up but it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 
combo so my chest is clearing up but it
used<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> first<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.140 
used to be like when I first got it and
I<00:01:16.710> would<00:01:17.100> never<00:01:17.310> take<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.060> was
