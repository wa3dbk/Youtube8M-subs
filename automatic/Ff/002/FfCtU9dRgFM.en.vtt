to it without seeing him it's kind of

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.360

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
are dilated I'm not sure if I should if

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.280 
are dilated I'm not sure if I should if
I<00:02:38.910> should<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.120> wash<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.810> mean<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:39.990> could<00:02:40.140> try

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
I should just wash I mean I could try

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.580 
I should just wash I mean I could try
and<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.820> what<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.180> only<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> top<00:02:42.840> which

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and like what it's only on the top which

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.560 
and like what it's only on the top which
is<00:02:43.650> what<00:02:44.310> leads<00:02:44.430> me<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.820> believe<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.240> might<00:02:45.390> be

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
is what leads me to believe it might be

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.710 
is what leads me to believe it might be
something<00:02:46.610> maybe<00:02:47.610> from<00:02:47.850> all<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.090> rain<00:02:48.450> work

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
