about who what lit license things will

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.270

be<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> Rugby<00:01:14.939> World<00:01:14.970> Cup<00:01:15.180> 2015<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
be in the Rugby World Cup 2015 so I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
be in the Rugby World Cup 2015 so I
believe<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.420> will<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.570> teams<00:01:19.080> like

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
believe that it will be teams like

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.910 
believe that it will be teams like
Scotland<00:01:19.650> Wales<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> USA<00:01:21.330> who<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.659> already

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
Scotland Wales and USA who are already

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
Scotland Wales and USA who are already
confirmed<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:24.180> Ireland<00:01:24.420> France<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
confirmed but I think Ireland France and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.460 
confirmed but I think Ireland France and
Italy<00:01:25.500> will<00:01:26.159> probably<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.229> chanted<00:01:28.229> off

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
Italy will probably do have chanted off

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
Italy will probably do have chanted off
from<00:01:29.000> being<00:01:30.000> licensed<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.720> Rugby<00:01:31.259> World<00:01:31.290> Cup
