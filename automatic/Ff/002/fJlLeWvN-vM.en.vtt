all there so it's labeled here this is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.780 
all there so it's labeled here this is
warming<00:01:01.739> jig<00:01:01.950> right<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.430> half<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.700> my

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
warming jig right here at half of my

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.240 
warming jig right here at half of my
hand<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.199> bottom<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.619> laser<00:01:04.920> etched

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
hand and on the bottom we laser etched

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.270 
hand and on the bottom we laser etched
the<00:01:06.119> actual<00:01:06.600> lure<00:01:07.289> that<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.709> designed<00:01:08.069> for

the actual lure that it was designed for
so<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.639> rod<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.479> fish<00:01:09.689> warmer<00:01:10.109> a<00:01:10.170> jig<00:01:10.469> but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so this rod go fish warmer a jig but

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.910 
so this rod go fish warmer a jig but
it's<00:01:10.740> from<00:01:10.889> truly<00:01:11.219> designed<00:01:11.579> to<00:01:11.729> fish<00:01:11.969> a<00:01:12.299> jig

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
it's from truly designed to fish a jig

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.260 
it's from truly designed to fish a jig
that's<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.069> new<00:01:14.189> clearest<00:01:14.609> casting<00:01:15.090> rods

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
designed the real seat so fold a 2500 or

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.770 
designed the real seat so fold a 2500 or
3000<00:01:36.130> real<00:01:36.280> seat<00:01:36.520> for<00:01:37.090> when<00:01:37.180> you<00:01:37.300> lock<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:37.690> up

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
3000 real seat for when you lock it up

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.749

and<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.560> sits<00:01:38.860> there<00:01:38.979> nice<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:39.220> tight<00:01:39.460> so

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
and it sits there nice and tight so

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.710 
and it sits there nice and tight so
there's<00:01:39.940> no<00:01:40.060> caps

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
there's no caps

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.840 
there's no caps
so<00:01:41.229> with<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.440> no<00:01:41.560> gaps<00:01:41.830> does<00:01:42.159> is<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:42.640> can<00:01:42.759> get

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
so with the no gaps does is you can get
