to open five packs and as you can see

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.580 
to open five packs and as you can see
there<00:00:15.240> were<00:00:15.299> actually<00:00:15.599> some<00:00:15.660> jumbo<00:00:16.230> premium

there were actually some jumbo premium
go<00:00:16.740> backs<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.430> thought<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.820> know<00:00:18.000> what

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
go backs out so I thought you know what

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700 
go backs out so I thought you know what
it<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.539> said<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:18.960> Christmas<00:00:19.350> sooner<00:00:19.590> this

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it is said it's Christmas sooner this

it is said it's Christmas sooner this
Christmas<00:00:20.100> tomorrow<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> figured<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.420> would

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
Christmas tomorrow so I figured I would

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.450 
Christmas tomorrow so I figured I would
open<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.020> five<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> these<00:00:22.800> instead<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.310> the

goals<00:03:25.250> with<00:03:25.459> him<00:03:25.580> but<00:03:25.970> that's<00:03:26.120> mainly<00:03:26.270> because

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
goals with him but that's mainly because

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.330 
goals with him but that's mainly because
of<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.750> fact<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.050> i<00:03:27.140> use<00:03:27.410> him<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.770> entity

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
of the fact that i use him in the entity

of the fact that i use him in the entity
with<00:03:28.550> second<00:03:28.880> informed<00:03:29.209> cristiano<00:03:29.600> ronaldo

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
with second informed cristiano ronaldo

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.810 
with second informed cristiano ronaldo
and<00:03:30.080> ronaldo<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.680> obviously<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.280> main<00:03:31.430> man<00:03:31.640> in

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
and ronaldo is obviously the main man in

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.580 
and ronaldo is obviously the main man in
that<00:03:31.940> squat<00:03:32.270> but<00:03:32.660> obviously<00:03:33.050> all<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.380> goals

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
that squat but obviously all the goals

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.350 
that squat but obviously all the goals
then<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.160> center<00:03:34.430> for<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.820> Elton

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
then the center for it is Elton

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.240 
then the center for it is Elton
five-foot-three<00:03:36.230> picked<00:03:36.620> him<00:03:36.740> up<00:03:36.800> for<00:03:37.010> just

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
five-foot-three picked him up for just

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.730 
five-foot-three picked him up for just
under<00:03:37.400> 15k<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.330> as<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.930> can<00:03:39.050> see<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.470> haven't

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
under 15k and as you can see I haven't

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.199 
under 15k and as you can see I haven't
even<00:03:39.950> played<00:03:40.250> with<00:03:40.490> him<00:03:40.580> yet<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:41.150> think

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
even played with him yet and I think

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.550 
even played with him yet and I think
that's<00:03:41.630> mainly<00:03:41.810> because<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.260> fact<00:03:42.470> that

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
that's mainly because of the fact that

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.949 
that's mainly because of the fact that
there<00:03:42.770> are<00:03:42.800> not<00:03:43.489> really<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.910> many<00:03:44.090> brazil<00:03:44.600> vs

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
there are not really that many brazil vs

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.300 
there are not really that many brazil vs
you're<00:03:45.080> an<00:03:45.200> ultimate<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.620> which<00:03:45.800> is<00:03:45.890> obviously

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
you're an ultimate in which is obviously

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.390 
you're an ultimate in which is obviously
shame<00:03:46.730> then<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.480> left<00:03:47.630> winger<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:47.959> rafinha<00:03:48.650> 87

shame then the left winger is rafinha 87
bases<00:03:49.760> shooting<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.330> maybe<00:03:50.630> not<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.500> best<00:03:51.620> but

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
bases shooting is maybe not the best but

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.560 
bases shooting is maybe not the best but

decided to serve on safety i think for

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.020 
decided to serve on safety i think for
rafinha<00:06:27.530> and<00:06:27.860> I<00:06:27.890> think<00:06:28.310> put<00:06:28.460> Elton<00:06:28.790> on<00:06:28.910> the

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
rafinha and I think put Elton on the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.700 
rafinha and I think put Elton on the
left<00:06:29.210> winger<00:06:29.570> spot<00:06:29.870> so<00:06:30.110> um<00:06:30.290> yeah<00:06:30.470> we<00:06:30.560> got

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
left winger spot so um yeah we got

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.320 
left winger spot so um yeah we got
safety<00:06:31.040> that<00:06:31.160> on<00:06:31.340> the<00:06:31.460> ball<00:06:31.610> nice<00:06:31.790> faker<00:06:32.060> bone
