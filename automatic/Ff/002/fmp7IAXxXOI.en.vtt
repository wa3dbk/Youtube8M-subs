okay we're here with the Sony CD PvE 375
problem<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.440> know<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.560> took<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.919> board<00:00:08.130> out

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
problem you know I took the board out

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.459 
problem you know I took the board out
because<00:00:08.880> there's<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.179> problem<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.900> have

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
because there's a problem I have

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.230 
because there's a problem I have
attached<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.389> old<00:00:12.389> pioneer<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:14.240> for

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
attached it to my old pioneer here for

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.970 
attached it to my old pioneer here for
audio<00:00:16.310> receiver<00:00:17.539> and<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> problem<00:00:19.140> was<00:00:19.289> it

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
audio receiver and the problem was it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.740 
audio receiver and the problem was it
sounded<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.910> get<00:00:21.029> dirty<00:00:21.210> connection

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
sounded like and get dirty connection

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.900 
sounded like and get dirty connection
you<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.710> wiggle<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.550> time<00:00:23.760> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
you have to wiggle it and some time it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.070 
you have to wiggle it and some time it
just<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> last<00:00:24.630> channel<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
just you know the last channel is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.259 
just you know the last channel is
cutting<00:00:25.380> out<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.310> surprise<00:00:29.970> means

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
cutting out and you know surprise means

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.269 
cutting out and you know surprise means
you<00:00:30.449> even<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> screw<00:00:31.230> down<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.130> hold

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you even have a screw down there to hold

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.830 
you even have a screw down there to hold
the<00:00:32.460> board<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.390> there<00:00:33.600> shouldn't<00:00:33.750> be

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the board so you know there shouldn't be

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
the board so you know there shouldn't be
a<00:00:33.960> bird<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.260> starter<00:00:34.700> in<00:00:35.700> there<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.059> connect

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
a bird from starter in there to connect

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.350 
a bird from starter in there to connect
it

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.630 
it
fortunately<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> problem<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> pretty<00:00:40.260> easy

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.290 

to<00:00:44.640> figure<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> cameras<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.350> focus

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.600 

okay<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> anyway<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> absurd

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
okay you see it anyway this is absurd

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.080 
okay you see it anyway this is absurd
our<00:00:53.820> joint<00:00:54.059> there's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> bad<00:00:55.140> solder<00:00:55.590> short

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
our joint there's a bad solder short

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:07.070 
our joint there's a bad solder short
notice<00:00:57.090> when<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> move<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> connector<00:01:06.080> okay

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
notice when I move the connector okay

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
notice when I move the connector okay
and<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.490> making

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and if it's like this you're not making

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640 
and if it's like this you're not making
connection<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.200> make

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
connection if it's like this you make

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.250 
connection if it's like this you make
connection<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.930> we're<00:01:13.140> gonna

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
connection not very good so we're gonna

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.730 
connection not very good so we're gonna
fix<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.799> problem<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:17.930> lead<00:01:18.930> free<00:01:19.140> solder<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
fix this problem and lead free solder to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.240 
fix this problem and lead free solder to
be<00:01:20.040> pretty<00:01:20.310> brutal<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:21.119> our<00:01:21.240> iron<00:01:22.250> cheap

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
be pretty brutal got our iron cheap

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.450 
be pretty brutal got our iron cheap

example of a bad solder joint don't
understand<00:02:33.530> how<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.770> happened<00:02:34.190> because<00:02:34.340> it's

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
understand how it happened because it's

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.800 
understand how it happened because it's
screwed<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.000> like<00:02:35.210> that

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
screwed in like that

screwed in like that
it's<00:02:36.170> screwed<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.560> like<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.100> know<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.460> for

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
it's screwed in like you know that for

it's screwed in like you know that for
stability<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.770> I<00:02:39.830> put<00:02:40.010> much<00:02:40.160> pressure

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
stability not that I put much pressure

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.880 
stability not that I put much pressure
on<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> thing<00:02:41.150> either<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:42.670> obviously<00:02:44.890> and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
on the thing either but obviously and

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.500 
on the thing either but obviously and
then<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.340> little<00:02:46.640> over<00:02:46.820> acid<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.180> around

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
then that little over acid you around

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.420 
then that little over acid you around
did<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.840> like<00:02:48.050> ring<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.100> see<00:02:49.250> right

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
did that like ring and you can see right

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.550 
did that like ring and you can see right
there<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.730> my<00:02:50.060> not<00:02:50.300> safley<00:02:50.780> flux<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.470> I'm

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
there that my not safley flux so I'm

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.020 
there that my not safley flux so I'm
gonna<00:02:51.680> remove<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.010> too<00:02:52.459> doesn't<00:02:52.820> hurt

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
gonna remove that too doesn't hurt

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.020 
gonna remove that too doesn't hurt
anything<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.720> makes<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:53.989> look<00:02:54.110> messy<00:02:58.030> well

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
anything but it makes it look messy well

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.940 
anything but it makes it look messy well
I<00:02:59.060> finished<00:02:59.840> are<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.410> doing<00:03:00.620> some<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
I finished are you doing some of the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.670 
I finished are you doing some of the
solder<00:03:01.250> joints<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:01.940> can<00:03:02.030> see<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.650> muck

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
solder joints you can see that muck

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.340 
solder joints you can see that muck
that's<00:03:04.130> what<00:03:04.580> solder<00:03:05.120> flux<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.170> those

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
that's what solder flux is for those

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.940 
that's what solder flux is for those

that don't know no see those I redid

those<00:03:20.180> LEDs<00:03:20.810> solder<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:24.820> read<00:03:27.040> and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
those LEDs solder that that I read and

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.180 
those LEDs solder that that I read and
not<00:03:28.790> only<00:03:28.970> Joey<00:03:29.690> also<00:03:30.019> add<00:03:30.170> more<00:03:30.440> solder

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
not only Joey also add more solder

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.370 
not only Joey also add more solder
shining<00:03:32.150> solder<00:03:32.420> because<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.930> had<00:03:33.019> some<00:03:33.200> LED

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
shining solder because it had some LED

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.890 
shining solder because it had some LED
and<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:33.709> just<00:03:33.739> don't<00:03:34.160> looking<00:03:34.459> of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
and it all just don't looking of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.120 
and it all just don't looking of
lead-free<00:03:35.900> solder<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:39.170> this<00:03:39.320> is<00:03:39.440> much<00:03:39.769> more

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
lead-free solder so this is much more

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.030 
lead-free solder so this is much more
dirty<00:03:41.030> now<00:03:41.330> in<00:03:41.810> fact<00:03:42.080> if<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.380> bends<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.800> whole

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
dirty now in fact if it bends the whole

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.949 
dirty now in fact if it bends the whole
board<00:03:43.670> bad<00:03:43.970> that's<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.660> good<00:03:44.810> thing

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
board bad that's a good thing

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.360 
board bad that's a good thing
now<00:03:47.959> just<00:03:48.260> throw<00:03:48.440> them<00:03:48.620> there<00:03:48.800> real<00:03:49.040> quick<00:03:49.340> and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
now just throw them there real quick and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.870 
now just throw them there real quick and
give<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.060> shot<00:03:51.610> not<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.670> very<00:03:52.910> big<00:03:53.510> board
