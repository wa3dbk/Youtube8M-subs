actually been around for quite a while
but<00:00:38.520> I'm<00:00:39.510> running<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.990> Mac<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.490> is<00:00:41.670> OS

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
but I'm running on a Mac here this is OS

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.040 
but I'm running on a Mac here this is OS
10<00:00:43.160> leopard<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:45.150> I<00:00:45.180> wanted<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
10 leopard and what I wanted to do is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.400 
10 leopard and what I wanted to do is
show<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.350> vmware<00:00:47.250> fusion<00:00:47.300> fusion<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.810> mac

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
show you vmware fusion fusion is the mac

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.060 
show you vmware fusion fusion is the mac
version<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> buy<00:00:51.000> vmware<00:00:51.630> for<00:00:52.320> mac

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
version you can buy vmware for mac

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.020 
version you can buy vmware for mac
windows<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.300> linux<00:00:54.950> so<00:00:55.950> in<00:00:56.220> this<00:00:56.310> case<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
windows and linux so in this case it's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.060 
windows and linux so in this case it's
the<00:00:57.120> mac<00:00:57.420> version<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the mac version so what we're going to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650 
the mac version so what we're going to
do<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.250> we're<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> fire<00:00:59.790> off<00:00:59.970> vmware

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
do is we're going to fire off vmware

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.920 
do is we're going to fire off vmware
fusion<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.860> idea<00:01:02.220> here<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
fusion and what the idea here is it's a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.580 
fusion and what the idea here is it's a
you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> virtual<00:01:05.689> pc<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.929> a<00:01:06.960> virtual

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
you can have a virtual pc or a virtual

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.580 
you can have a virtual pc or a virtual
machine<00:01:08.579> and<00:01:08.609> what<00:01:08.880> happens<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.079> software

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
machine and what happens is the software

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.639 
machine and what happens is the software
basically<00:01:10.979> emulates<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.259> hardware<00:01:13.259> so<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
basically emulates the hardware so you

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.489 
basically emulates the hardware so you
can<00:01:13.889> actually<00:01:13.920> install<00:01:14.579> regular<00:01:15.299> OS<00:01:15.719> is<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
can actually install regular OS is on it

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.319 
can actually install regular OS is on it
and<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> thinks<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.429> you're<00:01:17.609> installing<00:01:17.999> it

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
and it thinks that you're installing it

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.539 
and it thinks that you're installing it
on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> hardware<00:01:18.959> itself<00:01:19.249> so<00:01:20.249> for<00:01:20.459> instance

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
on the hardware itself so for instance

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.999 
on the hardware itself so for instance
that<00:01:20.939> i'm<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.359> show<00:01:21.569> you<00:01:21.600> am<00:01:22.139> a<00:01:22.469> windows

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that i'm going to show you am a windows

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.739 
that i'm going to show you am a windows
XP<00:01:23.179> load<00:01:24.179> and<00:01:24.770> it's<00:01:25.770> i<00:01:26.189> installed<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.209> as<00:01:27.450> if

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
XP load and it's i installed that as if

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.480 
XP load and it's i installed that as if
it<00:01:27.929> were<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> real<00:01:28.499> machine<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.039> actually

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it were on a real machine but actually

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.099 
it were on a real machine but actually
it<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.639> just<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.030> software<00:01:30.539> so<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.929> nice

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
it was just in software so the nice

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.989 
it was just in software so the nice
thing<00:01:31.139> about<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.799> i<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.639> still<00:01:32.880> be

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
thing about that is i can still be

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.129 
thing about that is i can still be
running<00:01:33.119> mac<00:01:33.719> OS<00:01:34.319> 10<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.270> if<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.420> need<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.719> I<00:01:36.990> can

the image that you want and you'll see
in<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.810> case<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.350> pops<00:02:30.770> up<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.010> window<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
in this case it pops up a window and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.030 
in this case it pops up a window and
it's<00:02:31.520> going<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.730> look<00:02:32.030> as<00:02:32.210> if<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:33.040> another

it's going to look as if it's another

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.740 
it's going to look as if it's another
machine<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:34.940> there<00:02:35.180> it's<00:02:35.330> booting<00:02:35.660> up

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
machine so right there it's booting up

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.500 
machine so right there it's booting up
windows<00:02:36.170> XP<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.920> look<00:02:37.040> how<00:02:37.130> fast<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.820> I'm

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
windows XP and look how fast it is I'm

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.370 
windows XP and look how fast it is I'm
running<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.960> on<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.250> Mac<00:02:40.250> Pro<00:02:40.990> 16<00:02:41.990> gigs<00:02:42.560> around

running this on a Mac Pro 16 gigs around
all<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.620> bells<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:45.950> whistles<00:02:46.040> it's<00:02:46.400> like

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
all the bells and whistles it's like

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.390 
all the bells and whistles it's like
it's<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:47.000> dual<00:02:47.570> quad-core<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.770> it's<00:02:48.950> got<00:02:49.160> eight

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
it's a dual quad-core so it's got eight

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.370 
it's a dual quad-core so it's got eight
basically<00:02:50.090> eight<00:02:50.240> processors<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:51.020> there<00:02:51.230> so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
basically eight processors in there so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.670 
basically eight processors in there so
it's<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.620> pretty<00:02:52.280> nice<00:02:52.520> machine<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.380> here<00:02:54.560> we<00:02:54.650> go

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's a pretty nice machine so here we go

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.180 
it's a pretty nice machine so here we go
now<00:02:55.040> we're<00:02:55.220> running<00:02:55.250> windows<00:02:55.900> inside

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
now we're running windows inside

explorer right here now watch this is
one<00:03:29.270> really<00:03:29.750> cool<00:03:29.960> feature<00:03:30.350> that<00:03:30.680> we've<00:03:30.980> got

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
one really cool feature that we've got

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.160 
one really cool feature that we've got
it's<00:03:31.970> called<00:03:32.210> unity<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.110> if<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.040> go<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.280> view

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
it's called unity and if you go to view

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.940 
it's called unity and if you go to view
unity<00:03:36.170> then<00:03:37.160> watch<00:03:37.430> what's<00:03:37.700> going<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.910> happen

unity then watch what's going to happen

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.000 
unity then watch what's going to happen
boom<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:41.060> basically<00:03:41.300> takes<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.620> regular

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
boom it basically takes the regular

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.010 
boom it basically takes the regular
desktop<00:03:43.220> away<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.270> makes<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.660> look<00:03:44.960> like

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
desktop away and it makes it look like

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.920 
desktop away and it makes it look like
just<00:03:45.740> a<00:03:45.890> regular<00:03:45.920> window<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.570> makes<00:03:47.840> it

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
just a regular window and it makes it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.090 
just a regular window and it makes it
look<00:03:48.110> kind<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.410> native<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.730> Mac<00:03:50.510> OS<00:03:50.930> which<00:03:51.920> is

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
look kind of native to Mac OS which is

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.460 
look kind of native to Mac OS which is
really<00:03:52.430> cool<00:03:52.670> because<00:03:52.820> see<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.180> can<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.690> can

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
really cool because see I can I can

really cool because see I can I can
still<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:54.950> can<00:03:55.250> feel<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.490> little<00:03:55.700> bit<00:03:55.880> better

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
still I can feel a little bit better

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.350

about<00:03:56.150> as<00:03:56.510> if<00:03:56.720> I'm<00:03:56.900> running<00:03:57.470> on<00:03:57.800> OS<00:03:58.370> 10<00:03:58.850> by

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
about as if I'm running on OS 10 by

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.760 
about as if I'm running on OS 10 by
itself<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.990> that<00:04:00.020> there's<00:04:00.260> no<00:04:00.410> windows

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
itself and that there's no windows

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.160 
itself and that there's no windows
running<00:04:01.040> at<00:04:01.220> all<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:01.910> can<00:04:02.360> still<00:04:02.690> run<00:04:02.870> on<00:04:02.900> my
