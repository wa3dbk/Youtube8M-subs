00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.650
 One of the things that is most valued when it comes to portraying someone is the 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.650
 ability we have had to capture the expression of that person 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.810
 on an artistic level this is important 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.890
 however a portrait session can not be based on this single concept 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.890
 we would limit it much 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.560
 a good portrait session should include many more things how are we going to 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.210
 see and between them should not miss clear that yes 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 that study of the expression that we commented 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.910
 we always treat a real model a person who has tables in the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.620
 affair 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.860
 we'll just have to pick up what we're doing with our camera and 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.360
 thus leading a mind 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.629
 These people know their trade very well 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.629
 and we should not hinder their display of poses and attitudes 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.520
 if the person does not have experience the matter is very different here we will have 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.480
 to work declared 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.699
 it is best to talk a little with her in a relaxed and friendly way 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.910
 so that he does not see the person who is going to portray him as a stranger 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.430
 we can even explain a little how the flashes of studies of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.270
 2000 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 then in goal everyone liked it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 official speakers the congress 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.990
 gonzález 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350
 stressed 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.410
 brito 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.410
 zapico much patience 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.700
 yes 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.210
 all this will make it go away the nerves and it is shown more and more 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.010
 interested 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.950
 if necessary, you can even let her prove it and invest the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.280
 papers almost anything goes for you to take confidence and feel comfortable 3 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.860
 elorza instead of diego maradona 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 government 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 this time 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 morals did 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.959
 nothing at all 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.959
 mascherano 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.260
 doing so there are a series of constants that should mark any assignment of portrait 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.299
 both indoors and outdoors 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.139
 let's see them 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.679
 we will have to 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.989
 vary the frame 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.999
 vary the 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.489
 vary the lucc of the person 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.489
 vary backgrounds and lighting 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.669
 to insist on different framing 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.260
 the full-length framing 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.040
 that while it should never be missed in a study session is the least 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 you should practice then because of the amplitude of the plane 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.510
 the face of the person always appears very small 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:06.249
 the three-quarter frame that consists of cutting the person above the 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.109
 knee probably the most interesting just that here the face is 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.569
 he appreciates much better the same as the rest of the body that appears more 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 close to us for what is more important 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.669
 the half-length framing 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.319
 here the cut is produced by the waist 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.989
 It is a three-quarter variant but it is less popular because it does not include 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.309
 legs do not suggest the rest of the body also like the previous 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.290
 the bust portrait consists of cutting the person over the chest 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.290
 whether it is female masculine should not be included 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.469
 It is inevitable because it gives a lot of strength to the face 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.299
 also harmonized very well with the two elements with which the 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.299
 shoulders and hair 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.160
 the close-up portrait 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.819
 is more controversial because only the head of the model should appear on it 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.729
 the face take absolute and absolute protagonism 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:06.299
 but not everyone likes it because the texture of the face shows everything 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.449
 detail and very few people have uniform and beautiful skin to contemplate 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.879
 those distances 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.069
 the use of sun diffusers is recommended for this type of portrait 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.539
 and finally the foreground close-up 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.849
 here following the rules of composition the person is cut by the 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.180
 front or the front and the chin the time 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.320
 It is a very aggressive type of framing that is used very punctually 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.370
 It is not very appreciated for not showing hair completely 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.370
 but on the contrary it makes the eyes take on a strong role 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.719
 the interesting thing in some sessions fugar with all these types of framing 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:48.879
 using mostly in three rooms that we combine with the half-body 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.319
 and he liked leaving others for occasional cases 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.699
 however each photographer according to the pose and the physiognomy of the person must 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.249
 choose at each moment the type of portrait that can most favor your 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.249
 client 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:10.429
 when it comes to portraying someone we have to try to avoid portraits 

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:11.319
 frontal 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.150
 they give a too flat image of the person 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.589
 tour and a little 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:19.429
 and advancing one shoulder over the other will give a sense of depth in 

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:22.879
 the image and shape and volume to the body 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.999
 again here we must not obsess either, sometimes we have a 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:29.249
 good position we will spoil because it does not follow this rule 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.580
 the human body is hyper articulated 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.990
 at the end of the day we do a lot of posse your posture without realizing 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.530
 when a person is portrayed if we do not want simple portrait and bored 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.530
 we should try to reproduce such things 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.250
 To do this, we see small props elements with which 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.520
 we force the person to play in order to achieve this in a more 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520
 spontaneous 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.749
 It is also important to place the model on her knees sitting down and 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.749
 another series of habitual postures of the body 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.949
 It is also important to vary the angle of capture but if we do it as usual 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.500
 will come elements that are not specific to the fund that we have placed and do not 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.580
 will spoil the photo 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.319
 so you have to get her to turn different ways 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.720
 for itself without moving of the site will achieve that it was accumulated of digital taking 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.229
 naturalness is very important in the portrait if the model is sent to make a 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.339
 pose you have to try to make it but not as we have done it but as 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.149
 she would do it, that is, we have to get her to make that pose her own 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.240
 the udinese raise awareness 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.480
 anything that says nonetheless the common values ​​only they 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.480
 positive officialism 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.490
 your Creator 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.129
 by the way 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:12.439
 in a study session it is important that the model changed clothes 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:17.419
 alternating set of being paid with more elegant ones even swimsuits 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.439
 for underwear if it is more daring
