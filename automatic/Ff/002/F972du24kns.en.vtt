00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:19.280
 I'll turn the trumpet and knife over the jacket. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.280
 APA is the first article polygon tool segment in bending standing 4 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:29.810
 Because these three minutes go into the inside of the fabric and the lapel is inverted, 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:36.010
 Set the angle to 360 degrees 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.010
 Copy the left and right sides of the segment and copy and paste it into the left pattern . 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.650
 The internal line is also drawn on the fold line of the collar. 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.690
 Set the angle to 360 degrees 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:59.060
 If the simulation, press the Sync button so the shop thus setting the pattern 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.730
 Forgot bloom 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.730
 To better collapse the pattern 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:14.050
 I choose a pattern with a faded abalone and a color 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.050
 Set the bending strength to 80 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:24.560
 You can see that Colla and Lapel slowly turn upside down. 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:30.970
 To flip quickly 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.970
 Drag the mouse to pull back Calais is also 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:49.950
 Tala lapel completely reversed bending strength of the ground for safety simulations 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.950
 Lower to original 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:04.050
 The inverted side looks like this dark gray 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.910
 Right-click on the costume and double-side down 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.990
 If you check the menu 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.570
 You can see the same color on both sides 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:18.030
 2 Double-sided Rendering menu 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:24.740
 As other non surface texture of the tick rendering style costume 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.740
 It is the menu which does not show the thickness but does the same with the front and the back only.
