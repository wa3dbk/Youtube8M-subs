anyway<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:57.159> sauce<00:01:57.429> in<00:01:57.700> here

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.060 

this<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.230> first<00:02:02.440> time<00:02:02.590> I've<00:02:02.710> ever<00:02:02.800> done

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.670 
this is the first time I've ever done
this<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:03.660> hopefully<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.750> turns<00:02:04.900> out<00:02:05.290> all<00:02:05.470> right

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
and tastes okay I don't really know how

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.510 
and tastes okay I don't really know how
you<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.440> go<00:02:11.440> wrong<00:02:11.470> with<00:02:11.830> buffalo<00:02:12.280> chicken

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
you can go wrong with buffalo chicken

you can go wrong with buffalo chicken
and<00:02:13.110> nobody<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.290> go<00:02:14.470> wrong<00:02:14.590> with<00:02:14.770> smoked

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
on the breast meat just because it tends

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.260 
on the breast meat just because it tends
to<00:03:07.990> dry<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.709> say<00:03:09.640> any<00:03:09.760> extra<00:03:10.090> moisture

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
to dry out on you say any extra moisture

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.430 
to dry out on you say any extra moisture
you<00:03:10.600> can<00:03:10.780> add<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.380> better<00:03:13.260> not<00:03:14.260> try<00:03:14.410> to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
you can add to it the better not try to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:29.710 
you can add to it the better not try to
get<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.620> little<00:03:14.860> bit<00:03:15.010> on<00:03:15.550> me<00:03:15.700> as<00:03:15.850> well

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.610 

this<00:03:30.440> injector<00:03:30.830> has<00:03:31.100> holes<00:03:31.700> halfway<00:03:32.270> up<00:03:32.620> here

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
this injector has holes halfway up here

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.910 
this injector has holes halfway up here
and<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:33.950> makes<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.000> kind<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.210> difficult<00:03:35.920> when

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
and this makes it kind of difficult when

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.230 
and this makes it kind of difficult when
you're<00:03:37.100> using<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.400> smaller<00:03:37.670> cuts<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.060> meat

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
you're using the smaller cuts of meat

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.050 
you're using the smaller cuts of meat
like<00:03:38.270> this<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.040> want<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.370> squirt<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.670> lot<00:03:40.910> of

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
like this if you want to squirt a lot of

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:51.630 
like this if you want to squirt a lot of
injection<00:03:41.570> back<00:03:41.750> on<00:03:41.960> you

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.080 

all<00:03:52.640> right<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:55.010> should<00:03:55.189> do<00:03:55.400> pretty<00:03:55.579> good<00:03:55.700> for

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
all right that should do pretty good for

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.679 
all right that should do pretty good for
the<00:03:56.180> injection<00:03:56.739> making<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.799> mess<00:03:58.010> over<00:03:58.189> here

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
the injection making a mess over here

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.899 
the injection making a mess over here
now<00:03:59.689> I'm<00:03:59.780> gonna<00:03:59.900> use<00:03:59.989> this<00:04:00.290> seasoning<00:04:00.909> I'm
