also<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:32.150> am<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.570> tad<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.110> lactose<00:01:34.770> intolerant

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
also I am a tad bit lactose intolerant

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060 
also I am a tad bit lactose intolerant
so<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> dairy<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.170> tend<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
so when I have a lot of dairy I tend to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
so when I have a lot of dairy I tend to
break<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.880> skin<00:01:39.180> tends<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> break<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.439> of

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
break out my skin tends to break out of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.219 
break out my skin tends to break out of
it<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.820> notice<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it and I notice here that in the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.830 
it and I notice here that in the
ingredients<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:45.149> use<00:01:45.420> whey

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
ingredients they actually use whey

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920 
ingredients they actually use whey
protein<00:01:46.409> isolate<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.720> worry

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
protein isolate so I don't have to worry

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.620 
protein isolate so I don't have to worry
about<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.649> which<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.159> great<00:01:50.880> now

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
about that with this which is great now

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.410 
about that with this which is great now
let's<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.200> over<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.420> macronutrient

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
let's go over the macronutrient

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.380 
let's go over the macronutrient
breakdown<00:01:54.450> alright<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.500> total<00:01:55.860> fat

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
breakdown alright the total fat

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.399 
breakdown alright the total fat
is<00:01:56.479> zero<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.580> carbs<00:01:59.030> are<00:01:59.210> just<00:01:59.540> three<00:02:00.050> and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
is zero the carbs are just three and

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.060 
is zero the carbs are just three and
then<00:02:00.590> 22<00:02:01.130> grams<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.700> protein<00:02:02.240> all<00:02:03.140> right<00:02:03.409> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
then 22 grams of protein all right the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.370 
then 22 grams of protein all right the
scoops<00:02:04.550> are<00:02:05.860> about<00:02:06.860> average<00:02:07.130> size<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
scoops are about average size of a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.190 
scoops are about average size of a
protein<00:02:10.100> scoop<00:02:10.930> and<00:02:11.930> there's<00:02:12.620> 28<00:02:13.240> or<00:02:14.240> sorry<00:02:14.570> 32

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
protein scoop and there's 28 or sorry 32

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.760 
protein scoop and there's 28 or sorry 32
servings<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.450> bad<00:02:17.690> boy<00:02:18.190> okay<00:02:19.570> now<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
servings in this bad boy okay now the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.090 
servings in this bad boy okay now the
reason<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.900> macro<00:02:24.320> breakdown<00:02:24.830> is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
reason I like the macro breakdown is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.970 
reason I like the macro breakdown is
because<00:02:26.020> since<00:02:27.020> this<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> protein

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
because since this is a protein

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.060 
because since this is a protein
supplement<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:30.530> what<00:02:30.770> you're<00:02:30.890> getting

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
supplement that's what you're getting

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.370 
supplement that's what you're getting
you're<00:02:31.370> getting<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.730> protein<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.840> if<00:02:33.230> you're

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
you're getting the protein so if you're

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.280 
you're getting the protein so if you're
somebody<00:02:33.620> who<00:02:33.920> tracks<00:02:34.250> your<00:02:34.610> macros<00:02:35.290> you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
somebody who tracks your macros you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.440 
somebody who tracks your macros you
don't<00:02:36.470> really<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.340> worry<00:02:37.550> about<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
don't really have to worry about the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.770 
don't really have to worry about the
carbs<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.380> fat<00:02:39.650> being<00:02:40.310> affected<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.239> if

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
carbs and the fat being affected and if

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.580 
carbs and the fat being affected and if
you<00:02:41.900> did<00:02:42.260> want<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.160> add<00:02:43.340> fats<00:02:43.790> or<00:02:44.150> add<00:02:44.390> carbs<00:02:44.959> or

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
you did want to add fats or add carbs or

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.830 
you did want to add fats or add carbs or
calories<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.489> general<00:02:46.940> then<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.660> could

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
calories in general then you could

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.740 
calories in general then you could
easily<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.709> blend<00:02:49.100> fruits<00:02:49.970> or<00:02:50.300> peanut

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
easily just blend fruits or peanut

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.620 
easily just blend fruits or peanut
butter<00:02:50.930> almond<00:02:51.500> butter<00:02:51.739> or<00:02:52.040> whatever<00:02:52.630> you

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
butter almond butter or whatever you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.259 
butter almond butter or whatever you
like<00:02:54.070> into<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.250> shake<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.760> then<00:02:55.850> add<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
like into the shake and then add the

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.820 
like into the shake and then add the
calories<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.930> way<00:02:57.170> but<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.440> gives<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.800> that

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
calories that way but it gives you that

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.190 
calories that way but it gives you that
option<00:02:58.220> right<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.209> if<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.480> only<00:02:59.750> need<00:03:00.050> the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
option right so if you only need the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.170 
option right so if you only need the
protein<00:03:00.650> then<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.549> just<00:03:01.760> take<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
protein then you can just take the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.360 
protein then you can just take the
protein<00:03:02.630> if<00:03:03.079> you<00:03:03.230> need<00:03:03.410> more<00:03:03.590> calories<00:03:03.890> then

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
protein if you need more calories then

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.699 
protein if you need more calories then
you<00:03:04.459> can<00:03:04.640> throw<00:03:04.820> in<00:03:05.200> whatever<00:03:06.200> additional

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
you can throw in whatever additional

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.580 
you can throw in whatever additional
food<00:03:07.489> items<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> want<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.510> blend<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.110> to

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
food items you want to blend in there to

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.729 
food items you want to blend in there to
add<00:03:09.739> those<00:03:10.900> micronutrients<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.170> those

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
add those micronutrients and those

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.190 
add those micronutrients and those
macronutrients<00:03:13.930> alright<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:17.049> tried<00:03:18.049> it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
macronutrients alright and I tried it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.930 
macronutrients alright and I tried it
for<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.350> first<00:03:18.590> time<00:03:18.769> today<00:03:19.040> as<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.400> said<00:03:19.670> and

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
for the first time today as I said and

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.600 
for the first time today as I said and
to<00:03:20.420> be<00:03:20.570> honest<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:21.350> actually<00:03:22.190> really

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
to be honest it was actually really

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.949 
to be honest it was actually really
really<00:03:23.030> good<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.079> again<00:03:25.180> it's<00:03:26.180> funny<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.780> do

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
really good and again it's funny to do

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.440 
really good and again it's funny to do
these<00:03:27.140> kinds<00:03:27.920> of<00:03:28.010> reviews<00:03:28.489> because<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:29.030> kinda

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
these kinds of reviews because you kinda

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.920 
these kinds of reviews because you kinda
always<00:03:30.610> will<00:03:31.610> just<00:03:31.880> assume<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.840> gonna

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
always will just assume that it's gonna

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.069 
always will just assume that it's gonna
be<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> good<00:03:33.410> review<00:03:33.620> but<00:03:34.160> this<00:03:34.940> actually<00:03:35.269> was<00:03:35.780> a

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
be a good review but this actually was a

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.759 
be a good review but this actually was a
really<00:03:36.500> good<00:03:36.980> tasting<00:03:37.700> protein<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.540> fact<00:03:39.440> I

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
really good tasting protein in fact I

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.030 
really good tasting protein in fact I
will<00:03:40.250> go<00:03:40.519> out<00:03:40.700> on<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.940> limb<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.540> say<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:42.680> is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
will go out on a limb and say this is

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.380 
will go out on a limb and say this is
terms<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.239> flavor<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.650> best<00:03:45.980> protein<00:03:46.610> that<00:03:47.329> I

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
terms of flavor the best protein that I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.270 
terms of flavor the best protein that I
have<00:03:47.810> tried<00:03:48.110> in<00:03:48.440> mind<00:03:48.739> you

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
have tried in mind you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.720 
have tried in mind you
vanilla<00:03:50.060> milkshake<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:50.870> not<00:03:51.650> necessarily<00:03:52.310> my

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
vanilla milkshake is not necessarily my

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.009 
vanilla milkshake is not necessarily my
favorite<00:03:52.760> per<00:03:53.510> se<00:03:53.859> alright<00:03:54.859> so<00:03:55.190> as<00:03:55.790> far<00:03:56.090> as<00:03:56.329> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
favorite per se alright so as far as the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.020 
favorite per se alright so as far as the
flavor<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.859> tastes<00:03:58.370> really<00:03:58.790> really<00:03:59.150> good

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.140 

and<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.650> funny<00:04:03.890> thing<00:04:04.130> is<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.460> that<00:04:04.580> because<00:04:05.120> I

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
and the funny thing is is that because I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.270 
and the funny thing is is that because I
don't<00:04:05.420> buy<00:04:05.630> protein<00:04:06.260> supplements<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.100> don't

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
don't buy protein supplements I don't

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.720 
don't buy protein supplements I don't
even<00:04:07.430> own<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> shaker<00:04:08.440> anymore<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:10.070> I<00:04:10.460> was

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
even own a shaker anymore so I was

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.510 
even own a shaker anymore so I was
actually<00:04:11.030> able<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.690> just<00:04:12.140> stir<00:04:12.890> this<00:04:13.070> up<00:04:13.130> with

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
actually able to just stir this up with

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.270 
actually able to just stir this up with
a<00:04:13.550> spoon<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.510> consistency<00:04:15.140> was<00:04:15.950> great

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
a spoon and the consistency was great

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.800 
a spoon and the consistency was great
now<00:04:16.640> I<00:04:16.670> did<00:04:17.209> not<00:04:17.950> have<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:18.980> with<00:04:19.370> water<00:04:20.090> like<00:04:20.690> I

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
now I did not have it with water like I

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.380 
now I did not have it with water like I
usually<00:04:21.290> would<00:04:21.560> in<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:21.890> past<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.520> did<00:04:23.150> use

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
usually would in the past I did use

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.730 
usually would in the past I did use
almond<00:04:24.020> milk<00:04:24.230> which<00:04:24.590> is<00:04:24.730> my<00:04:25.730> preference<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:28.760> I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
almond milk which is my preference but I

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.500 
almond milk which is my preference but I
don't<00:04:30.740> think<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.130> would<00:04:31.280> make<00:04:31.460> much<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.240> a

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
don't think it would make much of a

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.450 
don't think it would make much of a
difference<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:33.020> terms<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.440> flavor<00:04:33.770> especially

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
difference in terms of flavor especially

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.250 
difference in terms of flavor especially
because<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.970> almond<00:04:35.390> milk<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.660> used<00:04:35.930> was<00:04:36.230> not

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
because the almond milk I used was not

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.960 
because the almond milk I used was not
flavored<00:04:37.130> all<00:04:38.000> right<00:04:38.320> so<00:04:39.820> would<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:40.850> recommend

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
flavored all right so would I recommend

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.530 
flavored all right so would I recommend
this<00:04:41.540> protein<00:04:42.850> again<00:04:43.850> if<00:04:44.120> you're<00:04:44.330> somebody

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
this protein again if you're somebody

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.630 
this protein again if you're somebody
who<00:04:44.870> has<00:04:45.080> trouble<00:04:45.470> reaching<00:04:45.830> your<00:04:46.190> protein

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
who has trouble reaching your protein

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.260 
who has trouble reaching your protein
goals<00:04:46.970> or<00:04:47.710> maybe<00:04:48.710> you're<00:04:49.490> cutting<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.120> your

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
goals or maybe you're cutting and your

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.710 
goals or maybe you're cutting and your
calories<00:04:50.960> are<00:04:51.200> low<00:04:52.120> then<00:04:53.120> yes<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.540> would

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
calories are low then yes I would

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.960 
calories are low then yes I would
definitely<00:04:54.020> recommend<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.130> simply<00:04:55.610> because<00:04:55.940> I

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
definitely recommend it simply because I

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.610 
definitely recommend it simply because I
like<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.630> macros<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:58.550> think<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.590> for<00:05:00.590> a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
like the macros and I think that for a

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.220 
like the macros and I think that for a
protein<00:05:01.100> supplement<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.820> even<00:05:02.180> not<00:05:02.900> for<00:05:03.200> a

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
protein supplement and even not for a

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.720 
protein supplement and even not for a
protein<00:05:03.650> supplement<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.250> flavor<00:05:04.550> is

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
protein supplement the flavor is

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.280 
protein supplement the flavor is
actually<00:05:05.270> quite<00:05:05.540> good<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.840> was<00:05:06.080> actually

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
actually quite good I was actually

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.430 
actually quite good I was actually
really<00:05:06.710> surprised<00:05:07.250> by<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:09.200> mean

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
really surprised by that so I mean

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.040 
really surprised by that so I mean
that's<00:05:09.560> pretty<00:05:09.919> much<00:05:10.040> it<00:05:10.520> it's<00:05:11.360> not<00:05:11.480> much<00:05:11.810> else

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
that's pretty much it it's not much else

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.440 
that's pretty much it it's not much else
to<00:05:12.410> say<00:05:12.650> I<00:05:12.919> mean<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.280> is<00:05:13.430> just<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.970> protein

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
to say I mean it is just a protein
