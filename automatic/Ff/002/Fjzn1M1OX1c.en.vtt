00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
before that or now wouldn't it just be

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.959 
before that or now wouldn't it just be
easier<00:00:48.219> if<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.539> had<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.719> bat<00:00:50.019> a<00:00:50.379> bat<00:00:51.309> yeah<00:00:51.909> you

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
easier if you had a bat a bat yeah you

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.340 
easier if you had a bat a bat yeah you
know<00:00:52.149> just<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.420> knock<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.780> other<00:00:52.809> girls<00:00:53.140> over

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
know just to knock the other girls over

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.419 
know just to knock the other girls over
it<00:00:53.409> looks<00:00:53.530> like<00:00:53.649> that's<00:00:53.769> part<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.219> game<00:00:54.249> I

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
it looks like that's part of the game I

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.200 
it looks like that's part of the game I
just<00:00:54.850> as<00:00:54.969> we<00:00:55.570> have<00:00:55.749> rules<00:00:56.019> so<00:00:56.980> we<00:00:57.969> get

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
just as we have rules so we get

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.200 
just as we have rules so we get
penalized<00:00:58.659> if<00:00:59.170> we<00:00:59.379> break<00:00:59.589> those<00:00:59.800> rules

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
penalized if we break those rules

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.369 
penalized if we break those rules
because<00:01:01.210> i<00:01:01.300> think<00:01:01.359> it<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.629> would<00:01:01.870> be<00:01:01.899> easier

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
because i think it just would be easier

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.189 
because i think it just would be easier
wouldn't<00:01:02.679> it<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:04.239> only<00:01:04.449> i<00:01:04.600> could<00:01:04.689> be<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:04.960> little

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
wouldn't it if only i could be a little

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.380 
wouldn't it if only i could be a little
tiny<00:01:05.379> microphone<00:01:05.950> up<00:01:06.460> close<00:01:06.790> pinned<00:01:07.149> to<00:01:07.299> the
