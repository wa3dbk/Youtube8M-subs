00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.100
 how come to a new motto view and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.100
 this time it's about the mountain tools murder 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.010
 yes but the bag tool is characterized 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.859
 actually a purely optics mod 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 your character meets and you see 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.310
 already I have it here on the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.689
 back and forward my sword and once 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.510
 I now have to switch back to here 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 example my sword still back to 1 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.630
 Picking the hand if I go further 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.719
 I've got a shovel to switch on and off 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 in hand and my pc's hintendrauf 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.290
 of course with the ax and with the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 ax and the bow yes how works 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.280
 it's actually quite easy in the room 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.980
 below here in your little task bar 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 here you have the expensive things 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.070
 of course, a party here could of course say 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 I really want a pickaxe now 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.910
 have and one sword and at the same time 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 but can use my bow 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 For example, you have to say yes, come on 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 not me back or that sword 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.280
 or you say again I want mine 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.570
 then have a bow only one 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.859
 you have to click here and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.799
 then the arc take the same but 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.220
 want to have in the px px 1 makes her 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.630
 so you could be the same 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.070
 that we have a sword on the back 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.390
 or just a bow in your hand and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.680
 then the same as said with the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.780
 pixel on the back 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.340
 actually very small mods 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.070
 Of course, Merry Christmas from me 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.070
 is felt to be half past three at night 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.210
 I've already said a video yes 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 I have to say the whole thing 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.079
 I'm sorry if I'm in the morning 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.400
 not so horny 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.400
 but I wanted you anyway 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.530
 usual live experience delivery 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.450
 bring videos and therefore we see 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.340
 us 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.820
 I think a special one today 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.409
 again 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 otherwise it was quite easy 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.149
 install with research and I give that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.490
 motto vision points I've been here 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.250
 relatively meaningless but has a new one 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.990
 makes cool if I have such a rpg style im 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.210
 minecraft with three if you have one 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.360
 sword on the back has as well as 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.370
 gothic back then 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.370
 still knows thank you for watching
