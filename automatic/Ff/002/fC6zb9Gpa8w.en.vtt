rocket cuz you need a tittie rocket to
get<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.980> Mars<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.400> didn't<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.090> its<00:02:30.209> spawn<00:02:30.420> in

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

this chest I got the schematic for a
moon<00:02:32.160> buggy<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.300> that's<00:02:33.690> also<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.500> moon<00:02:34.739> buggy

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
moon buggy so that's also a moon buggy

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.949 
moon buggy so that's also a moon buggy
tutorial<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> suppose<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:36.660> get<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> little

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
tutorial I suppose and you get a little

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.240 
tutorial I suppose and you get a little
shirt<00:02:37.349> as<00:02:37.440> well<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.709> that's<00:02:37.860> basically<00:02:38.069> how

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
shirt as well so that's basically how

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.130 
shirt as well so that's basically how
you<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.360> need<00:02:39.629> to<00:02:39.660> keep

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you do it and you just need to keep

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.540 
you do it and you just need to keep
farming<00:02:40.470> these<00:02:40.739> dungeons<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.129> you<00:02:41.310> managed<00:02:41.519> to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
farming these dungeons so you managed to

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.630 
farming these dungeons so you managed to
get<00:02:41.640> STS<00:02:42.030> two<00:02:42.420> schematic<00:02:43.290> which<00:02:44.160> will<00:02:44.370> allow

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
get STS two schematic which will allow

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.880 
get STS two schematic which will allow
you<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.000> build<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.660> tier<00:02:45.959> 2<00:02:46.110> rocket<00:02:46.470> which<00:02:46.680> will

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
you to build a tier 2 rocket which will

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.850 
you to build a tier 2 rocket which will
let<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.129> go<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> Mars<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.769> thanks<00:02:49.769> for
