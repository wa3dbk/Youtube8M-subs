wink<00:00:06.180> wink<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.779> then<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:06.960> realized<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:08.400> is

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
wink wink and then I realized this is

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.310 
wink wink and then I realized this is
the<00:00:08.639> whole<00:00:08.940> segment<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.480> cycle<00:00:09.840> road<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.260> is

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the whole segment of cycle road this is

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.379 
the whole segment of cycle road this is
the<00:00:10.620> first<00:00:10.800> two<00:00:10.950> trainers<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> cycle<00:00:11.910> road<00:00:12.120> and

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.140 
the first two trainers of cycle road and
then<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> cut<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.639> segment<00:00:14.639> because<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.910> was

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
then I cut the segment because I was

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.090 
then I cut the segment because I was
worried<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> third<00:00:16.080> time<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.770> would

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
worried that for the third time it would

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.010 
worried that for the third time it would
run<00:00:17.490> too<00:00:17.760> long<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:18.180> some<00:00:18.390> reason<00:00:18.750> even<00:00:18.869> though

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
run too long for some reason even though

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.860 
between that and the 55 yard line looked
about<00:05:39.290> like<00:05:39.350> fight<00:05:40.100> feed<00:05:40.430> even<00:05:41.300> if<00:05:41.540> I<00:05:41.630> went

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
about like fight feed even if I went

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.270 
about like fight feed even if I went
down<00:05:42.080> there<00:05:42.290> and<00:05:42.440> stood<00:05:42.620> next<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.950> it<00:05:43.070> looked

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
down there and stood next to it looked

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.430 
down there and stood next to it looked
at<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.460> I<00:05:43.700> probably<00:05:43.970> still<00:05:44.240> go<00:05:44.450> oh<00:05:44.690> this<00:05:45.230> looks

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
at it I probably still go oh this looks

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.220 
at it I probably still go oh this looks
like<00:05:45.590> maybe<00:05:45.800> two<00:05:46.040> yards<00:05:46.520> I<00:05:46.669> just<00:05:47.570> cannot

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
like maybe two yards I just cannot

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.680 
like maybe two yards I just cannot
estimate<00:05:48.800> anything<00:05:49.669> I<00:05:49.910> mean<00:05:50.090> some<00:05:50.330> people<00:05:50.360> can

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
estimate anything I mean some people can

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.210 
estimate anything I mean some people can
look<00:05:50.780> at<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.140> go<00:05:51.260> yeah<00:05:51.500> that<00:05:51.530> looks<00:05:51.980> like<00:05:52.070> it

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
look at and go yeah that looks like it

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.740 
look at and go yeah that looks like it
might<00:05:52.340> be<00:05:52.430> about<00:05:52.580> four<00:05:52.880> inches<00:05:53.210> off<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:53.690> I'd

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
might be about four inches off and I'd

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.740 
might be about four inches off and I'd
be<00:05:53.990> going<00:05:54.169> Oh<00:05:54.620> what<00:05:55.580> are<00:05:55.669> you<00:05:55.760> even<00:05:56.060> seeing<00:05:56.510> I

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
be going Oh what are you even seeing I

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.070 
be going Oh what are you even seeing I
guess<00:05:56.810> I<00:05:57.680> just<00:05:58.460> don't<00:05:58.610> get<00:05:58.760> it

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
guess I just don't get it

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.120 
guess I just don't get it
mmm<00:06:01.140> I<00:06:01.290> mean<00:06:01.530> I'm<00:06:01.650> really<00:06:01.860> good<00:06:01.950> at<00:06:02.010> math

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
mmm I mean I'm really good at math

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.710 
mmm I mean I'm really good at math
otherwise<00:06:02.580> like<00:06:02.790> fractions<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.270> stuff<00:06:03.510> but

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
otherwise like fractions and stuff but

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.320 
otherwise like fractions and stuff but
just<00:06:03.860> looking<00:06:04.860> at<00:06:05.010> something<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.640> guessing<00:06:05.910> I

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
just looking at something and guessing I

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.390 
just looking at something and guessing I
mean<00:06:06.960> at<00:06:07.050> least<00:06:07.080> with<00:06:07.350> angles<00:06:07.800> you've<00:06:07.980> kind<00:06:08.280> of

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
mean at least with angles you've kind of

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.160 
mean at least with angles you've kind of
got<00:06:08.640> something<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.180> go<00:06:09.270> by<00:06:09.540> I<00:06:09.750> mean<00:06:09.870> you<00:06:09.990> know

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
got something to go by I mean you know

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.250 
got something to go by I mean you know
what<00:06:10.380> a<00:06:10.410> right<00:06:10.710> degree<00:06:11.090> my<00:06:12.090> saying<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.450> went

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
what a right degree my saying I went

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.750 
what a right degree my saying I went
somewhere<00:06:13.470> between<00:06:13.680> 90<00:06:14.160> degree<00:06:14.430> and<00:06:14.580> right

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
somewhere between 90 degree and right

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.660 
somewhere between 90 degree and right
angle<00:06:15.090> so<00:06:16.020> choose<00:06:16.470> either<00:06:16.650> of<00:06:16.830> those<00:06:17.040> and

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
angle so choose either of those and

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.540 
angle so choose either of those and
we'll<00:06:18.330> slow<00:06:19.020> down<00:06:19.200> while<00:06:19.440> we<00:06:19.620> walk<00:06:19.800> out<00:06:20.160> of<00:06:20.220> the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
we'll slow down while we walk out of the

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:29.060 
we'll slow down while we walk out of the
bike<00:06:20.700> path<00:06:21.500> so<00:06:22.500> I<00:06:22.530> mean<00:06:23.180> just<00:06:25.790> estimating<00:06:28.070> it's

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
bike path so I mean just estimating it's

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.720 
bike path so I mean just estimating it's
so<00:06:29.250> much<00:06:29.460> I<00:06:29.850> could<00:06:30.630> show<00:06:30.810> custom<00:06:31.170> anything

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
so much I could show custom anything

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.850 
so much I could show custom anything
okay<00:06:32.730> and<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:33.780> I<00:06:33.990> don't<00:06:34.050> like<00:06:34.290> estimating

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
okay and and I don't like estimating

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.200 
okay and and I don't like estimating
mean<00:06:34.980> what's<00:06:35.160> the<00:06:35.280> point<00:06:35.490> of<00:06:35.610> estimating<00:06:36.120> if

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
mean what's the point of estimating if

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.760 
mean what's the point of estimating if
you<00:06:36.300> can<00:06:36.420> get<00:06:36.570> an<00:06:36.660> exact<00:06:36.990> number<00:06:37.140> it's<00:06:37.560> really

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
you can get an exact number it's really

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.120 
you can get an exact number it's really
annoying<00:06:38.180> and<00:06:39.180> nice<00:06:41.360> we're<00:06:42.360> by<00:06:42.690> the<00:06:42.750> beach
