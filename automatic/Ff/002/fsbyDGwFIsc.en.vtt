guys<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.490> keyboard<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:44.189> trackpad

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
guys is the keyboard and the trackpad

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.969 
guys is the keyboard and the trackpad
the<00:01:45.689> keyboards<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.470> almost<00:01:46.680> seem

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the keyboards on them almost seem

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
the keyboards on them almost seem
identical<00:01:47.579> they're<00:01:48.000> both<00:01:48.149> chiclet<00:01:48.600> style

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
identical they're both chiclet style

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
identical they're both chiclet style
they're<00:01:49.079> slightly<00:01:49.350> raised<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.189> large

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
they're slightly raised really large

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.249 
they're slightly raised really large
strike<00:01:50.790> pad<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.540> MacBook<00:01:51.869> Air<00:01:52.020> has<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
strike pad the MacBook Air has a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
strike pad the MacBook Air has a
slightly<00:01:52.560> bigger<00:01:52.950> trackpad<00:01:53.430> than<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.939> chrome

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
slightly bigger trackpad than the chrome

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
slightly bigger trackpad than the chrome
notebook<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> chrome<00:01:55.979> notebooks

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
notebook but the chrome notebooks

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.399 
notebook but the chrome notebooks
trackpad<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.240> responsive<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:58.229> as

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
trackpad is really responsive not as

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
trackpad is really responsive not as
responsive<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> MacBook<00:01:59.520> Air<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.969> again

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
responsive as the MacBook Air but again

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.840 
responsive as the MacBook Air but again
this<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> beta<00:02:01.140> computer<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:02.040> beta<00:02:02.369> laptop

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
this is the beta computer or beta laptop

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.069 
this is the beta computer or beta laptop
and<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> don't<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.630> everything<00:02:03.990> is

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and so I don't think everything is

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.480 
and so I don't think everything is
supposed<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.560> perfect<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.280> for

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
supposed to be perfect on it but for

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.210 
supposed to be perfect on it but for
what<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:06.719> good<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.220> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
what it is it's really good I really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.070 
what it is it's really good I really
like<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> layout<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.030> very<00:02:09.330> similar<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
like the layout it's very similar to the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.340 
like the layout it's very similar to the
MacBook<00:02:10.440> Airs<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.950> keyboard<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.670> really

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
MacBook Airs on keyboard so it's really

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.290 
MacBook Airs on keyboard so it's really
familiar<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:13.040> experience<00:02:13.850> when<00:02:14.030> you're<00:02:14.150> using

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
familiar I experience when you're using

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.090 
familiar I experience when you're using
either<00:02:14.630> one<00:02:14.780> or<00:02:14.960> when<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> go<00:02:15.440> back<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.650> forth

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
either one or when I go back and forth

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.640 
either one or when I go back and forth
they<00:02:16.910> both<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.480> sights<00:02:17.780> camera<00:02:18.230> iSight

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
they both have I sights camera iSight

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.070 
they both have I sights camera iSight
cameras<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.370> camera<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> MacBook<00:02:20.720> here

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
cameras the camera on the MacBook here

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.870 
cameras the camera on the MacBook here
it<00:02:21.620> does<00:02:21.800> seem<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.040> work<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.460> little<00:02:22.580> bit<00:02:22.760> better

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
it does seem to work a little bit better

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.080 
it does seem to work a little bit better
or<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:24.380> has<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> better<00:02:24.830> sharper<00:02:25.520> image<00:02:25.820> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
or it has a better sharper image and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.780 
or it has a better sharper image and
again<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> tech<00:02:27.740> bandit<00:02:28.430> testing

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
again this is a tech bandit testing

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.880 
again this is a tech bandit testing
laptop<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:29.960> think<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.620> camera

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
laptop so I don't think that the camera

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.710 
laptop so I don't think that the camera
should<00:02:31.040> be<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.340> good<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:31.790> just<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.540> note

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
should be that good but just to note

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.410 
should be that good but just to note
that<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:33.200> not<00:02:33.380> as<00:02:33.680> good<00:02:33.920> at<00:02:34.610> taking<00:02:34.850> images

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that it's not as good at taking images

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.030 
that it's not as good at taking images
or<00:02:35.630> shots<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.560> doesn't<00:02:36.860> seem<00:02:37.010> that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
or shots of you it doesn't seem that

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.420 
or shots of you it doesn't seem that
nice<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:39.470> both<00:02:39.710> of<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.980> screens<00:02:40.280> are

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
nice but if both of the screens are

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.800 
nice but if both of the screens are
relatively<00:02:40.940> damnit<00:02:41.570> in<00:02:41.780> my<00:02:42.020> opinion<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
relatively damnit in my opinion the the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.990 
relatively damnit in my opinion the the
one<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.830> chrome<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.640> little<00:02:46.910> bit

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
one on the chrome is a little bit

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.690 
one on the chrome is a little bit
smaller<00:02:47.270> than<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.570> MacBook<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.520> I'm<00:02:49.520> not

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
smaller than the MacBook here I'm not

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.130 
smaller than the MacBook here I'm not
going<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.940> go<00:02:50.030> over<00:02:50.270> all<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.600> specs<00:02:50.930> and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
going to go over all the specs and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.510 
going to go over all the specs and
everything<00:02:51.470> about<00:02:51.890> either<00:02:52.130> one<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
everything about either one of the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.800 
everything about either one of the
computers<00:02:52.880> all<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.180> stuff<00:02:53.360> can<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.540> found

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
computers all that stuff can be found

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.450 
computers all that stuff can be found
online<00:02:54.020> but<00:02:54.440> what<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.590> really<00:02:54.890> want<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.310> is

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
online but what I really want to do is

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.540 
online but what I really want to do is
just<00:02:55.820> talk<00:02:56.000> about<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:57.050> user<00:02:57.260> experience<00:02:57.770> how

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
just talk about the user experience how

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.340 
just talk about the user experience how
fast<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.030> boots<00:02:59.210> up<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.750> different<00:03:00.020> things

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
fast it boots up and different things

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.720 
fast it boots up and different things
that<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.530> like<00:03:00.710> about<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.220> I'm<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.610> go

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
that I like about it so I'm going to go

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.730 
that I like about it so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.000> turn<00:03:02.090> both<00:03:02.300> of<00:03:02.360> them<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:02.780> now<00:03:08.740> okay

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
ahead and turn both of them on now okay

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.310 
ahead and turn both of them on now okay
so<00:03:09.920> they<00:03:10.910> both<00:03:11.090> they<00:03:11.420> both<00:03:11.600> boot<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.990> up<00:03:12.110> around

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
so they both they both boot it up around

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.490 
so they both they both boot it up around
the<00:03:12.770> same<00:03:12.980> amount<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.460> time<00:03:13.670> or<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:15.110> seems<00:03:15.320> like

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the same amount of time or it seems like

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.840 
the same amount of time or it seems like
the<00:03:15.620> Apple<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> little<00:03:16.340> bit<00:03:16.430> faster<00:03:16.730> than

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
the Apple is a little bit faster than

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.870 
the Apple is a little bit faster than
the<00:03:16.910> Chrome<00:03:17.210> but<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:19.160> sounds<00:03:19.400> like<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.550> lot<00:03:19.730> of

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
the Chrome but it sounds like a lot of

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.460 
the Chrome but it sounds like a lot of
bugs<00:03:20.000> I'm<00:03:20.210> making<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> lot<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.660> excuses<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:21.350> it

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
bugs I'm making a lot of excuses for it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.920 
bugs I'm making a lot of excuses for it
but<00:03:21.620> again<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.580> still<00:03:22.820> it's<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.780> a

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
but again it's still it's it's a

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.450 
but again it's still it's it's a
relatively<00:03:24.350> new<00:03:24.470> laptop<00:03:24.980> that's<00:03:25.250> being

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
relatively new laptop that's being

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.940 
relatively new laptop that's being
tested<00:03:25.640> out<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.480> expect<00:03:27.020> it<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.350> not<00:03:27.380> be<00:03:27.560> as

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
tested out so I expect it to not be as

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.070 
tested out so I expect it to not be as
fast<00:03:28.250> even<00:03:28.670> though<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.180> chrome<00:03:29.420> notebook<00:03:29.870> and

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
fast even though the chrome notebook and

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.050 
fast even though the chrome notebook and
the<00:03:30.380> MacBook<00:03:30.650> Air<00:03:30.920> both<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.550> solid-state

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
the MacBook Air both have solid-state

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.230 
the MacBook Air both have solid-state
hard<00:03:32.120> drives<00:03:33.610> another<00:03:34.610> thing<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.000> wanted<00:03:35.180> to

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
hard drives another thing I wanted to

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.570 
hard drives another thing I wanted to
show<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.480> guys<00:03:35.570> is<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.320> instant-on<00:03:37.250> feature

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
show you guys is the instant-on feature

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.520 
show you guys is the instant-on feature
on<00:03:37.820> both<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.180> them<00:03:38.300> so<00:03:38.510> let's<00:03:39.020> try<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.350> one

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
on both of them so let's try that one

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.610 
on both of them so let's try that one
out<00:03:40.570> see<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.870> open<00:03:42.140> them<00:03:42.230> at<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.470> same

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
out see if I can open them at the same

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.960 
out see if I can open them at the same
time<00:03:44.290> Wow<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.890> chrome<00:03:46.160> notebook<00:03:46.550> actually

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
time Wow so the chrome notebook actually

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.460 
time Wow so the chrome notebook actually
launched<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.330> little<00:03:47.570> bit<00:03:47.660> faster<00:03:48.080> from<00:03:48.320> what<00:03:48.440> I

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
launched a little bit faster from what I

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.460 
launched a little bit faster from what I
can<00:03:48.710> tell<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:50.150> woke<00:03:50.360> up<00:03:50.480> right<00:03:50.660> away<00:03:50.840> from<00:03:50.990> that

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
can tell it woke up right away from that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.070 
can tell it woke up right away from that
sleep<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.520> in<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:53.270> respect<00:03:53.450> because<00:03:53.780> it's

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
sleep so it in that respect because it's

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.450 
sleep so it in that respect because it's
a<00:03:54.170> different<00:03:54.350> OS<00:03:54.740> though<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.100> might<00:03:55.310> be<00:03:55.340> a

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
a different OS though it might be a

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.600 
a different OS though it might be a
little<00:03:55.580> bit<00:03:55.790> smaller<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.240> little<00:03:56.710> a<00:03:57.710> little

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
little bit smaller a little a little

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.510 
little bit smaller a little a little
easier<00:03:58.910> for<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.450> fur<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.410> resume<00:04:00.770> after<00:04:01.040> you

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
easier for the fur to resume after you

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.680 
easier for the fur to resume after you
wake<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.060> back<00:04:02.090> up<00:04:03.760> but<00:04:04.760> they're<00:04:05.270> both<00:04:05.450> still

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
wake it back up but they're both still

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.120 
wake it back up but they're both still
really<00:04:06.080> quick<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:09.470> for<00:04:09.710> the<00:04:09.770> next<00:04:09.890> thing<00:04:10.100> that

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
really quick so for the next thing that

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.680 
really quick so for the next thing that
I<00:04:10.250> kind<00:04:10.460> of<00:04:10.490> want<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.730> do<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:11.030> want<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.480> pull<00:04:11.660> up

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
I kind of want to do I want to pull up

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.420 
I kind of want to do I want to pull up
YouTube<00:04:12.110> on<00:04:12.290> both<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.620> these<00:04:12.680> machines<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.250> see

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
YouTube on both of these machines to see

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.400 
YouTube on both of these machines to see
how<00:04:14.000> fast<00:04:14.240> they<00:04:14.420> connect<00:04:14.750> now<00:04:14.900> both<00:04:15.110> of<00:04:15.260> them

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
how fast they connect now both of them

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.530 
how fast they connect now both of them
are<00:04:15.560> on<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:15.770> wireless<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.520> network<00:04:16.910> set<00:04:17.420> up

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
are on the wireless and network set up

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.030 
are on the wireless and network set up
at<00:04:17.660> my<00:04:17.780> home<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.260> so<00:04:18.380> both<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:18.590> them<00:04:18.799> should

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
at my home and so both of them should

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.250 
at my home and so both of them should
connect<00:04:19.489> almost<00:04:19.820> at<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.060> same<00:04:20.239> speed<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:20.810> let

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
connect almost at the same speed so let

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.600 
connect almost at the same speed so let
me<00:04:21.350> go<00:04:21.470> ahead<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.710> get<00:04:21.890> that<00:04:22.040> set<00:04:22.220> up<00:04:22.280> for

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
me go ahead and get that set up for

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:34.240 
me go ahead and get that set up for
guys

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.190 

okay<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.180> looks<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:35.630> MacBook<00:04:35.840> here

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
okay so it looks like the MacBook here

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.160 
okay so it looks like the MacBook here
is<00:04:36.380> done<00:04:36.980> loading<00:04:37.670> up<00:04:37.960> YouTube

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
is done loading up YouTube

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.380 
is done loading up YouTube
and<00:04:39.260> then<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.340> chrome<00:04:40.610> finished<00:04:41.060> slightly

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
and then the chrome finished slightly

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.930 
and then the chrome finished slightly
after<00:04:41.680> until<00:04:42.680> they<00:04:42.830> they<00:04:43.100> seem<00:04:43.310> relatively

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
after until they they seem relatively

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.330 
after until they they seem relatively
quick<00:04:44.180> they<00:04:44.480> both<00:04:44.960> seem<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.980> finish<00:04:46.130> around

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
quick they both seem to finish around

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.920 
quick they both seem to finish around
the<00:04:46.550> same<00:04:46.760> time<00:04:47.000> but<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.300> MacBook<00:04:47.630> Air<00:04:47.810> is<00:04:47.840> a

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
the same time but the MacBook Air is a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.100 
the same time but the MacBook Air is a
little<00:04:48.230> bit<00:04:48.320> faster<00:04:49.660> other<00:04:50.660> things<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:51.080> I

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
little bit faster other things that I

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.240 
little bit faster other things that I
noticed<00:04:51.530> with<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.370> chrome<00:04:53.270> notebook<00:04:53.780> is

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
noticed with the chrome notebook is

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.740 
noticed with the chrome notebook is
sometimes<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.430> crashes<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.850> little<00:04:56.150> bit<00:04:56.300> when

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
sometimes it crashes a little bit when

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.530 
sometimes it crashes a little bit when
you're<00:04:56.870> downloading<00:04:57.050> different<00:04:57.650> apps<00:04:58.510> you

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
you're downloading different apps you

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.020 
you're downloading different apps you
you<00:05:00.320> can<00:05:00.560> browse<00:05:00.950> most<00:05:01.280> of<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.520> internet<00:05:01.910> but

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
you can browse most of the internet but

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.760 
you can browse most of the internet but
there's<00:05:02.240> some<00:05:02.450> things<00:05:02.900> that<00:05:03.080> you'll<00:05:03.530> have<00:05:03.710> a

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
there's some things that you'll have a

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.250 
there's some things that you'll have a
hard<00:05:04.100> time<00:05:04.250> with<00:05:04.520> some<00:05:04.730> type<00:05:04.910> of<00:05:05.060> flash<00:05:05.810> videos

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
hard time with some type of flash videos

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.650 
hard time with some type of flash videos
where<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.680> won't<00:05:06.830> be<00:05:06.920> able<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.250> see<00:05:07.400> them<00:05:07.660> and

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
where you won't be able to see them and

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.050 
where you won't be able to see them and
I<00:05:09.320> guess<00:05:09.500> that's<00:05:09.740> with<00:05:10.430> every<00:05:10.700> note<00:05:10.850> because

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
I guess that's with every note because

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.330 
I guess that's with every note because
of<00:05:11.660> course<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.110> MacBook<00:05:12.470> Air<00:05:12.620> has<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:13.130> same

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
of course the MacBook Air has that same

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.720 
of course the MacBook Air has that same
type<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.550> trouble<00:05:13.970> sometimes<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:15.460> can't<00:05:16.460> really

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
type of trouble sometimes I can't really

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.220 
type of trouble sometimes I can't really
load<00:05:16.940> up<00:05:16.970> too<00:05:17.240> many<00:05:17.390> programs<00:05:17.900> or<00:05:18.050> anything

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
load up too many programs or anything

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.770 
they both have their own place but each
one<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.050> them<00:05:39.230> is<00:05:39.380> extremely<00:05:40.280> different<00:05:40.780> other
