00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.660
 elastic wristbands for beginners 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:15.839
 white material and elastics 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.539
 red pink yellow green blue then bad 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.410
 as it can be called a machine to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.070
 a Kurdish bracelet have or a good hook 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.990
 then but no begin to start 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.830
 I take a red elastic 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.630
 I place it like these on the board 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.110
 I take another elastic too 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.559
 the same color and I put it online a 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:49.500
 on top of each other like that and I did 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:51.920
 same for the middle and for the other 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920
 side 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.890
 so to continue we take a 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.130
 elastic there is a rose 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:09.650
 and then places like this and then 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.810
 other to continue we do the same 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:22.460
 thing for the middle and for the other 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:24.920
 side after you repeat the same 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.619
 operation for the other four 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.259
 colors then take the white is at 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.090
 makes triangles in this sense the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.090
 first here you do not do it yourself 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.899
 started or second but here you the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.619
 finish and how far last now 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.830
 we take the toothpick or the hook seen 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.560
 go through here bypass the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.430
 white and you hang the ruble 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.470
 wanted to go over latino and you 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.399
 are going to wear it on the other 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.250
 I will take it with my hands and 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.280
 you do it the same way so 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.080
 repetitive like that on all 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.600
 others on the middle and the other side 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.750
 so your bracelet should look like 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.660
 to them like this and also at the bottom it s 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.190

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:40.310

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.560

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.320
