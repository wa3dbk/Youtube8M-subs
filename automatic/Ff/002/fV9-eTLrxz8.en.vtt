00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 hello everyone this is in today's video 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.270
 I want to bring you the third part of the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.360
 guide to the glass at a time 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.509
 in this video we will see how to overcome 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.200
 maze of gorgons and how to overcome 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.200
 the platform part 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.030
 also in the video I will show you where 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.309
 find the two boxes in the labyrinth of the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.050
 gorgons and so let's start before 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.420
 begin I know there is another way 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.420
 we passed by the door that is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.059
 opens behind the temple knows that there is 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.520
 just another way though that is 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.160
 for another video because there is the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.760
 fifth cash when I have a video in which 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.059
 we can get it I will post invitation to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.309
 that's the part of that sword then 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.619
 they will suffer the templar and we go down there 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.080
 one road only 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.479
 sorry you got to this point 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.929
 we should jump off then 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.600
 careful it is easy to die also because the 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.939
 quite high distance 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.619
 so jump down, try to use the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.030
 your double jump reached the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:29.670
 end of the precipice and should gone 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.640
 all good of course you will suffer anyway 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.000
 damage despite the second jump though 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 in theory you shouldn't die to this 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.070
 point we will proceed towards the first one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.530
 of the two cases in the labyrinth of the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.170
 you will have to go to the left and go up 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.600
 this on this rock building is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.580
 quite easy maybe it's a bit 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:02.820
 problematic for sorcerers though 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:06.230
 sharon at least once overcome 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.630
 the ledge the road is one as always 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.490
 continued straight and at the bottom of the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.790
 cave you will find the first of the two 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.860
 crates the crates in the vault as for the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.720
 first house that the opening of 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.870
 gates has a high probability of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.860
 find ascending objects and a small one 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.410
 chance of finding weapons 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.710
 more exotic this class maybe 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.960
 also the second of the maze will have 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.670
 the possibility of leaving you armor 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.490
 there is a legendary class of the vault 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.720
 one for each for each class so if 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.430
 you find it good for you 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.390
 however it is not nothing to that also 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.370
 because the armor of classes does not 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.400
 they have bonuses so they are quite useful 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.160
 let us proceed for the second house 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.670
 from the spinning point of the maze 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.020
 we go to the right and follow the continuation 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.790
 the path that I show you been 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.040
 watch out for the gorgons because I don't have it 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.620
 said before but I say now if it is 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.799
 gorgons see you 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.790
 the game closes you can knock them down 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.010
 obviously I'll show you later how to do it 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.170
 however in general this is the part in 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.450
 which moves more because precisely the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.489
 gorgons are cough to throw down and e 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.579
 maybe they decide instantly 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.040
 45 seconds so this is the second 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:34.040
 home even here possibility of dropping e 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.420
 ascending and exotic objects and time 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.250
 let's throw down a gorgon you'll have to 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.400
 choose one, possibly the first one 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.930
 because usually alone and to throw it 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.560
 down it should concentrate all the fire 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.799
 that you have on your gorgona 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.420
 he does not have much life in this in this 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.670
 juncture we are seen to kill her but there 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.140
 killed because I do n't know how much wide 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.940
 will give you a crimor card and then 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.280
 nothing that not too much of anything 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.989
 simply if you want to have a card 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.500
 of memory and read them some history of 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:11.180
 destinies since the game is not has not 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.730
 entered do it at this point there is 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.709
 the real road before 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.060
 begin I would like to emphasize that there 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.489
 there are many other roads this is the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.760
 the road we use, some pass by 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.039
 river we pass by the waterfall 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.650
 question of choices this is a bit 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.820
 safer in my opinion also because 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.700
 from above the gorgons do not see you 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.770
 so go up the waterfall has come to 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.000
 at this point let the gorgons pass 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:42.590
 that you have below and head to the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.680
 mountain left one thing to say is that 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.540
 the hunters if 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.340
 they use the skills of the blade 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.060
 dancing that makes me invisible 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.740
 therefore they cannot be identified 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.740
 it's very convenient for hunters 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.500
 usually we do not stop here and leave 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.290
 let all the gorgons pass I don't know 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.520
 because that is so around anyway 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.780
 from the top you can check the 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.780
 situation 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.820
 often to get a broader view 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.270
 of the zone I also jump to the left not 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:21.530
 I did it in this case but it is anyway 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.660
 easy enough and proceed towards 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.240
 the way out of the labyrinth 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.330
 it's very simple once you arrive 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.800
 will be finished at this point there will be the 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.750
 part of the platforms the road like 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.360
 as usual it is an era part of 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.120
 platforms can be overcome 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.160
 entirely on the right side 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.310
 you will have to get to this point as 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.110
 see the titan using the super e 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.610
 death from that death enhancement 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.730
 from above it will easily come to the a 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.560
 right side 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.770
 continuing along the corridor yes 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.370
 will come to the door where it will be 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.960
 the last real phase of the time so if 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.670
 you liked the video that was useful 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.350
 left online if you and sign up 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.150
 this is the third part we see ourselves in 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.010
 next video that will probably be on 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.910
 on atheist and the keepers 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.910
 Hello
