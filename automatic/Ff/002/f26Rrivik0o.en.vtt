00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.970
 a new squad builder i have mobile 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.340

 income up to 500 k so said so 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.670
 done 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.139
 here now go see on target we throw 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.639
 thibaut courtois 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.350
 has in 5 games of their reading 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.630
 where he is the best keeper so that us 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.039
 one of the best in the game and anyway 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.869
 the best of the bpl 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.510
 then you throw the judge throw 10 st paul 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.130
 verhaegh great he really is such 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
 positive surprise 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.670
 feels pretty fast has no 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.630
 duelkracht needed because he just 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.460
 just stand person earlier 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 pickling such a fucking flawless good one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.149
 also fit 80 3 million lubricants on prima 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.559
 I like it because it is crazy European 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.610
 you have better wordpress and he stuff 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.170
 just very well 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.730
 center back legs and I don't have to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.989
 tell why because you know him 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.100
 simply the best sent back is out of the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.480
 bundesliga 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 I think there is little discussion about 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.140
 then we throw john terry steam exactly 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.219
 and besides well beside the quick pennies 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 stream you do not notice the fact that he 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.260
 it is now slow but defensive 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.399
 he is so good fitting too say 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.539
 but that a leaf is marked 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.219
 crossing then it seems so bad 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.379
 great positioning for defending 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.949
 photo spines medium my work it really one 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.379
 closet 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 dims see aspi on left back very much 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.560
 good anyways as a man so normal 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.890
 tickets without favorite left back 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 the bpl and these jaws wow says that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.950
 is one how i could write it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.200
 super fast very good defend good 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.189
 passing I think you miss a little we 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.869
 we go him he also has one 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.970
 surprising shot but I'm not going there 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 Widely used to reliable to joho 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.380
 then we have file sheets as the first CD 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.900
 very good especially next to the casting 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.329
 and the night yaya would tour these two 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 from each other very well at la foule 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.689
 yes it is not possible to say in it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.189
 feels very smart will be the right place 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.100
 good distinction really has one 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.350
 treaty good pass really show behind and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.280
 then touring is really wanted his long shot off 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.820
 and to be real 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.439
 also performs normally and then first and is 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 marieke i would already mention twitter if you give me 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.030
 If you follow, you will know that he would 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.259
 sit one of the best cm are the game 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.790
 super- dangerous tribble surprisingly fast 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.470
 pretty good shot and especially that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.640
 tribble helps him so recently there most 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.750
 that just any ball can go through 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.759
 almost ticking 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 Another CMS service is a factory as and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.070
 63 5 matches is the men 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.750
 unbelievable nothing else unbelievable 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.330
 campbell quickly bought what the wolf 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.489
 was us but he really does stay 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.989
 nutrition and it fits so well that it 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.370
 anyone can bring the position 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.930
 then you throw it and lifeless chin icuro 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 in the space travel also to the opinion 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.760
 very good a74 deemed firm passing that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.660
 fits you very well with me 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.030
 in addition, they both have great 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.470
 shot good rimmel good tendon both 4 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.660
 star skills and fished week for dirty 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.160
 whore hurt popular hi medium 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.319
 mud mosque that is exactly what you are looking for 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.670
 this 10 but there is something else to it 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.900
 I also have change for a while 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.670
 pan airport i know not everyone 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.110
 filigree very tired this needs to buy so me 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.760
 have the affordable alternative 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.080
 distinction this is the 10 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.060
 she is in the bank costs I think 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.739
 100 k maximum and that is natural 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.780
 maximum so you can describe them film 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.850
 in the pick we have 10 media 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.230
 from a factory like a corner costa 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.980
 normal version you can just pointed 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.290
 throw 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.670
 maat each danced cdm and then kun 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.590
 you choose or tell decline i think 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.569
 that film is that anyway want to do 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.069
 an expired lease or as I would 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.099
 say if muscles looks quintus normal 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.680
 say on target men whose socratic 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.239
 that check and pander digitarian and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.590
 adriaan ramos 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.940
 basically the whole right side of it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.170
 dortmund and then you can actually do it 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.239
 don't go wrong they all have one 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.099
 piece of great qualities but this 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.209
 so is the team this is the bank like you 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.040
 it can change if you don't have the money 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.480
 and you're going to see now why this 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.890
 team for me 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.079
 suspect good governance see the here too 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.730
 again that against which I or two are seated 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.400
 they are just about the best teams you have 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.799
 and my team picked them up 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.590
 all piece by piece i think it 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.400
 the best thing about the team is that it is social 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.769
 cutting 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.750
 that must be he was such a positive 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.100
 surprise and the mar talked if there 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.019
 but if know through a two a two 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.180
 352 does n't seem to be that nice 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.090
 work for me but he was so dominant 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.310
 in this the in this formation of how this 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.440
 works with stay for then instructions 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.810
 but for backs have pitch taking 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.310
 cdm they have 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.019
 cross draw with CRM they have 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.579
 head for it and we have rush hour 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.739
 getting drunk and get in hand 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.030
 so that is his but i have both in 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.859
 the english i know so nice to give us 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.780
 seriously i also do n't know him but 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.310
 what I really liked what I normally 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.720
 spoken really beautiful really comes 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.359
 even without a striker was not 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.060
 really great dribbling and guido 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.609
 and live or ski are so good at the ball 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.979
 is also a few clips and I coming 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.720
 I still think it is that way again 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.789
 the ball seemed like an impossible situation 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.560
 but by how good he is with the tree and 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.220
 a very silent defender explains everything 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.060
 what on the floor 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.710
 he turns away for a moment and just has one 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.690
 and literally for the intake and that is 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.790
 so you also see this goal by Lions 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.050
 bottom corpse is just dirty how there 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.000
 by tribble 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.740
 it's just really pages outrageous 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.180
 and so many more good things about it 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.530
 ten more what I can literally spend hours on 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.669
 longer upper hand gets one of the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.510
 greatest beasts I have ever had 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.070
 used 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.419
 I really don't expect anything from it 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.710
 approximately customer 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.410
 I mean rail track we know 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.090
 all that check or pda and I thought 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.410
 I give him a chance because only one 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.750
 rechtsback had no specific links 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.919
 needed and we are busy okay I said advice 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.710
 I give him a chance 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.870
 he has such good or lounge sets 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.940
 and I know you don't expect it 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.530
 give it a try because i know that pch 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.570
 also has a very pissed off long shot 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.120
 can have but you have defensive 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.320
 so much to story that just really 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.570
 surprisingly, he is also just very bad 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.580
 quickly what is something that I didn't have with me 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.020
 expected because yes I have not and above 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.479
 their ticket is not always in me either 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.250
 it he played very well 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.590
 and therefore i think it is really on the 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.050
 best right back option is also carriage where 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.669
 I have said many times in videos and 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.860
 so I know it sounds like me 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.520
 well about short error she usually goes from 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.990
 kuta 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.490
 but that easy to beat the how the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.289
 Constitution you get a low shot 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.760
 always not the case at all 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.530
 I had and I really liked him very much 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.180
 I think the best is him but them 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.260
 reflexes I know you do not like 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.479
 thesis that person will be immediately 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.190
 speak boring bonheur goals but see there 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.690
 were moments when he was from space one 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.210
 student admits slag salt from aldo 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.860
 he tackles the most dangerous 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.570
 shots and I think you know that 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.060
 that sincere of bo that I expected 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.740
 not and I know the 86 again the keeper 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.460
 is just a few of the things he does 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.590
 made aside 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.760
 woman i think the only true whole 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.470
 many of you still are the doubt 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.690
 is terry speed i can imagine 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.940
 I also understand best if you have none 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.530
 want to defend slow but I have the 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.479
 Fever noticed that in recent months 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.150
 if you are just a pretty slow person 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.380
 defender like a whole to me 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.710
 that without a very extreme example 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.440
 but also terry and some other slomer 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.750
 armies or butter pique just do it just 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.580
 really just do it because if you do them 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.590
 next to the snow box set like a builder 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.450
 tank a socratic then you just notice 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.190
 really nothing and it is really nice because 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.539
 their defending duality are often like that 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.940
 awesome 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.800
 this team about fun is just really whole 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.050
 well i have great attackers that 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.030
 very very start the ball cdm each other 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.650
 well supplement and 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.530
 oh really a fantastic team for the 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.610
 price that I think costs 400k on his box 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.110
 it's not going to say how many 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.570
 namely, she ate most first owner 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.040
 try this should buy and told of 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.570
 must before you play because this is really one 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.760
 from the feyenoord this i inform them 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.140
 but kept so good for all but 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.100
 who comes for likes can pick up for 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.480
 be a chill thank you for it 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.720
 and I'll see you later 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.720
 shell
