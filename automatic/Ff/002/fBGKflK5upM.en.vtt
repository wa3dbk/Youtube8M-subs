there<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> getting<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.800> wave<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
there this is getting into wave to

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.019 
there this is getting into wave to
grapple<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.080> then<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.680> Inferno<00:00:26.340> hoist

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
grapple and then we have Inferno hoist

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.200
