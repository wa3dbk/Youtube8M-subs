now<00:00:12.060> what<00:00:12.270> you're<00:00:12.420> looking<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.440> bottle

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
now what you're looking at is the bottle

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.830 
now what you're looking at is the bottle
number<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.520> Li<00:00:14.730> bear<00:00:14.970> train<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.690> those

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
number of this Li bear train and those

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.810 
number of this Li bear train and those
first<00:00:16.170> three<00:00:16.500> numbers<00:00:16.680> indicate<00:00:17.400> its<00:00:17.580> load

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
first three numbers indicate its load

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.859 
first three numbers indicate its load
capacity<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.779> basically<00:00:19.200> this<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.250> old<00:00:20.869> 330

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
capacity so basically this can old 330

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.550 
capacity so basically this can old 330

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
tons and Joe quite frankly how does it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800 
tons and Joe quite frankly how does it
do<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.770> without<00:00:26.460> tipping<00:00:26.910> over<00:00:27.150> tell<00:00:27.689> me

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
do that without tipping over tell me

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.120 
do that without tipping over tell me
about<00:00:27.900> some<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.169> the<00:00:28.290> counter<00:00:28.590> weights<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.040> the

we<00:00:55.469> won't<00:00:55.710> even<00:00:56.179> touch<00:00:57.179> that<00:00:57.210> capacity<00:00:58.079> on

for larger industrial pics and they

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.640 
for larger industrial pics and they
wouldn't<00:01:04.410> have<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.769> lover<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.970> would<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.120> a

wouldn't have the lover there would be a

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
wouldn't have the lover there would be a

fresh<00:01:40.590> off<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> lot<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.640> I'm<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.880> check<00:01:42.149> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
fresh off the lot so I'm gonna check it

fresh off the lot so I'm gonna check it
out<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.630> hopefully<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.409> disrupt<00:01:43.860> anything
