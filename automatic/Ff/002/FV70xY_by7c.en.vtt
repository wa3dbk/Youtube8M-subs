00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.160
 once there was a little girl by name 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.760
 Little Red Riding Hood 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.860
 one morning mom said take this 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.650
 basket to the sick grandmother but me 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.870
 I recommend not stopping in the woods like this 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.920
 do n't make bad encounters 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.840
 the child, however, approaches in the woods 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.460
 forgetting the recommendations of the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.309
 mom suddenly met a wolf that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.320
 the bovine told her everything and the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.620
 little girl answered I go to the sick grandmother 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.379
 the wolf to the words of the child yes 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.860
 he threw towards his grandmother's house where 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.370
 he entered pretending to be a Little Red Riding Hood 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.960
 red and when he saw the grandmother ate 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.109
 in one bite later also 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.050
 Little Red Riding Hood arriving at the house and the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.620
 wolf that was put in the bed of the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.560
 grandmother 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:11.100
 I also eat from the woods in the meantime 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 I get a hunter who had to say hello 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.950
 the grandmother but when the cottage arrived yes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 noticed that the door was open and entered 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.420
 he saw the big wolf with a swollen belly 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.420
 lying on her grandmother's bed 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.140
 the hunter approached the wolf 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 slowly and pointed the rifle did the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.159
 rifle firing a big bang then with 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.299
 a cutlass opened the belly to the wolf 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.140
 died from which came out little cap 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.570
 red 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.150
 and the grandmother 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.150
 so it was peace that tranquility 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:03.170
 they returned to the great little capuchin wood 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.530
 red greeted her grandmother and together with the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.970
 Mom walked over to her little house 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.720
 saying we always follow path without 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.900
 never stop so we won't be ugly 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.900
 meetings
