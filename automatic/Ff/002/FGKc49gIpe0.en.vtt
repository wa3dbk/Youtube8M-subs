00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.299
 we are at the doors of the ritz hotel where one of the 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.269
 interventions of the president of colombia Ã¡lvaro uribe in his visit to 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.269
 Madrid 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.760
 In his speech he spoke about the economic situation of the country and the 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.829
 achievements obtained in democratic security 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.900
 also highlighted social cohesion and trust as 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.429
 key tools to get out of the crisis 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.559
 we continue in what I have transmitted to you on previous occasions 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.840
 looking for confidence in colombia 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.120
 trust to live in Colombia to study in Colombia to invest in 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.070
 Colombia 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.570
 to start in Colombia 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.710
 trust so that the new generations live happy calm 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.810
 In colombia 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.390
 trust 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.870
 so that the international community 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 He feels fully like one in Colombia 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.710
 that trust we support in three elements 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.910
 security with democratic values 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.910
 the stimulus to investment with social responsibility 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.410
 and the search for social cohesion despite the crisis in Colombia continues the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.930
 investment 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.790
 and still in the event 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.420
 that we came to a situation where the flow of 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.380
 investment 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.630
 we want that asset that the investor confidence there is that 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 preserve it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
 because the moment the economy starts to rebound the investment will 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.400
 place where the conditions of trust are created 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.100
 in colombia we have faced 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 one of the richest terrorisms in the world 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.660
 based on drug trafficking 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.090
 that has lasted 60 years 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.300
 with a criminal and unequaled capacity 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.740
 and we have faced it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.040
 with civil law 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.370
 with ordinary legislation 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.470
 we have not appealed to extraordinary legislation 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.970
 that is known as the state of inner shock site and 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.769
 exterior Interior 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.429
 i much less 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.429
 we have appealed we would not do it and we will not 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.349
 to legislation what I went into suppressing liberties 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.639
 I would like to finish here 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.779
 inviting them to you has incorporate be colombia 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:31.659
 To have faith in Colombia we greatly appreciate this relationship 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.989
 with Spain 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.249
 Spain 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.689
 is the second investor in Colombia 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.119
