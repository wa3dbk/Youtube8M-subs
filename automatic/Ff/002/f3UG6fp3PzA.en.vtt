00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.180
 good your fears not yet video video the 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.700
 really quite ridiculous in certain 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.259
 I do not know what kind of peta it is 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.400
 an organization that is against the 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.349
 animal abuse and others 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 and good in that sense because there are 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.029
 applaud them does not do a great job and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 others but when it refers to what it is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.380
 the theme of video games does not really 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 they stop messing up and shitting 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.239
 recharge it like in games like super 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 Mario have been criticized for the suit 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.160
 tanooki well let's say a suit of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.199
 raccoon and so on you can also 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.239
 writing was also and above all 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.480
 because monkey because it was when I martyred 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.790
 ass in my life sometimes his methods are 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 a little disgusting, not because I made a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 kind of pretty pokemon parody 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 pretty stupid where the pokemon 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.680
 they were mistreated and so on and with another step 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 more then a pretty strong video is read 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.369
 Not suitable for all public is served 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 that a 13 or 14 year old boy of 13 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.680
 cats years down in the home just 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 traumatized but for all his fucking life 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.989
 surely so good the truth is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.890
 how good their methods are a bit 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.659
 out of the ordinary outside 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.030
 from outside of video games I loved 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.830
 play inside do not stop messing good 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.170
 let's see with the news seems to be 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 that espeta reaches minecraft according to the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.240
 good field do not want to tolerate any 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.479
 wrong 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.149
 animal not even in the digits in the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.520
 digital they repeat and in 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.890
 minecraft is not going to be less and it seems 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.330
 be that soon they will open a 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.329
 server is not that they achieve before a little 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.009
 is already open or how it goes but good in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.490
 that server will not be able to mistreat 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.590
 good animals mistreat mistreating is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.360
 that we think so asshole what 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.439
 I'm doing right now what is it 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.330
 I am saying right now of my 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.500
 words the words I'm sitting by 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.210
 the works of the sample stressing 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.470
 super rare minecraft and abuse 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.869
 animal is that I do not know how they can go 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.149
 together seriously, I think it's asshole 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.380
 and absurd but good today we go there as well 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.360
 that's good basically why there was not 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.399
 a server where you can make us 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.630
 nothing to the animals and everything else very much 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.789
 nice other I think with these 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.350
 Uncle shares is how it really is 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.399
 raise the world and we do everything is a 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.250
 world better with this kind of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.179
 bullshit is really like 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.009
 we waste time and do things 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.620
 good for humanity getting into 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.910
 minecraft and making you can not kill 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.520
 4 pixels 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.410
 is that he's stupid and asshole all 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.480
 this the truth each one is free of 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.350
 do what you want but really I 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.540
 I think this is good for 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.430
 absolutely nothing I think we can 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.180
 raise awareness of other people 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.160
 way 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.500
 I for example if I want to raise awareness 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.210
 someone about the traffic accident not 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 I think it's 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.580
 I do not say is that in this videogame of 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.800
 motorstorm you hit hosts and then 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.110
 when you spend that mini game that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.750
 created to parody the metro method 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.870
 images of dead people of children 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.430
 dead in cars so I have to 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.860
 say what kind of awareness of 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.260
 shit that I do not understand or be in my 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.760
 head what I do not achieve I do not achieve pearl or if 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.320
 you want to stop the program the rates 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.270
 otherwise not video games is that 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.150
 they do not make any sense if you're not going to 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.370
 do nothing anything hurt someone something 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.140
 that is not still existing 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.400
 directly that seems absurd to me is 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.600
 that has not yet seen any person 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.850
 that mine plays is that it goes killing 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.370
 pigs down the street or chicken or anything 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.650
 like that because if you show up it seems 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.290
 this a little silly I do not know the same I am 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.019
 just like that but good I do not know I do not know 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.849
 I think that I am the odd one is already 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.620
 directly so good nothing else 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.400
 We're not going to the next kids 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.400
 next work
