00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
in this video I'm gonna show you how to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.230 
in this video I'm gonna show you how to
make<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:02.970> origami<00:00:03.330> Thanksgiving<00:00:04.110> turkey

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
make the origami Thanksgiving turkey

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.400 
make the origami Thanksgiving turkey
okay<00:00:06.240> so<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.509> start<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:06.870> your<00:00:06.960> scrap<00:00:07.259> piece

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
okay so you start with your scrap piece

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.700 
okay so you start with your scrap piece
of<00:00:07.440> paper<00:00:08.030> and<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.179> fold<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.570> half<00:00:09.780> diagonally

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
of paper and you fold in half diagonally

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.620 
of paper and you fold in half diagonally
and<00:00:11.309> open<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.790> again<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.710> then<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.830> fold<00:00:14.630> two

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and open it again and then you fold two

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:34.830 
and open it again and then you fold two
outside<00:00:16.230> points<00:00:18.199> into<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> center<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:20.039> this

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.050 

now<00:00:35.440> you<00:00:35.500> want<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:35.830> do<00:00:36.040> is<00:00:36.550> you<00:00:36.700> want<00:00:36.850> to<00:00:36.940> take

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
now you want to do is you want to take

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.150 
now you want to do is you want to take
the<00:00:37.150> top<00:00:37.360> point<00:00:38.310> and<00:00:39.310> fold<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.730> down<00:00:40.650> on<00:00:41.650> this

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
the top point and fold it down on this

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.490 
the top point and fold it down on this
line<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:45.970> it<00:00:46.120> lies<00:00:46.330> hidden<00:00:46.720> inside<00:00:49.500> these

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
line just so it lies hidden inside these

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.670 
line just so it lies hidden inside these
two<00:00:50.740> flaps<00:00:51.010> here<00:00:52.290> like<00:00:53.290> that<00:00:55.470> now<00:00:56.470> what<00:00:56.590> you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
two flaps here like that now what you

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.630 
two flaps here like that now what you
want<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:56.890> do<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.130> you<00:00:57.190> want<00:00:57.310> to<00:00:57.340> make<00:00:57.460> some

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
want to do is you want to make some

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.170 
want to do is you want to make some
squash<00:00:57.940> folds<00:00:58.330> and<00:00:58.990> to<00:00:59.140> do<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.030> two

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
squash folds and to do that take the two

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.740 
squash folds and to do that take the two
top<00:01:01.210> points<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.830> one<00:01:03.010> by<00:01:03.160> one<00:01:04.140> fold<00:01:05.140> them<00:01:05.290> down

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
top points and one by one fold them down

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.620 
top points and one by one fold them down
into<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.840> center

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.140 

like<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:16.750> then<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.840> want<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.049> open<00:01:18.200> them<00:01:19.150> and

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
like that then you want to open them and

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.340 
like that then you want to open them and
what<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:20.360> want<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:20.570> do<00:01:22.090> is<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.270> want<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.659> take

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
what you want to do is you want to take

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.240 
what you want to do is you want to take
the<00:01:24.560> top<00:01:24.770> layer<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.500> on<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.740> creases<00:01:31.100> you've

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
the top layer and on the creases you've

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:43.070 
the top layer and on the creases you've
made<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.790> want<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.960> push<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.380> point<00:01:33.710> down

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.440 

you'll<00:01:43.920> make<00:01:44.870> point<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:47.460> sticks<00:01:47.640> vertically

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you'll make point that sticks vertically

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.590 
you'll make point that sticks vertically
downwards<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.700> I'll<00:01:50.790> take<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> step

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
downwards so I'll take it back a step

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
downwards so I'll take it back a step
from<00:01:52.080> this<00:01:53.600> taking<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.870> top<00:01:55.050> layer<00:01:56.090> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
from this taking up the top layer and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.930 
from this taking up the top layer and
pushing<00:01:57.480> it<00:01:57.570> down<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.820> do

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
pushing it down like that and then do

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.990 
pushing it down like that and then do
the<00:02:00.060> same<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.750> other<00:02:00.780> side<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.790> want

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the same on the other side so you want

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
the same on the other side so you want
to<00:02:03.120> do<00:02:03.270> exactly<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.020> same<00:02:04.080> thing<00:02:04.470> on<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
to do exactly the same thing on the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.240 
to do exactly the same thing on the
other<00:02:05.370> side<00:02:05.520> open<00:02:06.300> up<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.660> last<00:02:06.810> fold<00:02:07.250> take

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
other side open up the last fold take

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.180 
other side open up the last fold take
the<00:02:08.369> top<00:02:08.520> layer<00:02:09.530> squash<00:02:10.530> fold<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> down<00:02:11.160> like

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.860 

that<00:02:18.860> know<00:02:19.860> what<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.040> want<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.340> do<00:02:20.460> on<00:02:21.270> these

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that know what you want to do on these

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.780 
that know what you want to do on these
diagonal<00:02:22.440> lines<00:02:23.930> here<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.400> want<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.460> take<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
diagonal lines here you want to take the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.240 
diagonal lines here you want to take the
points<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.240> pointing<00:02:27.660> down<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.830> fold<00:02:29.100> them

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
points that pointing down and fold them

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.630 
points that pointing down and fold them
back<00:02:29.430> up<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.720> these<00:02:31.050> edges<00:02:31.470> these<00:02:32.130> inside

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
back up so that these edges these inside

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.520 
back up so that these edges these inside
edges<00:02:33.000> lie<00:02:33.270> along<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.170> diagonal<00:02:34.620> lines<00:02:36.530> like

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
edges lie along the diagonal lines like

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.930 
edges lie along the diagonal lines like
that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.580 

very<00:02:46.540> simple<00:02:48.270> now<00:02:49.270> what<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> want<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.930> is

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
very simple now what you want to do is

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.900 
very simple now what you want to do is
you<00:02:50.740> want<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.980> take<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:52.570> two<00:02:52.750> top<00:02:52.780> points<00:02:53.350> here

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
you want to take the two top points here

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.320 
you want to take the two top points here
and<00:02:55.170> there's<00:02:56.170> no<00:02:56.380> accuracy<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:58.120> just

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
and there's no accuracy to this but just

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.200 
and there's no accuracy to this but just
fold<00:02:58.600> them<00:02:58.780> down<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.440> they<00:03:02.590> project<00:03:03.210> over

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
fold them down so that they project over

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.200 
fold them down so that they project over
the<00:03:04.270> bottom<00:03:04.660> by<00:03:04.900> about<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.320> centimeter<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:10.120> to

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
the bottom by about a centimeter just to

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.210 
the bottom by about a centimeter just to
make<00:03:10.360> sure<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.750> they're<00:03:10.900> even<00:03:11.020> on<00:03:11.440> both

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
make sure that they're even on both

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.640 
make sure that they're even on both
sides<00:03:14.460> like<00:03:15.460> that<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:17.110> now<00:03:17.230> what<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.440> want<00:03:17.590> to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
sides like that and now what you want to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.680 
sides like that and now what you want to
do<00:03:17.740> is<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:17.950> want<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.100> whole<00:03:18.250> fold<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:19.510> whole

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
do is you want to whole fold the whole

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.670 
do is you want to whole fold the whole
thing<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:20.020> half<00:03:21.780> through<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> center<00:03:23.320> like

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
thing in half through the center like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.840 
thing in half through the center like
this<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:27.010> then<00:03:27.130> once<00:03:27.280> you've<00:03:27.400> done<00:03:27.520> that<00:03:27.580> you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
this and then once you've done that you

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.460 
this and then once you've done that you
can<00:03:28.030> check<00:03:28.210> to<00:03:28.270> see<00:03:28.450> if<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.780> feet<00:03:28.990> are<00:03:29.140> even

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
can check to see if the feet are even

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.040 
can check to see if the feet are even
and<00:03:29.830> if<00:03:30.820> they're<00:03:31.000> not<00:03:31.030> make<00:03:31.450> them<00:03:31.660> like<00:03:31.870> that
