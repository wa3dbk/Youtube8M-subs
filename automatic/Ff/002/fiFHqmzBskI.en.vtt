into<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> rocker<00:01:35.640> board<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.750> push<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.259> again

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
into a rocker board just push this again

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
into a rocker board just push this again
straight<00:01:38.250> onto<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.610> white<00:01:38.759> knob<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.150> the

straight onto the white knob in the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.270 
straight onto the white knob in the
middle<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:40.079> becomes<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.530> rocker<00:01:40.740> board<00:01:41.040> then

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
middle it becomes a rocker board then

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.830 
middle it becomes a rocker board then
and<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> limit<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> range

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and it's just going to limit the range

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.719 
and it's just going to limit the range
of<00:01:43.049> movement<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.680> rather<00:01:43.920> than<00:01:44.130> having<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.460> full

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.600 
of movement so rather than having a full
360<00:01:45.450> degrees<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.680> left<00:01:47.220> or<00:01:47.460> right

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
360 degrees it will have left or right

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.160 
360 degrees it will have left or right
forwards<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.270> backwards<00:01:48.479> depending<00:01:48.810> upon
