you have the right position so pulling

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.919 
you have the right position so pulling
it<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.469> little<00:01:28.679> bit<00:01:28.859> like<00:01:29.039> this<00:01:29.659> allows<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
it out a little bit like this allows you

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.859 
it out a little bit like this allows you
to<00:01:31.670> apparently<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.700> pull<00:01:32.850> out<00:01:32.880> too<00:01:33.119> far<00:01:33.389> change

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
to apparently i pull out too far change

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.639 
to apparently i pull out too far change
the<00:01:34.109> date<00:01:34.289> again<00:01:35.100> i'm<00:01:35.369> winding<00:01:35.639> it<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
the date again i'm winding it now and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.480 
the date again i'm winding it now and
then<00:01:37.649> when<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.799> pull<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.310> way

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
then when you pull it out of the way

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
then when you pull it out of the way
you're<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.539> be<00:01:39.689> changing<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.069> time<00:01:42.020> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you're going to be changing the time it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.449 
you're going to be changing the time it
works<00:01:43.170> pretty<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.859> takes<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.159> little<00:01:44.310> bit

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
works pretty well it takes a little bit

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.069 
works pretty well it takes a little bit
getting<00:01:45.209> used<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.569> cos<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.749> have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.929> know

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
getting used to cos you have to know

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.019 
getting used to cos you have to know
precisely<00:01:46.740> how<00:01:47.069> far<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> pulled<00:01:47.639> out<00:01:47.789> but<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:48.029 
precisely how far to pulled out but it

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:50.629 
precisely how far to pulled out but it
it<00:01:48.209> snaps<00:01:48.749> in<00:01:48.959> there<00:01:49.109> securely<00:01:49.529> and<00:01:49.889> when<00:01:50.490> it's

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:50.639 
it snaps in there securely and when it's

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.370 
it snaps in there securely and when it's
in<00:01:50.789> you<00:01:50.909> can't<00:01:51.149> turn<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:51.479> crown<00:01:51.719> so<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.170> it

bad at all that's pretty good for a
watch<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.740> means<00:02:04.889> you<00:02:05.009> could<00:02:05.159> go

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
watch like this that means you could go

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.150 
watch like this that means you could go
diving<00:02:06.029> in<00:02:06.419> it<00:02:06.779> but<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.049> probably<00:02:07.380> want<00:02:07.950> for

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
diving in it but you probably want for

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.880 
diving in it but you probably want for
two<00:02:08.340> reasons<00:02:08.580> while<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.720> booster<00:02:10.380> does<00:02:10.619> have

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
two reasons while this booster does have

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.000 
two reasons while this booster does have
what<00:02:11.099> looks<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:12.170> rotating<00:02:13.170> divers<00:02:13.620> bezel

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
what looks to be a rotating divers bezel

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.740 
what looks to be a rotating divers bezel
it's<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> rotating<00:02:14.880> divers<00:02:15.209> bezel<00:02:15.540> because

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it's not a rotating divers bezel because

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.500 
it's not a rotating divers bezel because
it<00:02:15.900> doesn't<00:02:16.200> rotate<00:02:16.520> if<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.640> does<00:02:17.819> rotate<00:02:18.090> I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
it doesn't rotate if it does rotate I

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.009 
it doesn't rotate if it does rotate I
haven't<00:02:19.110> turned<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.470> nearly<00:02:19.680> hard<00:02:19.980> enough

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
haven't turned it nearly hard enough

haven't turned it nearly hard enough
also<00:02:22.019> luminant<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.799> an<00:02:22.920> issue

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
also luminant is an issue

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.320 
also luminant is an issue
one<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> sacrifices<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.300> a

it's actually a very interesting trend
I've<00:02:40.060> noticed<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.780> probably<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.200> third

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
I've noticed this is probably the third

basically only on the the bracelet
because<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.240> just<00:03:19.360> looks<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.930> lot<00:03:20.140> better<00:03:20.410> on

with<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.380> design<00:03:23.830> of<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.250> case<00:03:24.490> it's<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.390> a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
with a design of the case it's just a
