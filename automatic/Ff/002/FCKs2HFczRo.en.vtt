00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 at coffee fans since last time 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.799
 gone a long way 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.960
 Meanwhile, the cafés skills 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.219
 a little bit improved and I want that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.219
 but do it again today 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.960
 The first is Rihanna has is we had 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.960
 Before getting these big bags here 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.640
 used to notice that it is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.910
 just needs too much milk foam 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.189
 and the coffee will be too milky if 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.489
 you try these giant cups here 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.040
 to fill with cappuccino 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.840
 works but the taste is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.840
 the small cashier much better 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.170
 which I also passed on 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.280
 Just bring the coffee cup with you before 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.219
 hot water to preserve before and with 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 cooked hot water that makes that 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.230
 button just clear hotter and the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.230
 coffee cold just stay hot for much longer 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.950
 by now we have beans 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.920
 only beans from the coffee roasting 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.740
 we had in the meantime sometimes 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 However, ready-made living tastes the chandler 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.479
 later on the coffee is 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 maybe is so great while 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.030
 freshly roasted beans cream 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 certainly one and a half centimeters thick 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:40.470
 still calm in with a sieve 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:45.630
 leading double schott and doing that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.770
 in dietach try the coffee here 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.770
 to push bit before 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.000
 tempo 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.209
 play out 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.349
 yes that is better relation works 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.480
 meanwhile also much better so 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:59.480
 you know how to paint the beans 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.170
 and yes it will be easy 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.849
 it just improved everything 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.519
 We had it with the milk for a long time 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.670
 with a durable half-field with tried 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.290
 now we have performs here milk me 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.689
 the coffee tastes much better 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.970
 by 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:23.030
 it's just a lot creamier than with 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.810
 Half time milk already what am I doing 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.379
 I'm a bit sad at the machine 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:40.060
 It's just that it takes so long 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:40.060
 the steam here comes my mister klocke 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.430
 but for so long until you barely 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.430
 holding in hand can not be too hot 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.069
 and most importantly the same 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:49.050
 cleaning the nozzle we were recently in the 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.530
 been a café and I have one there 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.270
 drunk cappuccino and the the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.560
 Chanteuse never got there 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.909
 finally cleaned a pretty good 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.300
 everyday story is me 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.189
 that is why the nozzle is not always cleaned 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.240
 Immediately and then is the 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:11.159
 Cleaning here not so high 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.759
 Here we have our nespresso right 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:18.780
 beautiful chandler on the milk shocked 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.550
 We do not want to be very nice now 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.940
 see that it is also smooth number 1 here 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.940
 to water 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.840
 yes I've read somewhere needs 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.640
 somehow the first 1000 espresso or 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.830
 1000 cappuccino with the whole 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.600
 latte art works for me it goes there 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.560
 similar 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.900
 i would say i am meanwhile 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.040
 perhaps remain so 600 and cappuccino 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.840
 yes depending on 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.530
 sometimes it gets better and sometimes 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.620
 it's a little worse that's it 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.850
 nothing again 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.180
 but I think the card still good 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.180
 notice 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:14.640
 the choir was nice hot creamy yummy yes 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.490
 What can I say it is getting better 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.050
 and I think I will soon 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.050
 back from boston to the job
