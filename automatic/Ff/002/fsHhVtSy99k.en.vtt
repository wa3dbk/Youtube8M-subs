00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.430
 great pleasure to see that his work 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.989
 is rewarded here we are guys do not 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.520
 features south for the first spot when 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.720
 you sentinel spawn you will you 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.949
 place the molding responsible place the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.199
 sentinel body or spawn you go 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.120
 you place our little corner there just 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.680
 before the boumba alley and you 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.269
 have the cursor up and down 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.980
 your weapon so align with the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.620
 small recess on the left and the block of 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.030
 stone that justin to the standards and you 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.190
 go see that the gonÃ¢ve has directly 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.440
 integrated on the top sniper it just in 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.330
 face so on the top scared atlas style 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.400
 very practical this spot since enormously 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.870
 people come here to get 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.720
 places right from the start the round is this 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.770
 not kill you on the top sniper 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.060
 sentinel so here are beautiful spots 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.610
 very practical offers us immediately 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.930
 to the second spot who cares at the same 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.270
 place so there you will place yourself 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.040
 in the same place as first except small 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.600
 difference that vote this time it's not 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.640
 your cursor from the bottom and the top that you 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.260
 have to put but your cursor 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.810
 of left that you go up and with 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.520
 the little boat you control al din 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.960
 and the chp stone block has if you see 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.700
 very well in any case there is a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.590
 delimitation between the bar and the block 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.410
 of stone and you will see that this 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.700
 grenade bateg a beautiful place on 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.330
 way of these grenades and frankly 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.830
 whew 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 here look at me and I leave you 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.810
 to discover is really the most beautiful 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.620
 sport grenade I find on call of duty 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.630
 adventure fort it's really something 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.110
 sublime thing to look at I run the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.420
 grenade 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.730
 she goes through the window and there she 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.739
 arrives directly below the top 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.929
 sniper atlas frankly I judged good 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.879
 frankly who made this spot it was 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 frankly beautiful when I have them 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.080
 seen online so here we are gone 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.989
 all for the 3rd spawn so this time 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.080
 this is for the one to kill the 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.519
 snipers who put themselves on the spot 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.650
 sentinels the sentinel sniper spo 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.840
 but the one on the left when you spawn 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.870
 sentinel is so there you will place 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.050
 your body your bottom slider between 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.470
 the 4th and the 5th batch 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.610
 in play the square but diamond and you 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.100
 have actually placed your cursor at 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.950
 middle of those two but upstairs it's 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.440
 to say not glued stuck to the beard 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.430
 blue and you'll see that there the spot 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.170
 I pass it twice but 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.670
 normally you reassure yourself the spots 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.380
 passing twice went so far 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.450
 I had a little ally opposite 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.550
 did a little flow so that's it 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.350
 necessarily sharp jumps in the air as he 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.050
 the fact the nymphomaniac goes less well 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.700
 so that's sorry for that but go 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.000
 complain to zeus 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.290
 he is at fault for gaza fourth canvas 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.420
 spot known right away party so 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.190
 that's what it's used for it is going to serve kills one 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.150
 there to kill the enemies who defuses 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.220
 opposes the bomb 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.870
 oh no I'm sorry I have no spots 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.040
 to kill all the enemies posing or 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.080
 defuse the bomb and I do not have 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.490
 necessarily found nook there you go 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.260
 place your cursor a little bit of this 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.090
 way there it's a bit random you 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.440
 place your cursor so that 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.910
 you play the right cursor without going back 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.550
 the two little lines is aiming after that is 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.080
 completely random it's ya not 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.010
 really way to place it yourself 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.660
 see that it's directly 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.810
 land on the bomb at 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.970
 So, if I find a little spot 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.110
 on the bomb b between between each 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.950
 episode you loose maybe takes a 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.360
 episode bonus spot did not find a spot 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.130
 to add here is something like 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360
 that and I wanted to take is on youtube 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.800
 bad anyway the alpha recipes 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.880
