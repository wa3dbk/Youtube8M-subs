 in the one of revealing a lie 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.410
 he did not say what is this 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.220
 Mendia where everything is ready by 2007 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.470
 it protects the small wild collection from the red diver dt 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.819
 according to the own truth sojo tran deny 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.810
 for example 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.740
 one of the most widespread lies in this one broke down and fernando nobre 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.829
 escandón 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.730
 that supposes 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.730
 they are very big 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.870
 there are many ways to tell the story 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.130
 but today here in digital journalist we will talk about a way to tell the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.620
 friendly story while being sincere and that sincerity 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.970
 it means saying things that we might not like to hear 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.630
 This is the leitmotiv of the new work of Fernando de Orbaneja Spain 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.920
 history of a failure it and here digital company is a pleasure to be able 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.520
 chat a little while with don fernando welcome digital 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210
 many russians is money 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.820
 always to his thesis and interested in season and catriel this book that 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.640
 He has dedicated himself to the suffering Spanish people 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.450
 so badly has history treated us 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.120
 by people 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.740
 bruce springsteen he remembered a famous comes a great 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.790
 the percentage rises until February 13 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.110
 stated 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.360
 The history of Spain very sad 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.680
 because it always ends badly 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.110
 bankpime really that's what happened to us 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.550
 kirchner the fundamental thesis of the book 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.550
 is who unfortunately we have never had 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.880
 I believe that we have never feared politicians authentically 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.790
 patriots even in Spain 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 that is to say 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.390
 by the way is the powerful processor bourbon carlos 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.820
 but without doubt that for him first of all the dynasty 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 after that came the region 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.170
 and thirdly, although others did not appear above all 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:09.999
 that the custodian 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.079
 I was Spain 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.290
 this country has been treated as if it were the private property of the ATP of the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.139
 people who governed 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.139
 despite the importance of a country 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.489
 it is not about 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.099
 but I have to tell you enough and those nonsense no no you do not have to work for the country 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.859
 why 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.199
 by cedice 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:37.479
 get each of the Spaniards each of the citizens live better 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.919
 come in three fundamental senses respect not same 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.339
 in that intellectual sense 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.729
 and the moral sense the sense of ethics 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.899
 and that will make us be careful never 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.339
 asked for an android ballast 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.909
 today that is taken care of and the politicians say poland and spain 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.789
 so that we are all the same and good from don pedro laborde auster 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.019
 a horror 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.500
 problems I think at the same time of Spain to redouble the density 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.599
 and the tarnol chair is taking care is not there we are not waiting for 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.689
 europe the gate of the senan 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.319
 and talks about uncovering a lie 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.919
 he did not say what is this town where we can be installed is serious 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.429
 it protects the small wild collection from the red gustavo dt 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.499
 according to the other and all that trans denies 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.489
 for example 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.659
 one of the most widespread lies is that he knows that the kings are giving 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.429
 Catholics put oviedo Spain 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.110
 that is a lie 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.629
 but very serious 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.949
 were not the unity of Spain were religious ideas of Spain 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.499
 proof of this is that between this between Castile and Aragon 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.759
 allied band 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.809
 had not been given to anyone 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:01.229
 and had to pay 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.919
 or for the last pava prescription products probability to pay 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:06.539

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.459
 fignon back 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.459
 We are the only country in the world in Luján 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.269
 that did not help should discuss 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.120
 but imagine that when 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.840
 he got up 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.470
 one faction against another chávez 4 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.529
 To top it all, the same flag as those that go to favor ceiling 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.409

 the standard bearer of morals of the republic 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.220
 if we want a petition of flags of Spain we say that we do not have a month 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.319
 the same 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.490
 let's sing all 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.800
 while the margin of what would have been 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.550
 the 23f 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.590

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.439
 National anthem 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.830
 because it will be affected prize that is granted emergency loans 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.319

 an unknown deficit here we are 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.240
 For example, totana was recently celebrated on 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.400
 the fifth anniversary of March 11, 2004
