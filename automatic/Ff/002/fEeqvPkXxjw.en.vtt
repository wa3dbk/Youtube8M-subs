00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.600
 and on the air slayer today I will talk about 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.820
 how to translate you eat this t-62a 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.240
 tank legendary soviet art 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.949
 thunderstorm random and Serb darling could 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.730
 to shuffle modelers during processing 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.300
 such a tank in hd or could not become 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.519
 tank is better armored or not answers in 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.790
 this video 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.850
 booking at 099 nld 100 millimeters 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.560
 armor tilted to 55 degrees 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.290
 174 millimeters 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.100
 slope increased by one degree but to 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.880
 gain nld 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.060
 this did not result in ld 100 millimeters 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.300
 armor with a slope of 60 degrees is given to 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.700
 200 millimeters but wld cut 2 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.980
 one millimeter of armor and one degree 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.080
 lowered the slope as a result it led to 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.070
 loosen vld by 10 millimeters 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.710
 reduced armor 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.830
 that is, vlt is now making its way a bit 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.830
 easier 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.320
 mask gun is a screen 214 millimeters 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.980
 tilt 0 in the central part and to 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.600
 seventy-three degrees at the top 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.750
 behind the mask is a plot with zero 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.510
 armor and at the same time he became 99 more 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.409
 however, it did not weaken this. 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.350
 site reservation 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.110
 the mask is still excellent 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.600
 strikes in the tower 240 millimeters of armor 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.880
 steel behaved to differ 240 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 two hundred millimeters next to the mask 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.800
 fifty five millimeters on cheeks 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.620
 overlord alba by tilting 7375 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.200
 degrees gives reduced armor 730 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.030
 millimeters and more exactly this part 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.280
 towers led to the appearance of less a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.280
 impenetrability of the tower t-62a 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.660
 commander turret 214 millimeters 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.580
 armor form changed and this led to 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.730
 the appearance of several sections of armor as 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.200
 with more armor so with less tilt 42 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.410
 degrees here given to here from 8 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.380
 millimeters there are 288 millimeters plots 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.240
 armor and there is a thin strip where 214 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.020
 millimeters of armor without slope is the most 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.020
 top cum towers 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.000
 board tower 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.650
 front half of 240 millimeters and 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.290
 214 millimeter and 240 millimeters 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.080
 much more than 214 aft 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.150
 here are two plots 161 millimeters and below 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.680
 and one hundred fifty three millimeters from the top 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.930
 here unchanged feed tower top 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.260
 part of 55 millimeters of reduced armor 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.020
 from 69 millimeters and lower 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.140
 65 millimeters of armor with reduced kai from 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.420
 65 millimeters here have loosened the top 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.390
 part since the earlier section with armor 55 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.670
 there were no millimeters at all 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.010
 abutment hull side 60 millimeters 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.510
 the main part is 80 millimeters with zero 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.340
 slope 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.470
 the main part of the board increased by 5 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.900
 millimeters while cast to rose 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.230
 to the same 80 millimeters since the slope 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.660
 no stern hull booking 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.150
 changed 45 millimeters with a minimum 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.160
 on the lump of the patch's release several 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.560
 days I could from the merged deuce in 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.410
 usual randy car did not become weaker 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.690
 well, many players also did not become stronger 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.190
 feared for the turret armor change in 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.100
 bookings that might affect 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.370
 on the gameplay I did not find the t-62a 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.920
 still well tank the tower she 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.480
 vld a bit offended 10 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.730
 millimeters reduced to lightened 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.940
 penetration of the eighth level VFD machines 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.010
 even with a lightweight body dorothy let you down 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.380
 total quality of model transfer 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.360
 booking tank t-62 and wait version 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.330
 performed at a good level while 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.770
 the car has become much prettier on it 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.420
 all like subscribe to my 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.310
 channel link to it is in the description and 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.310
