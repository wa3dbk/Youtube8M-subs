00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.969
 finally, after a long time, always 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.959
 again congratulate home win 1 0 against 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.450
 Under the stroke , I believe one 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.770
 highly deserved victory i have too 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.420
 We saw it from the beginning 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.580
 put pressure on the opponent 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.439
 I 've already succeeded 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.420
 the first half we have good 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.330
 chances but unfortunately not the gate 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.369
 met and then socialist by that 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.100
 Tor and I believe was a work victory 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.580
 but there we have to tie up and me 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.440
 believe some character shown 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.559
 We always believed my fans 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.870
 often said if we continue to us 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.339
 work for faith and always everyone 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.780
 accept tackle and go on it if 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.690
 one that we want to ultimately blond 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.699
 today with 91 music and we were happy 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.830
 is it also next player next 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.940
 I think so of course you need in 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.900
 the situation, of course, too 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.780
 little luck and I believe that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.479
 once had by a at the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.400
 free kick where risking everything at what 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.540
 of course, ultimately, there was no free kick 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.820
 but I mean it will not work too 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.409
 Of course it was the one 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.700
 thousand percent chance to return in 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.580
 leadership is all about how it is 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.580
 Come and introduce us all like then 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 the game could be if you like that 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.630
 struck that we just at home 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.910
 but I arrive from the first minute 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.290
 seen that we are our own 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.570
 We tried football 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.280
 then play for a while 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.780
 unpacked are chased 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.490
 I look for advertising because attacked 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.870
 because then finally ours 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.860
 have had opportunities and I believe that 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.310
 most important was that you go to 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 single guide then easy too 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.130
 we did not continue 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.380
 have retreated but we continue 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.520
 had tried to act and I think 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.810
 that was the key to 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.580
 Success I believe if you do it again 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.260
 drop it until you all like it then 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.229
 also was the last weeks and months 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.550
 then man begs in the gate and that 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.690
 not done but made ever 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.840
 and I think 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.160
 What that can do even after the week 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.540
 Just to say that you can be proud 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.680
 can be anywhere on the team of me 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.450
 Much has pattered on us 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.250
 I've always said 30 points 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.390
 keep calm but is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.130
 naturally clear how at home so 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.710
 play many as many games loses 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.170
 then the mood tilts and that is 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.640
 tilted and then you have to say at 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.050
 so many failures we do that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.400
 nevertheless made the troops he already 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.990
 some of the games are not so 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.120
 long as i like theirs like slave or how 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.520
 heiko butscher are some of the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 not yet have as many profiles as 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.050
 You have to have done that then 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.730
 say it strong so i think so we do 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.540
 have pressed and went all in 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.920
 the scale thrown what we had 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.810
 If I see the game I have to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.300
 already ask why you probably why 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.350
 not fully in the previous play set 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.150
 people have been able to do that 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.910
 have just retrieved from the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.460
 Use of the unconditional sake 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.810
 seen everyone in the team wanted 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.790
 the three points with everyone is involved 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.830
 a knife kept here and me 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.330
 thinking we are just at the end 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.590
 times for rewarding wise said the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.820
 mood is tilted in the stadium one has 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.380
 it not noticed today that I 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.540
 Believe support from fans even if 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.640
 It was only 10,000 today that was sensational 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.170
 yes that in any case I think that was 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.170
 our last chance today 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.020
 There was a clear statement often from the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.180
 fans do not care if we all have that 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.810
 somewhere the one more the other 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.849
 less taken with the game and that 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.500
 I mean yes , if yes then sometimes 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.420
 so an announcement comes from the fans then 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.900
 as I said some are not so 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.930
 long time 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.510
 then shrug perhaps ever 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.590
 together 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.530
 but you take that in general 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.610
 No matter how many professional years you have 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.050
 As I said, you have to rest 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.470
 will keep it cool today 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.030
 head with with good aggressiveness and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.400
 mastered healthier and aggressiveness 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.989
 I think that's what our fans have 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.569
 rewarded so what you want then from the 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.069
 Dirty 1 0 victory in the situation that 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.840
 it's great 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.250
 I personally would have my team 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.830
 fans can also understand that in 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.900
 the national sport and today stands the 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.610
 Fans are also very keen that we have the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.130
 Keep it great and that's why it is 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.959
 perfectly understandable that they too 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.060
 and to worry about and also about them 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.530
 I'm sure I'm doing very well 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.599
 still very high that she despite 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.130
 All this today further encouraged us 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.870
 have and have given gas and put 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.150
 we still do it the same way 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.160
 We also can sit down 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.500
 until now a bit more relaxed 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.560
 just not relaxed so if now 33 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.660
 points, it is still nothing so with 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.330
 the three points rule one is completely 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.650
 quickly back down in therefore good 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.800
 advise the time now one day to 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.250
 but then enjoy from next week 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840
 to work and continue to work just as well 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.180
 then i am i going to play the same way 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.420
 as it did today what I continue to do 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.300
 work 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:49.550
 We are happy about the victory but it 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.510
 go ahead and we still have to 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.700
 Continue to gas 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.110
 actually lost game and then the 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.920
 others with the trailing will be back 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.960
 could agree 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.760
 we are aware of that and we have to 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.480
 from matchday to matchday as many points 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.480
 collect as possible
