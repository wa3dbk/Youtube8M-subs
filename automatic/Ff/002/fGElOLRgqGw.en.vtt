00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.530 
don't need to do that just yet just head
up<00:01:17.450> along<00:01:18.350> these<00:01:18.530> rocks

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.450 

and<00:01:23.870> there's<00:01:24.440> going<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.650> be<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.770> golem<00:01:25.190> all<00:01:25.370> the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
and there's going to be a golem all the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.670 
and there's going to be a golem all the
way<00:01:25.550> up<00:01:25.700> here<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.780> can<00:01:26.930> open<00:01:27.200> them<00:01:27.290> up<00:01:27.410> with<00:01:27.650> a

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
way up here you can open them up with a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.730 
way up here you can open them up with a
nice<00:01:27.890> missile<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:28.990> then<00:01:29.990> hop<00:01:30.260> in<00:01:30.530> and

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
nice missile and then hop in and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:56.190 
nice missile and then hop in and
activate<00:01:31.010> him

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.239 

okay<00:01:57.200> once<00:01:57.439> he<00:01:57.590> freezes<00:01:57.890> those<00:01:58.509> waterfalls

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
okay once he freezes those waterfalls

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.630 
okay once he freezes those waterfalls
you<00:02:01.249> just<00:02:01.429> jump<00:02:01.850> over<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.179> lowest<00:02:02.600> one<00:02:03.640> which

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
you just jump over the lowest one which

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.730 
you just jump over the lowest one which
can<00:02:04.850> be<00:02:05.000> hard<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> land<00:02:05.509> on<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.109> if<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.530> fall

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
can be hard to land on so if you fall

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.440 
can be hard to land on so if you fall
off<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.399> just<00:02:07.460> got<00:02:07.609> knocked<00:02:07.939> off<00:02:08.179> right

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
off like I just got knocked off right

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.449 
off like I just got knocked off right
there<00:02:08.720> there<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.830> an<00:02:10.009> easier<00:02:10.429> way<00:02:10.610> up<00:02:15.459> but

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
there there is an easier way up but

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.039 
there there is an easier way up but
first<00:02:16.790> take<00:02:17.060> out<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.330> guy<00:02:17.450> who<00:02:17.510> knocks<00:02:17.870> you

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
first take out the guy who knocks you

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:32.110 
first take out the guy who knocks you
down

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.900 

ok<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.420> easier<00:02:33.780> way<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:35.460> go<00:02:35.640> up<00:02:35.760> like

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
ok so the easier way is you go up like

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.180 
ok so the easier way is you go up like
you're<00:02:36.090> going<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> middle<00:02:36.720> thing<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.950> this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
you're going to the middle thing so this

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280 
you're going to the middle thing so this
first<00:02:38.340> rock<00:02:38.670> platform<00:02:39.300> then<00:02:39.840> turn<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.200> your

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
first rock platform then turn to your

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.860 
first rock platform then turn to your
right<00:02:40.440> there's<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> rock<00:02:41.610> platform<00:02:42.270> behind<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
right there's a rock platform behind the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.940 
right there's a rock platform behind the
waterfalls<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.590> go<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.770> that

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
waterfalls so you can just go up that

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.280 
waterfalls so you can just go up that
way<00:02:47.010> which<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.520> much<00:02:47.850> easier<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:51.140> then<00:02:52.140> just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
way which is much easier and then just

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.490 
way which is much easier and then just
head<00:02:52.440> through<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.740> door<00:02:52.920> here

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.370 

and<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.640> be<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.030> little<00:03:01.020> bit<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
and it's going to be a little bit of a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.810 
and it's going to be a little bit of a
complicated<00:03:02.060> morph<00:03:03.060> ball<00:03:03.990> tunnel<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.670> can

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
complicated morph ball tunnel you can

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.120 
complicated morph ball tunnel you can
blow<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.300> yellow<00:03:06.600> ice<00:03:06.870> crystals<00:03:07.500> with<00:03:07.830> a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
blow up the yellow ice crystals with a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.100 
blow up the yellow ice crystals with a
bomb<00:03:11.090> but<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.330> want<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.600> go<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.750> wear<00:03:12.990> these

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
bomb but you want to go to wear these

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.080 
bomb but you want to go to wear these
plant<00:03:13.530> things<00:03:13.800> are<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.850> go<00:03:15.030> across<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:17.090> then

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
plant things are and go across and then

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.160 
plant things are and go across and then
blow<00:03:18.390> up<00:03:18.600> these<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.920> crystals<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:21.050> will<00:03:22.050> open

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
blow up these I crystals that will open

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.520 
blow up these I crystals that will open
up<00:03:22.410> some<00:03:22.590> more<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.950> it

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.550 

and<00:03:30.530> you're<00:03:30.769> back<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.069> where<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.310> started<00:03:32.560> so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
and you're back to where you started so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.790 
and you're back to where you started so
you<00:03:33.650> don't<00:03:33.830> want<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.069> go<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.340> way<00:03:34.550> oh<00:03:35.800> yeah

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
you don't want to go that way oh yeah

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.089 
you don't want to go that way oh yeah
don't<00:03:37.730> want<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.060> go<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.300> way<00:03:40.420> all<00:03:41.420> right<00:03:42.099> now

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
don't want to go that way all right now

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.289 
don't want to go that way all right now
you<00:03:43.160> want<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.489> blow<00:03:43.640> up<00:03:43.700> these<00:03:43.879> crystals<00:03:47.799> and

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
you want to blow up these crystals and

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.509 
you want to blow up these crystals and
then<00:03:50.299> there's<00:03:50.629> this<00:03:50.930> thing<00:03:51.890> running<00:03:52.160> around

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
then there's this thing running around

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.020 
then there's this thing running around
so<00:03:53.349> plant<00:03:54.349> a<00:03:54.470> bomb<00:03:54.650> on<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:55.129> get<00:03:55.760> up<00:03:55.879> on<00:03:55.970> that

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
so plant a bomb on it get up on that

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.839 
so plant a bomb on it get up on that
hand<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.650> then<00:03:57.799> you<00:03:57.890> can<00:03:58.040> double<00:03:58.370> jump<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.790> a

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
hand and then you can double jump to a

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.930 
hand and then you can double jump to a
missile<00:03:59.150> expansion<00:04:00.640> got<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.730> be<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.819> little

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
missile expansion got to be a little

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.780 
missile expansion got to be a little
quick<00:04:02.209> about<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.510> but<00:04:02.900> it's<00:04:03.200> not<00:04:03.380> too<00:04:03.590> bad<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790
