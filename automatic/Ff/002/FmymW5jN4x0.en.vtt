 Well, if it's not worth it, it's what we do, it's pro for smart 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.630
 and that means we merge fashion with technology 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.759
 we do it with ideas and Spanish creativity 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.089
 percent with American technology and putting on henman devotion in the cinema 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.329
 with validity of california we do from bagged that you load the mobile with 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.640
 its tissue only accessible pagani mushrooms that the printed images on the tissue 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.559
 or tapatÃ­as that eta and have on the street as if they were a gps things very 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.010
 fun iii very innovative in this case the fashion industry 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.610
 in my particular case it was coincidence because I went to study a mba a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.710
 month in the course of senior management the wish is this way 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 and he liked the environment so much 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.239
 cusco discover that system is run to undertake 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.450
 I was seduced so much that I decided to stay 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.299
 to try a new business adventure I've been a year and a half 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.360
 installed in california 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.890
 the cir for obeyed an emperor should pass 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.490
 I highly recommend 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.390
 a lot of percent maybe not thinking about staying and tonality and 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 thinking a train that your business only makes sense 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.290
 in the silicon valley 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.840
 despite what testament environment 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.940
 etc so powerful and so prepared to undertake and with energy 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.230
 clear what and that's good to be there even to learn 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 look silicone valey try a new business adventure 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.820
 p 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.610
 with the motivation to learn 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.850
 I think it's a great recommendation that things can go well and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.619
 continue there continue to grow as a company 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.549
 and yes it is not sure that you will return with a baggage is extraordinary dd of everything 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.880
 what people learned 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.289
 that the best people and the best companies in the world have gone as far as 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.149
 to innovation in terms of technology 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.820
 and the energy 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.100
 I think that when they go like that with bale you turn conchita in the skin tea party 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.369
 then forever 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.919
 percent from another perspective much more optimistic and much more 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.919
 enterprising 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:29.549
 good in our case I think it's the human team percent we're 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.749
 exporting creativity of our country 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.839
 to the United States ii with which we live from the ideas that we have 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.869
 we invent new products 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.329
 for all kinds of companies, especially the fashion industry 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.749
 i in short what we sell is creativity innovation then 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:49.589
 inhumation 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.779
 is the creativity put business 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.839
 PS pro what the preparation we have is neither the patents nor immaterial and 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.320
 the fabrics ni 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.310
 and the sensors we make clothes 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.750
 if not the human team that we have 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.750
 I have brilliant ideas 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.549
 poor of that entrepreneur must be someone who disturbed someone has to 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.809
 really is preventing you from being satisfied with the environment and want to improve something 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:23.489
 by the way which is innovative sae innovation I understand that 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.360
 this conviction that all of that 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.119
 the best added the coach has to innovate 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.059
 therefore it has to be a restless person 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.389
 i Wolf has to be brave he also has to believe in his ideals by 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:36.949
 hundred 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.589
 and undertake 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:43.389
 percent the work of the entrepreneur that already bar by turning an idea into a 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.200
 business a dream in a business 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.389
 and to do that you will have to overcome a lot of obstacles 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.259
 like stores that being brave after being optimistic has an entrepreneur has 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:58.889
 who tries to write quality and feel passion for his project because if 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.009
 no no you will not have enough energy to overcome 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.689
 p this these obstacles that you have in the day to day 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.469
 and hamas has to apply a lot of tenacity because not all of the 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:16.009
 first p it is very possible that the pole was ruined denied that it does not go well 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.609
 first attempt to create new generate business and your company but in 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.430
 base to try it on the shore and to be almost like a table football in your ideals 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.360
 then it will come acom pour 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.360
 this dream in reality 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.699
 little man luca would encourage these entrepreneurs oo entrepreneurs in 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.139
 power to be thrown into the pool 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.330
 that they really try 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.800
 e carry out your idea the idea is extraordinary people today I have had the occasion 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.080
 of knowing aa the person is very bright very talented very very 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.990
 good accent in what they do 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.210
 i surely what we lack in this country 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.210
 first we have to believe that we are good and then we have to really 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.500
 try 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.379
 try it according to this day 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.909
 the random pool 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.189
 make the decisions that we have to make to try 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.789
 start your project will stop fighting 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.890
 so that this process and become reality and if they also have a 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.140
 social component piquÃ© election is the case of many students 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.409
 I would say that 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.539
 and I always understand percent in the attitude of an entrepreneur as a 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.389
 attitude of wanting to change the 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.409
 percent and it seems an almost romantic attitude but it is what drives you to 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.389
 do something creative do something constructive there 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.370
 if they also turn on the social field afterwards and these much more 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.919
 of course which is to say hey 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.150
 Well really fight for wanting to change the world to the best does not bring your granite 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.810
 of sand and all new product service 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.430
 generate employment 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.879
 mcgee 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.710
 fight for your project i make the decisions tate the pool i 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.979
