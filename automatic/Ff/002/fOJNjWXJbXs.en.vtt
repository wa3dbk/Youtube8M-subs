00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
things into the game that we really

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
game I had a vision in my head of what

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.460 
game I had a vision in my head of what
it<00:01:52.600> would<00:01:52.690> be<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:54.160> went<00:01:55.030> back<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.479> in<00:01:56.260> my

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
it would be and I went back to in my

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.540 
it would be and I went back to in my
head<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.770> what<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:56.950> was<00:01:57.040> thinking<00:01:57.370> about<00:01:57.490> that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
head to what I was thinking about that

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.700 
head to what I was thinking about that
and<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.600> Empire<00:01:58.900> or<00:01:59.050> three<00:01:59.290> I<00:01:59.320> thought<00:01:59.530> well

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
and with Empire or three I thought well

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.770 
and with Empire or three I thought well
what<00:01:59.890> we<00:02:00.040> really<00:02:00.280> need<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.460> do<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.729> put<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
what we really need to do is put the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.350 
what we really need to do is put the
earth<00:02:01.960> back<00:02:01.990> in<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.590> Empire<00:02:02.890> Earth<00:02:03.360> we

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
earth back in the Empire Earth we

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.580 
earth back in the Empire Earth we
definitely<00:02:04.660> made<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.080> harder<00:02:05.320> for<00:02:05.350> ourselves

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
definitely made it harder for ourselves

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.160 
definitely made it harder for ourselves
by<00:02:06.160> having<00:02:06.640> many<00:02:07.119> epics<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.750> all<00:02:07.990> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
by having many epics and all the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.430 

I<00:04:14.700> think<00:04:15.700> empire<00:04:16.180> earth<00:04:16.330> fills<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.989> gap<00:04:17.230> in

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
I think empire earth fills the gap in

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.500 
I think empire earth fills the gap in
the<00:04:17.500> realtime<00:04:17.920> strategy<00:04:18.190> genre<00:04:18.640> that<00:04:19.030> no

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
the realtime strategy genre that no

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.200 
the realtime strategy genre that no
other<00:04:19.660> game<00:04:19.900> comes<00:04:20.200> close<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.670> it<00:04:21.670> really<00:04:22.060> is

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
other game comes close to it really is

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.930 
other game comes close to it really is
the<00:04:22.570> only<00:04:22.900> game<00:04:23.170> where<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.220> spend<00:04:24.610> all<00:04:24.880> of
