00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.130
 hello to all of you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.839
 captains now we find ourselves 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 today on screw set for a small 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.320
 presentation of a character a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 presentation of a pvp stuff in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.689
 the occurrence of which there is a stuff to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 intelligences 1 on a panda sees so 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.820
 in this case the web panda the west 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.410
 that I have already shown so this level of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.170
 stocks pv not too long ago when 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
 a video this time we will forgive 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.450
 be interested in pvp stuff so a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.570
 pvp disk so the stuff 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.739
 oo intelligence we will see everything from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 next in that it gives in term of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.500
 stuff so here's internally dofus 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.750
 usually it's duet created from 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.480
 turquoise in 6th road for the vita a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.340
 octopus and possibly 1 2 up 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.710
 oued that we can change if 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.620
 not necessarily need to steve yahoo 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.840
 pm in the fight possibly back 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.390
 rocket class that can also be removed 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.180
 to add a trophy what if we 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 falls against fire or cra 11 - 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.150
 xelor eventually finally brief you 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.240
 can modulate there is no problem in 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.570
 term of trophies there is what it takes 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.579
 so wait 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.990
 so the panoply is a panoply cries 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.350
 with chrome there is no problem 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.780
 thereupon 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.670
 a panoply so whole that cuts 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.399
 so this is the headdress the noë the amulet 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.140
 in terms of fmi destroyed this 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.209
 friendly they are looked fast done 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.130
 what it gives 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:37.369
 so these are ovaries 61 on the side of 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.170
 the ring amulet a ring screams at 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.789
 chrome exoplanets crowd 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.490
 characteristics 1 it's 40 of chances 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.030
 they enter intelligence an exo pm 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.349
 on a belt the tallinn one and one 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.509
 lethal panels ignore why one for 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.979
 come to complete for for the doubs 6 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.959
 as you have seen so 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.679
 small exo critical resistance here 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.819
 by then of the vita on the boots the state in 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:03.379
 so that's nice one at all 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:06.289
 if what I meant was I 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:08.060
 know shorter béchamel shovel for 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.009
 existence in this case so the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.239
 resistances fire the resistances to this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.290
 which means that we will immediately see 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 characteristics 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.560
 it gives us resistance to these 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.120
 friendly 1 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 when you 're not under 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.599
 the occurrence we had 17 neutral 13 ter 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.459
 of the thirteenth was very high and very severe 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.760
 so here's in dd armor for the 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.530
 power and resistances 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.260
 so what do we have other terms 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.090
 fm years is enough it's good fm on 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.410
 will say we'll see right away what 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.120
 it gives in terms of characteristics 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.989
 which is still shown at 400 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.239
 intelligence 400 luck and a lot of 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.459
 wisdom I find 1500 wisdom that we 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.190
 makes dodges of the pm skiffs which 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.140
 up all even at 50 and 70 that's what 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.390
 gets lost really very interesting for 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.730
 fighting against classes that make 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.400
 of the slowdown is due to retreat soul 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.730
 of the withdrawal pm pardon in terms of peace 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.920
 where we had 5 in 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.590
 we do not have his a5 but still 3 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.659
 invocations and an initiative that 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.220
 capped at 2700 there is still the 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.799
 opportunity to play with the trophies 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.209
 pro initiatives to take 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.190
 the initiative on his opponent 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.870
 48 that's it so we must have 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.650
 some tests in ram it seems to me no 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.580
 in short, I do not know what I 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.410
 wanted to look at others 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.940
 it seems to me that's pretty much everything 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.950
 we're going to throw a little putching ball and 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.470
 we will see what it gives so a 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.890
 vitality to 5000 years and it's not bad I 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.540
 find 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.560
 it's full vita we did not climb 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.910
 auxin at nothing rise in terms of 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.790
 intelligence and singing that's 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.410
 really only the full vita we 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.629
 this putsch we're going to put in psy was looking for 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.549
 still a pure for the little madness and 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.260
 we're going to see what it's all about 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.920
 gives a little a little class 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.530
 explosive 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.900
 so the panda does not have a boost 1 it's 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.370
 really the person who does not have much 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.190
 of mud are there will say anyway 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.480
 anger and at the castle eichmann for 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.459
 those who carried me last time 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.190
 short so there is still anger 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.060
 which is 200 power but otherwise there is 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.489
 not much other 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.530
 a flame that falls to 419 small 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.650
 waves to the soul to see what it gives and 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.049
 who will finish with a little flamiche 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.000
 so here's really sure of the 0% not 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.340
 guess waves to the soul that make 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.250
 practically 500 damage a little 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.580
 family luck and that's go here's a 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.169
 little family luck and got on nicely 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.970
 186 is pretty interesting we'll go 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.070
 angry 2 high tech ones that day 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.830
 schwahn and little flaming fists 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.110
 names that still make 300 to 380 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.990
 damages 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.450
 a small and islets that does roughly 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.530
 the same maybe a little less but but 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.160
 helpful to the gifts that there is the possible 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.110
 benefit of taking retirees out it's 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.690
 really interesting against eghezee 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.360
 for example a peace at all of 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.060
 not bad we'll say a trio you 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.470
 can type up we'll just see 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.139
 before this country so there really is the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.180
 possibility 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:03.020
 to hit far enough then against 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.389
 so wait not inflamed who is typing 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.529
 less well than there is at once so I 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.529
 thought it was the reverse so 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.310
 apparently no what can we 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.249
 do other 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.499
 a little bong that will pass us from one 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.539
 spent late because because we got it 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.219
 asked no he went to good it's 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.050
 always a little boomerang 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.090
 still goes to almost six 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.699
 years it's nice when you look after 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.520
 in half what did we watch 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.900
 what can we look at other 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.219
 can big thing now a 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.050
 little forehand - for fun that's it 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:39.379
 still 1,300 more damage he 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.819
 is not mounted I guess voila 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.469
 I would like the driver to type a 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.870
 little bit I would like to see the care 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.449
 carrots eventually I think the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.969
 chaffeur necessarily good go go not me 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.069
 typing it's okay I think we have to 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.949
 just about everything seen for this stuff really 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.539
 a chance and intelligence access stuff 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.639
 resistances against as little see 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.650
 not bad in terms of recency set in 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.719
 terms of resistance percentage in 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.230
 clear we were going we do not have the 5% of the 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:09.080
 of the apricot of India of the dragoturkey 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.190
 armor 51 resistance are criticizing one 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.740
 quite interesting too 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.060
 so it's really a stuff that 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.500
 I present to you because it is not 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.180
 street what is true we have 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.010
 trend to see street chic pandas 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.270
 the bear cub in this case it's not 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.850
 of the stryges so that's why 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.960
 I present it to you because it can that 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.240
 come out a little bit of the ordinary we're going 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:34.750
 to say that for nicely finish this 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:37.760
 putching ball up 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:41.080
 so it 's level 200 staff on it 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.810
 there is no problem and it's over 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.400
 so the cac 1 which must not type I 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.200
 think a way not if it's a case that 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.690
 pat chances but especially for 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.580
 resistors and not at all to type a 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.660
 coach to scrambled maybe the way to 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.190
 to type a little bit we will see what that 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.990
 given 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.990
 hop a little mastery 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.550
 that's the goal it's not about 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.069
 typing the maximum on this video it's 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:10.300
 for that I did not necessarily do 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:12.370
 2-2 vulnerable to the kind of shots 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.220
 that still hurt me a little bit 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.259
 index is supposed that's good will is 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.139
 even while it is still interesting 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:23.229
 to 4 p ah here it's always 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.370
 some nice damage we finish 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:27.819
 the most boring gaulle and I think we 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.259
 we're going to leave it on here so 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:32.909
 it was the presentation of one of the losses 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:35.409
 a best-of forgiveness of the pvp panda 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:37.569
 here is a beautiful ornaments in passing 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.849
 so it was captain now survival 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:41.080
 smith 1 do not hesitate to put one never 

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:43.000
 a comment if you could 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.620
 eventually you can subscribe 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.720
 to follow my videos more easily 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.860
 could come to me in play if 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.599
 you have some questions I 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.520
 answer there is no problem it was 

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:53.520
 capital to magna on the smiths has more
