00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.519
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.769
 Brian 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.719
 in this video you will know where it falls 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.999
 is a riding animal like reins 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.559
 raven lord 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.309
 this mode falls in our dungeon 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.590
 sitk ski 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.810
 hall and the probability of a drop that is 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.850
 the probability that this particular 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.770
 the moment the mount falls is only 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.450
 just simply one piece and sixty 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.760
 four hundredths percent that is 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.370
 probability but low very low 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.530
 so if he didn't fall from the first 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.289
 times then do not despair surely fall 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.510
 from 2 to 3 well and so on in general the essence of that 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.879
 that he will drop you just a question in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.589
 simple time when also do not forget 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.179
 to establish 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.769
 heroic level of difficulty for everyone 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.800
 case who do not know how to do it 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.989
 Now I will tell you this so we direct 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.879

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.010
 5 heroic players click on it and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.629
 everything is fine you will enter the heroic 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.489
 dungeon difficulty level 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.710
 also for those who do not know where 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.750
 is the entrance to the Sith cave 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.219
 halls at the moment you can see 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 a link to the video in which I am in detail 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:15.090
 telling where is the entrance to this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.740
 dungeons well then let's go here he
