the<00:01:06.570> pen<00:01:06.810> preventing<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> nib<00:01:08.040> drying<00:01:08.340> out

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the pen preventing the nib drying out

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
the pen preventing the nib drying out
when<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.390> use<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.950> twist<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> out

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
when it's not in use so twist it out

when it's not in use so twist it out
comes<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.760> nib<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.490> we

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
comes the nib there we go and there we

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.020 
comes the nib there we go and there we
go<00:01:14.670> again<00:01:14.790> here's<00:01:15.330> locked<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.259> forming

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
go again here's locked so that's forming

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.399 
go again here's locked so that's forming
as<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> lot<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.659> lime<00:01:18.810> use<00:01:18.960> top<00:01:19.140> range

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
as with the lot of lime use top range

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.990 
as with the lot of lime use top range
pens<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.790> nice

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
but you're probably wondering how do we

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.850 
but you're probably wondering how do we
get<00:01:35.009> ink<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.759> well<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:37.020> with<00:01:37.500> most<00:01:37.650> of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
get ink into it well as with most of

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.289 
get ink into it well as with most of
Lamy<00:01:38.009> pens<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.549> actually<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> cartridge

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
Lamy pens is actually a cartridge

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.840 
Lamy pens is actually a cartridge
converter<00:01:40.040> pen<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:42.509> undo<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:44.520> start

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
converter pen so to undo it you start

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.560 
converter pen so to undo it you start
unscrewing<00:01:45.810> mirja<00:01:46.619> clockwise<00:01:47.100> direction<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
unscrewing mirja clockwise direction the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
unscrewing mirja clockwise direction the
base<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> pen<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:51.049> what's<00:01:52.049> revealed<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
base of the pen and what's revealed is a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510 
base of the pen and what's revealed is a
converter<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.500> obviously<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.070> use<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
converter and obviously you can use a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.399 
converter and obviously you can use a
cartridge<00:01:57.030> ii<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> prefer<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.290> what

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
cartridge ii if you prefer to but what

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.630 
cartridge ii if you prefer to but what

we're going to show you this afternoon

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.760 
we're going to show you this afternoon
is<00:02:00.469> how<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.530> fill<00:02:02.399> using<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> converter

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
is how to fill using the converter

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.630 
is how to fill using the converter
obviously<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.070> drop<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.520> straight

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
obviously if you just drop it straight

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
obviously if you just drop it straight
in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> ink<00:02:06.360> you're<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:07.200> awful
