00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.029 

it's<00:00:26.590> gotta<00:00:26.980> be<00:00:27.250> in<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.369> rain<00:00:28.829> David<00:00:29.829> you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
it's gotta be in the rain David you

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.589 
it's gotta be in the rain David you
haven't<00:00:30.250> even<00:00:30.460> seen<00:00:30.730> what<00:00:31.000> I've<00:00:31.119> got<00:00:31.329> to<00:00:31.449> show

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
haven't even seen what I've got to show

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.329 
haven't even seen what I've got to show
you<00:00:31.630> yet<00:00:32.019> right<00:00:32.500> here<00:00:32.710> in<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.890> living<00:00:33.010> dirt

you yet right here in the living dirt
this<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.089> the<00:00:34.150> coolest<00:00:34.540> exhibit<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.110> whole

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
this is the coolest exhibit the whole

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.970 
this is the coolest exhibit the whole
science<00:00:35.829> I<00:00:35.949> know<00:00:36.309> absolutely

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
science I know absolutely

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.270 
science I know absolutely
let<00:00:38.980> me<00:00:39.070> show<00:00:39.250> you<00:00:39.309> this<00:00:40.059> thing<00:00:40.300> right<00:00:40.480> here

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
let me show you this thing right here

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.960 
let me show you this thing right here
this<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.989> green<00:00:50.290> basilisk<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:51.159> can<00:00:51.369> run<00:00:51.670> on

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
this is the green basilisk it can run on

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.359 
this is the green basilisk it can run on
the<00:00:52.150> water<00:00:52.689> believe<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.290> or<00:00:53.409> not<00:00:53.559> right<00:00:54.189> on<00:00:54.250> the

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
the water believe it or not right on the

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.030 
the water believe it or not right on the
water<00:00:54.640> they<00:00:54.970> can<00:00:55.180> run<00:00:55.390> on<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.659> lung<00:00:56.040> sounds

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
water they can run on the lung sounds

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.700 
water they can run on the lung sounds
like<00:00:57.159> Jesus<00:00:57.760> well<00:00:58.239> they<00:00:58.869> call<00:00:59.110> it<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> Jesus

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
like Jesus well they call it the Jesus

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.100 
like Jesus well they call it the Jesus
Christ<00:00:59.860> lizard<00:01:00.269> but<00:01:01.269> it's<00:01:01.420> actually<00:01:01.809> babies

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
Christ lizard but it's actually babies

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.679 
Christ lizard but it's actually babies
degree<00:01:02.439> fossils<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.759> I<00:01:03.909> know<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.269> guy's<00:01:04.479> not

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
degree fossils and I know this guy's not

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.060 
degree fossils and I know this guy's not
running<00:01:05.019> on<00:01:05.110> right<00:01:05.350> now<00:01:05.530> but<00:01:05.799> if<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:05.920> ever

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
running on right now but if you ever

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.480 
running on right now but if you ever
come<00:01:06.460> here<00:01:06.640> when<00:01:06.820> he<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.060> all<00:01:07.360> boy<00:01:10.259> well<00:01:11.490> let's

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
come here when he is all boy well let's

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:26.090 
come here when he is all boy well let's
go<00:01:12.700> try<00:01:19.590> absolutely<00:01:20.590> go<00:01:21.220> for<00:01:21.460> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:37.110 

why<00:01:27.100> must<00:01:27.370> that<00:01:27.490> be

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:48.990 

oh<00:01:46.710> no<00:01:47.710> way<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:47.920> was<00:01:48.220> -<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.460> was<00:01:48.730> just<00:01:48.910> so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
oh no way I was - I was just so

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.850 
oh no way I was - I was just so
interested<00:01:49.420> after<00:01:49.660> trying<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.200> do<00:01:50.350> last<00:01:50.530> night

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
interested after trying to do last night

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.760 
interested after trying to do last night
yes<00:01:51.390> well<00:01:52.390> stay<00:01:52.600> actually<00:01:52.870> what<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.020> found<00:01:53.320> was

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
yes well stay actually what I found was

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.560 
yes well stay actually what I found was
this<00:01:53.890> since<00:01:54.130> water<00:01:54.430> simply<00:01:54.880> stick<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.270> itself

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
this since water simply stick to itself

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.930 
this since water simply stick to itself
she<00:01:56.020> creates<00:01:56.260> a<00:01:56.350> layer<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.950> surface<00:01:56.980> and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
she creates a layer of a surface and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.390 
she creates a layer of a surface and
this<00:01:58.180> layers<00:01:58.650> phenomena<00:01:59.650> surface<00:02:00.010> tension

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
this layers phenomena surface tension

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.090 
this layers phenomena surface tension
and<00:02:01.030> surface<00:02:01.570> tension<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.410> measurement<00:02:02.800> of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
and surface tension is a measurement of

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.950 
and surface tension is a measurement of
the<00:02:03.250> cohesive<00:02:03.880> forces<00:02:04.180> present<00:02:04.810> any

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
the cohesive forces present any

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.710 
the cohesive forces present any
interface<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:09.580> each<00:02:09.790> other<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.360> because<00:02:10.600> of

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
interface to each other it's because of

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.190 
interface to each other it's because of
polarity<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:12.070> in<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.490> water<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.750> majority

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
polarity and in the water the majority

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.140 
polarity and in the water the majority
of<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.410> water<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:15.040> very<00:02:15.310> balanced<00:02:15.910> because

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
of the water is very balanced because

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.610 
of the water is very balanced because
the<00:02:16.240> molecules<00:02:16.720> are<00:02:16.810> trucks<00:02:17.080> are<00:02:17.260> at<00:02:17.500> each

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
the molecules are trucks are at each

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.440 
the molecules are trucks are at each
other<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.340> at<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.580> surface<00:02:18.850> it's<00:02:19.390> very

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
other but at the surface it's very

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.930 
other but at the surface it's very
unbalanced<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:20.770> okay<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.400> makes<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.760> much

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
unbalanced so okay that makes so much

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.009 
unbalanced so okay that makes so much
sense

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.899 

so<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.500> basilisk<00:02:25.980> arnis<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.670> surface

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
so the basilisk arnis is the surface

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.610 
so the basilisk arnis is the surface
tension<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.450> water<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.930> uses<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.349> round

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
tension of water and uses it to round

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.890 
tension of water and uses it to round
across<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.670> does<00:02:29.909> this<00:02:30.030> by<00:02:30.209> using<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.629> flaps

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
across it does this by using the flaps

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.680 
across it does this by using the flaps
of<00:02:31.110> skin<00:02:31.140> between<00:02:31.769> its<00:02:31.950> hind<00:02:32.159> toes<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:33.450> must

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
of skin between its hind toes it must

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.270 
of skin between its hind toes it must
increase<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.110> surface<00:02:34.409> area<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.890> lizard's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
increase the surface area the lizard's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.339 
increase the surface area the lizard's
able<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.610> run<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.150> keeping<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.080> constant

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
able to run on so keeping in constant

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.800 
able to run on so keeping in constant
momentum<00:02:37.709> allows<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.489> basilisk<00:02:38.909> to<00:02:39.360> run<00:02:39.569> on

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
momentum allows the basilisk to run on

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
momentum allows the basilisk to run on
the<00:02:39.959> water<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.040> possible<00:02:41.519> because<00:02:41.640> of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the water this is possible because of

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.550 
the water this is possible because of
the<00:02:41.940> air<00:02:42.090> pocket<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.870> created<00:02:43.319> from<00:02:43.410> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
the air pocket that is created from a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.710 
the air pocket that is created from a
speed<00:02:43.830> stopping<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> cohesive<00:02:44.819> surface<00:02:45.239> all

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
speed stopping the cohesive surface all

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.509 
speed stopping the cohesive surface all
of<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.170> must<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.560> what<00:02:46.799> prevents<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> lizard

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
of this must be what prevents the lizard

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.850 
of this must be what prevents the lizard
from<00:02:47.640> sinking<00:02:48.120> right<00:02:48.420> yeah

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.430 

so<00:02:52.860> why<00:02:53.190> can<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:53.640> into<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.450> yesterday

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
so why can we into it yesterday

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.920 
so why can we into it yesterday
well<00:02:55.880> since<00:02:56.880> our<00:02:57.000> feet<00:02:57.240> don't<00:02:57.510> spread<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.870> our

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
well since our feet don't spread on our

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.020 
well since our feet don't spread on our
mass<00:02:58.170> out<00:02:58.470> over<00:02:58.740> enough<00:02:58.950> surface<00:02:59.160> area<00:02:59.490> we

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
mass out over enough surface area we

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.240 
mass out over enough surface area we
can't<00:03:00.300> harness<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.810> cohesive<00:03:01.380> nature<00:03:01.500> wallet
