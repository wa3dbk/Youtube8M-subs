00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.170
 Hillert and welcome to grow another June this time I have 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.289
 the 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.570
 the family then suddenly ran 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 Caps the hysterical caps 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.539
 pa with 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.359
 you can guide her husband purposefully 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.749
 Record videos from game consoles in HD 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.240
 There is now quite Pauli Niebel 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.530
 you have the whole 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.860
 Specifications of what it implies consumed 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.980
 - 7 compatible 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 USB EQ that's whatever that is 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.540
 here on the back you can still see what's inside 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.350
 and the kids is leaving 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.120
 and then they are from and main students and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.650
 yes, how to do it all 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.550
 subsequently became 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.550
 down here is the usage plan 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 Adhesive strips can be fixed just like that 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.500
 simple Kurt Hoffmann kids 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.930
 and then you can do it all 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.190
 you can not 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.280
 I have to go often has to make every little punishment 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.920
 So two adhesive strips 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.860
 because more and more 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 Now I can open the whole ISO 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.710
 they fulfill 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710
 the same as the installation cd for the recording program 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 and right on top is the kit 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.660
 the little short side and Cobra still something to it 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.020
 Pouring worried 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.820
 when boxing for 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.910
 unsurpassed 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.130
 Zafra packed the squad on I did not think it was that right 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.540
 have been done 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.440
 you do it all up then 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 and have it here 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.580
 That's exactly what the portal is about 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.580
 the socket comes 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.700
 the adapter 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 So I think mine gives me so for many countries 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.739
 it also seemed like it 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.739
 Oh yes that is and a cable for this for the remote 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.960
 suddenly things have become 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 I think I hope that company is shaped 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.959
 No it is not not 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.030
 then it does not feel like I know now which castles and palaces 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.030
 anyway, only for us it has succeeded 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.829
 here's a component cable to switch from the pressure device to the TV 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.829
 can come again 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.769
 Wanner usb cable in it 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.790
 That was quite short I read that we definitely good if you 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.229
 then you get an extension cable 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.689
 what the box was 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.069
 and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.069
 You can see for the area is from Stephan this one 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.119
 I opened now follows the execution way 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.929
 put pressure on the study and off the horse 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.049
 so 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.209
 At that time, the Native would still be as sparkling as that 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.229
 Of course, very good match 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.609
 you have the catches of the s-video Inc if you are old for example now 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.249
 vhs cassettes 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.789
 Ballen's digital file from April wants to 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.159
 otherwise they would have to be around f5 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.469
 much better than her main hair Porsche 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.409
 whether ORF 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.609
 however one pronounces it 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.619
 the more you connect in the components 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.949
 As I said here is only that Kate at the one of the part c again 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.839
 fall in love as now one wanted for example with components still came 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:51.779
 five from the PlayStation here 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.919
 You have to get that extra 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.289
 Here is an HDMI out 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.939
 that is moving but relatively little Herrmann can only use behind if 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:00.679
 one now 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.979
 in front of the TV 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 because the PC wants to stream to the TV 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.499
 because you can then connect via HDMI 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.559
 here it is one more by the good read 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.169
 the iphone hacker 5-millimeter jack 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.529
 the USB port 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.269
 and the power has been 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.780
 Georgener Super Feeling I thought it's a fan you're on it 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.879
 painted 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.650
 and a little bit yes what still open 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.819
 very nice here is the logo 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.620
 I like that - now put this 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.840
 so it stands 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.289
 looks very nice 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.819
 and I think it was already from the Andok are I have my suspicions 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.930
 Song pinned thumbs up also commented on commented appraised 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:40.500
 Until next time
