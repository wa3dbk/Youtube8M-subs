g3 now of course that might seem like a
bit<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> drop<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> g3<00:01:04.680> screen<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.040> one

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
bit of a drop but the g3 screen is one

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.679 
bit of a drop but the g3 screen is one
of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> best<00:01:05.640> screens<00:01:05.939> I've<00:01:06.150> ever<00:01:06.270> seen<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of the best screens I've ever seen I

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.690 
of the best screens I've ever seen I
mean<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.200> don't<00:01:07.290> feel<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.799> 720p<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
mean you don't feel like it's 720p and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
mean you don't feel like it's 720p and
it's<00:01:08.880> almost<00:01:09.060> impossible<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:10.080> see<00:01:10.229> pixels

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
it's almost impossible to see pixels

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.460 
it's almost impossible to see pixels
unless<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.970> focus<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
unless you really focus on them so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.109 
unless you really focus on them so
there's<00:01:14.250> no<00:01:14.400> worries<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> screen

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
there's no worries about the screen

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.539 
there's no worries about the screen
being<00:01:15.299> subpar<00:01:15.810> subpar<00:01:16.380> quality<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.130> fact<00:01:17.430> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
being subpar subpar quality in fact it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.800 
being subpar subpar quality in fact it's
one<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> better<00:01:17.909> screens<00:01:18.210> I've<00:01:18.360> seen<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
one of the better screens I've seen and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
one of the better screens I've seen and
I<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.530> could<00:01:19.680> even<00:01:19.830> pass<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.400> some

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
I think it could even pass for some

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
I think it could even pass for some
higher-end<00:01:21.150> device<00:01:21.630> screens<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.470> body<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
higher-end device screens the body of

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
higher-end device screens the body of
the<00:01:22.860> g3<00:01:23.189> bead<00:01:23.369> has<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> same<00:01:24.259> metal<00:01:25.259> polished

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the g3 bead has the same metal polished

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
the g3 bead has the same metal polished
plastic<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> back<00:01:26.939> which<00:01:27.240> makes<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
plastic on the back which makes it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
plastic on the back which makes it
really<00:01:27.990> nice<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.619> feel<00:01:28.770> quite<00:01:29.040> nice<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
really nice and feel quite nice but I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.300 
really nice and feel quite nice but I
mean<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.270> honestly<00:01:31.170> used<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> quick

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
mean I honestly used it with the quick

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
mean I honestly used it with the quick
circle<00:01:32.610> case<00:01:32.790> most<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
circle case most of the time which is

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.390 
circle case most of the time which is
also<00:01:34.380> quite<00:01:34.619> thin<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.070> doesn't<00:01:35.310> add

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
also quite thin that it doesn't add

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
also quite thin that it doesn't add
enough<00:01:35.640> bulk<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> make<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.299> disturbing<00:01:36.750> either

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
enough bulk to make it disturbing either

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
enough bulk to make it disturbing either
way<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> phone<00:01:38.220> gives<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> nice<00:01:38.640> grip<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.180> not

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.880 
way the phone gives a nice grip it's not
too<00:01:39.479> slippery<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.110> does<00:01:40.259> feel<00:01:40.439> nice<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
too slippery but it does feel nice and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
too slippery but it does feel nice and
gives<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> premium<00:01:41.850> feel<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.420> even

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
gives it a premium feel to it even

fingers and press them down so it's kind

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.000 
fingers and press them down so it's kind
of<00:02:30.960> awkward<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.440> mean<00:02:31.470> I'm<00:02:31.680> sure<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.890> feels

beat<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:39.840> feature<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.140> did<00:02:40.380> miss<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.920> g3

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
beat one feature I did miss on the g3

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.590 
beat one feature I did miss on the g3
beat<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.940> feature<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.180> actually

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
beat and it's a feature that actually

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.210 
beat and it's a feature that actually
made<00:02:42.750> me<00:02:42.900> feel<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.410> using<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.830> low-end

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
made me feel like I was using a low-end

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.680 
made me feel like I was using a low-end
device<00:02:44.459> rather<00:02:44.700> than<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.030> mid-range<00:02:45.390> device

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
device rather than a mid-range device

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
device rather than a mid-range device
was<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.290> fact<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.800> does<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.370> a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
was the fact that it does not have a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.430 
was the fact that it does not have a
auto<00:02:47.880> brightness<00:02:48.120> sensor<00:02:48.510> instead<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.350> have

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
auto brightness sensor instead you have

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.810 
auto brightness sensor instead you have
to<00:02:49.470> manually<00:02:49.920> toggle<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> brightness<00:02:50.670> all

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
to manually toggle the brightness all

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.460 
to manually toggle the brightness all
the<00:02:50.910> time<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.420> since<00:02:51.780> I'm<00:02:51.930> used<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.200> auto

brightness picking in every time I step
outdoors<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.480> made<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.959> really<00:02:55.080> annoying

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380

instead I just usually kept it on a
hundred<00:02:57.030> percent<00:02:57.180> even<00:02:57.840> though<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.140> burned<00:02:58.350> my

playing<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.810> game<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.199> would<00:04:54.289> be<00:04:54.410> really

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
playing the game it would be really

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.399 
playing the game it would be really
random<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.250> isn't<00:04:55.910> really<00:04:56.120> reputable

elsewhere<00:06:14.870> you<00:06:15.680> can<00:06:15.860> easily<00:06:16.069> consider<00:06:16.819> this

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
elsewhere you can easily consider this
