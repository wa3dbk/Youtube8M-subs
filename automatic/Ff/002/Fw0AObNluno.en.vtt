00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.680
 have you ever had such that you entered 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.600
 some text in a text document and 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.639
 after some time cn were covered 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.709
 that you forgot to switch the keyboard to 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.420
 Russian language is appropriate for you 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.520
 the keyboard was set to 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.230
 English and all you entered 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.750
 text you entered 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.660
 in Latin letters for example instead of 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:31.869
 to introduce hello how are you 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.000
 Here are such a symbol and, accordingly 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.079
 Now I have here but literally 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.850
 two or three words 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.789
 if you have entered several paragraphs 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.309
 text, it is very disappointing to enter all 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.620
 first what to do as it is possible 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.569
 track or fix for this 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.940
 There is a special program about which I 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:52.389
 now I want to tell you and let 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.309
 let's open the browser and download it 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:56.679
 the program is called punto switcher 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.729
 so we are now just in the address 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.199
 prompt type punto switcher and 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.720
 almost immediately in the first place with us 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.880
 will be the site of this program is the point 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.469
 yandex.ru 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.850
 To download the program click on 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.930
 set button 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.880
 and after we have a program 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.830
 downloaded click to her 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.960
 run on install 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.110
 here you can remove the first two checkboxes 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.300
 which they suggest we do by Yandex 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.570
 index by default search engine 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.370
 click install 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.080
 Yes, and the program is installed 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.210
 You can also cancel the installation of Yandex 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.340
 browser and run the program click 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.650
 ready pay attention that here 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.830
 now I have a notification area 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.290
 there was another panel to which 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.960
 allows you to switch language only 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.720
 that the standard panel to us is so 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.450
 colorless under the color of the taskbar 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.850
 it's the same with us the panel has the color Russian 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.860
 language blue and english red 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.540
 accordingly now we are with you 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.760
 This Russian-language socket can 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.590
 just turn off click close 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.240
 language bar she is no longer us 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.860
 need because we now have it 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.340
 the punto program will play the role 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 switcher 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.390
 also this program works and here 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.800
 look we will switch now 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:24.830
 on the English layout and now we will write 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.750
 start writing the text again as you saw 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.030
 I have an automatic layout 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.950
 happened now you are just not so 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.600
 will forget 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.970
 switch layout and you can even 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.130
 this is no longer any way to think so program all 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.290
 It will do this automatically except in 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.800
 programs have some more features 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.019
 very useful for example if you were already driving 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.720
 some kind of text you can just 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.420
 highlight and press the shift key and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.400
 pause button 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.150
 as you see now the regions by me earlier 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.610
 the text has been translated into Russian layout 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.980
 if you for example want to enter all letters 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.600
 to be capitalized in this case 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.260
 you need to press the key combination 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.630
 alto pause 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 In this case, I will change the register 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.739
 Letters that is, I had the first big 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.600
 the rest were small now I have 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.470
 first little others all became 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.530
 capitalized as you can change 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.720
 layout at the time you write 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.690
 some text for example when you drive 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.610
 some kind of abbreviation or word which 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.040
 Are you sure that it is entered apparently 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.820
 right but the program for some 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.740
 reasons anyway turns it off on 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.750
 example stopped writing the word hi y 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.210
 The program switched me to Russian 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.920
 layout if i want it now 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.930
 word return back to latin 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.100
 the layout in this case I need to click 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.190
 pause key 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.560
 but there is a mandatory rule if 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.720
 for example, you now press the key 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.140
 space bar to introduce new 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.120
 word and start typing another word by 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.820
 you already have about a profit pause will 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.640
 work only on the last word then 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.800
 there is very important that you are in front 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.370
 switched layout exactly in that word 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.959
 in which you just wrote 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.060
 if you have already written 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.860
 the word you want to translate it into another 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.000
 in this case, use the layout 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.000
 shift combination
