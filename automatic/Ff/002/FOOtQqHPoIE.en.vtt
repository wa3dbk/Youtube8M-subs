00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:16.390
 Talk to you , youtube, beauty. 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.869
 we're here with another great video 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.240
 For you guys, I'll borrow it here. 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.390
 here again text path of the pec for 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.740
 show you the changes I 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:35.020
 I did as I left my pec forehead 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.750
 for you to find text ipec aturiá é é 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.210
 original 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.219
 so here we go with the new update 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.680
 is to update to 1.5 I updated the texture 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:53.170
 But she did not get excited. 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.989
 I think it came out beta 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.579
 I do not think it's animated yet. 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:03.129
 when I left him at the fae and I'm done 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.110
 try to arrange the animation she does not 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:12.580
 was animated 1.5 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 but I'm here because I think it's going to 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.000
 release another version so it will not 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.060
 compensate 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.350
 so do not use it because it's too 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.610
 different now 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.800
 the way texture is updated to 1.5 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.060
 is totally different from the versions 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.970
 previous 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.510
 more than a point 4.7 I loved it very much 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:45.430
 thing as if you could have noticed it 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:48.100
 Ok let's go guys here and you can 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.810
 realize that animation is much better 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:02:00.820
 Our plant is fine, I got it. 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:06.430
 some some do not remember the name 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:09.910
 The water is the same there too. 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 the story is more with the movies 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.280
 better is not so rush in there our 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 program is much better how to avoid 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.080
 smoother drive 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.080
 our flowers I changed the texture of 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:50.230
 a lot of change in our 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:56.980
 so our ore rate is here I go 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:00.940
 show the ore of command but he 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.520
 it has a very lively texture in the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.959
 same way before as you can see the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.310
 our tnt 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:17.489
 She has an animation up here and I 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:23.549
 I also grew here is totally changed 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:25.570
 all 104 x ok blocks is not that of the 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:33.420
 original 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.420
 below us 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:04:00.730
 It was then the guys I should cut 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.090
 in what is giving a falling gps 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.540
 Our tree is still alive. 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.280
 you can see the leaf of our water 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.500
 totally changed that there are also the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.130
 four kinds of leaf dna ours 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.549
 and if this dust that is also animated 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:26.580
 text is fully modified 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:30.270
 ok now it has a fps face it shows 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.500
 I did not even think about God, I did not even consider taking 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:38.460
 this graph here try on the bottom of mine 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.430
 God is our texture of a day too. 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.230
 It was changed Everything is released - some 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.669
 understands that 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:52.200
 so I think it's like this and the goal is two 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:54.510
 years here our armor can come there 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.090
 it's very fucking awesome 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.970
 this xis here in the middle of the amateur like 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.990
 very cool, it's really good, but it's 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.440
 so cool 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.680
 the chip says that neither he nor I 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:22.640
 that guy the inconvenience back here 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:22.640
 I also think that the guys 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:34.590
 so this is it people here and I do not know if 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.660
 I'll be able to upgrade to 1.5 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.780
 I do not know if I can do it but it's already 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.810
 here updated to 1,471 with movies 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.550
 lower with the drive through 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.010
