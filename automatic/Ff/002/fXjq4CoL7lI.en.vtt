00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.240
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.849
 connect your double coil speaker 4 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.130
 Who is the only one that I need is the video 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.830
 how to connect one is simple 4 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.350
 a simple 8 and a double coil of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.510
 two are this is a double line of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.090
 four or more times and the game does not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.789
 use the video one the men connect 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.369
 your four-coil speaker is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.619
 putting it to eight outs and what you have 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.699
 what to do is and what you have to do 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 is to grab the cable that comes to the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.290
 amplifier connect one in the negative 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.960
 of a terminal but they in the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.550
 positive from the other terminal and just 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 to give another extra cable that will go from 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 positive from this to the negative of this and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.030
 that's how to connect your double bass 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.059
 4 to 8 shoulder coil 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.710
 and now to connect your horn to 2 or more 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.300
 what you have to do again is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 grab a cable that in the amplifier 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 connect it in the negative on one side in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.540
 the positive on the other side and you grab it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.680
 another extra cable and this will go on the side 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.800
 positive on one side 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.110
 to the positive side and you're going to 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.230
 grab this green negative that this 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.510
 side and will be the negative on this side 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.690
 maybe put your double coil bass 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.340
 4 to homs to 2 or more and square are not 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.080
 only two options that you have for 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.060
 connect all a double coil of 4 or more 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.120
 and well then that truth or as a 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.610
 connect two together and now for 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.160
 connect two speakers together or two basses 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.830
 double-coil four-outs together 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.930
 to put them in 4 or more what you have to 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.470
 to do is to grab a cable has 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.900
 identifier you connect a cable with the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.440
 negative the negative the device in 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.930
 the positive and you grab another cable that 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.020
 goes from this negative and you will see the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.780
 have active the coil on this side 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.820
 from the other speaker you grab another tablet 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.820
 how green is this positive 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.070
 to this positive 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.950
 is another cable that will connect this suv 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.530
 and these two that are left loose in this 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.590
 office you connect them together instead of 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.090
 another cable that will connect this and this 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.400
 this side and like the one that I do not have another 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.030
 cable but then it has more or less one 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.220
 idea 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.160
 and how he approached me to give him a 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.319
 take closer to connect the cable that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.090
 comes in the picador to this negative this 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.400
 side of this side you connect to this 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.200
 negative on this side larraz a cable 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.970
 that will connect from this negative to 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.709
 active of this horn 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.470
 lagarde is the positive on this side and what 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.150
 you connect to the positive of this kitchen and what 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.069
 you connect these two that are loose 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.769
 together 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.260
 and then the last of people does not touch the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.079
 extra but you connect these two together the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.909
 two terminals together turns and that you 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.060
 is going to put your double coils under 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.770
 4 mbps than at 42 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.810
 and the last option you have for 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.739
 connect to these dual coil speakers 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.360
 4 mm is connecting the joints a1 and 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.550
 Well, what you have to do now 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.200
 It is the recipe that came the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.630
 amplifier you connect in the negative 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.900
 on this side you connect it in the positive 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.910
 on this side you grab a cable that goes 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.440
 to connect what you were going to connect the most 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.840
 all right 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.140
 in this negative and negative endowment 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.350
 from this side 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.760
 to be here , to make it also 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.620
 this side 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.519
 you connect 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.500
 you kill the positive on this side and the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.620
 positive on that side and what it does 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.830
 to do is connect together all the 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.349
 terminals and with me all are all going 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.500
 to occupy a cable that goes from this to 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.170
 this negative of this positive to this 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.750
 positive of this negative to this 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.510
 negative and from this positive to this 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.579
 positive will be their picture at the end 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.860
 of the video so that they see more or less what 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.660
 what I mean and well then it's how 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.060
 connect your four-man horns 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.830
 double coil to one 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.540
 and I hope you have helped them 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.940
 tutorials that I have done for 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.040
 help them how to connect their speakers and 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.690
 I know that maybe I'm not more expert in 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.360
 this topic but I try to teach them more 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.800
 humans what I know and how is how 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.650
 we do this is like the basics still 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.630
 I hope it helped you in something I think 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.650
 who have learned something well then 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.360
 tell me in the comments that others 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.530
 videos want to see what other kind of 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.760
 videos want to see what they want to learn 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.130
 to do what they want 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.660
 to teach them how to make themselves kind 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.139
 well not in the next tutorial a the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.139
 proximity 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.880
 Y 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.110
 Y 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.530
 Y 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.780
 ah 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.000
 Y
