00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I'm very happy about that I'm happy that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
I'm very happy about that I'm happy that
they<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.680> characters<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.369> monologue

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
they got the characters the monologue

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.030 
they got the characters the monologue
the<00:01:12.270> comedy<00:01:12.840> down<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:13.650> didn't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the comedy down because if they didn't

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.999 
the comedy down because if they didn't
then<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.640> lose<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.680> charm<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
then that would just lose all charm that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.530 
then that would just lose all charm that
the<00:01:17.130> series<00:01:17.549> had<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> first<00:01:18.240> place

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the series had in the first place

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.810 
the series had in the first place
because<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.110> isn't<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.650> series<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.610> has

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
because this isn't a series that has

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.320 
because this isn't a series that has
action<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.500> has<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:23.040> in-depth<00:01:23.640> story<00:01:24.090> or

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
action or it has some in-depth story or

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.850 
action or it has some in-depth story or
anything<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
anything like that now this is just a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.060 
anything like that now this is just a
series<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:27.110> farming<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.590> funny<00:01:28.799> thing

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
interesting how she could go from that

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
interesting how she could go from that
to<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.909> still<00:01:45.329> keep<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> super
