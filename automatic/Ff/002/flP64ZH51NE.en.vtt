00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.590
 batista70phone friends after having 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.480
 tried ubuntu on mx4 in barcelona ho 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.789
 had the curiosity to try it also on 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.980
 my nexus 5 via multiroom the thing is 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.810
 it was really very simple 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.519
 practically in dual boot if not 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.060
 choose nothing at the beginning part 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.429
 android or if you can choose to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.650
 stop the boot and start 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.019
 directly ubuntu 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.670
 here we have practically what it is 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.110
 success today with double tap makes us 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.000
 see what we've done 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.519
 then we can unlock either from one side or 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.190
 on the other it is indifferent we have the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.180
 the main page with the menu with all 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.540
 our applications 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.100
 here we can decide for example of 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.680
 add applications to those 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.970
 that they are there to put them on the menu 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.580
 so let's put grooveshark 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.729
 as you can see you find it here when you go 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.409
 to find again your example 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.000
 applications plus the other one you have 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.500
 chosen the market 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.160
 let's say it has several applications 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.560
 there is no example whatsapp found 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.450
 telegram there are several applications 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.180
 i love to see ubuntu store 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.320
 you have to make an ubuntu account less but it is 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.390
 one thing they did directly 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.090
 from the phone without any problem 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.870
 when example there are the top up some of 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.730
 the week is here divided by category I have to 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.860
 say there are 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.830
 different regarding the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.750
 functionality only works a few 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.410
 bluetooth problem I did not understand one 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.350
 what depends on it comes off all the time 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:50.780
 however for example wifi works the cam 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 gps function quietly wifi le 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.510
 calls are made without 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.160
 problems 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.380
 here you can choose for example of 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.970
 go directly to another 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.300
 program or with the key which 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.590
 back in the home I know 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.590
 we decide to go to the browser 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 here we are, we have time to load 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.700
 a browser I must say that is enough 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.860
 well we do double tap pinch to zoom 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 very fast now in the previous one 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.540
 something is not a problem when you do 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.640
 swipe this but give it a time 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.440
 moment to recover with this swipe 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.580
 you have the applications that are open and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.540
 here you can for example close above 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.470
 we have a notification drop-down menu 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.090
 we can go rotation notifications 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.760
 files its position to activate 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.010
 bluetooth I told you, but I turned it on 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.850
 it turns itself off I don't understand how 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.989
 never the network the audio and anything else 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.030
 battery 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.880
 now and I give it at least today 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.520
 using and not giving me very big 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.310
 problems seems to work all in 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.890
 quite correct as you see 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.230
 the fluidity and good you can open more 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.080
 applications and leave them in multitasking 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.270
 those with no problems whatsoever 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.250
 that you have then that side too 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.459
 that you have here in the dream to open the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.830
 file manager 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.709
 then do the swipe back here you can 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.670
 open other applications that I know of 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.800
 weather 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.000
 then always make the side swipe vi 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.160
 also found with the others 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.060
 applications without any kind of 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.530
 problem 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.270
 then when you want to close just that 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.140
 swipe it upwards e 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:38.660
 they close what else we can say here 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.580
 see it also divided into categories 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.550
 then say that it is enough 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.730
 interesting as an operating system 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.320
 at the moment it also seems quite 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.440
 stable I repeat in the market in my opinion 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.920
 some applications are missing 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.650
 I consider it quite indispensable though 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.840
 that if you want to try it the procedure 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.960
 very simple with multi room you don't have 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.720
 not even the menata then having to reflect 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.200
 another rom the rom you have is not coming 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.690
 reset or nothing 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.820
 you can import contacts 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.390
 quietly synchronizing to 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.220
 example then go to the settings 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.020
 it's a bit long sometimes however here you have 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.720
 all various things background audio languages 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.550
 account accounts test add 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.070
 all the accounts you want and to 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.220
 example regarding gmail and lo 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.270
 you can synchronize without any 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.540
 kind of problem ok 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.150
 and sometimes I don't get the switch a 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.420
 sometimes it does a little fatigue however it can also 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.650
 be a priest shop 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.660
 could be a display problem 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.270
 oh well anyway that ok by one 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.580
 quick test if you want to try it 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.590
 find as usual su su xda and se 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.270
 you have some doubts ask with 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.250
 this concluded immediately by the arias alias
