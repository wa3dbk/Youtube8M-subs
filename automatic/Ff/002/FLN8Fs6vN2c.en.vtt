if you have it right on top of the bead

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580 
if you have it right on top of the bead
you<00:02:11.310> may<00:02:11.580> break<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.600> be<00:02:12.750> okay<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.470> we're

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you may break it to be okay so we're

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.670 
you may break it to be okay so we're
gonna<00:02:13.680> turn<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> 90<00:02:14.790> degree<00:02:15.090> angle

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
gonna turn it and do a 90 degree angle

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.040 
gonna turn it and do a 90 degree angle
like<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.390> part<00:02:18.660> takes<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
like so and then this part takes a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.840 
like so and then this part takes a
little<00:02:19.200> practice<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.040> knowing<00:02:20.280> just

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
little practice which is knowing just

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.790 
little practice which is knowing just
how<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.330> wire<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.930> want<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.170> keep<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.680> how

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
how much wire you want to keep and how

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.780 
how much wire you want to keep and how
much<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.160> waste

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
much is waste

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.560 
much is waste
okay<00:02:24.150> you're<00:02:24.600> looking<00:02:24.989> at<00:02:25.140> probably<00:02:25.470> about

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
okay you're looking at probably about

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.670 
okay you're looking at probably about
mmm<00:02:28.130> maybe<00:02:29.130> three-quarters<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.120> an<00:02:30.330> inch

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
mmm maybe three-quarters of an inch

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.410 
mmm maybe three-quarters of an inch
right<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.070> area<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.760> part<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
right in that area is the part that you

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660 
right in that area is the part that you
want<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.810> keep<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.160> you're<00:02:35.310> gonna<00:02:35.400> take

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
want to keep and so you're gonna take

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.979 
want to keep and so you're gonna take
your<00:02:35.730> wire<00:02:36.060> cutters<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:36.870> you're

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
your wire cutters and when you're

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.900 
your wire cutters and when you're
cutting<00:02:37.230> wire<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:38.190> either<00:02:38.310> want<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.670> cover

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
cutting wire you either want to cover

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.120 
cutting wire you either want to cover
your<00:02:39.209> finger<00:02:39.630> or<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.290> want<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.530> face<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.980> down

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
your finger or you want to face it down

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.860 
your finger or you want to face it down
so<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.640> don't<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.940> wire<00:02:42.180> flying<00:02:42.600> all

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
so that you don't have wire flying all

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960 
so that you don't have wire flying all
around<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.350> would<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:43.769> dangerous<00:02:43.980> so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
around that would be very dangerous so

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.850 
around that would be very dangerous so
be<00:02:45.600> careful<00:02:46.019> when<00:02:46.110> you're<00:02:46.230> cutting<00:02:46.380> your<00:02:46.620> wire

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
be careful when you're cutting your wire

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.270 
be careful when you're cutting your wire
and<00:02:48.319> then<00:02:49.319> we're<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.739> take<00:02:49.950> our<00:02:50.100> round

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
and then we're going to take our round

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.750 
and then we're going to take our round
nose<00:02:50.459> pliers<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:52.040> as<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.579> round

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
nose pliers and as you can see the round

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.080 
nose pliers and as you can see the round
nose<00:02:53.910> pliers<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> taper<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.260> them<00:02:55.500> mm-hmm

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
nose pliers have a taper to them mm-hmm

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.610 
nose pliers have a taper to them mm-hmm
it's<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.239> matter<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.540> preference<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.410> whether

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it's a matter of preference on whether

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.289 
it's a matter of preference on whether
you<00:02:58.829> want<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.130> have<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> teenager<00:02:59.820> that's<00:03:00.120> going

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
you want to have a teenager that's going

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.210 
you want to have a teenager that's going
to<00:03:00.360> determine<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.840> size<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.530> your<00:03:02.010> loop

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
to determine the size of your loop

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.509 
to determine the size of your loop
mm-hmm<00:03:02.850> there<00:03:03.780> are<00:03:04.160> reasons<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.370> may

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
mm-hmm there are reasons that you may

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.610 
mm-hmm there are reasons that you may
want<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:05.820> very<00:03:06.209> very<00:03:06.450> large<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.320> may<00:03:07.440> want

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
want one very very large or you may want

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.440 
want one very very large or you may want
them<00:03:07.769> very<00:03:07.980> very<00:03:08.190> small<00:03:08.489> but<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.299> most

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
them very very small but for most

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.840 
them very very small but for most
purposes<00:03:09.720> right<00:03:10.350> near<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:10.980> center<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.489> fine

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
purposes right near the center is fine

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.780 
purposes right near the center is fine
if<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.690> want<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> size<00:03:14.400> loop<00:03:14.610> that

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
if you want to you like a size loop that

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.550 
if you want to you like a size loop that
you<00:03:14.880> like<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.390> actually<00:03:15.570> mark<00:03:15.989> this<00:03:16.230> with

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
you like you can actually mark this with

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.920 
you like you can actually mark this with
a<00:03:16.950> felt-tip<00:03:17.549> pen<00:03:17.910> okay<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.810> can

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
a felt-tip pen okay so that you can

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.780 
a felt-tip pen okay so that you can
always<00:03:19.049> find<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.410> same<00:03:19.440> place<00:03:19.829> again<00:03:20.040> gotcha

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
always find the same place again gotcha

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.940 
always find the same place again gotcha
so<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.390> can<00:03:21.510> put<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> round<00:03:22.769> nose

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so you can put it in the round nose

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.949 
so you can put it in the round nose
pliers<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.579> then<00:03:24.450> you're<00:03:24.570> going<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.750> roll

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
pliers and then you're going to roll

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.430 
pliers and then you're going to roll
towards<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> center<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:27.260> you're<00:03:28.260> going<00:03:28.380> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
towards the center and you're going to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.009 
towards the center and you're going to
have<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.650> pull<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.890> pliers<00:03:29.160> out<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.870> can

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
have to pull the pliers out and you can

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.080 
have to pull the pliers out and you can
see<00:03:31.230> where<00:03:31.440> it's<00:03:31.530> made<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.829> partial<00:03:32.250> term

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
see where it's made of partial term

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.690 
see where it's made of partial term
there<00:03:33.859> reinsert<00:03:34.859> your<00:03:34.890> pliers<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:38.280> complete

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
there reinsert your pliers to complete

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.140 
there reinsert your pliers to complete
the<00:03:38.850> loop<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:40.310> sometimes

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
the loop and sometimes

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.119 
the loop and sometimes
you<00:03:43.540> kind<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.870> have<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.230> fool<00:03:44.500> with<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:45.069> a

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
you kind of have to fool with it a

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.460 
you kind of have to fool with it a
little<00:03:45.310> bit<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:46.120> get<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.299> right<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.659> place<00:03:46.689> okay

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
little bit to get it right in place okay

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.800 
little bit to get it right in place okay
you<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.769> see<00:03:47.980> how<00:03:48.159> easy<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.329> it

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
you can see how easy that is and it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.740 
you can see how easy that is and it
takes<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.140> little<00:03:50.290> practice<00:03:51.239> again<00:03:52.239> probably

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
takes a little practice again probably

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.390 
takes a little practice again probably
finding<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.470> length<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:53.980> want<00:03:54.069> your

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
finding the length that you want your

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.780 
finding the length that you want your
loop<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.760> one's<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.090> little<00:03:55.360> big<00:03:55.599> but<00:03:56.349> is<00:03:57.159> it's

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
pair of earrings I like them now I

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.279 
pair of earrings I like them now I
brought<00:05:51.460> with<00:05:51.699> me<00:05:51.759> another<00:05:52.330> type<00:05:52.660> of<00:05:52.870> earring

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
brought with me another type of earring

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.189 
brought with me another type of earring
finding<00:05:53.860> that's<00:05:54.520> something<00:05:55.120> that<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:56.050> can

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
finding that's something that you can

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.640 
finding that's something that you can
add<00:05:56.610> more<00:05:57.610> movement<00:05:58.449> more<00:05:58.870> beads<00:05:59.169> just

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
add more movement more beads just

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.990 
add more movement more beads just
something<00:05:59.979> a<00:06:00.069> little<00:06:00.280> bit<00:06:00.400> different<00:06:00.849> and

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
something a little bit different and

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.210 
something a little bit different and
this<00:06:01.509> is<00:06:01.569> a<00:06:01.780> filigree<00:06:02.139> finding<00:06:02.710> that<00:06:02.830> actually

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
this is a filigree finding that actually

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.550 
this is a filigree finding that actually
has<00:06:03.400> a<00:06:03.430> number<00:06:03.699> of<00:06:03.880> different<00:06:04.270> loops<00:06:04.900> on<00:06:05.169> them

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
has a number of different loops on them

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.580 
has a number of different loops on them
and<00:06:06.310> you<00:06:06.639> can<00:06:06.669> take<00:06:07.509> the<00:06:07.780> same<00:06:08.050> technique

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
and you can take the same technique

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.589 
and you can take the same technique
maybe<00:06:08.919> you<00:06:09.130> would<00:06:09.250> just<00:06:09.400> want<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.669> put<00:06:09.849> smaller

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
maybe you would just want to put smaller

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.719 
maybe you would just want to put smaller
beads<00:06:10.900> on<00:06:11.199> there<00:06:11.470> and<00:06:11.680> using<00:06:12.430> that<00:06:12.520> same

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
beads on there and using that same

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.360 
beads on there and using that same
technique<00:06:13.150> making<00:06:13.599> these<00:06:13.930> these<00:06:14.889> on<00:06:15.220> the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
technique making these these on the

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.850 
technique making these these on the
wires<00:06:15.580> and<00:06:15.940> adding<00:06:16.360> these<00:06:16.479> on<00:06:16.750> here<00:06:17.380> into<00:06:17.680> the

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
wires and adding these on here into the

wires and adding these on here into the
edge<00:06:18.039> and<00:06:18.569> possibly<00:06:19.569> one<00:06:19.810> in<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.050> center<00:06:20.440> and

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
edge and possibly one in the center and

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.559 
edge and possibly one in the center and
then<00:06:20.740> of<00:06:20.860> course<00:06:20.919> you<00:06:21.250> would<00:06:21.370> add<00:06:21.580> your<00:06:21.880> your

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
then of course you would add your your

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.290 
then of course you would add your your
earring<00:06:23.020> finding<00:06:23.650> to<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:23.919> top<00:06:24.159> but<00:06:24.819> by<00:06:25.000> using

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
earring finding to the top but by using

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.300 
earring finding to the top but by using
these<00:06:25.569> different<00:06:26.020> types<00:06:26.229> of<00:06:26.409> metal<00:06:26.800> filigrees

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
these different types of metal filigrees

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.120 
these different types of metal filigrees
you've<00:06:27.610> got<00:06:27.789> a<00:06:27.819> huge<00:06:28.330> variety<00:06:28.750> of<00:06:29.130> options

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
you've got a huge variety of options

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.070 
you've got a huge variety of options
available<00:06:30.220> using<00:06:30.909> this<00:06:31.030> same<00:06:31.300> technique<00:06:31.780> it's

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
available using this same technique it's

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.230 
available using this same technique it's
just<00:06:32.349> a<00:06:32.440> very<00:06:32.650> simple<00:06:32.919> turning<00:06:33.909> the<00:06:34.030> loop

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
just a very simple turning the loop

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.350 
just a very simple turning the loop
cutting<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:35.020> wire<00:06:35.199> and<00:06:35.590> I<00:06:36.430> think<00:06:36.940> you<00:06:37.060> can<00:06:37.240> do

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
cutting the wire and I think you can do

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.330 
cutting the wire and I think you can do
that<00:06:37.509> I<00:06:37.780> think<00:06:37.960> I<00:06:38.259> can<00:06:38.440> do<00:06:38.530> that<00:06:38.560> too<00:06:38.860> that's

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
that I think I can do that too that's

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.920 
that I think I can do that too that's
great<00:06:39.729> and<00:06:40.000> I'm<00:06:40.090> sure<00:06:40.270> you<00:06:40.389> can't<00:06:40.599> do<00:06:40.720> it<00:06:40.840> at

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
great and I'm sure you can't do it at

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.979 
great and I'm sure you can't do it at
home<00:06:41.110> -<00:06:41.380> thank<00:06:41.800> you
