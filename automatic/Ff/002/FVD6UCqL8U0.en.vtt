bays here we have three external 5.25

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.270 
bays here we have three external 5.25
and<00:01:04.339> we<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:04.939> eight<00:01:05.239> internal<00:01:05.869> 3.5<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:07.159> can

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
and we have eight internal 3.5 you can

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.859 
and we have eight internal 3.5 you can
also<00:01:07.460> change<00:01:07.789> these<00:01:08.000> out<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.570> instead<00:01:08.810> of

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
also change these out so that instead of

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.590 
also change these out so that instead of
having<00:01:08.960> eight<00:01:09.320> 3.5<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.549> can<00:01:10.670> take<00:01:10.880> two<00:01:11.299> screws

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
having eight 3.5 you can take two screws

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.510 
having eight 3.5 you can take two screws
off<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.899> back<00:01:12.049> here<00:01:12.079> pull<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.159> trays<00:01:13.369> out

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
off the back here pull the trays out

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.490 
off the back here pull the trays out
slide<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.359> use<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.990> two<00:01:15.170> point<00:01:15.380> five

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
slide this in and use the two point five

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.109 
slide this in and use the two point five
trays<00:01:15.859> that<00:01:15.890> come<00:01:16.219> in<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.369> accessories<00:01:16.759> box

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
trays that come in the accessories box

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.690 
trays that come in the accessories box
so<00:01:17.689> essentially<00:01:18.079> you<00:01:18.320> can<00:01:18.409> have<00:01:18.590> eight<00:01:18.829> 3.5<00:01:19.520> s

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
so essentially you can have eight 3.5 s

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.649 
so essentially you can have eight 3.5 s
or<00:01:19.850> five<00:01:20.359> 2.5<00:01:21.020> s<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.320> 3<00:01:21.590> 3.5<00:01:22.310> s<00:01:22.429> we've<00:01:23.390> designed

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
or five 2.5 s and 3 3.5 s we've designed

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.630 
or five 2.5 s and 3 3.5 s we've designed
up<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.899> eight<00:01:24.049> mounts<00:01:24.530> for<00:01:24.770> fans<00:01:25.009> inside<00:01:25.460> this

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
now the front of the case is very soon

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.240 
now the front of the case is very soon
we<00:02:39.930> wanted<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.290> hide<00:02:40.500> away<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.770> lot<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
types of ROM days that you have and so

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.970 
types of ROM days that you have and so
what<00:02:45.240> we've<00:02:45.390> done<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.630> we've<00:02:45.959> integrated<00:02:46.410> into

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
what we've done is we've integrated into

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.890 
what we've done is we've integrated into
the<00:02:47.070> seamless<00:02:47.400> design<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:48.000> power<00:02:48.300> button<00:02:48.570> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the seamless design a power button and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.590 
the seamless design a power button and
reset<00:02:49.320> switch<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.130> barely<00:02:50.550> visible<00:02:50.670> we

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
reset switch that is barely visible we

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.970 
reset switch that is barely visible we
also<00:02:51.780> designed<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.650> when<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.950> need

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
also designed it so that when you need

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.949 
also designed it so that when you need
the<00:02:53.190> cd-rom<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.820> come<00:02:53.970> out<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.600> spring-loaded

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
the cd-rom to come out the spring-loaded

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.160 
the cd-rom to come out the spring-loaded
doors<00:02:55.320> will<00:02:55.680> eject<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> close<00:02:57.240> as<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.870> drum

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
doors will eject and close as the drum

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.470 
doors will eject and close as the drum
also<00:02:58.440> Jackson<00:02:58.950> closed<00:02:59.160> if<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.060> wanted<00:03:00.390> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
also Jackson closed if you wanted to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.910 
also Jackson closed if you wanted to
showcase<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.050> we've<00:03:01.170> also<00:03:01.350> made<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:01.740> that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
showcase it we've also made it so that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.300 
showcase it we've also made it so that
these<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.850> actually<00:03:03.120> pop<00:03:03.360> off<00:03:03.860> if<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.040> slide

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
these can actually pop off if you slide

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.640 
these can actually pop off if you slide
this<00:03:05.459> forward<00:03:05.720> we've<00:03:06.720> added<00:03:07.080> these<00:03:07.380> little

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
this forward we've added these little

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.500 
this forward we've added these little
spaces<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.580> inside<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> accessories
