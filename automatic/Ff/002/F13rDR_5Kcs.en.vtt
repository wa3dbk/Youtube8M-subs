so<00:00:00.240> we're<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.810> bend<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.319> lead<00:00:01.620> upward

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so we're going to bend this lead upward

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.230 
so we're going to bend this lead upward
and<00:00:03.500> since<00:00:04.500> we<00:00:04.710> can<00:00:04.890> get<00:00:05.069> added<00:00:05.520> easiest<00:00:06.029> right

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
and since we can get added easiest right

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.179 
and since we can get added easiest right
now<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.750> am<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.319> go<00:00:07.440> ahead<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.859> solder

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
now I am going to go ahead and solder

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.580 
now I am going to go ahead and solder
this<00:00:08.970> connection<00:00:09.660> will<00:00:09.960> let<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> solder

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
this connection will let the solder

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.190 
this connection will let the solder
completely<00:00:11.370> fill<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.910> winding<00:00:12.570> see<00:00:13.110> how

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
completely fill that winding see how

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.369 
completely fill that winding see how
that<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:14.040> fills<00:00:14.370> up<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.969> should<00:00:15.900> be<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> very

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
that that fills up that should be a very

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.160 
that that fills up that should be a very
good<00:00:16.529> solder<00:00:17.010> joint<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.420> beaded<00:00:18.960> it's

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
good solder joint it's not beaded it's

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.590 
good solder joint it's not beaded it's
completely<00:00:19.650> filled<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.130> metal<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:21.300> now

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
completely filled the metal and that now

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.849 
completely filled the metal and that now
we<00:00:21.630> won't<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.260> worry<00:00:22.410> about<00:00:22.439> trying<00:00:22.769> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
we won't have to worry about trying to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.560 
we won't have to worry about trying to
get<00:00:23.039> down<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.760> solder<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.330> once

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
get down in there to solder that once

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.560 
get down in there to solder that once
the<00:00:24.810> coil<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.769> place<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.880> next<00:00:27.240> part<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the coil is in place the next part to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.110 
the coil is in place the next part to
add<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.900> coil<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> low<00:00:32.399> pass<00:00:32.640> section

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
add is the coil for the low pass section

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.260 
add is the coil for the low pass section
for<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> woofer<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
for the woofer and as you can see in the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
for the woofer and as you can see in the
the<00:00:36.719> one<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> I've<00:00:37.500> already<00:00:37.739> constructed<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the one that I've already constructed I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
the one that I've already constructed I
did<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:39.840> right<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.890> next<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
did just right right there right next to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220 
did just right right there right next to
the<00:00:41.430> coil<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> very<00:00:42.480> short

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the coil and we have a very short

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
the coil and we have a very short
connection<00:00:43.680> right<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:46.280> coil<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.550> going

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
connection right there so coil is going

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
connection right there so coil is going
to<00:00:48.270> set<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.840> very<00:00:49.620> close<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.309> they

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to set right here very close and they

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
to set right here very close and they
see<00:00:50.700> conveniently<00:00:51.449> these<00:00:51.960> two<00:00:52.230> wires<00:00:52.500> are

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
see conveniently these two wires are

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.540 
see conveniently these two wires are
close<00:00:53.100> together<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> trim<00:00:56.520> off

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
close together so I'm going to trim off

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.750 
close together so I'm going to trim off
the<00:00:57.059> long<00:00:57.270> lead<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.390> coil<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.760> now

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the long lead of the coil right here now

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.399 
the long lead of the coil right here now
this<00:01:03.210> red<00:01:03.539> coating<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:06.150> coil<00:01:06.510> wire<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
this red coating on the coil wire is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.440 
this red coating on the coil wire is
insulation<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> end<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
insulation and you can see the end of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.469 
insulation and you can see the end of
this<00:01:09.630> wire<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.950> has<00:01:11.159> been<00:01:11.460> 10<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
this wire it has been 10 so it has a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.219 
this wire it has been 10 so it has a
silver<00:01:12.810> appearance<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.180> cannot<00:01:15.509> solder

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
silver appearance but we cannot solder

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.560 
silver appearance but we cannot solder
to<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.009> insulation<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.780> I'll<00:01:18.900> use<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
to this insulation so what I'll use is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
to this insulation so what I'll use is
this<00:01:21.570> time<00:01:21.780> I'll<00:01:21.960> use<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.140> carton<00:01:22.680> cutter<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this time I'll use a carton cutter and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.580 
this time I'll use a carton cutter and
I'm<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.840> scrape<00:01:24.840> away<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I'm just going to scrape away that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.320 
I'm just going to scrape away that
insulation<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.640> you'll<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> course

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
insulation and what you'll see of course

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
insulation and what you'll see of course
right<00:01:27.600> underneath<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.710> bright<00:01:29.189> clean

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
right underneath it is bright clean

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.179 
right underneath it is bright clean
shiny<00:01:30.890> copper<00:01:32.840> we've<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
shiny copper we've got to get all of

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.999 
shiny copper we've got to get all of
that<00:01:35.220> off<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.090> plenty<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
that off there so we have plenty of

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.120 
that off there so we have plenty of
clean<00:01:38.009> clear<00:01:39.829> copper<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.490> solder<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:43.130> we'll

my fingers we'll wrap this guy around
here<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:18.790> we<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:18.940> do<00:02:19.180> after<00:02:19.360> we<00:02:20.050> solder

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
here and what we can do after we solder

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.620 
here and what we can do after we solder
this<00:02:20.770> we<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.220> bend<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:21.640> down<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.360> get

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
this we can bend this down to get it get

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.740 
this we can bend this down to get it get
it<00:02:22.750> out<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.140> way<00:02:23.290> keep<00:02:24.130> things<00:02:24.720> nice<00:02:25.720> and

neat<00:02:26.080> okay<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.190> our<00:02:30.280> input<00:02:30.340> terminal

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
neat okay so this is our input terminal

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.030 
neat okay so this is our input terminal
we<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> solder<00:02:31.930> connection<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.650> here<00:02:32.920> on

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
we have a solder connection back here on

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.910 
we have a solder connection back here on
the<00:02:33.160> back<00:02:33.540> which<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:34.780> make<00:02:34.959> later<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.470> went

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the back which will make later I went

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.380 
the back which will make later I went
ahead<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.220> soldered<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.760> one<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.150> front

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
ahead and soldered the one on the front

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.759 
ahead and soldered the one on the front
here<00:02:37.570> because<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:37.989> kind<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.260> tight<00:02:38.440> quarters

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
here because it's kind of tight quarters

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.509 
here because it's kind of tight quarters
down<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.280> there<00:02:40.980> connected<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.190> input

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
down in there connected to the input

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.670 
down in there connected to the input
side<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.970> coil<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.660> our<00:02:43.959> output<00:02:44.440> side

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
side of the coil this is our output side

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.430 
side of the coil this is our output side
to<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> speaker<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.630> next<00:02:46.900> part<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
to the speaker so the next part is the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.990 
to the speaker so the next part is the
parallel<00:02:50.310> capacitors<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:53.670> position<00:02:54.670> those

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
parallel capacitors and I position those

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.220 
parallel capacitors and I position those
right<00:02:55.569> next<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.370> coil<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.030> these<00:02:58.930> guys

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
right next to the coil and these guys

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.229 
right next to the coil and these guys
are<00:02:59.530> also<00:02:59.739> in<00:03:00.160> parallel<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.850> means<00:03:01.060> they're

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
are also in parallel that means they're

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.009 
are also in parallel that means they're
hooked<00:03:01.420> end-to-end<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.810> two

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
hooked end-to-end just like the the two

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.940 
hooked end-to-end just like the the two
500s<00:03:05.890> before<00:03:06.989> since<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.110> have<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> connection<00:03:08.680> up

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
500s before since I have a connection up

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.310 
500s before since I have a connection up
high<00:03:09.160> here<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:09.970> connection<00:03:10.269> down<00:03:10.570> low<00:03:10.870> here

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
high here and a connection down low here

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.410 
high here and a connection down low here
I<00:03:11.470> wrap<00:03:11.920> these<00:03:12.160> guys<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.880> lead<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.329> the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
I wrap these guys so the lead is on the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.090 
I wrap these guys so the lead is on the
top<00:03:13.630> here<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:13.959> lead<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.380> on<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> bottom<00:03:14.920> there

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
top here and lead is on the bottom there

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.729 
top here and lead is on the bottom there
none<00:03:15.340> of<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.700> critical<00:03:15.910> yeah<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.470> you

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
none of this is critical yeah just I you

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.720 
none of this is critical yeah just I you
know<00:03:17.860> try<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.160> do<00:03:18.370> things<00:03:18.640> neatly<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.799> it's<00:03:21.579> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
know try to do things neatly so it's the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.729 
know try to do things neatly so it's the
same<00:03:21.910> thing<00:03:21.970> again

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
same thing again

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.470 
same thing again
looking<00:03:23.739> ahead<00:03:23.829> since<00:03:24.489> one<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.820> these<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.299> up

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
looking ahead since one of these is up

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.330 
looking ahead since one of these is up
high<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.750> other<00:03:26.019> is<00:03:26.260> down<00:03:26.470> low<00:03:26.769> I'm<00:03:27.100> going<00:03:27.280> to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
high the other is down low I'm going to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.100 
high the other is down low I'm going to
use<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.730> upper<00:03:28.060> lead<00:03:28.239> on<00:03:28.450> this<00:03:28.600> side<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.049> I'm

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
use the upper lead on this side so I'm

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.069 
use the upper lead on this side so I'm
going<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.290> bring<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.590> lower<00:03:29.799> lead<00:03:30.130> up<00:03:30.430> and

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
going to bring the lower lead up and

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.250 
going to bring the lower lead up and
twist<00:03:32.079> it<00:03:32.260> around<00:03:32.350> here<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:34.049> I'm<00:03:35.049> going<00:03:35.230> to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
twist it around here and I'm going to

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.720 
twist it around here and I'm going to
use<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.620> lower<00:03:35.829> lead<00:03:36.100> over<00:03:36.280> here<00:03:36.549> because

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
use the lower lead over here because

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.509 
use the lower lead over here because
it's<00:03:36.880> down<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.329> surface<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.959> board

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
it's down on the surface of the board

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.660 
it's down on the surface of the board
so<00:03:39.519> I'll<00:03:39.640> just<00:03:39.820> bend<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.269> down<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.769> wrap

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
so I'll just bend that down and wrap

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.039 
so I'll just bend that down and wrap
that<00:03:42.910> guy<00:03:43.090> around<00:03:43.450> there<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:46.630> we'll<00:03:46.840> go<00:03:46.959> ahead

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
that guy around there and we'll go ahead

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.050 
that guy around there and we'll go ahead
and<00:03:47.230> trim<00:03:47.410> those<00:03:47.620> guys<00:03:47.859> off<00:03:48.190> they're<00:03:48.850> not

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
and trim those guys off they're not

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.180 
and trim those guys off they're not
going<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.329> go<00:03:49.870> anywhere<00:03:52.950> again

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
going to go anywhere again

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.620 
going to go anywhere again
there's<00:03:54.520> no<00:03:54.640> polarities<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.210> any<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.570> these

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
there's no polarities in any of these

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.270 
there's no polarities in any of these
parts<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.290> doesn't<00:03:56.590> matter<00:03:56.740> which<00:03:57.010> way<00:03:57.220> you

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
parts so it doesn't matter which way you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.530 
parts so it doesn't matter which way you
turn<00:03:57.430> them<00:03:57.790> which<00:03:57.970> way<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.210> hook<00:03:58.420> them

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
turn them which way you hook them

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.290 
turn them which way you hook them
together<00:03:58.690> there<00:03:59.320> they're<00:03:59.620> non<00:03:59.800> polarized<00:04:00.490> so

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
together there they're non polarized so

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.210 
together there they're non polarized so
our<00:04:01.810> cap<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:02.380> going<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.650> we're<00:04:02.770> going<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.950> park

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
our cap is going to we're going to park

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.430 
our cap is going to we're going to park
this<00:04:03.340> guy<00:04:03.580> right<00:04:03.850> here<00:04:03.880> or<00:04:04.540> electrical

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
this guy right here or electrical

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.560 
this guy right here or electrical
connection<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:06.040> right<00:04:06.250> here<00:04:06.670> so<00:04:06.910> again<00:04:07.240> we

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
connection is right here so again we

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.840 
connection is right here so again we
need<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.930> clear<00:04:08.200> away<00:04:09.810> our<00:04:10.810> insulation<00:04:11.470> off<00:04:12.280> of

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
need to clear away our insulation off of

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.900 
need to clear away our insulation off of
this<00:04:12.970> wire<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:16.060> we<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.239> solder<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:18.580> I'm

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
this wire so we can solder to it so I'm

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.160 
this wire so we can solder to it so I'm
going<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.120> go<00:04:19.239> ahead<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.540> glue<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.930> into<00:04:20.080> place

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
going to go ahead and glue it into place

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.280 
going to go ahead and glue it into place
just<00:04:20.380> spot<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:21.010> hot<00:04:21.250> melt<00:04:21.519> glue<00:04:21.549> on<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.780> board<00:04:23.050> a

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
just spot a hot melt glue on the board a

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.460 
just spot a hot melt glue on the board a
little<00:04:23.560> bit<00:04:23.710> on<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.070> side<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:25.470> capacitors

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
little bit on the side of the capacitors

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.820 
little bit on the side of the capacitors
and<00:04:26.830> we'll<00:04:27.010> just<00:04:27.190> Park<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.610> right<00:04:27.640> there<00:04:28.830> and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
and we'll just Park it right there and

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.600 
and we'll just Park it right there and
that<00:04:30.220> grabs<00:04:30.490> pretty<00:04:30.910> quickly<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:33.250> we'll<00:04:33.460> go

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
that grabs pretty quickly and we'll go

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.600 
that grabs pretty quickly and we'll go
ahead<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.850> wrap<00:04:34.420> our<00:04:34.690> lead<00:04:36.090> around<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:38.610> coil

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
ahead and wrap our lead around the coil

ahead and wrap our lead around the coil
lead<00:04:46.140> okay<00:04:47.140> now<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.470> lead<00:04:47.710> I'm<00:04:47.920> going<00:04:48.100> to

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
lead okay now this lead I'm going to

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.160 
lead okay now this lead I'm going to
bend<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.610> down<00:04:48.670> this<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.270> our<00:04:49.390> output<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:50.110> I'm

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
bend this down this is our output so I'm

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.940 
bend this down this is our output so I'm
going<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.380> bend<00:04:50.590> this<00:04:50.740> down<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:52.740> get<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.890> in

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
going to bend this down and get it in

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.650 
going to bend this down and get it in
place<00:04:54.190> there<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.700> I'm<00:04:54.820> going<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.000> anchor<00:04:55.240> that

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
place there and I'm going to anchor that

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.620 
place there and I'm going to anchor that
to<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.140> board<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:57.430> help<00:04:57.550> strain<00:04:58.030> relief<00:04:58.450> it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630

and<00:06:57.340> a<00:06:57.370> half<00:06:57.400> and<00:06:57.729> the<00:06:57.850> ten<00:06:58.090> in<00:06:58.330> parallel<00:06:58.990> which

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
and a half and the ten in parallel which

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.350 
and a half and the ten in parallel which
is<00:06:59.350> the<00:06:59.470> way<00:06:59.590> we'll<00:06:59.800> set<00:07:00.070> it<00:07:00.100> up<00:07:00.310> here<00:07:00.790> the

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
is the way we'll set it up here the

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.510 
is the way we'll set it up here the
baffle<00:07:01.930> step<00:07:02.169> needs<00:07:02.440> for<00:07:02.710> the<00:07:02.889> way<00:07:03.010> you<00:07:03.070> use

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
baffle step needs for the way you use

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.390 
baffle step needs for the way you use
your<00:07:03.550> speakers<00:07:04.270> may<00:07:04.510> be<00:07:04.570> different<00:07:05.139> so<00:07:05.440> it's<00:07:06.310> a

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
your speakers may be different so it's a

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.280 
your speakers may be different so it's a
good<00:07:06.550> thing<00:07:06.610> obviously<00:07:07.540> to<00:07:07.690> think<00:07:07.870> ahead<00:07:07.990> how

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290 
good thing obviously to think ahead how

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.629 
good thing obviously to think ahead how
you're<00:07:08.470> going<00:07:08.650> to<00:07:08.710> use<00:07:08.919> your<00:07:09.070> system<00:07:09.460> whether

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 
you're going to use your system whether

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.230 
you're going to use your system whether
it's<00:07:09.910> going<00:07:10.150> to<00:07:10.240> be<00:07:10.300> the<00:07:10.630> ML<00:07:11.020> TL<00:07:11.500> or<00:07:12.150> just<00:07:13.150> the

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
it's going to be the ML TL or just the

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.240 
it's going to be the ML TL or just the
center<00:07:13.390> channel<00:07:13.870> or<00:07:13.960> whatever<00:07:14.289> that's<00:07:14.979> going

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
center channel or whatever that's going

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.890 
center channel or whatever that's going
to<00:07:15.310> determine<00:07:15.850> whether<00:07:16.030> or<00:07:16.150> not<00:07:16.270> again<00:07:16.660> that

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
to determine whether or not again that

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.650 
to determine whether or not again that
you<00:07:17.050> use<00:07:17.380> the<00:07:17.979> two<00:07:18.550> big<00:07:18.760> filter<00:07:19.150> caps<00:07:19.419> at<00:07:19.630> the

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
you use the two big filter caps at the

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.820 
you use the two big filter caps at the
input<00:07:20.140> and<00:07:20.380> these<00:07:22.229> attenuation<00:07:23.229> transistors
