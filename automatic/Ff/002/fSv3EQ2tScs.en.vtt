closing strong arc impact angle is an

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.860 
closing strong arc impact angle is an
average<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:30.060> 4.3<00:03:32.359> tempo<00:03:33.980> 1.5<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.870> that's

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
average of 4.3 tempo 1.5 the one that's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.780 
average of 4.3 tempo 1.5 the one that's
pretty<00:03:37.170> good<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> tempo<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:44.609> they<00:03:44.730> were

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
pretty good the tempo so but they were

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.610 
pretty good the tempo so but they were
all<00:03:44.970> closed<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:47.340> now<00:03:48.319> essentially<00:03:51.049> if<00:03:52.049> you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
all closed so now essentially if you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.039 
all closed so now essentially if you
were<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:53.609> do<00:03:53.909> this<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.349> multiple<00:03:55.950> times

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
were to do this you know multiple times

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.550 
were to do this you know multiple times
you<00:03:58.049> can<00:03:58.319> then<00:03:58.560> go<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.639> area<00:03:59.940> here<00:04:00.560> to

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you can then go to this area here to

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.699 
you can then go to this area here to
compare<00:04:02.599> being<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.840> I've<00:04:03.989> only<00:04:04.200> done<00:04:05.359> huh
