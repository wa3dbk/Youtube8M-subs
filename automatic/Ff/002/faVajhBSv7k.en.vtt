00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.500
 good afternoon dear gambling addicts 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.879
 with you leicester and today with you scheduled 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.740
 rollers arskoy but he will 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.530
 finally because i am friends so 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.540
 I thought, and I just do not see any further 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.940
 play for sky but just friends i know 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.250
 the fact that many people like this game but 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 think for yourself here we went through the company and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.779
 actually no goals we have more in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.289
 there is no game and we are probably doomed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 just like this for days 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.060
 wander through the universe of this game and 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.560
 just wandering aimlessly as you know 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.660
 like some ghost who doesn't 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.030
 can find refuge in this world 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.530
 so let's do something today 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.100
 like saying goodbye to the game 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.140
 really friends as much as you can 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.570
 play and do the same thing because 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 now again there are no goals in the game 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.940
 there is nothing that we should do simply 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 to infinity build a base I generally 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.699
 I donâ€™t see sense since then 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.850
 could find 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.410
 which garbage can 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.390
 used as fuel by the way looking for 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.300
 you can have energy but you can't eat 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 so first check what you can 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.590
 no and then say but so friends i 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.460
 I suggest just so calm here 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.140
 atmosphere move so say goodbye to 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.909
 play 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.869
 here and so just moving away from 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.640
 our base is down and no longer return to 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.490
 your base stay right here at the depth 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.560
 I think a decent farewell to the game 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 although there is no herbie now i'm going down 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 I don't want to, either, I won't die 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.030
 not enough not really not enough not 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.520
 my suit is so good 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.360
 go down I am already on the verge 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.460
 I am and the theater drift 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.680
 from one side to the other to 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 sad but by the way music fits 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 our atmosphere after all is goodbye 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 videos so the moisture will be short because 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.600
 that as soon as I run out of oxygen 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.409
 we are going to die and the base itself is no longer 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.100
 back, you know, I offer friends 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.220
 remember sky headlights 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.380
 as he was in the adventure kit 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.300
 have fun interesting forever giving 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.069
 to us for any hope that we are like 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.280
 you can quickly get a submarine 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.880
 sail away from here all the same darkness swam 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.620
 as I do not know, it turned out we have to dump 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:29.640
 bottom of the sea and get out to where we are 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 waiting for our beloved which is so careful and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.410
 carefully talked to us on the radio I 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.350
 I donâ€™t know how much I should 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.360
 to be a walkie-talkie what is so big under water 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.640
 depth to keep in touch with the land but not the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.760
 less friends continue to walk soon 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.170
 It seems we will die of hunger because our 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.480
 dude stubbornly dies dirt 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.100
 but we can never need 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.780
 that's why friends basically i don't know 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.700
 calm such a quiet atmosphere will hold 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.739
 these remaining minutes are farce sky 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.450
 because it's true what's next here 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.329
 make endless base build 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.720
 friends but it really bless me I beg you card 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:16.079
 here the principle is exactly the same as in 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.060
 move the chocks so again the meaning of 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.440
 run a few times again 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.420
 reach already I used to look then 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.790
 some letstpley and a long time ago 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.019
 for a long time just know he when some 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.430
 new game was coming out new year he immediately 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.640
 did on her video so I basically 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.410
 may be aware of what appeared 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.760
 Any new items like this can be on these 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.730
 games and make a video just to be 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.450
 in the course of everything so here are my friends 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.220
 Ainaz and life happen gradually and 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.980
 Actually what I want to say just 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.590
 this guy 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.269
 I played games several times and you know it 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.849
 looked very ridiculous and now 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.220
 I really feel like that 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.290
 I do this and that is just by 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.690
 several times I pass the same game 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.780
 it doesn't matter at all so i hope you 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.080
 do you understand me now i have 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.349
 a little bit pulled our death so as not to 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.560
 so fast die what kid started 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.540
 die of hunger but now we are 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.019
 correct eat raw fish right through 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:25.340
 spacesuits restore first life and 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:28.710
 and enjoy here oh and enjoy shorter 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.150
 so that the evil fish will kill us 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.680
 friends principle i don't know took clean 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.020
 this video that just had some reason 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.060
 complete this series of wars clips to this 9 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.770
 it was part of not mistaken that's why 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.090
 guys I really do not see further sense 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.430
 play thieves despite the fact that 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.389
 videos are collected normally views 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.729
 people like friends 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.620
 agree you already release through 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.510
 two will bother you 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.840
 infinity running collecting some 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.639
 resources I build a base and basically nothing 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.389
 it really doesn't happen except i 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:00.389
 I run along the bottom collecting everything therefore 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.220
 friends need better finish the game on 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.870
 peak when everything is interesting than already 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.490
 finish then when no one is 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.770
 wants to look and as far as it was with 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.470
 the fourth resident evil am that's why 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.750
 just let the project show 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.669
 respect for such an unpopular game but 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.020
 all the same 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.669
 we liked the game far sky therefore 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.550
 what do friends write in 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.710

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.200
 I still got a lot of nice 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.080
