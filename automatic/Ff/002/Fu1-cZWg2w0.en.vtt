 colorful sansung

 his original route to the attack 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 you will need to open it with the help of a stylus 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 it's a hammer 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.859
 he is stuck and that earthquake 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.859
 open serpa 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.910
 it is not difficult to repeat in Europe where primate is stuck with marten 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.280
 after releasing the ball takes a chance still 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220
 and loved it 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.100
 milan - 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.090
 will leave 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 cap 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.620
 after removing the cap from the cartridge you will find a gear 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.700
 this gear needs to be removed 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
 by the time 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.170
 hold the black cartridge base 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.420
 so that it is not removed 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 haiti personally in the network 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.500
 according to article 1 of the project the last six 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 will damage the internal system of dem 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.800
 after removing gear rating the hole cap 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.700
 Where do you put it there? 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 all around the world 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.649
 when picking up your style shake or sometimes to unzip 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.090
 it can be 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 after being easy 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.980
 this fear of being sealed to avoid the contamination of impunity 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.980
 in the tournament 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.769
 remove the sealing wax 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.769
 of the refill 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 after removing the sealing wax with its nest 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.719
 the siege to the pack 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.979
 like the building of campus 1 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.929
 and dump the content 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.649
 slowly 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.849
 because it is a very fine people 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.849
 and spreads easily 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.559
 we folks a little funnel to lower all the contents into the cartridge 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.439
 to clear 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 all the contents into the cartridge 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 thanks immediately the cartridge 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.709
 to avoid contamination 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 I just want 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.849
 clean the residue 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 replace the gear 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.039
 and to replace the cover 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.159
 exists with a pin on the difficult filmus cartridge on the cover 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.439
 jael should put it in a correct position 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.659
 place in the correct position 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.659
 and close the cartridge again. 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:07.819
 the pull lever the cartridge is aligned with the senior producer 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.249
 How do you say the newsletter? 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.930
 you close again 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.749
 the cartridge cover 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.749
 air 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.229
 steps only one and a half turns 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.680
 otherwise you will have difficulty 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.680
 to put the cadu 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.789
 Let's go with the case now. 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.339
 with the dead brothers 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.009
 each chip 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.009
 is your specific color 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.219
 This is a slower cartridge. 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.669
 you will receive a chip 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.539
 with the letter m 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.539
 remove adhesive fitout 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.550
 and the bottom of the cartridge 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.669
 you will find 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.769
 hole for perfect fit of chips 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.029
 in some cases this is summarized 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.220
 exist 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.930
 two families 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.930
 in the center of the cartridge to be cut 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.900
 cut the two alerts 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.150
 and let's put a chip 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.879
 there is a certain 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.539
 which should cost towards the center of the cartridge 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.650
 late withdrawal after removing alerts 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.969
 take the typical arrow pointing to the center of the cartridge 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.919
 and fit into the building 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:39.879
 now your cartridge is ready for use on the mech 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:46.799
 Good shopping
