through<00:01:03.130> pasta<00:01:03.489> machine<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.000> apply<00:01:04.479> some

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
through pasta machine and apply some

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.100 
through pasta machine and apply some
texture<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.140> to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.540 

voila<00:01:14.050> so<00:01:15.050> let's<00:01:15.290> place<00:01:15.590> all<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:16.040> beautiful

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
voila so let's place all this beautiful

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:25.980 
voila so let's place all this beautiful
pieces<00:01:16.790> aside<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.570> work<00:01:17.840> on<00:01:18.050> them<00:01:18.230> one<00:01:18.530> by<00:01:18.680> one

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.570 

start<00:01:26.990> with<00:01:27.170> cutting<00:01:27.380> out<00:01:27.650> many<00:01:28.070> colorful

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
start with cutting out many colorful

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.750 
start with cutting out many colorful
triangles

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.950 

the<00:01:34.660> sky<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.850> try<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.910> cut<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.420> place<00:01:37.780> my

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the sky I try to cut and place my

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.170 
the sky I try to cut and place my
triangles<00:01:38.470> at<00:01:38.620> the<00:01:38.740> same<00:01:38.950> time<00:01:39.220> but<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.880> didn't

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
triangles at the same time but it didn't

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.600 
triangles at the same time but it didn't
work<00:01:40.360> for<00:01:40.390> me<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.170> instead<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:41.830> decided<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.400> cut

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
work for me so instead I decided to cut

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.730 
work for me so instead I decided to cut
all<00:01:42.820> triangles<00:01:43.120> first<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.320> see<00:01:44.620> all

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
all triangles first so I can see all

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.090 
all triangles first so I can see all
shapes<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.250> combine<00:01:45.640> colors<00:01:46.000> correctly

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.560 

improvise<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.460> mosaic<00:01:53.760> and<00:01:54.000> assemble

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
improvise with your mosaic and assemble

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.520 
improvise with your mosaic and assemble
it<00:01:54.660> as<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.020> wish

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
it as you wish

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770 
it as you wish
don't<00:01:55.950> put<00:01:56.100> similar<00:01:56.460> colors<00:01:56.820> together<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.420> if

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
don't put similar colors together and if

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.540 
don't put similar colors together and if
you<00:01:57.810> can't<00:01:58.110> find<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:58.710> shape<00:01:59.010> make

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
you can't find the right shape make

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.680 
you can't find the right shape make
another<00:01:59.940> one<00:02:01.670> roll<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.820> client<00:02:03.180> back<00:02:03.330> into

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
another one roll your client back into

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.530 
another one roll your client back into
little<00:02:03.990> balls<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.470> put<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.830> aside<00:02:05.360> now<00:02:06.360> use

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
little balls and put it aside now use

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.090 
little balls and put it aside now use
your<00:02:06.690> knife<00:02:06.870> tool<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.320> start<00:02:07.590> cutting<00:02:07.830> out

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
your knife tool and start cutting out

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.970 
your knife tool and start cutting out
the<00:02:08.280> main<00:02:08.490> necklace<00:02:08.910> shape<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:13.500> want<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.830> make

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the main necklace shape we want to make

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.010 
the main necklace shape we want to make
leather<00:02:14.220> cutouts<00:02:14.700> more<00:02:14.970> holistic<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:15.840> they

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
leather cutouts more holistic as if they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.650 
leather cutouts more holistic as if they
are<00:02:16.050> sewn<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.740> brown<00:02:17.070> leather<00:02:17.340> dice

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
are sewn on the brown leather dice

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.000 
are sewn on the brown leather dice
that's<00:02:18.660> why<00:02:18.900> I'm<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> use<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> ball<00:02:19.770> tool

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that's why I'm going to use a ball tool

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.740 
that's why I'm going to use a ball tool
but<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.520> don't<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.850> one<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.570> use<00:02:21.600> a

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
but if you don't have one you can use a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.560 
but if you don't have one you can use a
toothpick<00:02:22.370> start<00:02:23.370> making<00:02:23.730> dots<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.240> edges

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
toothpick start making dots on the edges

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.660 
toothpick start making dots on the edges
of<00:02:24.720> your<00:02:24.750> triangles<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.459> take

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
of your triangles actually this can take

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.699 
of your triangles actually this can take
a<00:02:26.730> lot<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.090> time<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.810> realize<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.320> I

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
a lot of time and when I realize that I

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.050 
a lot of time and when I realize that I
started<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.250> look<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.400> different<00:02:29.910> solutions

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
started to look for different solutions

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.110 
started to look for different solutions
and<00:02:30.510> make<00:02:30.780> myself<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.320> hair<00:02:31.620> comb<00:02:31.830> tool<00:02:32.130> it's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and make myself a hair comb tool it's

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.300 
and make myself a hair comb tool it's
about<00:02:33.360> 10<00:02:33.630> times<00:02:33.900> faster<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.130> dots

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
about 10 times faster and all the dots

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.860 
about 10 times faster and all the dots
are<00:02:35.459> perfectly<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.030> line<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
are perfectly in line so it is

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.630 
are perfectly in line so it is
definitely<00:02:37.470> worth<00:02:37.620> breaking<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.459> your

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
definitely worth breaking one of your

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.430 
definitely worth breaking one of your
old<00:02:38.820> hair<00:02:39.060> combs<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> tool<00:02:40.020> like<00:02:40.170> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
old hair combs to have a tool like that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.949 
old hair combs to have a tool like that
so<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.610> last<00:02:41.760> thing<00:02:42.030> before<00:02:42.209> making<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.930> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
so the last thing before making is to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.810 
so the last thing before making is to
