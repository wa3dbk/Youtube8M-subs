00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.360
 good dari sonohra ba welcome in 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.450
 this new spotlight maybe from the item 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.570
 that in hand already understood what way you 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.720
 I'll talk today if you don't understand is the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.070
 portal gun one that we say is inspired by 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.780
 game leads to no who leads to 2 yes mi 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.059
 I'm a bit confused, however, leads to 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.010
 2 and it's a game I've never played but 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.199
 minus the various videos on youtube with these 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.269
 not having a brain to play with it 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.670
 I've never played it because I don't know if I am 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.159
 merit of a brain so if there is a 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.140
 brain life that I will play but for now 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.250
 not there still play then not 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:01.519
 I will know the items we say the objects 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.229
 but I know for example the turrets and e 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.680
 then the weapons and this armor in hand 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:11.869
 which would be the weapon that will make us create 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.009
 portals portal gun and now I hurt myself 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.850
 turrets then had with those the radio is 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.359
 there are some shoes I don't know what 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.549
 serve 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.740
 then there are other objects that I do to you 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.259
 see now look at linguists and jacket 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:34.609
 a cd the music you put in the box 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.159
 then we have these blocks that some 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:40.819
 I don't even know what they are and anyway 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.369
 now I show you the door to ghana 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.219
 these here instead the element turrets 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.399
 here are two different turrets now me 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:52.369
 it seems that one I don't remember 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.009
 Oh God, I do n't remember the difference 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.659
 then oh well, however these are useful 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:03.200
 because they make us believe lead to 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:05.140
 example I have now put the point there on 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.590
 dot the moviola 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.360
 and how I'm coming I'm seeing that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.520
 that we see that he flies for example 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.470
 the point that is now seen as it is set 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.430
 based on the top 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.330
 so we will see the clouds and now sun 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.470
 see which clouds anyway 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.270
 I have to replace it 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.100
 here now we see the tree anyway 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.580
 entering it inside only that makes me enter 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.270
 for those who do not let me enter the stock market not 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.440
 it lets me enter bump ok it's a real e 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 own portal because we exit from 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.900
 other part for example succeed at that 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.110
 Wall 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.500
 no no marking ventra here I am 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:03:00.040
 how to bomb your mind with these ci 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:02.080
 they are different colors and it's a lot of fun 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.030
 this time it is also very useful with 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.989
 data is getting higher and higher we are 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.040
 more and more the other ready I want to try 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:17.320
 one thing I put this here here 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.299
 and I put this one out of here 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.980
 this other part, however, video 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.980
 look at it point on cool 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.530
 no been in danger no no way out of here 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.480
 the light 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.850
 anyway the journey is over 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.630
 sorry if we have enough 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.870
 ignorant 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.790
 on this game but I wanted it right 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.650
 show you the mode by showing what 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.770
 adds you that you know portal 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.090
 however you already know what the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.959
 therefore useless objects that I make you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.980
 see how you know how they work 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:00.840
 another thing I want to tell you is that I don't 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.459
 I like neither the crafting methods because vi 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.470
 I suggest to use the mode and that seen 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.340
 which are many I recommend you to select 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.530
 mode that delinque description that for the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.530
 wanted 4.2 that they also make a video in 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.030
 future that is the mode that from the point of 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.609
 show the crafting methods themselves 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:25.020
 in game then base go to the sluyter 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.479
 and I'll show you how to treat it and it comes 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.910
 defined and see you at the next video 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.380
