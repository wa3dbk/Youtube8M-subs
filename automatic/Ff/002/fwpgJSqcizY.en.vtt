 It is quite possible books 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.419
 easy to format and still 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.349
 to insert the same much fun 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.349

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.699
 Let's get this program out of the 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.900
 minecraft forum download the link 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.970

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.259
 description, gold is just a little bit 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.390
 So far in the download 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.980
 section comes there you will find the latest 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.750
 version and we can do that in this 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.579
 just download here you have 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.320
 on about the advertising can wait 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.370
 you click on advertising skip and 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.039
 you will be downloaded the file 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.079
 after you download on dropbox on 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.060
 have clicked now lead in this case 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.040
 we just dj out and it opens 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.410
 a program and that is the one 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.880
 minecraft jason bourque generator 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.590
 First, we have here in this case 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.810
 We see a kind of file structure there 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.940
 for one the title the author as well 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.350
 the pages at the beginning we give the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.970
 first book a title and therefore 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 I call it the whole now, for example 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.440
 tutorial center also we insert 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.000
 car and there my minecraft in-game 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.860
 name is also tutorial center 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 namely the whole on tutorial center 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.979
 first you see here in the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.899
 file structure that is now title and author 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.030
 have been set and now in this 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.860
 case, we click on add on pages 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.450
 element and now have here in this 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.100
 case different possibilities so 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.869
 First of all, we need a text 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.850
 I now have my text here 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.319
 entered and can format it eg 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.450
 I do not want the tenth tutorial 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.679
 more in the standard color is but 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.539
 for example in a dark blue 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.009
 I also want to write 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.109
 that the text is written and 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.670
 that's why little bolt here i can do that 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.779
 whole course also italic or 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.880
 underline 

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:39.709
 but is quite interesting that 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.569
 cliq event and for that i get in now 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.249
 In this case click on event and have 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.779
 now here's the possibility of an action 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.520
 that means if you are now with 

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.259
 the mouse drives over it and then clicks 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.670
 leads to a command from in this case 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.130
 I have that set by one 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.049
 command and under value we carry now 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.770
 just run the command one of the out 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.450
 shall be 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.299
 and that's just as easy as 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.889
 empty place tutorial center creative if 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.479
 But we now the one who 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.340
 do not know which command is behind 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.289
 then want to help hide this text 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.390
 can we add a who went huber 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.979
 is handy if you're over the moon 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.230
 this text contains a command 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.819
 then you get one over 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.800
 small message and therefore click 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.780
 we here on change huber event and 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.910
 have now the possibility extra 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.650
 and now here in this 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.120
 case a text to write it must 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.350
 however, we do not stick to one text 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.420
 could also be easy 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.100
 riding man show we could be an end 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.050
 the ads or of course one 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.760
 Achievement of this, too, we can do 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.200
 Of course, a color set no 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.070
 problem and also fat one can do that 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.600
 of course 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.070
 Here you see the case now in this case 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.630
 action command real but simple 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.580
 ok and this will be us then 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.440
 automatically you inserted directly below 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.670
 These are the basic settings 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.140
 program is and now we want that 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.820
 all of course still in minecraft 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.350
 We simply copy them 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.060
 this command is down here 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.470
 located with control we mark 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 everything and with ctrg c we can do it 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.290
 just copy 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.000
 Now I am here in minecraft and also 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.410
 already directly in the command block menu of 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.940
 with a command blog deal with these 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.770
 command now of course takes too long 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.300
 long for the chats is hurry and now 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.580
 we just have to paste it with ctrl v 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.170
 click on then and then we need 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.640
 another button and then it can too 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.410
 get started with the happy one 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.450
 command blocks clique before we do 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.580
 get a slot free again and get it 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.500
 Now here's a book called this book 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.360
 himself tutorial center and was from 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.060
 tutorial center is written and even 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.220
 an original open we will see it once 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.400
 We have exactly this text that we set 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.190
 have old total centers completely stupid 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.650
 ok so the text is of course more creative 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.420
 you see the couvert event so if we 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.100
 drive the mouse over this text 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.320
 in this case, that's game 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.940
 Change fashion in bolt in gold and exactly 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.630
 we have set that now, however 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.490
 we want the whole course 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.290
 Just try it out here 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.330
 click and you see we are in 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.250
 creative mode and the command was 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.930
 perfectly executed we can 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.000
 Of course, more elements at any time 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.590
 Just add pages for that 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.570
 element and then we have in here 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.860
 In this case, for example, just page 2 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.590
 and if this is exactly the same here 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.240
 do it again and now for example others 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.020
 to set things for this program 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.670
 In any case, very much 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.590
 more extensive in this case it went 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.850
 but only about the rough functionalities 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.140
 I hope you invite the whole 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.610
 Just once in the link is in fact 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.200
 in the video description the program 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.700
 is very practical and then thank you 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.100
 I watch for you if you want 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.870
 you can still look at what 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.790
 happens when you minecraft with the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.140
 Reality comparison the video is to 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.400
 otherwise here links otherwise wishes 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.180
