00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.550
 Zdarova men and also home in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.950
 commentary cutting today sat down yam 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.870
 that is, logs sail niru yu champions 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 the world in the eSports team 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.930
 hellraisers hello alexey everyone 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.300
 hi overcame now we will become 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.369
 witness brief not infinite 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.810
 intense confrontation team you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.820
 choke who has no 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.550
 relationship to warhammer 40k this guys from 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.410
 goblin slippers and some hut and Hawks 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.399
 that's the world what can you say about 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 stages of the team and the initial junction but 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.350
 if you analyze the original with 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.930
 stages and a picture accordingly 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.559
 combat can easily assume that the team 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.870
 can go both on the left side and 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.620
 on the right side respectively clans 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 chok chooses what to go to the left 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 side and square and butting in squares 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.989
 b 1 c 1 d because there they have the most 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.539
 advantageous position for positional 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.400
 shootout on to completely agree 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.320
 chok team went to the left flank in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 mainly because their court of law consists 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.580
 most of the heavy tanks with 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 quite large alpha and with 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 inaccurate gun melissa 3 everyone knows what 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.009
 such represents itself from 3 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.900
 so they decided to fall in the city 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.520
 for a short look at close range 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.820
 how wonderful this cam looks and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.220
 land in the third squared g3 g5 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.170
 hid amx 50100 this is 32 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.790
 respectively 132 in the amount of three 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 pieces and two 50100 will not enter into battle 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.079
 a little later and look here 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.520
 are discovered play hawks pro hut 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.180
 what is not found near 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.100
 its base 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.020
 explain why they are there why they 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.670
 did not begin to play actively attack why 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.560
 they decided the curse it seems to me 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.659
 most likely because the tanks were 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.829
 divided they rode all over the map and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.070
 then you can see by 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.079
 amx-13 90 who shone through the center and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.540
 began to catch up to their main 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.500
 impact force can also be noticed that in 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.170
 square c1 c2 are tanks and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 they go skating center 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.549
 respectively sb fox want to hold in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.229
 food team fok now viewers can 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.300
 watch on their screens as a group 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.400
 t30 daughters begin to approach the place 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.280
 main encounter fights guards 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.060
 I think this is exactly the players clans choke and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 conceived 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.430
 first the main group breaks in on the left 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 after which you are 3250 stop closer 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.959
 and clamp close the ring 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.510
 but here the ring did not close and 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.970
 it turns out something random and tell me 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.489
 that's what you think of the tricks act on 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.829
 situations are adapted perry after all 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.150
 it was originally intended as something 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.010
 defensive as defensive 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.609
 tactic when the enemy pass inside 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.650
 then 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.140
 clamped in a ring near its own 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.319
 flag do you think the world seems to me that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.760
 This is still a game on the situation because with 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.680
 and did not expect such rapid 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.430
 Russia in the face of the team 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.370
 god and they decided to play precisely by 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.010
 situations even adapt to this time 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.989
 I agree because despite the fact that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.670
 both teams are cunning both teams are trying 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.439
 fool each other constantly 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.450
 pulls up some kind of reinforcement from 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.030
 from nowhere the fight still looks equal 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.069
 account 88 and that's just now thanks 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.900
 wonderful street focus 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.329
 personal skill and rather even 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.639
 tactics than strategists literally on 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.579
 the final stage of the battle guys from the clan 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.500
 namely slipper goblin pull run about 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.510
 it would seem a few more 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.299
 seconds ago was almost equal 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.220
 par 88 why is she now 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.560
 turn your eyes into full 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.419
 the defeat of sin does not pour as you think 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.519
 why due to the fact that light tanks 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.099
 both teams from the start described 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.139
 picture of the battlefield to mount both clans already 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.720
 knew that they would meet their opponent in 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.760
 but they didnâ€™t know exactly where 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.859
 it all depended on who was faster and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.560
 more effectively adapts to the current 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.180
 situations the guys from the clan deadlock were 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.659
 smarter and one step ahead 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.879
 so the victory and got them Well Well 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.310
