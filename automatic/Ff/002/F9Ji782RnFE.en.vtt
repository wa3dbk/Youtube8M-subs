00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.440
 let's put 4 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.910
 but it's the same subject I do not know the same 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.910
 configuration with 1.2 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.910
 in which I pray 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.700

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.400
 Manute good settings 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:23.330
 graphic and you in rendering of 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.790
 rendering distance the rapporteur or 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.580

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:44.169
 50 and the soft mention in off 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.830
