00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.479 
see a look using those type of colors
but<00:00:58.079> since<00:00:58.289> most<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:58.800> shades<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.190> usually

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
fashion taking a light color and

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.780 
fashion taking a light color and
placement<00:02:32.469> literally<00:02:32.769> all<00:02:32.980> over<00:02:33.010> because

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
placement literally all over because

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.670 
placement literally all over because
even<00:02:34.450> if<00:02:34.540> I'm<00:02:34.629> using<00:02:34.750> an<00:02:35.019> eyeshadow<00:02:35.170> primer

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
even if I'm using an eyeshadow primer

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.679 
even if I'm using an eyeshadow primer
this<00:02:36.189> allows<00:02:36.459> all<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.760> other<00:02:36.969> shadows<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.480> I

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
this allows all the other shadows that I

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.229 
this allows all the other shadows that I
place<00:02:37.989> on<00:02:38.170> my<00:02:38.260> lips<00:02:38.530> blends<00:02:39.040> better<00:02:39.310> just

place on my lips blends better just

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.849 
place on my lips blends better just
because<00:02:40.390> they<00:02:40.599> have<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> dryer<00:02:41.140> smoother

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
because they have a dryer smoother

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.160 
because they have a dryer smoother
silkier<00:02:42.430> surface<00:02:42.909> sometimes<00:02:43.629> if<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.870> apply

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
silkier surface sometimes if you apply

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.809 
silkier surface sometimes if you apply
your<00:02:44.379> shadow<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:45.040> top<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.459> an<00:02:45.549> eyeshadow

primer<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.659> grabs<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.260> sticks<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.859> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
primer it just grabs and sticks to the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.979 
primer it just grabs and sticks to the
point<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.609> you<00:02:48.730> can't<00:02:48.969> blend<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.299> out<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.959> a
