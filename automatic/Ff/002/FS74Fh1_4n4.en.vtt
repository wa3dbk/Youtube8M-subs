00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:18.140
 henke turn give advice 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.820
 Everything we have been familiar with for years 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.410
 But I can tell you there 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.200
 it makes huge differences 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.939
 We will be the way as technology and 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.800
 innovation leaders in the future 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:36.949
 continue and I think it will be 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:39.320
 Today you will experience impressive technology 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.539
 I'm already experiencing tomorrow today 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.820
 really exclusive events 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.339
 invited and one has namely in 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.510
 apron of iaa international 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.510
 Journalists loaded to Germany 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.019
 I dream I'll say it exactly 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.449
 just the individual innovations too 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.539
 to feel driven in real time 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.539
 can 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.060
 international journalists is always 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.399
 again surprisingly large over 70,000 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.520
 Endingen employees in 26 countries 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.250
 Innovations for the car industry clear 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.250
 that you also manage the group 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.399
 on - site presentations is technology for 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.470
 touch technology to experience technology too 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.090
 feel that is what it matters 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.560
 this event here makes it 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 a huge amount of hand the why 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.319
 Do you actually operate in the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.610
 the apron of iaa in september we want 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.500
 Of course journalists have the opportunity 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.619
 Give our products ours 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.229
 to learn the complete portfolio of zf and 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.630
 also to understand and that is a very 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.369
 Wide range of products we have 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.380
 the drivetrain products all the way to 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.450
 the drive train system we have but 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.579
 also the suspension so that we ours 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.100
 entire portfolio in the sense of 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.130
 mobility and in the sense of efficiency 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.509
 can use the car year 2013 is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.519
 important for zf how many 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.620
 differences in relation to today 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.660
 future technology will be like this 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.519
 concerns lightweight construction of new one's use 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.280
 of new materials use of new ones 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.700
 conception and design principles as well 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.530
 as the structure of the drive train in 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.090
 the transition phase electrification until 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.090
 for purely electrical drive 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.040
 with these cars it goes straight to the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.390
 test track you could believe zf has 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.510
 the test car departments of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.920
 premium manufacturer cleared whether 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.939
 hybrid drive 7 can be manual gearbox 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.159
 activity regulation with motorcycles the 8 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.319
 gear automatic transmission in brand new 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.930
 jaguar s-type but if you ask me 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.970
 whether I have the chic jack or this 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.209
 edgy fellows would take 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.109
 this is a true prototype with 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.139
 Electric drive that you can here too 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.780
 actually experience like the new 9 gang 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:05.099
 automatic transmission that here in the range rover 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.099
 evoque depends on the distance 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:20.260
 motion and mobility north where can you 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.590
 to notice that better than on the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.709
 mountain station of zf from the compact like that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.769
 bmw 1er up to heavy suv mercedes ml 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.959
 and nissan infiniti in which i am now 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.950
 Seats can be used by zf 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.950
 try out 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.219
 that brings pleasure was very great because 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.219
 it right here 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.700
 hidden between electric drive 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.129
 gearboxes and steering solutions still have 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.290
 something little fine almost revolutionary 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.269
 Discover the times in which 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.729
 Boat owners do not park in reverse 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.370
 could just get out and with that 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.570
 smartphone or tablet the team 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:31.250
 steer from the outside and pack perfectly 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:36.950
 unbelievable in pretty excited and it 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.389
 is a bit of science fiction to the 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.669
 At the station we offer the journalist 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.960
 insight into the topic cdc continuous 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.000
 damping control 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.190
 Here is the insulation continuous 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.930
 know lingenfeld pretended and thus 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.680
 always to the vehicle situation 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.680
 customized 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.430
 read 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.580
 athletic impressive and I was happy 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.590
 that was little traffic and then comes 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.520
 know again 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:16.300
 clack clack clack I'm even aware 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:18.160
 seventh gear came along with me 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.470
 an absolute world novelty with the 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.470
 new gear automatic transmission from zf 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.360
 My fear with nine gears that 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.950
 the horse like a stepless 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.360
 automatic cvt they are complete 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.210
 it really is scattered 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.120
 beautiful stages automatic so expires 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:48.730
 what the best front automatic transmission 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:51.340
 I also electrification on the topic 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.410
 shows zf here in key field the whole 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.930
 range of its developments in 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.740
 many series hybrid models is 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.550
 the zf technology hid in vw jetta im 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.350
 audi q5 and the bmw 5er on board here 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.810
 eight transition area the onion on 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.300
 Button pressure it in the E mode and so can 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.630
 to up to four kilometers if it be 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.940
 must drive up to 60 km h 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.860
 electrically but that's a lot 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.550
 yes not or 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.360
 that's why there is not much 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.360
 been strong 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.070
 amazingly dynamic so the vehicle 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:36.470
 has very good performance 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.470
 July took place after electronic 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.730
 So on board szf prototypes one asks 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.860
 why is he more ? 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.340
 Electric vehicles are out in the streets 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.190
 one comes daily 120 kilometers one man 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.140
 drives the technology locally without emissions 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.830
 is absolutely mature you still have 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.620
 lane 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.840
 if the thing is going right and forward 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.180
 Electromobility will also be 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.910
 cheaper than zf can this package in 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.000
 principle to supply each manufacturer and 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:11.560
 Immediately install so motion and 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.560
 mobility for everyone
