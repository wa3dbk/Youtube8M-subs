00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
up for all the water 2,000 pounds and it

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.120 
up for all the water 2,000 pounds and it
wouldn't<00:03:09.890> flip<00:03:10.100> over<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:11.680> ruling<00:03:12.680> start

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
wouldn't flip over the ruling start

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.100 
wouldn't flip over the ruling start
tilting<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.700> little<00:03:13.850> bit<00:03:14.300> because<00:03:14.570> my<00:03:14.930> high

tilting a little bit because my high
with<00:03:15.380> liberty<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:19.070> way<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.519> works<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.450> the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
with liberty and the way it works is the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.440 
with liberty and the way it works is the
bottom<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.070> up<00:03:22.610> like<00:03:23.330> rats

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
bottom of it up like rats

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.559

our<00:03:25.959> sensor<00:03:26.650> film<00:03:26.980> up<00:03:27.099> with<00:03:27.310> water<00:03:27.569> they

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
our sensor film up with water they

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.990 
our sensor film up with water they
really<00:03:28.810> you'll<00:03:29.200> only<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.860> taking<00:03:30.280> over<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.849> if

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
really you'll only be taking over and if

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.699 
really you'll only be taking over and if
they<00:03:31.209> go<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.720> side<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.110> we'll<00:03:32.290> come<00:03:32.470> back

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
they go to the side and we'll come back

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.660 
they go to the side and we'll come back
up<00:03:32.920> like<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:34.590> punching<00:03:35.590> bags<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.280> one

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
holes right there with the water we fill

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.190 
holes right there with the water we fill
up<00:03:48.730> in<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:51.099> main<00:03:51.340> part<00:03:51.760> of<00:03:51.910> it

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
up in it and this is the main part of it

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.070 
up in it and this is the main part of it
where<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.470> astronauts<00:03:54.400> were<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.180> people

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
where the astronauts were the people

where the astronauts were the people
inside<00:03:56.440> of<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.739> life<00:03:56.950> raft<00:03:57.280> would<00:03:57.459> stay<00:03:57.819> and

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
inside of the life raft would stay and

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.759 
inside of the life raft would stay and
survive<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:01.180> wouldn't<00:04:01.690> tip<00:04:01.870> over<00:04:02.410> at<00:04:02.560> all

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
survive it wouldn't tip over at all

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.580 
survive it wouldn't tip over at all
because<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.250> its<00:04:06.480> malice<00:04:07.480> system<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.410> only

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
because of its malice system it only

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.000 
because of its malice system it only
takes<00:04:08.860> 30<00:04:09.250> seconds<00:04:09.849> for<00:04:10.030> football<00:04:10.480> 30<00:04:11.470> seconds

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
takes 30 seconds for football 30 seconds

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.640 
takes 30 seconds for football 30 seconds
or<00:04:12.220> less<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:13.090> fill<00:04:13.269> out<00:04:13.420> lavella<00:04:13.780> system<00:04:14.349> with

or less to fill out lavella system with

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.090 
or less to fill out lavella system with
water<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:16.150> fills<00:04:16.479> up<00:04:16.690> in<00:04:17.200> 30<00:04:17.530> seconds<00:04:17.979> or

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
water and it fills up in 30 seconds or

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.700 
water and it fills up in 30 seconds or
left<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.609> fills<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:20.040> 2,000<00:04:21.040> pounds<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.489> water

left it fills up 2,000 pounds of water

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:32.410 
left it fills up 2,000 pounds of water
so<00:04:23.710> we'll<00:04:24.240> start<00:04:25.240> tilting<00:04:25.990> over<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:28.200> flip

it<00:04:32.840> only<00:04:33.080> takes<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:34.600> there<00:04:35.600> are<00:04:35.890> 450<00:04:36.890> people

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
it only takes it there are 450 people

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.250 
it only takes it there are 450 people
alive<00:04:37.760> today<00:04:37.790> because<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:38.930> NASA

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
are my proof that this is the best NASA
