00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.740 
going to start sending the data so any
second<00:01:41.910> now<00:01:41.940> let's<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.270> what's<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.630> my

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
second now let's see what's all my

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.640 
second now let's see what's all my
handheld<00:01:43.050> is<00:01:43.320> also<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.920> big<00:01:44.130> screen

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.480 

here<00:01:48.190> we<00:01:48.310> go<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.090> can<00:01:49.240> now

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.210 

wrong<00:01:52.119> but<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:53.710> now<00:01:53.799> start<00:01:53.979> navigating

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
wrong but I can now start navigating

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.860 
wrong but I can now start navigating
through<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.790> slides

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
through the slides

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.150 
through the slides
see<00:01:57.140> what's<00:01:57.320> happening<00:01:57.680> in<00:01:57.830> both<00:01:57.950> places<00:01:58.660> so

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
see what's happening in both places so

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.400 
see what's happening in both places so
we<00:02:01.160> actually<00:02:01.310> support<00:02:01.850> 55<00:02:02.390> transitions<00:02:02.990> and

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
we actually support 55 transitions and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.230 
we actually support 55 transitions and
24<00:02:04.010> animations<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:04.580> that's<00:02:04.760> most<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.150> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
24 animations so that's most of the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.450 
24 animations so that's most of the
powerpoint<00:02:05.690> functionality<00:02:06.350> as<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.340> would

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
powerpoint functionality as you would

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.560 
powerpoint functionality as you would
expect<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.940> something<00:02:08.270> that's<00:02:08.420> a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
expect in something that's a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.000 
expect in something that's a
presentation<00:02:09.140> tool<00:02:09.290> we<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.590> bunch<00:02:09.860> of

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
presentation tool we have a bunch of

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.160 
presentation tool we have a bunch of
features<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.790> would<00:02:10.850> expect<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.810> blank

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
features you would expect like blank

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.200 
features you would expect like blank
screen<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.250> can<00:02:13.340> blank<00:02:13.700> what's<00:02:13.910> being<00:02:14.120> shown

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
screen so I can blank what's being shown

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.750 
screen so I can blank what's being shown
on<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.510> big<00:02:14.660> screen<00:02:14.960> switch<00:02:15.380> slides<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.220> then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
on the big screen switch slides and then

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.970 
on the big screen switch slides and then
go<00:02:16.850> back<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> showing<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:18.410> have<00:02:18.590> fries

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
go back to showing it we have fries

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.040 
go back to showing it we have fries
feature<00:02:19.280> which<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.970> very<00:02:20.420> much<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.720> same<00:02:20.870> but

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
feature which is very much the same but

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.320 
feature which is very much the same but
keeps<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.350> slide<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.830> screen<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.150> show

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
keeps the slide on screen we have show

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.460 
keeps the slide on screen we have show
speaker<00:02:23.690> notes<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:23.990> i<00:02:24.020> can<00:02:24.170> actually<00:02:24.410> be

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
speaker notes so i can actually be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.810 
speaker notes so i can actually be
looking<00:02:24.710> at<00:02:24.800> my<00:02:24.860> speaker<00:02:25.160> notes<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.610> hand

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
looking at my speaker notes on the hand

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.880 
looking at my speaker notes on the hand
towel<00:02:26.030> while<00:02:26.720> navigating<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.320> presentation

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
towel while navigating the presentation

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.590 
towel while navigating the presentation
so<00:02:28.040> if<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.190> ever<00:02:28.280> lose<00:02:28.460> your<00:02:28.610> spot<00:02:28.880> or<00:02:29.240> forget

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
so if you ever lose your spot or forget

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.360 
so if you ever lose your spot or forget
what<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.840> say<00:02:29.990> next<00:02:30.170> now<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.950> don't<00:02:31.190> have<00:02:31.250> to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
what to say next now you don't have to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.950 
what to say next now you don't have to
be<00:02:31.940> embarrassed<00:02:32.030> about<00:02:32.390> looking<00:02:32.690> your<00:02:32.840> notes

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
be embarrassed about looking your notes

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.590 
be embarrassed about looking your notes
because<00:02:33.140> nobody'll<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.710> you<00:02:33.830> are<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:35.360> last

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
because nobody'll know you are and last

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.510 
because nobody'll know you are and last
but<00:02:35.720> certainly<00:02:35.840> not<00:02:36.230> least<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.980> feature

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
but certainly not least is a feature

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.430 
but certainly not least is a feature
that's<00:02:37.760> really<00:02:38.330> useful<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.080> scenario<00:02:39.230> like

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
that's really useful in a scenario like

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.950 
that's really useful in a scenario like
this<00:02:39.590> at<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.860> trade<00:02:40.100> show<00:02:40.130> loop<00:02:41.120> presentation

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
this at a trade show loop presentation

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.630 
this at a trade show loop presentation
so<00:02:42.170> what<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.320> allows<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.890> do<00:02:43.130> is

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
so what that allows you to do is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.010 
so what that allows you to do is
actually<00:02:43.850> set<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.210> time<00:02:44.480> interval<00:02:44.720> between

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
actually set a time interval between

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.740 
actually set a time interval between
slides<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:45.980> case<00:02:46.220> three<00:02:46.520> seconds<00:02:46.970> let's

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
slides in this case three seconds let's

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.060 
slides in this case three seconds let's
see<00:02:47.840> in<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.930> second<00:02:48.260> my<00:02:48.440> presentation<00:02:48.980> will

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
see in a second my presentation will

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.100 
see in a second my presentation will
restart<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.610> big<00:02:49.760> screen<00:02:50.090> every<00:02:50.870> three

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
restart on the big screen every three

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.100 
restart on the big screen every three
seconds<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.530> will<00:02:51.590> change<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:52.070> can<00:02:52.370> now<00:02:52.490> put<00:02:52.790> my

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
seconds it will change I can now put my

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.870 
seconds it will change I can now put my
blackberry<00:02:54.110> away<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:55.190> my<00:02:55.280> presentation<00:02:55.790> will

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
blackberry away and my presentation will

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.540 
blackberry away and my presentation will
continue<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.390> loop
