I'm not done yet this automate we're
doing<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.180> really<00:02:05.600> really<00:02:05.750> well<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:08.259> I'm

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
doing this really really well so I'm

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:40.080 
doing this really really well so I'm
going<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.470> open<00:02:09.619> up<00:02:09.920> my<00:02:10.209> toy<00:02:11.920> which<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:12.950> white

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.130 

and<00:02:41.640> she's<00:02:42.640> starting<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.209> get<00:02:43.390> different<00:02:43.840> look

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140

and she's starting to get different look
but<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.250> looks<00:02:45.550> unnatural<00:02:46.030> right<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.430> would

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
but it looks unnatural right so I would

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:58.559 
but it looks unnatural right so I would
take<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.959> wake<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.410> up

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.059 
and we're not doing the whole face but

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
you see how that sort of softens

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.399 
you see how that sort of softens
everything<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:11.180> gives<00:03:11.390> her<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.870> illusion<00:03:11.959> and

her lips a little wider

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:42.460 
her lips a little wider
I<00:03:27.530> would<00:03:27.920> work<00:03:28.640> outside<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.780> going<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.319> little

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
I would work outside and going a little

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:50.420 
I would work outside and going a little
below

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:00.920 

and<00:03:50.939> then<00:03:51.060> if<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.269> fill<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.689> all<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.989> end

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.500 

one<00:04:01.500> way<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.769> make<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.790> look<00:04:03.000> more<00:04:03.180> plump<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:05.510> to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
one way to make it look more plump is to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.020 
one way to make it look more plump is to
put<00:04:06.720> some<00:04:06.900> white<00:04:07.140> in<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.099> center<00:04:08.310> on<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
put some white in the center on the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.960 
put some white in the center on the
bottom<00:04:09.540> lip<00:04:12.470> white<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.739> great<00:04:14.190> for<00:04:14.549> lots<00:04:14.819> of

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
bottom lip white is great for lots of

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:34.860 
bottom lip white is great for lots of
different<00:04:15.299> things

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.550 

so<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.620> gives<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.160> good<00:04:36.610> look<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:37.260> them<00:04:38.260> being

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
so that gives a good look of them being

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:51.510 
so that gives a good look of them being
even<00:04:38.889> work

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:04.080 

this<00:04:53.400> would<00:04:54.400> take<00:04:54.639> out<00:04:54.879> of<00:04:54.990> wax<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:02.229> not<00:05:02.849> be<00:05:03.849> so

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
this would take out of wax and not be so

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.330 
this would take out of wax and not be so
gross<00:05:06.150> just<00:05:07.150> cream<00:05:07.539> makeup<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.259> and<00:05:09.129> not

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
gross just cream makeup and and not

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.790 
gross just cream makeup and and not
really<00:05:09.699> being<00:05:09.909> three-dimensional<00:05:10.379> if<00:05:11.379> I<00:05:11.620> only

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
really being three-dimensional if I only

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.700 
really being three-dimensional if I only
give<00:05:12.129> her<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.310> bruise<00:05:12.669> let's<00:05:13.120> say<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.720> moved<00:05:14.440> like

blood doesn't break okay and it looks a
little<00:05:40.330> red<00:05:40.569> and<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:41.740> don't<00:05:42.009> want<00:05:42.280> this<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.849> be

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
little red and you don't want this to be

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.709 
little red and you don't want this to be
even<00:05:43.509> if<00:05:44.110> I<00:05:44.560> were<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.860> paint<00:05:45.219> this<00:05:45.400> on<00:05:45.729> her<00:05:46.180> if

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
even if I were to paint this on her if

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:51.209 
even if I were to paint this on her if
we<00:05:46.960> can<00:05:47.139> look<00:05:47.349> right<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:48.690> I<00:05:49.690> am<00:05:50.080> creating<00:05:50.650> for

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219
