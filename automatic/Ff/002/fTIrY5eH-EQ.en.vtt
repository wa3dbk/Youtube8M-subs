what<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.180> buy<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.230> let's<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.860> simple

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
what do I buy so let's make this simple

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459 
what do I buy so let's make this simple
let's<00:00:38.489> break<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:38.940> real<00:00:39.329> simple<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
let's break this down real simple the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.040 
let's break this down real simple the
dual<00:00:40.920> action<00:00:41.190> try<00:00:41.640> x-series<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.719> are

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
dual action try x-series these are

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.490 
dual action try x-series these are
essentially<00:00:43.860> we've<00:00:44.550> taken<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.210> default<00:00:45.780> PCB

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
essentially we've taken the default PCB

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.979 
essentially we've taken the default PCB
the<00:00:46.770> reference<00:00:47.219> design<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.789> AMD<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.660> we

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the reference design from AMD and we

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.200 
the reference design from AMD and we
said<00:00:49.200> yeah<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> nice<00:00:50.100> bill<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
said yeah this is a nice bill but the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
said yeah this is a nice bill but the
coolers<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.750> good<00:00:51.930> enough<00:00:52.170> throwing<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
coolers not good enough throwing that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
coolers not good enough throwing that
away<00:00:53.190> put<00:00:53.730> our<00:00:53.850> own<00:00:53.879> cooler<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.379> dual

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
away put our own cooler on it now dual

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
away put our own cooler on it now dual
extra<00:00:56.129> tri-x<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:56.789> tell<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.210> many<00:00:57.270> fans

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
extra tri-x will tell you how many fans

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.260 
extra tri-x will tell you how many fans
are<00:00:57.930> involved<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> simple<00:00:59.789> heat

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
are involved but this is a simple heat

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.380 
are involved but this is a simple heat
pipe<00:01:00.539> cooler<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.230> anybody's<00:01:01.829> used<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> using

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
pipe cooler like anybody's used to using

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
pipe cooler like anybody's used to using
so<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> good<00:01:03.780> reference<00:01:04.019> design<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> heat

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
so a good reference design with a heat

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.730 
so a good reference design with a heat
pipe<00:01:05.369> cooler<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.299> keeps<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.869> cost<00:01:07.170> really

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
pipe cooler this keeps the cost really

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
pipe cooler this keeps the cost really
close<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> standard<00:01:08.670> reference<00:01:08.909> cost<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
close to a standard reference cost and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
close to a standard reference cost and
gives<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> same<00:01:10.979> performance<00:01:11.460> with

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
gives you the same performance with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020 
gives you the same performance with
cooler<00:01:12.210> quieter<00:01:12.659> operation<00:01:13.549> but<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
cooler quieter operation but what if you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990 
cooler quieter operation but what if you
want<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> bit<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> yet<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.640> need

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
want a bit more what if you yet you need

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
want a bit more what if you yet you need
to<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> little<00:01:18.390> cooler<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> little

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to be a little cooler and a little

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.080 
to be a little cooler and a little
quieter<00:01:19.710> than<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.159> well<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:20.640> where<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
quieter than that well that's where the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.840 
quieter than that well that's where the
vapor<00:01:21.360> x<00:01:21.689> comes<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:23.009> take<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.580> add

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
vapor x comes in we take and we add

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.090 
vapor x comes in we take and we add
vapor<00:01:24.119> chamber<00:01:24.479> technology<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> actual

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
vapor chamber technology to the actual

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
vapor chamber technology to the actual
cooler<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> reduces<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> heat<00:01:27.750> further

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
cooler so this reduces the heat further

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.249 
cooler so this reduces the heat further
allows<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.280> even<00:01:29.759> quieter<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.420> then

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
allows it to be even quieter and then

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.690 
allows it to be even quieter and then
with<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> high-end<00:01:32.220> stuff<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.579> do

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
with some of the high-end stuff we do

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
with some of the high-end stuff we do
extra<00:01:33.090> features<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.990> take<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> PCB<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
extra features like we take the PCB and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
extra features like we take the PCB and
redesign<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.180> we've<00:01:36.780> been<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> chip<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.680> we

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
redesign it or we've been the chip so we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.170 
redesign it or we've been the chip so we
get<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.070> better<00:01:38.250> overclocked<00:01:38.909> from

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
get a little better overclocked from

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.899 
get a little better overclocked from
them<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> case<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> our<00:01:40.110> 290<00:01:40.619> 290x<00:01:41.189> we

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
them or in the case of our 290 290x we

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.800 
them or in the case of our 290 290x we
actually<00:01:42.509> added<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.229> PCB<00:01:44.070> cooler<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> so

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
actually added a PCB cooler to it so

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.330 
actually added a PCB cooler to it so
essentially<00:01:46.439> when<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> buy<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
essentially when you go to buy what you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
essentially when you go to buy what you
have<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> decide<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> need<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> save<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
have to decide is do I need to save a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.319 
have to decide is do I need to save a
little<00:01:49.829> money<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.369> good<00:01:50.610> performance<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
little money get good performance and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.899 
little money get good performance and
fairly<00:01:51.689> quiet<00:01:51.960> operation<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.310> want<00:01:53.520> much

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
fairly quiet operation or do I want much

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
fairly quiet operation or do I want much
quieter<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.509> cooler<00:01:54.810> operation<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.590> spend

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
quieter and cooler operation and spend

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.670 
quieter and cooler operation and spend
thirty<00:01:56.250> forty<00:01:56.640> dollars<00:01:56.939> more<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.899> choice<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
thirty forty dollars more the choice is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.190 
thirty forty dollars more the choice is
really<00:01:59.250> based<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.780> budget

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
really based on the need and the budget

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
really based on the need and the budget
that's<00:02:01.500> available<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.850> offer<00:02:03.000> two

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that's available now we do offer two

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.319 
that's available now we do offer two
other<00:02:03.630> well<00:02:04.049> one<00:02:04.409> other<00:02:05.149> selection<00:02:06.149> and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
other well one other selection and

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.199 
other well one other selection and
that's<00:02:06.600> our<00:02:06.780> special<00:02:07.409> models<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.670> example<00:02:09.090> we

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that's our special models for example we

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's our special models for example we
have<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.569> ultimate<00:02:09.750> which<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> completely

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
have the ultimate which is a completely

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.720 
have the ultimate which is a completely
fanless<00:02:11.910> cooler

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
fanless cooler

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.580 
fanless cooler
and<00:02:12.819> then<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.239> have<00:02:13.390> our<00:02:13.510> ITX<00:02:14.080> card<00:02:14.409> which<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and then we have our ITX card which is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.640 
and then we have our ITX card which is
small<00:02:15.099> form-factor<00:02:15.489> card<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:17.170> you've<00:02:17.470> got<00:02:17.500> a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
small form-factor card so you've got a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.020 
small form-factor card so you've got a
lot<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:17.920> options<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.640> that's<00:02:18.790> what<00:02:18.909> we've

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
lot of options and that's what we've

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.490 
lot of options and that's what we've
tried<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.269> do<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.480> make<00:02:19.810> sure<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.260> gamer

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
tried to do is make sure that the gamer

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.490 
tried to do is make sure that the gamer
has<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.980> options<00:02:21.549> he<00:02:21.909> needs<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:23.049> pick<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
has the options he needs to pick the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.080 
has the options he needs to pick the
card<00:02:23.739> that's<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.069> perfect<00:02:24.370> fit<00:02:24.790> for<00:02:24.819> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
card that's the perfect fit for the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.479 
card that's the perfect fit for the
build<00:02:25.299> he<00:02:25.480> wants<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> do<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.280> some

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
build he wants to do so on the on some

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.960 
build he wants to do so on the on some
of<00:02:27.549> these<00:02:27.610> cards<00:02:27.909> we<00:02:28.239> saw<00:02:28.480> some<00:02:28.750> exposed<00:02:29.970> pcs

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
of these cards we saw some exposed pcs

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.869 
of these cards we saw some exposed pcs
mx-5s<00:02:31.420> copper<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:32.860> 290<00:02:33.670> and

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
mx-5s copper so on the on the 290 and

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.949 
mx-5s copper so on the on the 290 and
290x<00:02:34.349> vapor-x<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.849> have<00:02:37.060> done<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.629> and

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
290x vapor-x what we have done is and

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.289 
290x vapor-x what we have done is and
you<00:02:38.470> guys<00:02:38.620> will<00:02:38.799> have<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> close-up<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.150> this

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
you guys will have a close-up of this

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.899 
you guys will have a close-up of this
I'm<00:02:40.540> sure<00:02:40.810> what<00:02:41.799> we<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.129> done<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.549> we've

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
I'm sure what we have done is we've

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.809 
I'm sure what we have done is we've
actually<00:02:43.120> exposed<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.959> copper<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.489> core

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
actually exposed the copper in the core

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.990 
actually exposed the copper in the core
of<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:46.060> PCB<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.079> put<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.349> heat<00:02:47.560> sink<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.220> now

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
of the PCB and put a heat sink on it now

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.960 
of the PCB and put a heat sink on it now
this<00:02:49.209> sounds<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.290> why<00:02:51.160> well<00:02:51.760> it's

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
this sounds like it why well it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.369 
this sounds like it why well it's
pulling<00:02:52.329> heat<00:02:52.599> out<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.019> middle<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.319> the

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
pulling heat out of the middle of the

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.520 
pulling heat out of the middle of the
card<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.970> we're<00:02:55.150> able<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.540> actually<00:02:55.569> draw<00:02:56.290> out

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
card so we're able to actually draw out

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.910 
card so we're able to actually draw out
heat<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:58.030> before<00:02:58.810> nobody<00:02:59.230> has<00:02:59.410> ever<00:02:59.590> touched

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
heat that before nobody has ever touched

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.220 
heat that before nobody has ever touched
as<00:03:00.250> near<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.180> tell<00:03:01.359> in<00:03:01.629> our<00:03:01.750> testing

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
as near as we can tell in our testing

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.509 
as near as we can tell in our testing
this<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.620> good<00:03:02.799> for<00:03:02.829> about<00:03:03.099> 3<00:03:03.430> degrees

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
this is good for about 3 degrees

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.220 
this is good for about 3 degrees
centigrade<00:03:03.970> now<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.540> doesn't<00:03:04.810> sound<00:03:05.049> like<00:03:05.109> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
centigrade now that doesn't sound like a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.410 
centigrade now that doesn't sound like a
lot<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:05.609> that's<00:03:06.609> three<00:03:06.879> degrees<00:03:07.209> centigrade

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
lot but that's three degrees centigrade

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.800 
lot but that's three degrees centigrade
essentially<00:03:08.079> for<00:03:08.260> free<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:10.150> it's<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.720> a

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
essentially for free so it's a it's a

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.750 
essentially for free so it's a it's a
really<00:03:11.019> neat<00:03:11.260> little<00:03:11.440> idea<00:03:11.650> i<00:03:11.980> like<00:03:12.609> the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
really neat little idea i like the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.670 
really neat little idea i like the
concept<00:03:13.000> i'm<00:03:13.420> hoping<00:03:13.690> we'll<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:14.019> more<00:03:14.230> models

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
concept i'm hoping we'll see more models

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.129 
concept i'm hoping we'll see more models
with<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.220> future<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:16.599> end<00:03:16.750> result

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
with it in the future the end result

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.870 
with it in the future the end result
though<00:03:17.200> has<00:03:17.500> been<00:03:17.680> really<00:03:17.980> good<00:03:18.130> for<00:03:18.340> us<00:03:18.400> it's

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
though has been really good for us it's

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.339 
though has been really good for us it's
worked<00:03:19.150> out<00:03:19.269> really<00:03:19.329> well<00:03:19.660> for<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.079> way<00:03:20.200> we

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
worked out really well for the way we

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.080 
worked out really well for the way we
want<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.650> cooler<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.010> perform<00:03:21.370> what<00:03:22.000> about

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
want the cooler to perform what about

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.150 
want the cooler to perform what about
the<00:03:22.239> vapor<00:03:22.510> chamber<00:03:22.720> well<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.620> vapor<00:03:23.799> chamber

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
the vapor chamber well the vapor chamber

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.220 
the vapor chamber well the vapor chamber
is<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.669> the<00:03:24.849> big<00:03:25.030> advantage<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.780> vapor<00:03:25.959> x

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
is that the big advantage of the vapor x

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.140 
is that the big advantage of the vapor x
and<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.680> that's<00:03:26.950> what<00:03:27.130> i<00:03:27.160> mentioned<00:03:27.430> it's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
and that that's what i mentioned it's
