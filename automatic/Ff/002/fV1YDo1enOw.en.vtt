 or 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.179
 2 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.090
 it's an event during this 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.130
 meeting ready cash is back on his 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.610
 favorite playground the track of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.189
 vincennes 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.090
 crack and his hobby supporters 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 winter configuration and redonnet I do not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.169
 couturier cut out all this is my 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.640
 fleece I came back to me I 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.930
 come back to 50 days of the grand prize 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.120
 of america the double titleholder 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.700
 also finds his regular driver franck 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 particularly calm level with the sides 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.899
 of his dabitch havel bodyguards and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 jacquot and ready cash before the event 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.589
 is exceptionally serene and during 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.609
 the race 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.859
 what benefits simply 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.839
 ruler very easily despite his 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.489
 initial handicap of 25 meters crack 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.309
 dominates his subject with ease 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.679
 disconcerting to dominate qwerty and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.190
 resist the successful completion of the scholarship 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.190
 royal dream 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.550
 This is great art 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.610
 and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.190
 yes he was really calm even frank 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.390
 that he had a little doubt that they were 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.430
 maybe a little too quiet 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.460
 but no he did very well today 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.660
 not easy all the time I had at the end 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.650
 fingers the mastery he pulls a little bit 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.750
 in the course but there really 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.200
 I was fascinated did not shoot the film 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.480
 not bothered 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.950
 when there was this brief day he leapt 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.060
 like every time like that it's great 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.300
 horse I was not expecting him 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.070
 wins 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.250
 here I worked very very slowly 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.740
 horse game has done little 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.320
 so me and my team draw from them 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.890
 Conclusions voice to really 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.890
 French was going slowly 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.749
 go slowly gently 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.749
 the hardest remains to be done
