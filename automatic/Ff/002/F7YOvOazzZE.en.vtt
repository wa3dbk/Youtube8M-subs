00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
panels are obviously going to be behind

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.910 
panels are obviously going to be behind
it<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.050> hides<00:01:52.260> all<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> pocket<00:01:52.800> hole

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it so it hides all the pocket hole

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.290 
it so it hides all the pocket hole
screws<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.740> panel<00:01:56.130> wants<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.970> tack

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
screws you know the panel wants you tack

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.910 
screws you know the panel wants you tack
it<00:01:57.510> into<00:01:57.630> place<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.170> glue<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.470> or<00:01:58.560> however<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
it into place or glue it or however you
want<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> secure<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.600> that's<00:02:00.600> where<00:02:00.840> your

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
want to secure it that's where your

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
want to secure it that's where your
strength<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.920> obviously<00:02:02.580> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
strength is going to be obviously the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.860 
strength is going to be obviously the
frame<00:02:02.970> by<00:02:03.120> itself<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.479> gonna<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.690> pretty

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
frame by itself is gonna be pretty

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.480 
frame by itself is gonna be pretty
strong<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.710> panel<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.280> tie

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
strong but the panel is going to tie

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
strong but the panel is going to tie
everything<00:02:05.729> together<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:07.830> be

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
everything together so that will be

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.609 
everything together so that will be
where<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:09.170> majority<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.229> your<00:02:10.319> strength

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
where your majority of your strength

top piece laid out from my length

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
top piece laid out from my length
measurements<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.349> ahead<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.769> cut

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
measurements and we go ahead and cut

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.080 
measurements and we go ahead and cut
these<00:02:20.129> on<00:02:20.489> my<00:02:22.010> panel<00:02:23.010> sled<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.640> table<00:02:23.909> saw

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
these on my panel sled on the table saw

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.980 
these on my panel sled on the table saw
and<00:02:24.120> rip<00:02:24.659> them

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
and rip them

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.440 
and rip them
down<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.100> length<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.490> they<00:02:26.640> need<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> be

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.170 

now<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.810> everything<00:02:31.020> rough<00:02:31.800> cut<00:02:32.180> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
now that I have everything rough cut to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.810

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
its rough cut to the length we need I'm

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.440 
its rough cut to the length we need I'm
still<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.240> cut<00:02:37.170> these<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.560> final<00:02:38.040> length

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
still going to cut these to final length

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.850 
still going to cut these to final length
on<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.600> chapter<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.050> once<00:02:40.320> they<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.710> rip

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
on the chapter so once they going to rip

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.900 
on the chapter so once they going to rip
down<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:42.080> then<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:43.350> rough<00:02:44.280> cut<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.760> length

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790 
down but then of all rough cut to length
now<00:02:45.540> I'm<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.080> shut<00:02:46.290> off<00:02:46.470> everything

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
now I'm going to shut off everything

00:02:46.800 --> 00:03:31.850 
now I'm going to shut off everything
down<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:48.420> two<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> half<00:02:48.840> inches

to<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.230> width<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.530> they<00:03:35.739> need<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.129> I've

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
to the width that they need to be I've

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.250 
to the width that they need to be I've
got<00:03:36.940> them<00:03:37.030> rough<00:03:37.300> cut<00:03:37.599> to<00:03:37.720> length<00:03:37.840> now<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.080> need

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
got them rough cut to length now I need

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.440 
got them rough cut to length now I need
the<00:03:38.349> final<00:03:38.680> need<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.730> cut<00:03:39.849> them<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.060> final

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
the final need to cut them to final

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.089 
the final need to cut them to final
length<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.319> what<00:03:41.440> I'm<00:03:41.560> doing<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.920> I'm<00:03:42.040> going

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
length and what I'm doing is I'm going

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.900 
length and what I'm doing is I'm going
through<00:03:42.430> my<00:03:42.930> my<00:03:43.930> cut<00:03:44.200> list<00:03:44.470> here<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:44.980> finding

through my my cut list here and finding

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.210 
through my my cut list here and finding
the<00:03:46.030> shortest<00:03:46.269> measurement<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.260> then

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the shortest measurement and then

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.970 
the shortest measurement and then
writing<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.879> down<00:03:49.090> on<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.390> first<00:03:49.629> board<00:03:49.989> I've

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
writing it down on the first board I've

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.860 
writing it down on the first board I've
got<00:03:51.190> these<00:03:51.370> ranged<00:03:51.940> from<00:03:52.180> shortest<00:03:52.750> to

got these ranged from shortest to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.270 
got these ranged from shortest to
longest<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:54.480> I'll<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.690> write<00:03:55.900> down<00:03:55.930> my<00:03:56.280> my

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
cut all four of these and then I'll move

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.990 
cut all four of these and then I'll move
my<00:04:14.410> stop<00:04:14.620> block<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.129> next<00:04:15.370> dimension<00:04:15.489> cut

and<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.910> forth<00:04:19.180> until<00:04:19.419> have<00:04:19.600> everything<00:04:19.989> cut

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
and so forth until have everything cut

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.860 
and so forth until have everything cut
down<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.680> my<00:04:20.829> final<00:04:21.250> length<00:04:21.510> after<00:04:22.510> that's

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
down to my final length after that's

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.210 
down to my final length after that's
done<00:04:23.169> it's<00:04:23.380> time<00:04:23.620> for<00:04:23.860> pocket<00:04:24.220> hole<00:04:24.370> screws

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
done it's time for pocket hole screws

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.270 
done it's time for pocket hole screws
also<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.490> took<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.880> time<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:29.560> rip<00:04:29.770> my<00:04:29.919> top

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
also I took the time to to rip my top

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.110 
also I took the time to to rip my top
boards<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.240> chose<00:04:31.840> some<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.350> had<00:04:32.530> some

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
boards and I chose some that had some

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.779 
boards and I chose some that had some
some<00:04:34.120> some<00:04:34.570> rather<00:04:35.050> large<00:04:35.200> knots<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:36.310> use<00:04:36.460> as

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
some some rather large knots to use as

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.850 
some some rather large knots to use as
the<00:04:37.300> top<00:04:37.570> panel<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.729> what<00:04:39.729> I<00:04:39.760> did<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:41.350> took

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
the top panel and what I did is I took

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.629 
the top panel and what I did is I took
my<00:04:42.370> final<00:04:43.120> depth<00:04:43.450> measurements<00:04:44.169> of<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:45.370> think

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
my final depth measurements of I think

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.550 
my final depth measurements of I think
that's<00:04:45.970> nineteen<00:04:46.539> and<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.720> half<00:04:46.750> camera<00:04:47.410> maybe

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
that's nineteen and a half camera maybe

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.140 
that's nineteen and a half camera maybe
fuzzy

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
fuzzy

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.260 
fuzzy
so<00:04:49.810> we'll<00:04:49.960> say<00:04:50.110> 20<00:04:50.440> inches<00:04:51.090> divided<00:04:52.090> by<00:04:52.210> two

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
so we'll say 20 inches divided by two

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.580 
so we'll say 20 inches divided by two
and<00:04:52.570> a<00:04:52.599> half<00:04:52.720> inch<00:04:52.930> width<00:04:53.200> because<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.410> want<00:04:53.530> to
