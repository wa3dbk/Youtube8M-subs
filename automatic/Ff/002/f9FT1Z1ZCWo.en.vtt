grind them up and put them in a liquid
form<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.420> here<00:00:46.719> but<00:00:47.379> what<00:00:47.859> it<00:00:47.979> does<00:00:48.249> is<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.729> it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
form in here but what it does is that it

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.079 
form in here but what it does is that it
makes<00:00:49.449> it<00:00:49.870> creamy<00:00:50.229> it<00:00:51.069> makes<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.460> very<00:00:51.639> creamy

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
as if you put a pork bone leaving it be

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.160 
as if you put a pork bone leaving it be
so<00:00:56.019> I<00:00:56.079> put<00:00:56.319> about<00:00:56.409> a<00:00:57.359> tablespoon<00:00:58.359> of<00:00:58.960> this
