00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
reason that card is just glued to my

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.689 
reason that card is just glued to my
hand<00:06:20.289> which<00:06:21.289> is<00:06:21.320> cool<00:06:21.620> so<00:06:22.159> there<00:06:22.280> you<00:06:22.400> go<00:06:22.520> guys

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
hand which is cool so there you go guys

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.040 
hand which is cool so there you go guys
that's<00:06:22.759> the<00:06:23.090> deck

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
that's the deck

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.779 
that's the deck
42<00:06:24.830> cards<00:06:25.130> total<00:06:26.650> pretty<00:06:27.650> cool<00:06:27.860> it's<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.550> little

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
42 cards total pretty cool it's a little

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.999 
42 cards total pretty cool it's a little
more<00:06:29.060> fast-paced<00:06:29.719> than<00:06:30.020> regular<00:06:30.259> aggro<00:06:30.770> decks

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
more fast-paced than regular aggro decks

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.320 
more fast-paced than regular aggro decks
because<00:06:31.940> you<00:06:32.120> accelerate<00:06:32.599> mana<00:06:32.990> a<00:06:33.110> lot<00:06:33.320> better

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
because you accelerate mana a lot better

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.929 
because you accelerate mana a lot better
but<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:35.289> only<00:06:35.439> real<00:06:35.979> drawback<00:06:36.220> is<00:06:36.729> that<00:06:36.759> you

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
but the only real drawback is that you

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.140 
but the only real drawback is that you
don't<00:06:37.330> get<00:06:38.129> the<00:06:39.129> draw<00:06:39.370> power<00:06:39.610> that<00:06:39.909> water

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
don't get the draw power that water

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.670 
don't get the draw power that water
offers<00:06:41.220> so<00:06:42.220> you<00:06:43.060> know<00:06:43.180> cars<00:06:43.990> like<00:06:44.199> clamp<00:06:44.500> and

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
offers so you know cars like clamp and

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.510 
offers so you know cars like clamp and
lost<00:06:44.860> soul<00:06:45.129> tend<00:06:45.460> to<00:06:45.520> hurt<00:06:46.050> but<00:06:47.189> in<00:06:48.189> spite<00:06:48.460> of

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
lost soul tend to hurt but in spite of

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.740 
lost soul tend to hurt but in spite of

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
that the stick actually still does

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.689
