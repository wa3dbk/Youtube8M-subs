00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.289 

hey<00:00:07.920> it's<00:00:08.099> me<00:00:08.280> thought<00:00:08.820> it'd<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:08.969> a<00:00:09.059> good<00:00:09.179> idea

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:09.299 
hey it's me thought it'd be a good idea

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.209 
hey it's me thought it'd be a good idea
to<00:00:09.570> demonstrate<00:00:10.049> mixed-mode<00:00:10.650> what<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
to demonstrate mixed-mode what the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.709 
to demonstrate mixed-mode what the
advantages<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.180> hopefully<00:00:12.539> we're<00:00:12.629> going

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
advantages are so hopefully we're going

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.029 
advantages are so hopefully we're going
to<00:00:12.780> find<00:00:12.990> some<00:00:13.110> deep<00:00:13.320> signals<00:00:13.680> and<00:00:13.859> I'll<00:00:13.920> be

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
to find some deep signals and I'll be

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.700 
to find some deep signals and I'll be
able<00:00:14.100> to<00:00:14.219> show<00:00:14.430> you<00:00:14.600> why<00:00:15.600> I<00:00:15.629> used<00:00:15.959> mixed<00:00:16.500> mode

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
able to show you why I used mixed mode

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.990 
able to show you why I used mixed mode
and<00:00:16.890> how<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.160> help<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.460> really<00:00:17.609> find<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and how it can help you really find a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.970 
and how it can help you really find a
deep<00:00:18.180> signal<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.720> hold<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.320> we'll<00:00:19.769> see<00:00:19.890> how

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
deep signal so hold on and we'll see how

00:00:19.980 --> 00:03:46.350 
deep signal so hold on and we'll see how
it<00:00:20.100> goes

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.540

I don't know ten and a half of the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.900 
I don't know ten and a half of the
eleven<00:04:05.270> inches<00:04:05.570> but<00:04:06.560> here<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.400> go

it<00:04:29.720> wasn't<00:04:30.020> full<00:04:30.200> mixed-mode<00:04:32.500> probably

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
it wasn't full mixed-mode probably

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.400 
it wasn't full mixed-mode probably
wouldn't<00:04:33.710> have<00:04:33.800> found<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:34.160> one
