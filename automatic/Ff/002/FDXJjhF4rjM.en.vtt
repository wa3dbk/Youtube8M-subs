itself<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> fair<00:00:38.790> bit<00:00:38.940> larger<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.660> can

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170 
itself is a fair bit larger as you can
see<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.920> about<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> same<00:00:41.309> thickness<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
see but about the same thickness as the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
see but about the same thickness as the
original<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.469> sets<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
original but what really sets the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
original but what really sets the
excellent<00:00:44.370> part<00:00:44.520> from<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> original<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
excellent part from the original is the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.290 
excellent part from the original is the
screen<00:00:45.780> coming<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:46.770> 90%<00:00:47.100> larger<00:00:47.820> because

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
screen coming in at 90% larger because

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
screen coming in at 90% larger because
we<00:00:48.539> all<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.840> love<00:00:48.989> percentages<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.770> much<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
we all just love percentages so much and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.490 
we all just love percentages so much and
yet<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.059> resolution<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.050> original

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
yet the same resolution as the original

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
yet the same resolution as the original
now<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> theory<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.090> mean<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> we

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
now in theory this would mean that we

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
now in theory this would mean that we
would<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:54.960> blown<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.320> images<00:00:55.920> thus

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
would just get blown up images thus

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.560 
would just get blown up images thus
making<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> game<00:00:56.670> cloud<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> look<00:00:57.360> worse

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
making the game cloud you look worse

making the game cloud you look worse
