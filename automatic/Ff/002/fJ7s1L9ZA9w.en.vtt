will go out and you don't want that so
this<00:04:40.500> basically<00:04:40.800> what<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.370> got<00:04:41.760> maybe<00:04:42.450> it's

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
this basically what I got maybe it's

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.360 
this basically what I got maybe it's
because<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.440> type<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.650> her<00:04:43.890> hair<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.070> don't

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
because of the type of her hair I don't

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.030 
because of the type of her hair I don't
know<00:04:44.460> maybe<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:44.880> should<00:04:45.180> have<00:04:45.330> kept<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.780> in

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
know maybe I should have kept it in

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.580 
know maybe I should have kept it in
longer<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:48.360> if<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.630> want<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.960> can<00:04:49.110> keep<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.500> in

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
longer so if you want you can keep it in

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.310 
longer so if you want you can keep it in
longer<00:04:49.920> if<00:04:50.760> you<00:04:50.820> have<00:04:51.090> patience<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:54.320> it's

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
longer if you have patience but it's

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.740 
longer if you have patience but it's
very<00:04:55.500> beautiful<00:04:55.770> actually<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.580> her<00:04:57.360> hair<00:04:57.720> is

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
very beautiful actually that her hair is

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.320 
very beautiful actually that her hair is
already<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.410> bit<00:04:58.590> wavy<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:02.310> on<00:05:02.550> my<00:05:02.730> own<00:05:02.940> hair<00:05:03.180> it

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.450 
already a bit wavy so on my own hair it
works<00:05:03.600> better<00:05:06.920> so<00:05:07.920> if<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.160> have<00:05:08.280> risked

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
works better so if you have risked

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:19.910 
works better so if you have risked
request<00:05:08.970> any<00:05:09.780> other<00:05:09.960> hair<00:05:10.320> cells<00:05:11.330> SP
