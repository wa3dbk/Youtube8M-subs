00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.200
 in this mini tutorial I will show how 

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:09.839
 take the video or audio images to the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 timeline remember that here in 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.990
 I have this little section because 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 it is 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.700
 I have enlarged the monitor area so that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.740
 see what we do in this section 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.660
 we have the collections well be of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.539
 audio video all we want 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.340
 we can choose the ones here above if 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.790
 we have in sections 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.420
 or we could see here through this button 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.040
 of collections see the different 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.320
 folders so we can choose a u 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.320
 other 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.420
 the process is as simple as 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.059
 drag the timeline image 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 audio video that we want to take 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.629
 We also remember that in the line of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 we can see it as a storyboard 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.710
 which is how it looks now in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.650
 squares where we are going to carry 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 our images or videos and others 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.140
 smaller pictures that is where 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.890
 Later we will take the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.620
 transitions 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.089
 to this timeline in a chart there 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.180
 you can take audio audio you would have 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.560
 take it audio apart I want to say 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.659
 we should take it to the timeline 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.940
 when we have it as a time scale 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.770
 and here we can take things from 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.930
 any way what happens is that if 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.000
 we are not used to working 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.350
 with a video editing program 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.960
 maybe the simplest process is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.960
 in storyboard bring here the images 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 and for example, let's go to images and 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.330
 we put an image as a start 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.330
 then we put a video 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.030
 then we take another video is to say that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.350
 simply crawl here we 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.650
 we now look at the time scale and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.110
 we see that we have up here we have the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.240
 time that the image is passing is through 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.250
 defect has caught 21 seconds because it is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.700
 what I have put to him that he has to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.510
 last where you choose this good in 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.090
 tools options 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.610
 within advanced options what 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.680
 we want an image to last we put it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.430
 here and from that moment it will affect 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.590
 to the images that we bring to the program 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.060
 if we want it to last less then 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.000
 well then we'll see in the edition that 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.700
 we will simply drag but this 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.469
 I repeat that it is from the next lesson 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.719
 well he said that we have here the first 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.700
 image that we have put after we have 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.219
 the video the first video we've 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.689
 put and followed him is the third 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.350
 video than the second video we've 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.410
 Market Stall 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.870
 video and video image on the scale of 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.040
 time I will also decrease a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.080
 bit 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.990
 to lose me paris 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.610
 we have the image a video and the other 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.910
 video yes we have the same thing we could 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.440
 take them both to one site and to another and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.840
 if we wanted to take an audio 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.060
 I repeat that we will have to take it here to 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.610
 this action that in the biographical 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.930
 we have a place to take the audio 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.620
 then on the time scale 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.970
 just also click drag to 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.220
 the corresponding zone the audio 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.960
 music and here we can already move it and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.720
 put it where we want or cut it 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.790
 edit it that I repeat that is from the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.490
 next lesson so that the videos of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.680
 tutorial be short 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.489
 and that's it 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.489
 or a greeting
