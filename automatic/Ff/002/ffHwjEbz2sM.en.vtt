00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
little paint job so I definitely

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.930

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
recommend picking this figure up he

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.370 
recommend picking this figure up he
looks<00:02:56.090> really<00:02:56.270> badass<00:02:56.450> he<00:02:56.960> does<00:02:57.140> come<00:02:57.290> with

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
belts so being that he is a bigger

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.310
