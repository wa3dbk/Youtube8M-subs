dilemma the end I'm hungover I think I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.980 
dilemma the end I'm hungover I think I
might<00:00:17.400> be<00:00:17.550> an<00:00:17.640> alcoholic<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.539> love<00:00:19.230> beer<00:00:20.840> and<00:00:21.840> I

might be an alcoholic I love beer and I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.750 
might be an alcoholic I love beer and I
pretty<00:00:22.170> much<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.590> along<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.039> anybody<00:00:23.279> else

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
pretty much get along with anybody else

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
pretty much get along with anybody else
who<00:00:23.910> does<00:00:24.240> too<00:00:26.689> as<00:00:27.689> long<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:27.930> I'm<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.170> related

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
who does too as long as I'm not related

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.470 
who does too as long as I'm not related
to<00:00:28.830> him<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.250> don't<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> clear-cut

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
to him I don't have a clear-cut

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.700 
to him I don't have a clear-cut
definition<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.650> an<00:00:31.769> alcoholic<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.610> but

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
definition of what an alcoholic is but

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.380 
definition of what an alcoholic is but
I'm<00:00:34.710> thinking<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.700> look<00:00:35.880> forward<00:00:36.210> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
I'm thinking that if you look forward to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.470 
I'm thinking that if you look forward to
sobering<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.850> Jessie<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.239> drunk

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
sobering up Jessie you can get drunk

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.030 
sobering up Jessie you can get drunk
again<00:00:40.760> I'm<00:00:41.760> thinking<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.590> you<00:00:43.590> might<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
again I'm thinking that you might have a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.490 
again I'm thinking that you might have a
drinking<00:00:44.250> problem<00:00:46.789> hypothetically<00:00:47.789> speaking

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500
