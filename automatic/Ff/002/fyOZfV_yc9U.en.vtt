look that the lines around my mouth and
then<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.710> little<00:00:20.180> invitation<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.390> that

then this little invitation here that
seems<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.900> forming<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.590> then<00:00:22.830> my<00:00:23.300> dark

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
seems to be forming and then my dark

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.230 
seems to be forming and then my dark
circles<00:00:24.510> under<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.260> eyes<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:27.060> if

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
circles under my eyes and then if

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.870 
circles under my eyes and then if
possible<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.710> jowl<00:00:28.949> line<00:00:29.189> seems<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.760> be

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
possible the jowl line seems to be

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.260 
possible the jowl line seems to be
forming<00:00:30.599> along<00:00:30.840> ok<00:00:31.439> let<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.579> point<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> few

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
forming along ok let me point out a few

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.209 
forming along ok let me point out a few
of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> things<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.469> as<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:34.829> Cheney

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
of the things that I see as well Cheney

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.790 
of the things that I see as well Cheney
the<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.300> would<00:00:36.510> agree<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.320> terms<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the I would agree with you in terms of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.860 
the I would agree with you in terms of
needing<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.309> fill<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.820> nasolabial<00:00:39.300> fold

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
needing to fill that nasolabial fold

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.560 
needing to fill that nasolabial fold
this<00:00:40.469> lateral<00:00:40.950> commissure<00:00:41.579> area<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this lateral commissure area and the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
this lateral commissure area and the
area<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.590> front<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> jowl<00:00:44.340> what

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
area that is in front of the jowl what

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.930 
area that is in front of the jowl what
we<00:00:45.120> call<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> labial<00:00:45.780> mandibular<00:00:46.200> sulcus

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
we call the labial mandibular sulcus

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.700 
we call the labial mandibular sulcus
also<00:00:47.940> along<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.539> jawline<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.320> point<00:00:49.590> out

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
also along the jawline as you point out

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.189 
also along the jawline as you point out
I<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> nice<00:00:50.850> job<00:00:50.879> by<00:00:51.660> actually

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
I think we can do a nice job by actually

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
I think we can do a nice job by actually
filling<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.800> front<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> jowl<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.210> think

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
filling in front of the jowl and I think

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
filling in front of the jowl and I think
if<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.989> something<00:00:55.230> behind<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.129> jowl<00:00:56.370> we

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
if we do something behind the jowl we

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
if we do something behind the jowl we
can<00:00:57.059> actually<00:00:57.270> straighten<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> jawline

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
can actually straighten out the jawline

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
can actually straighten out the jawline
or<00:00:58.980> give<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> illusion<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.910> straightening

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
or give the illusion of straightening

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.410 
or give the illusion of straightening
out<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> jawline<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.190> eye<00:01:02.460> area<00:01:02.879> this

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
out the jawline in the eye area this

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
out the jawline in the eye area this
neighs<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.960> juggle<00:01:04.290> groove<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.979> called

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
neighs of juggle groove as it's called

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.969 
neighs of juggle groove as it's called
is<00:01:05.659> accentuated<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.840> its<00:01:06.990> depth<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.650> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
is accentuated in its depth because of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.530 
is accentuated in its depth because of
the<00:01:08.070> fact<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> fat

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the fact that there are some of the fat

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
the fact that there are some of the fat
bolts<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> lower<00:01:10.380> eyelid<00:01:10.740> area<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
bolts in the lower eyelid area here and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.899 
bolts in the lower eyelid area here and
if<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.990> ahead<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.590> fill<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:14.640> bit

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
if we go ahead and fill in a little bit

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.140 
if we go ahead and fill in a little bit
of<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.890> depth<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> nasal<00:01:17.369> juggle<00:01:17.909> grew

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
of that depth of the nasal juggle grew

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270 
of that depth of the nasal juggle grew
with<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> fillers<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.740> tends<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
with one of the fillers it tends to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310 
with one of the fillers it tends to
minimize<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.180> doesn't<00:01:21.479> obviously<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:22.080> rid<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
minimize it doesn't obviously get rid of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770 
minimize it doesn't obviously get rid of
the<00:01:22.650> fat<00:01:22.979> bowls<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> eye<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> tends<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the fat bowls in the eye but it tends to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
the fat bowls in the eye but it tends to
minimize<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.500> appearance<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> fat<00:01:26.490> bulge

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
minimize the appearance of the fat bulge

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
minimize the appearance of the fat bulge
similar<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.200> seeing<00:01:28.650> when<00:01:29.009> we

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
similar to what we're seeing when we

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
similar to what we're seeing when we
camouflage<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.479> jowl<00:01:30.689> area<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.290> think

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
camouflage the the jowl area I think

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
camouflage the the jowl area I think
lastly<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.729> also<00:01:33.060> consider<00:01:33.570> putting

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
lastly I would also consider putting

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.950 
lastly I would also consider putting
some<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.920> lateral<00:01:35.220> brow<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.720> we

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
some in the lateral brow because as we

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
some in the lateral brow because as we
age<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.290> fat<00:01:38.009> pad<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> normally<00:01:39.150> here

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
age the fat pad that is normally here

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.289 
age the fat pad that is normally here
will<00:01:40.140> actually<00:01:40.170> lose<00:01:41.040> volume<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
will actually lose volume and as that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.020 
will actually lose volume and as that
volume<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.020> lost<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.829> brow<00:01:44.009> descends<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
volume is lost the brow descends and the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.600 
volume is lost the brow descends and the
upper<00:01:45.360> lid<00:01:45.630> starts<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:46.380> heavy<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.430> can

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
upper lid starts to look heavy so we can

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
upper lid starts to look heavy so we can
add<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.299> volume<00:01:48.540> back<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.350> there

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
add a little bit of volume back to there

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.499 
add a little bit of volume back to there
we<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.159> actually<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.090> subtle

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we can actually get kind of a subtle

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.690 
we can actually get kind of a subtle
lift<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.110> eyebrow<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.670> turn

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
lift of the eyebrow and that in turn

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.359 
lift of the eyebrow and that in turn
lifts<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> upper<00:01:54.780> lid<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.259> well<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> think

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
lifts the upper lid as well so I think

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.190 
lifts the upper lid as well so I think
if<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.820> kind<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.299> address<00:01:57.630> each<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.899> those

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
if we kind of address each of those

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.149 
if we kind of address each of those
areas<00:01:58.969> with<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.540> Laird<00:02:01.110> liquid<00:02:01.619> left<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.100> think

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
areas with the Laird liquid left I think

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.100 
areas with the Laird liquid left I think
we're<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> find<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.659> very

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
we're going to find that will see a very

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.249 
we're going to find that will see a very
natural<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.920> an<00:02:05.850> easy<00:02:06.299> thing<00:02:06.630> hopefully<00:02:06.869> for

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
natural and an easy thing hopefully for

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.410 
natural and an easy thing hopefully for
you<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.439> go<00:02:07.560> through<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.160> okay<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you to go through to okay I'm going to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449 
you to go through to okay I'm going to
just<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.869> marking<00:02:10.349> out<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.530> areas<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.099> we're

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
just be marking out the areas that we're

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.320 
just be marking out the areas that we're
going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.700> doing<00:02:11.940> our<00:02:12.209> filling<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
going to be doing our filling a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.540 
going to be doing our filling a
and<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.570> want<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.900> leave<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.680> jowl<00:02:15.010> itself

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and we want to leave the jowl itself

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.340 
and we want to leave the jowl itself
alone<00:02:15.850> we're<00:02:16.150> going<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.390> fill<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.810> front<00:02:17.170> and

alone we're going to fill in front and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.770 
alone we're going to fill in front and
behind<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.920> gel<00:02:18.160> we<00:02:18.790> want<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.120> fill<00:02:19.300> into<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
behind the gel we want to fill into the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.470 
behind the gel we want to fill into the
labia<00:02:20.140> mandibular<00:02:20.740> sulcus<00:02:21.580> area<00:02:21.970> here<00:02:22.330> as

labia mandibular sulcus area here as

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.570 
labia mandibular sulcus area here as
well<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.380> kind<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.860> these<00:02:23.950> little<00:02:24.250> wrinkle

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
well as kind of these little wrinkle

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.610 
well as kind of these little wrinkle
lines<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.090> are<00:02:25.180> right<00:02:25.390> around<00:02:25.540> there<00:02:25.960> we'll

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
lines that are right around there we'll

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
lines that are right around there we'll
go<00:02:26.830> ahead<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.070> put<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> little<00:02:27.490> bit<00:02:27.970> into<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
go ahead and put a little bit into the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.340 
go ahead and put a little bit into the
nasal<00:02:29.380> labial<00:02:29.980> fold<00:02:30.280> right<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:32.080> think

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
nasal labial fold right here and I think

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.050 
nasal labial fold right here and I think
conservatively<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.430> want<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.730> put<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.910> little

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
conservatively we want to put a little

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.750 
conservatively we want to put a little
bit<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.630> nasal<00:02:34.840> juggle<00:02:35.410> group<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:35.950> also

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
bit in the nasal juggle group and also

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.660 
bit in the nasal juggle group and also
this<00:02:37.240> anterior<00:02:37.960> cheek<00:02:38.470> area<00:02:38.740> here<00:02:39.280> as<00:02:39.430> well

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
this anterior cheek area here as well

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.060 
this anterior cheek area here as well
it's<00:02:40.390> nice<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> actually<00:02:41.200> get<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.710> nice

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
it's nice to actually get a nice

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.280 
it's nice to actually get a nice
rounding<00:02:42.850> effect<00:02:43.240> you<00:02:43.420> have<00:02:43.630> some<00:02:43.930> nice

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
rounding effect you have some nice

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.560 
rounding effect you have some nice
fullness<00:02:44.830> already<00:02:45.280> here<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.000> lower<00:02:46.180> cheek

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
fullness already here in the lower cheek

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.540 
fullness already here in the lower cheek
so<00:02:47.050> we<00:02:47.140> don't<00:02:47.290> want<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.500> overdo<00:02:47.920> because<00:02:48.520> I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
so we don't want to overdo because I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.460 
so we don't want to overdo because I
think<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:48.970> important<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:49.750> keep

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
think it's important that we keep

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.490 
think it's important that we keep
everything<00:02:50.830> looking<00:02:51.430> very<00:02:51.780> normal<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.350> know

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
everything looking very normal you know

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.620 
everything looking very normal you know
when<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.890> when<00:02:54.250> we're<00:02:54.430> all<00:02:55.030> done<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
when we when we're all done and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.600 
when we when we're all done and
everything<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.230> finished<00:02:56.500> what<00:02:57.130> we<00:02:57.250> want<00:02:57.490> to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
everything is finished what we want to

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.730 
everything is finished what we want to
do<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.940> Mark<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:58.900> what<00:02:59.110> we're<00:02:59.260> doing<00:02:59.530> now

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
with an upright position have the effect

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.530 
with an upright position have the effect
of<00:03:02.260> gravity<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> tissues<00:03:03.430> then<00:03:04.060> when<00:03:04.360> we

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
of gravity on the tissues then when we

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.630 
of gravity on the tissues then when we
go<00:03:04.750> ahead<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.140> do<00:03:05.290> our<00:03:05.320> fillers<00:03:05.920> will<00:03:06.370> layer

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
go ahead and do our fillers will layer

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.730 
go ahead and do our fillers will layer
in<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.150> radius<00:03:07.510> first<00:03:07.900> then<00:03:08.260> we'll<00:03:08.500> take<00:03:08.709> a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
in the radius first then we'll take a

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.470 
in the radius first then we'll take a
look<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.310> we'll<00:03:09.370> go<00:03:09.640> ahead<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:09.850> layer<00:03:10.209> in

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
look and we'll go ahead and layer in

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.540 
look and we'll go ahead and layer in
some<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.020> hyaluronic<00:03:11.470> acid<00:03:12.220> fillers

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
some of the hyaluronic acid fillers

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.390 
some of the hyaluronic acid fillers
probably<00:03:13.150> Restylane<00:03:13.720> today<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.320> then<00:03:15.160> we'll

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
probably Restylane today and then we'll

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.670 
probably Restylane today and then we'll
go<00:03:15.580> ahead<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.910> let<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.840> set<00:03:17.080> up<00:03:17.200> as<00:03:17.410> we're

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
go ahead and let you set up as we're

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.190 
go ahead and let you set up as we're
doing<00:03:17.800> that<00:03:18.209> we'll<00:03:19.209> go<00:03:19.510> ahead<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.750> do<00:03:19.959> one

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
doing that we'll go ahead and do one

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.080 
doing that we'll go ahead and do one
side<00:03:20.440> first<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.130> then<00:03:21.280> we<00:03:21.430> can<00:03:21.610> take<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.820> look

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
side first and then we can take a look

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.360 
side first and then we can take a look
at<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.810> difference<00:03:23.230> between<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.070> side

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
at the difference between the the side

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.460 
at the difference between the the side
we've<00:03:24.760> done<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.390> side<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:25.989> haven't<00:03:26.320> done

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
we've done and the side we haven't done

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.680 
we've done and the side we haven't done
and<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:27.280> we'll<00:03:27.430> go<00:03:27.610> ahead<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.910> match<00:03:28.330> the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
and then we'll go ahead and match the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.830 
and then we'll go ahead and match the
second<00:03:29.290> side<00:03:29.470> with<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.130> first<00:03:30.910> side<00:03:31.120> because

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
second side with that first side because

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.350 
second side with that first side because
we<00:03:31.989> really<00:03:32.470> need<00:03:32.650> symmetry<00:03:33.280> what<00:03:33.850> I'm<00:03:33.970> doing

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
we really need symmetry what I'm doing

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.540 
we really need symmetry what I'm doing
here<00:03:34.600> Jeanne<00:03:34.870> I'm<00:03:35.019> going<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.410> be<00:03:35.530> putting<00:03:35.769> in<00:03:36.100> a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
here Jeanne I'm going to be putting in a

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.030 
here Jeanne I'm going to be putting in a
little<00:03:37.209> dot<00:03:37.450> some<00:03:38.110> numbing<00:03:38.350> in<00:03:38.620> various

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
little dot some numbing in various

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.220 
little dot some numbing in various
places<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:39.820> we<00:03:40.030> can<00:03:40.209> have<00:03:40.239> access<00:03:40.900> to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
places so that we can have access to

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.729 
places so that we can have access to
where<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.250> needle<00:03:42.760> for<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.420> filler<00:03:44.410> will

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
where the needle for the filler will

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.580 
where the needle for the filler will
actually<00:03:45.280> go<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:45.790> by<00:03:46.360> doing<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.780> we<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.380> go

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
actually go and by doing that we can go

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.430 
actually go and by doing that we can go
ahead<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.920> make<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:49.019> procedure<00:03:50.019> very

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
ahead and make the procedure very

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.190 
ahead and make the procedure very
comfortable<00:03:51.040> for<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.580> will<00:03:52.510> mix<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.989> little

comfortable for you will mix a little
bit<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.530> some<00:03:53.709> numbing<00:03:53.920> with<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:55.470> filler

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
bit of some numbing with the filler

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.310 
bit of some numbing with the filler
material<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:57.340> well<00:03:57.580> but<00:03:58.239> by<00:03:58.450> making<00:03:58.989> these

little<00:03:59.620> numb<00:04:00.100> spots<00:04:00.489> in<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.940> skin<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.480> makes

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
little numb spots in the skin it makes

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.640 
little numb spots in the skin it makes

Laird liquid left and I will just let
you<00:04:15.310> take<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.760> mirror<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:16.030> want<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.510> take<00:04:16.720> a

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
you take the mirror I want you to take a

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.580 
you take the mirror I want you to take a
look<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.290> see<00:04:17.350> what<00:04:17.530> your<00:04:17.799> thoughts<00:04:18.040> are

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.310 

yeah<00:04:21.590> it's<00:04:21.980> a<00:04:22.040> big<00:04:22.190> difference<00:04:22.870> yeah<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.050> seems

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
yeah it's a big difference yeah it seems

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.320 
yeah it's a big difference yeah it seems
to<00:04:24.530> take<00:04:24.680> off<00:04:24.890> some<00:04:25.190> years<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.760> think<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.240> you

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
to take off some years I think and you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.050 
to take off some years I think and you
can<00:04:26.480> see<00:04:26.690> there's<00:04:26.900> almost<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.530> an<00:04:28.370> appearance

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
can see there's almost a an appearance

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.540 
can see there's almost a an appearance
of<00:04:29.240> elevation<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.320> cheek<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.280> jaw

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
of elevation of the cheek and the jaw

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.160 
of elevation of the cheek and the jaw
line<00:04:31.580> like<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.270> were<00:04:32.360> saying<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.810> straightened

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
line like we were saying is straightened

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.380 
line like we were saying is straightened
out<00:04:33.230> a<00:04:33.290> little<00:04:33.410> bit<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:34.820> actually<00:04:35.270> are

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
out a little bit you actually are

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.450 
out a little bit you actually are
softened<00:04:35.870> not<00:04:36.170> only<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.560> nasolabial<00:04:36.950> fold

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
softened not only in the nasolabial fold

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.180 
softened not only in the nasolabial fold
but<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:37.910> whole<00:04:38.120> array<00:04:38.720> periorbital<00:04:39.650> area

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
but that whole array periorbital area

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.600 
but that whole array periorbital area
looks<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.150> think<00:04:41.180> much<00:04:41.570> much<00:04:41.780> more<00:04:42.280> rested<00:04:43.280> i

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
looks I think much much more rested i

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.700 
looks I think much much more rested i
guess<00:04:43.850> i<00:04:44.030> would<00:04:44.090> say<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.660> it's<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.410> kind<00:04:45.560> of

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
guess i would say and it's the kind of

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.380 
guess i would say and it's the kind of
thing<00:04:45.890> that<00:04:45.950> this<00:04:46.340> will<00:04:46.550> last<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.000> for

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
thing that this will last you for

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.230 
thing that this will last you for
probably<00:04:47.780> a<00:04:47.900> year<00:04:48.020> plus<00:04:48.500> because<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.610> radius

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
probably a year plus because the radius

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.710 
probably a year plus because the radius
tends<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.810> be<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:50.990> really<00:04:51.770> good<00:04:52.040> long-lasting

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
tends to be a really good long-lasting

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.130 
tends to be a really good long-lasting
support<00:04:53.720> structure<00:04:54.200> underneath<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:55.120> the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
support structure underneath and the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.690 
support structure underneath and the
Restylane<00:04:57.140> is<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.560> thing<00:04:57.800> that<00:04:57.830> will<00:04:58.190> give

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
Restylane is the thing that will give

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.880 
Restylane is the thing that will give
you<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.120> softness<00:04:59.660> on<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.990> surface<00:05:00.440> but<00:05:00.470> also

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
you the softness on the surface but also

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.679 
you the softness on the surface but also
gives<00:05:01.640> you<00:05:01.730> a<00:05:01.790> lot<00:05:02.060> of<00:05:02.120> longevity<00:05:02.390> as<00:05:02.960> well

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.320 

we've<00:05:07.049> put<00:05:07.379> our<00:05:07.499> radius<00:05:08.099> deep<00:05:08.759> underneath<00:05:09.149> the
