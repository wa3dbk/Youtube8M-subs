00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
road we also have off-road transitions

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.370 
road we also have off-road transitions
and<00:01:27.970> avoidance<00:01:28.970> setup<00:01:32.020> now<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.230> your

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
and avoidance setup now that your

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.650 
and avoidance setup now that your
routing<00:01:33.620> settings<00:01:34.160> are<00:01:34.370> set<00:01:34.730> we're<00:01:35.480> gonna

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
routing settings are set we're gonna

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.650 
routing settings are set we're gonna
want<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.230> road<00:01:36.440> somewhere<00:01:37.150> there's<00:01:38.150> two<00:01:38.450> ways

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
want to road somewhere there's two ways

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.110 
want to road somewhere there's two ways
of<00:01:38.870> routing<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.830> first<00:01:40.130> way<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.520> find<00:01:40.910> a

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
of routing the first way is to find a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.630 
of routing the first way is to find a
point<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.690> do<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:42.290> rope<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:42.920> one<00:01:43.280> point

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
point and do a rope to that one point

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.390 
point and do a rope to that one point
the<00:01:44.270> next<00:01:44.480> way<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.260> use<00:01:45.590> your<00:01:45.800> rope<00:01:46.010> planner

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
the next way is to use your rope planner

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.050 
the next way is to use your rope planner
so<00:01:47.210> we'll<00:01:47.690> show<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.050> first<00:01:48.380> way<00:01:48.620> hit<00:01:49.610> find

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
so we'll show you the first way hit find

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.600 
so we'll show you the first way hit find
once<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.440> then<00:01:51.560> select<00:01:51.860> what<00:01:52.100> you're<00:01:52.250> looking
