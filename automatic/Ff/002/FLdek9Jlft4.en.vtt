00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.580
These thoughts I’ve captured within my heart, I’ll gently say

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.440
Knocking on the hidden door

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.340
I find light in the still darkened sky

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.570
As the lightening world wakes to the future

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.440
Running down my cheeks these tears melt into a spring wind

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.910
Now shining upon the road I walk

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.210
May this racing wind carry my thoughts

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.160
In this forgotten world

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.960
I look upon the past, the future, and the truth

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.060
My face drenched with tears, I feel the wind

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.010
Even this smile

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.990
a lie

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.860
I’ll embrace everything now and say..

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.130
My unwavering heart reflects an image of the expanding world

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.290
Onto my back, shouldering my sadness

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.860
I leap far into the sky, chasing after the wind

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.060
As this distinct moment, reaches out towards the future

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.900
My voice rushes forth, sailing past the winds soaring through the sky

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.760
In the corner of my eye, the horizon line spreads out before me

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.750
I’m asking you, I’m looking for the answer

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.620
Even with these lies mixed with tears,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.620
Now, I’ll believe.. 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.620
These thoughts I send to you

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.620
Even if I disappear from this world,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.520
If somehow I’m forgiven,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.580
I’ll believe in a future where you still live..

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.010
I stand still and face the rain of a passing shower

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.080
I’ve grown afraid of tomorrow, I can’t go on alone

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.400
But with a single beam of light, into the sky opening with a smile

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.080
I ascend, now, into the distance, towards this light’s destination

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.040
May this racing wind carry my thoughts

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.830
In this world stained with lies

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.890
I look upon the past, the future, and the truth

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.890
My face drenched with tears, I feel the wind

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.590
Even this smile

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.770
a lie

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.960
I’ll embrace everything now and say
