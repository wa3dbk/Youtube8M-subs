30 this is a total throwback to my very

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.940 
30 this is a total throwback to my very
first<00:00:26.180> bike<00:00:26.599> which<00:00:26.900> had<00:00:27.259> about<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.800> same

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
first bike which had about the same

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.429 
first bike which had about the same
performance<00:00:28.189> value<00:00:29.230> considerably<00:00:30.230> more

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
performance value considerably more

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.229 
performance value considerably more
torque<00:00:30.770> but<00:00:31.009> nowhere<00:00:31.189> near<00:00:31.279> like<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:32.060> same

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
torque but nowhere near like the same

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.620 
torque but nowhere near like the same
horsepower<00:00:32.540> really<00:00:33.850> because<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:35.030> turned<00:00:35.239> it

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
horsepower really because it turned it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.460 
horsepower really because it turned it
I<00:00:35.660> guess<00:00:36.200> fewer<00:00:36.530> rpms<00:00:37.540> a<00:00:38.540> little<00:00:39.140> bit<00:00:39.260> bigger

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
I guess fewer rpms a little bit bigger

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.580 
I guess fewer rpms a little bit bigger
than<00:00:39.649> this<00:00:39.800> but<00:00:40.100> not<00:00:40.220> much<00:00:41.260> in<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.350> little

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
this thing sounds like ass when it is

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.830 
this thing sounds like ass when it is
kind<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.840> running<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> we'll<00:03:10.210> feather<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.660> gas

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
kind of running so we'll feather the gas

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.360 
kind of running so we'll feather the gas
see<00:03:11.560> what<00:03:11.680> we<00:03:11.740> can<00:03:11.890> do<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.070> keep<00:03:12.220> going

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
see what we can do to keep going

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.020 
see what we can do to keep going

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030
