00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
for the MacBook MacBook Pro this is

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.670 
for the MacBook MacBook Pro this is
actually<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.590> late<00:00:17.130> 2008<00:00:18.060> macbook<00:00:18.779> aluminum

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
actually in a late 2008 macbook aluminum

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.859 
actually in a late 2008 macbook aluminum
they<00:00:20.160> later<00:00:20.400> named<00:00:20.640> these<00:00:20.820> macbook<00:00:21.300> pro<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
they later named these macbook pro and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.650 
they later named these macbook pro and
this<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.130> particular<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.880> very<00:00:24.240> easy<00:00:24.510> to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
this one in particular is very easy to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870 
this one in particular is very easy to
swap<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> door<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.580> bottom

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
swap out we have a door on the bottom

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.150 
swap out we have a door on the bottom
now<00:00:27.689> yours<00:00:27.960> may<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.230> some<00:00:28.650> screws<00:00:28.980> along

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
now yours may have some screws along

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.919 
now yours may have some screws along
this<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:29.760> before<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.689> need<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
this but before we do that we need to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.690 
this but before we do that we need to
determine<00:00:31.080> what<00:00:31.590> we're<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> use<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
determine what we're going to use in

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.610 
determine what we're going to use in
this<00:00:33.180> case<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.899> swap<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.410> out

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this case we're going to swap this out

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.119 
this case we're going to swap this out
with<00:00:34.980> an<00:00:35.219> m6<00:00:35.820> s<00:00:36.090> Plextor<00:00:36.930> solid-state<00:00:37.829> drive

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
with an m6 s Plextor solid-state drive

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.889 
with an m6 s Plextor solid-state drive
they<00:00:38.640> were<00:00:38.700> nice<00:00:38.940> enough<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.300> send<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.750> along

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
they were nice enough to send this along

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.020 
they were nice enough to send this along
you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.670> come<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.940> at

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
you can see it here if they come in at

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.160 
you can see it here if they come in at
about<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> hundred<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.690> forty<00:00:42.960> four<00:00:43.110> dollars

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
about a hundred and forty four dollars

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.880 
about a hundred and forty four dollars
or<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.219> from<00:00:44.579> Newegg<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.239> amazon<00:00:45.770> supposed<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
or so from Newegg or amazon supposed to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
or so from Newegg or amazon supposed to
be<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.280> fast<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> we'll<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.090> some<00:00:48.270> other

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
be really fast and we'll do some other

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
be really fast and we'll do some other
tests<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:48.960> well<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.559> i'll<00:00:49.739> leave<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> link<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
tests as well and i'll leave a link to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.160 
tests as well and i'll leave a link to
those<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> description<00:00:51.120> below<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:52.020> these

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
those in the description below but these

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
those in the description below but these
particular<00:00:52.379> solid-state<00:00:53.280> drive<00:00:53.520> should<00:00:53.699> be

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
particular solid-state drive should be

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
particular solid-state drive should be
pretty<00:00:54.090> good<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.600> should<00:00:55.289> fit<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.620> here

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
pretty good for this should fit in here

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
pretty good for this should fit in here
nicely<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.730> before<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> need

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
nicely but before you do that you need

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
nicely but before you do that you need
to<00:00:57.750> determine<00:00:58.079> whether<00:00:58.350> or<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
to determine whether or not you want to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.340 
to determine whether or not you want to
start<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.030> scratch<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.780> load<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
start from scratch and load the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.560 
start from scratch and load the
operating<00:01:01.379> system<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.370> clone<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> old<00:01:03.239> hard

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
operating system or clone the old hard

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.020 
operating system or clone the old hard
drive<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.100> case<00:01:05.339> I've<00:01:05.519> cloned<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
drive and in this case I've cloned the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.359 
drive and in this case I've cloned the
hard<00:01:06.210> drive<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.920> means<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.310> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
hard drive in here and that means when I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
hard drive in here and that means when I
put<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> should<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.420> boot<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
put this in it should just boot up and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.929 
put this in it should just boot up and
be<00:01:10.140> how<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.650> before<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.400> I'll<00:01:11.760> leave<00:01:11.909> a

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.570 
in place we can set that aside and just
pull<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.590> out<00:02:14.800> now<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.099> want<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.310> make<00:02:15.400> sure

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.470 
you're grounded touch something metal
before<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.590> touch<00:02:17.800> any<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.099> this<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.550> always<00:02:19.150> do

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
before you touch any of this I always do

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.270 
before you touch any of this I always do
that<00:02:19.599> before<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:20.020> do<00:02:20.170> any<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.890> sort<00:02:21.190> of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
work now these just pop right out and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.800 
work now these just pop right out and
then<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.730> SATA<00:02:28.090> connector<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
then you have a SATA connector on the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.809 
then you have a SATA connector on the
bottom<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.530> want<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.770> gently<00:02:30.310> pull<00:02:30.670> that

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
bottom so you want to gently pull that

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.900 
bottom so you want to gently pull that
off<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.690> slides<00:02:31.870> off<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
off and it just slides off like that and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.460 
off and it just slides off like that and
that's<00:02:33.910> pretty<00:02:34.209> much<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.569> for<00:02:34.600> removing<00:02:35.350> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that's pretty much it for removing it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.840 
that's pretty much it for removing it
but<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.769> you'll<00:02:35.890> need<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.280> next<00:02:36.489> is

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
but what you'll need to do next is
