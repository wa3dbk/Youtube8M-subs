we've seen a lot of amazing indoor

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.440 
we've seen a lot of amazing indoor
helicopters<00:00:15.309> in<00:00:15.430> the<00:00:15.520> past<00:00:15.730> few<00:00:15.910> years<00:00:16.240> and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
helicopters in the past few years and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.240 
helicopters in the past few years and
you've<00:00:16.570> heard<00:00:16.810> us<00:00:16.930> say<00:00:16.960> it<00:00:17.140> before<00:00:17.560> but<00:00:18.130> they

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
you've heard us say it before but they

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.150 
you've heard us say it before but they
just<00:00:18.640> keep<00:00:19.090> getting<00:00:19.720> better<00:00:20.020> and<00:00:20.350> this<00:00:20.830> one<00:00:21.010> is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
just keep getting better and this one is

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.919 
just keep getting better and this one is
the<00:00:21.310> best<00:00:21.550> yet<00:00:21.880> let's<00:00:22.449> start<00:00:22.720> with<00:00:22.840> the

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
the best yet let's start with the

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.870 
the best yet let's start with the
terrific<00:00:23.199> design<00:00:23.650> check<00:00:24.220> out<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.580> incredible

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
terrific design check out the incredible

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.269 
terrific design check out the incredible
detail<00:00:25.359> on<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.960> helicopter<00:00:26.650> they've<00:00:27.009> even

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
detail on the helicopter they've even

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.519 
detail on the helicopter they've even
upgraded<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:28.029> charging<00:00:28.539> port<00:00:28.779> and<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.289> plug

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
upgraded the charging port and the plug

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.200 
upgraded the charging port and the plug
so<00:00:29.560> connecting<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:30.369> up<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.670> charge<00:00:30.970> is

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
so connecting this up to charge is

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.840 
so connecting this up to charge is
easier<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.080> more<00:00:32.140> stable<00:00:32.680> than<00:00:33.010> ever<00:00:33.310> before

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850
