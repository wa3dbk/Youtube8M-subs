00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 welcome to the new workout combining of 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.180
 me again for the triceps 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.470
 upper arm by side and though has become 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.500
 that establishes something one of mine 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.840
 I do my favorite combination once 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.860
 me over head and then was 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.590
 I still pull on the cable 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.080
 the counter-movement down and now 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 I start with the short says 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 comes over when effect stable 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 stabilizes the hip stabilized 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:43.020
 the spine and that slowly down 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:51.739
 and again high in 1234 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.739
 I try to create it so critically 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:04.579
 6 set off ok and then one directly 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.579
 just like that 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:44.920
 pull backwards from waste 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:47.830
 pants pocket I make three of them 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.970
 passages in between by 60 to 90 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.430
 second break 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.380
 I try here at the head thing 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.920
 between six and eight repetitions 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.860
 close 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.460
 relatively heavy weight for a big one 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.800
 training and then in the end again 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.869
 Then pull in the cable and try 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.180
 still makes up to 15 repetitions in the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.580
 profi the triceps completely too 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.590
 exhaust as well as a superset principle 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.900
 but only for the triceps is that important 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.700
 exhale down or exhale 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.120
 Overload exhale with relief 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.550
 inhale important is violent spine 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.980
 stable and only isolated the forearms 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.550
 is still brave about the triceps 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.950
 to reach 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.360
 and if you work over trophy area 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.790
 So wanted is simply muscle 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.690
 area you should ideally between 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.489
 6 and 15 clean feasible again 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.370
 Apartments are located 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.680
 and you should also choose the exercise 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.510
 every eight to twelve weeks at the latest 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.860
 vary 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.440
 there are different possibilities 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:56.070
 Again, you can vary speed 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.200
 Weight repetition range set number 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.510
 and of course on the exercise selection and 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.400
 the sense change again and again 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.230
 through the variation and the continuity 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.120
 it will be with a good one 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.190
 we are creating a great figure 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.049
 get thanks for watching 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.150
 look at a video clips 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.860
 cook on fitness recipes 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.989
 Germany's first fitness cooking school 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.989
