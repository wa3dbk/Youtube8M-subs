00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.170 
beat do you feel like you can even get
stronger<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:03.070> course<00:01:03.370> you<00:01:03.640> know

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
stronger of course you know

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.520 
stronger of course you know
this<00:01:05.510> I<00:01:05.690> was<00:01:05.870> all<00:01:06.080> 40<00:01:06.470> which

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
this I was all 40 which

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.719 
this I was all 40 which
I<00:01:09.070> guess<00:01:09.790> leeway<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:11.500> diet<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.100> training<00:01:12.130> it

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
I guess leeway my diet and training it

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.180 
I guess leeway my diet and training it
would've<00:01:12.970> made<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.119> easier<00:01:13.570> but<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.710> had<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:14.979> long

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
would've made it easier but I had a long

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.190 
would've made it easier but I had a long
day<00:01:15.340> off<00:01:15.520> as<00:01:15.670> well<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.150> that's<00:01:16.510> how<00:01:16.659> it<00:01:16.900> kind<00:01:17.049> of

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
day off as well so that's how it kind of

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.460 
day off as well so that's how it kind of
evened<00:01:17.920> out<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.670> hopefully<00:01:19.180> like<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:20.049> said<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
evened out so hopefully like I said the

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.780 
evened out so hopefully like I said the
fight<00:01:20.890> that's<00:01:20.979> about<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> year<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.580> going<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.729> be
