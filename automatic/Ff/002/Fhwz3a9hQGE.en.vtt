that<00:02:30.150> we<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.480> do<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.310> they<00:02:32.310> went

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
that we have to do and they went

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.240 
that we have to do and they went
together<00:02:32.730> nicely<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:34.650> know<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.100> lot

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
I've done but doing this project you see

00:02:48.120 --> 00:03:34.520 
I've done but doing this project you see
results<00:02:48.600> immediately

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.510 

we<00:03:35.530> built<00:03:35.830> five<00:03:36.250> stoves<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:38.130> four<00:03:39.130> families

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
we built five stoves to four families

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.490 
we built five stoves to four families
that<00:03:39.670> were<00:03:39.760> in<00:03:39.940> need<00:03:39.970> widowers<00:03:41.310> widows<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.700> in

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
that were in need widowers widows and in

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.380 
that were in need widowers widows and in
families<00:03:44.500> with<00:03:44.710> very<00:03:44.920> young<00:03:45.250> children<00:03:45.390> the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
families with very young children the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.330 
families with very young children the
stoves<00:03:46.690> we<00:03:47.200> hope<00:03:47.380> will<00:03:47.560> be<00:03:47.680> used<00:03:47.920> instead<00:03:48.280> of

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
stoves we hope will be used instead of

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.380 
stoves we hope will be used instead of
their<00:03:49.590> instead<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.710> the<00:03:51.250> open<00:03:51.910> fires<00:03:52.150> they

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
their instead of the open fires they

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.150 
their instead of the open fires they
cook<00:03:52.570> in<00:03:53.290> their<00:03:54.130> homes<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:55.770> this<00:03:56.770> year<00:03:56.980> was

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.980 
our pilot program we had a lot of
success<00:03:59.610> as<00:04:00.610> well<00:04:01.120> as<00:04:01.210> some<00:04:01.390> difficulties

we're<00:04:02.530> tweaking<00:04:02.800> this<00:04:03.070> programming<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:04.030> we

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
we're tweaking this programming and we

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.780 
we're tweaking this programming and we
found<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.380> lot<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.560> innovative<00:04:06.040> solutions<00:04:06.550> to
