00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
well I went but I don't think this is

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.480 
well I went but I don't think this is
the<00:01:56.900> spot<00:01:57.170> right<00:01:57.200> here<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.560> were<00:01:57.680> hitting<00:01:57.890> well

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
the spot right here we were hitting well

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.860 
the spot right here we were hitting well
