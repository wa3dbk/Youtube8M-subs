00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709 
walked for a few blocks then she noticed
that<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.610> leash<00:00:12.059> was<00:00:12.240> dragging<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.660> the

that the leash was dragging on the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.629 
that the leash was dragging on the

that<00:03:17.780> hole<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.620> center<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:21.019> what<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.200> mean

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
that hole in the center and what I mean

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.940 
that hole in the center and what I mean
by<00:03:21.500> that

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
by that

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.220 
by that
not<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.549> outside<00:03:22.579> holes<00:03:23.209> these<00:03:23.719> two<00:03:24.019> middle

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
not the outside holes these two middle

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.149 
not the outside holes these two middle
goals<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.780> put<00:03:27.049> each<00:03:27.349> of<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.650> strands

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
goals and then put each of the strands

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:36.759 
goals and then put each of the strands
right<00:03:28.849> on<00:03:29.060> through<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.659> middle<00:03:29.989> hole<00:03:35.769> now

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
right on through the middle hole now

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:37.839 
right on through the middle hole now
you're<00:03:36.950> going<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.129> continue<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.609> pattern

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
you're going to continue this pattern

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:49.030 
you're going to continue this pattern
until<00:03:38.569> you're<00:03:39.049> ready<00:03:39.200> for<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.439> d-ring

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:05:32.930 

you

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.900 

now<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.570> am<00:05:34.080> ready<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.380> add<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.860> d-ring<00:05:35.250> there's

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
now I am ready to add the d-ring there's

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.460 
now I am ready to add the d-ring there's
so<00:05:36.030> much<00:05:36.150> I've<00:05:36.360> done<00:05:36.570> I<00:05:37.550> have<00:05:38.550> my<00:05:39.030> two<00:05:39.780> suede

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
so much I've done I have my two suede

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.160 
so much I've done I have my two suede
laces<00:05:41.280> on<00:05:41.580> top<00:05:42.290> what<00:05:43.290> we're<00:05:43.470> going<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.800> do<00:05:45.170> take

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
laces on top what we're going to do take

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.460 
laces on top what we're going to do take
a<00:05:46.200> pop<00:05:46.530> tab<00:05:47.360> put<00:05:48.360> it<00:05:48.480> on<00:05:48.630> like<00:05:48.960> we're<00:05:49.170> about<00:05:49.320> to

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
a pop tab put it on like we're about to

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.910 
a pop tab put it on like we're about to
continue<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:50.010> pattern<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:51.440> then<00:05:52.440> before<00:05:52.710> we

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
continue the pattern and then before we

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.400 
continue the pattern and then before we
continue<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.640> actual<00:05:54.060> pattern<00:05:54.510> we<00:05:55.080> want<00:05:55.290> to

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
continue the actual pattern we want to

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.270 
continue the actual pattern we want to
slip<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.830> d-ring<00:05:56.190> on<00:05:57.800> slip<00:05:58.800> it<00:05:58.920> right<00:05:58.950> on

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
slip the d-ring on slip it right on

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.080 
slip the d-ring on slip it right on
through<00:05:59.550> all<00:06:04.790> right

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
through all right

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.240 
through all right
so<00:06:07.050> right<00:06:07.200> now<00:06:07.380> this<00:06:07.680> is<00:06:07.830> what's<00:06:08.040> going<00:06:08.190> to

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
so right now this is what's going to

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.030 
so right now this is what's going to
look<00:06:08.400> like<00:06:09.320> we're<00:06:10.320> going<00:06:10.470> to<00:06:10.530> put<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.830> two

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
look like we're going to put the two

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:23.290 
look like we're going to put the two
laces<00:06:11.280> right<00:06:11.520> through<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.810> middle<00:06:12.960> holes

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:36.010 

that's<00:06:24.110> one

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.590 

and<00:06:36.260> that's<00:06:37.070> two<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:37.700> then<00:06:37.940> you<00:06:38.360> just

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
and that's two and then you just

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.070 
and that's two and then you just
continue<00:06:38.810> the<00:06:39.290> pattern<00:06:40.240> all<00:06:41.240> right<00:06:41.540> and<00:06:41.720> so<00:06:41.990> it

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
continue the pattern all right and so it

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.010 
continue the pattern all right and so it
looks<00:06:42.290> like<00:06:42.350> with<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:43.520> d-ring<00:06:43.880> on<00:06:44.060> there<00:06:44.780> you

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
looks like with the d-ring on there you

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.560 
looks like with the d-ring on there you
go<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:46.070> only<00:06:46.100> thing<00:06:46.520> left<00:06:46.880> is<00:06:47.210> just

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
go the only thing left is just

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.200 
go the only thing left is just
continuing<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.140> pattern<00:06:48.490> until<00:06:49.490> you<00:06:50.030> have

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
continuing the pattern until you have

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.000 
continuing the pattern until you have
the<00:06:50.390> desired<00:06:50.420> length<00:06:51.080> and<00:06:51.410> then<00:06:51.620> just<00:06:51.800> tying

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
the desired length and then just tying

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.790 
the desired length and then just tying
it<00:06:52.160> off<00:06:52.280> and<00:06:53.060> you<00:06:53.210> have<00:06:53.270> your<00:06:53.360> dog<00:06:53.630> collar<00:06:53.840> now

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
it off and you have your dog collar now

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.530 
it off and you have your dog collar now
if<00:06:54.920> you<00:06:55.010> guys<00:06:55.130> aren't<00:06:55.460> clear<00:06:55.790> on<00:06:56.030> what<00:06:56.270> to<00:06:56.420> do<00:06:56.510> I

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.700 

that<00:07:10.030> I<00:07:10.060> want<00:07:10.360> which<00:07:10.660> is<00:07:10.840> about<00:07:11.080> this<00:07:11.620> big<00:07:12.030> um

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
that I want which is about this big um

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.500 
that I want which is about this big um
while<00:07:14.710> I<00:07:14.740> was<00:07:14.920> making<00:07:15.070> this<00:07:15.370> was<00:07:15.940> not<00:07:16.180> really

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510 
while I was making this was not really

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.710 
while I was making this was not really
pain<00:07:16.750> touch<00:07:16.990> to<00:07:17.110> the<00:07:17.200> pop<00:07:17.410> tab<00:07:17.650> so<00:07:18.570> put<00:07:19.570> on<00:07:19.600> a

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 
pain touch to the pop tab so put on a

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.200 
pain touch to the pop tab so put on a
sparkly<00:07:20.650> blue<00:07:20.800> one<00:07:20.980> so<00:07:21.520> we<00:07:21.670> will<00:07:21.850> just<00:07:22.060> have<00:07:22.180> to

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
sparkly blue one so we will just have to

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.180 
sparkly blue one so we will just have to
deal<00:07:22.540> with<00:07:22.720> that<00:07:22.930> you<00:07:23.620> won't<00:07:23.770> be<00:07:23.830> able<00:07:23.920> to<00:07:24.070> see

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
deal with that you won't be able to see

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.590 
deal with that you won't be able to see
it<00:07:24.280> since<00:07:24.460> the<00:07:24.550> d-ring<00:07:24.880> is<00:07:25.030> on<00:07:25.150> the<00:07:25.270> outside

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600 
it since the d-ring is on the outside

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.540 
it since the d-ring is on the outside
but<00:07:26.910> huh<00:07:27.960> that's<00:07:28.960> unique<00:07:29.230> I<00:07:29.350> guess<00:07:29.530> that<00:07:30.460> means

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
but huh that's unique I guess that means

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.010 
but huh that's unique I guess that means
do<00:07:30.790> that<00:07:30.940> but<00:07:31.150> I'm<00:07:31.270> not<00:07:31.420> about<00:07:31.510> to<00:07:31.660> take<00:07:31.810> all

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
do that but I'm not about to take all

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.450 
do that but I'm not about to take all
this<00:07:32.170> apart<00:07:32.500> just<00:07:32.740> so<00:07:32.920> I<00:07:32.980> can<00:07:33.040> get<00:07:33.130> that<00:07:33.280> blue

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.460 
this apart just so I can get that blue

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.760 
this apart just so I can get that blue
one<00:07:33.610> out<00:07:34.710> that's<00:07:35.710> the<00:07:35.860> color<00:07:37.320> and<00:07:38.320> that's<00:07:38.560> the

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
one out that's the color and that's the

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.190 
one out that's the color and that's the
outcome
