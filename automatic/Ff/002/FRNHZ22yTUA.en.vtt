character he is the same species as

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
character he is the same species as
bruiser<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.960> can<00:00:28.109> tell<00:00:28.260> from<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.590> mask

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
bruiser as you can tell from the mask

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.790 
bruiser as you can tell from the mask
right<00:00:29.310> here<00:00:29.599> but<00:00:30.599> lives<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> different<00:00:31.619> part

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
right here but lives on a different part

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
right here but lives on a different part
of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.980> planet<00:00:32.219> that's<00:00:32.790> actually<00:00:33.329> densely

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
of the planet that's actually densely

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.459 
of the planet that's actually densely
overgrown<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.969> plants<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:37.260> have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
overgrown with plants and they have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.430 
overgrown with plants and they have
slowly<00:00:37.920> begun<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.640> grow<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.629> living<00:00:40.200> rock

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
slowly begun to grow on this living rock

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.639 
slowly begun to grow on this living rock
formation<00:00:41.070> basically<00:00:41.790> hence<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.930> dark<00:00:43.260> green

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
formation basically hence the dark green

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.790 
formation basically hence the dark green
but<00:00:44.579> also<00:00:44.879> he<00:00:45.360> lives<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.690> an<00:00:45.809> area<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.500> there

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
but also he lives in an area where there

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.160 
but also he lives in an area where there
are<00:00:46.829> lots<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.309> red<00:00:48.030> rocks<00:00:48.360> opposed<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
are lots of red rocks opposed to the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
are lots of red rocks opposed to the
dark<00:00:52.170> gray<00:00:52.410> ones<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> area<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
dark gray ones from the area that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.170 
dark gray ones from the area that
bruiser<00:00:53.940> lives<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.180> part

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
bruiser lives in and this one this part

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
bruiser lives in and this one this part
of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.510> planet<00:00:58.440> doesn't<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.010> much<00:00:59.160> magma

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
of the planet doesn't have as much magma

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.119 
of the planet doesn't have as much magma
so<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.180> why<00:01:00.329> he<00:01:00.600> has<00:01:00.780> absolutely<00:01:01.320> no<00:01:01.469> magma

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so that's why he has absolutely no magma

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.140 
so that's why he has absolutely no magma
instead<00:01:02.940> he's<00:01:03.210> got<00:01:03.420> these<00:01:03.660> vines<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.589> plants

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
instead he's got these vines and plants

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.469 
instead he's got these vines and plants
so<00:01:06.150> there's<00:01:06.869> your<00:01:07.080> backstory<00:01:08.240> don't<00:01:09.240> really

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
so there's your backstory don't really

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.080 
so there's your backstory don't really
plan<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.720> adding<00:01:10.049> any<00:01:10.470> more<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.369> I've

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
plan on adding any more to it but I've

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.859 
plan on adding any more to it but I've
never<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.720> done<00:01:12.930> backstory<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.799> my<00:01:14.869> hero

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
never really done backstory with my hero

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.010 
never really done backstory with my hero
factory<00:01:16.110> creations<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.689> don't<00:01:18.900> like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
factory creations so if you don't like

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.190 
factory creations so if you don't like
it<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.409> understandable<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:21.200> getting

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it it's understandable but getting

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.850 
it it's understandable but getting
started<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> figure<00:01:23.070> itself<00:01:24.470> he<00:01:25.470> uses

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
started with the figure itself he uses

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.270 
started with the figure itself he uses
the<00:01:26.280> green<00:01:27.829> brain<00:01:28.829> piece<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.090> took<00:01:30.329> from

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the green brain piece that I took from

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.359 
the green brain piece that I took from
agram<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.710> isn't<00:01:34.950> used

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
agram and that really isn't used

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
agram and that really isn't used
anywhere<00:01:35.790> else<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> MOC<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.140> didn't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
anywhere else on the MOC it didn't

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.010 
anywhere else on the MOC it didn't
really<00:01:37.680> seem<00:01:37.950> necessary<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> did<00:01:39.299> put<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really seem necessary but I did put in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.340 
really seem necessary but I did put in
the<00:01:40.829> medium<00:01:41.310> length<00:01:42.229> translucent<00:01:43.229> green

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the medium length translucent green

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
the medium length translucent green
pieces<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> cover<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> back

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
pieces just to kind of cover up the back

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
pieces just to kind of cover up the back
and<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> dark<00:01:46.439> gray<00:01:46.619> color<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and then the dark gray color kind of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.780 
and then the dark gray color kind of
flows<00:01:47.759> flows<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.110> back<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:50.189> also<00:01:50.280> covers

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
flows flows to the back it also covers

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.450 
flows flows to the back it also covers
out<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> back<00:01:51.299> because<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.460> rock

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
out the back because we have this rock

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
out the back because we have this rock
piece<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> right

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
piece right here and then on the right

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.679 
piece right here and then on the right
side<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.219> buying<00:01:57.060> piece<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.450> kind<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
side we have a buying piece I kind of

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.289 
side we have a buying piece I kind of
like<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.670> asymmetry<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.180> have

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
like the the asymmetry that we have

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
like the the asymmetry that we have
going<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.689> there<00:02:03.770> something<00:02:04.770> else<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.040> like

vines<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:11.520> actually<00:02:11.970> coming<00:02:12.300> down<00:02:12.480> from<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
vines are actually coming down from the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.210 
vines are actually coming down from the
sites<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.190> his<00:02:14.310> face<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.800> kind<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.010> kind

of flowing out of his flowing out of his

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.770 
of flowing out of his flowing out of his
cheeks<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.850> coordinates<00:02:21.330> well<00:02:21.600> with

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780

think the new heads work out well in
this<00:02:29.460> mock<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:29.850> well<00:02:30.000> these<00:02:30.810> translucent

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
this mock as well these translucent

this mock as well these translucent
green<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.250> because<00:02:32.370> that's<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> color<00:02:33.240> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
green just because that's the color of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.040 
green just because that's the color of
the<00:02:33.570> brain

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.340 

so<00:02:40.370> another<00:02:41.370> thing<00:02:41.490> yet<00:02:42.420> another<00:02:42.780> thing<00:02:43.110> that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.640 
so another thing yet another thing that
I<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:45.270> about<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.600> mock<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.140> you

marks have done is the the weapon I
really<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.410> how<00:02:52.680> Lego<00:02:53.340> has<00:02:53.730> made<00:02:53.970> these

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
really like how Lego has made these

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.710 
really like how Lego has made these
pieces<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.160> go<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.550> with<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.360> singular

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
pieces that just go on with the singular

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.660 
pieces that just go on with the singular
pinhole<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:58.710> have<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> axles<00:02:59.400> coming

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
pinhole and then have the axles coming

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.420 
pinhole and then have the axles coming
out<00:02:59.820> at<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.240> 90<00:03:00.720> degree<00:03:00.750> angle<00:03:01.050> that's<00:03:02.040> really

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
out at a 90 degree angle that's really

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.350 
out at a 90 degree angle that's really
useful<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.300> was<00:03:03.450> able<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.170> attach<00:03:04.740> these

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
useful and I was able to attach these

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.510 
useful and I was able to attach these
brown<00:03:06.360> connector<00:03:06.930> pieces<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.560> add<00:03:07.770> spikes<00:03:08.280> on
