badass but the most important things and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.249 
badass but the most important things and
innovation<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.030> my<00:01:48.210> opinion<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
innovation in my opinion is that the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.899 
innovation in my opinion is that the
dragon<00:01:49.590> body<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.979> not<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> second<00:01:50.820> skin

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
but it's a true armor with a very nice

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.260 
but it's a true armor with a very nice
defense<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.740> become<00:01:55.890> dragon<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.670> must<00:01:56.939> not

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
defense so to become dragon you must not

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.080 
defense so to become dragon you must not
have<00:01:57.509> any<00:01:57.570> equipped<00:01:58.079> armor<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.820> when<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> are

have any equipped armor and when you are

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.789 
have any equipped armor and when you are
transformed<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.020> only<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.409> forward<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
transformed the only way forward to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.170 
transformed the only way forward to
