00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:23.580
 the fan before the eyes works 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.850
 and see 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.300
 fagot and grace 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.840
 the play 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 tired at last 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 the theme 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.630
 It's already been good, I thought the program was 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 very good was very spiritual beautiful 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.760
 messages that speak to our hearts and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.000
 I found the coolest programming was 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.230
 that he whom the arraiais they emphasized 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.840
 quite the desire that they have to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
 his songs do not you? 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.949
 do what we can think of in the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 Bible the word right and their songs 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.210
 are based on the word we see 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.180
 a lot of spirituality the songs by 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 account and I thought this was more 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.780
 important within the message but 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.960
 God's eyes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430
 when we are weak it 's like your 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.350
 be able to perfect 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.350
 then this song is called regions 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 up to 11 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.490
 dog and my son 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.490
 eita in testimony 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.850
 It's easy for me. 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.850
 of this world 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.909
 and that my gift 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.630
 my goal 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.060
 and that acquires 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:23.540
 this p 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:26.630
 It's mane without everything you found 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.690
 songs I thought they have a basic 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.150
 spiritual very good I think they 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.400
 sure have been inspired by every 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:44.500
 letter they did and it's worth thinking about 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:47.390
 watch together in his arms 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.880
 rest 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:57.820
 tired and sound like I know you 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.820
 next to me is always 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:13.530
 Venus and Belt Pinto is God 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.530
 The fans 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.910
 jade 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.680
 some ask for your house that I made for her 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.990
 even that 's what we're born to 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.610
 I was here looking for the 4th year of 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.040
 dating I made this song in the period 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.950
 that I was seeing her and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.180
 Then the music made everything right to us. 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.920
 I finished it later, I do not know if it was the song 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.170
 if it was I promised him in case the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.819
 problem but this song will become a 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.680
 prophecy in our life of what days 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.120
 better would come clear of what God is 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.800
 God who goes beyond all things in the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.600
 same stretch for my wife Paula who 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.940
 I do not see any day of these trips she is 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.920
 a great warrior at home woman 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.870
 that takes care of our son and 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.269
 make me grow even in my absence 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.540
 I love Paulo very much, I see and it 's not for 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:16.910
 to come the one who likes to look 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.910
 horizon that is not so far 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.770
 will wait on the god that goes beyond 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.570
 I already saw joy from a distance 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.020
 hope 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:10.670
 of the crumbs we waste 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.670
 we will have dinner 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.150
 OK 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.840
 to there 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.420
 i 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.050
 ad 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.050
 isa 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.699
 to me you 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.800
 I think after programming 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.570
 of the camp and let's do it 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.699
 some questions for them 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.460
 the first one is with the expectations 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.020
 programs have been overcome as 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.810
 was to play here after you started 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.250
 five years in college feeling no 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.020
 many expectations because our 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.120
 I work even if it's to play a place. 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.800
 big a small place we have 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.470
 always the desire that in a way the 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.539
 people can find the meaning that 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.800
 the words he speaks of having a 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.770
 relationship closer to god 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.270
 through the word is our cd in 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.099
 No one really needs to record services. 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.139
 and for containment it's not important you 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.639
 record a cd but in our case this is the 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.490
 The way we found it to do 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.020
 our songs can marry people and 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.940
 make them want to have a 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.199
 renewed relationship with christ 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.639
 through the word 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.199
 therefore our purpose with the 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.820
 first cd was so with the second with 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.610
 all the others that if we go 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.289
 recording will happen the same thing as 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.900
 a person listen to our songs from 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.190
 first cd of this new cd I can speak 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.690
 Wow, I'm going to give one more chance to 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.360
 scripture plus a relationship to 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:49.060
 God is this, it was always our desire to 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:49.060
 Wear it on your eyes and smile
