00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.529
 Hello, you are welcome

 my pies and cake world is coming today 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.590
 a delicious Turkish despite app of 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.230
 me 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.230
 that is then off and rule the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.519
 really super delicious taste the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.190
 I did that and I went to work 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.199
 taken and everyone was thrilled 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.910
 I also really like to eat 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.850
 I do the many different ones 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 variants but I'll show you first 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.890
 a contrat sap and how you like that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 can prepare intentionally and then you can 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.510
 your natural bag of course 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 you want to pack or you can do that nicely 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 roses women bake 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.559
 I'll tell you both variants today 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.690
 once croissants and in roses form 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.549
 As I said I have other recipes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.899
 that you can then look at me 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.620
 get to the link again 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.229
 Add 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.159
 Now I'll show you the ingredients first 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:59.459
 We need first for the dough 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:04.290
 250 grams of butter 1 1 5 tablespoons of milk 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:06.180
 lukewarm two tablespoon yogurt on 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.660
 packet of baking powder 1 packet 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.860
 vanilla sugar 100 grams of powdered sugar and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.510
 100 g of cornstarch and flour I do 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 then I always feel like you 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.890
 then I'll say how much I do 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.409
 taken 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.450
 First I will use the soft butter 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:30.560
 milk yogurt and eggs mix so 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.510
 everything liquid is food starch 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.660
 I have for myself and then I would 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.640
 just in there with powdered sugar give 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.520
 then so slowly that more pure 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.869
 I have that is because I gram flour 400 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.560
 I'll see how much I get out of it 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.840
 use 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.800
 as I said I do everything according to feeling 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:02:07.190
 but for you I'll look again 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:10.570
 that's exactly how it was exactly 550 grams 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.310
 flour sits that simply stands up in rome 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.670
 We need three to fill 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.140
 four apples really clean apples then 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.450
 i have had nuts here i will 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.209
 easy in a freezer bag small 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.690
 chop and have a tablespoon of sims i have 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.700
 the apples peeled and grated and 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.360
 will give the then fry briefly 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.720
 a bit of icing sugar into it and that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.280
 call me here right now 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.560
 Love are taste so I do 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.799
 the herd, and then simply give the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.970
 window still coins and leave it that 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.730
 is a cool 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:56.989
 I am going to make little balls out of content 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:01.090
 mold so i just wanted with one 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.090
 blood and partly off 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.530
 with a pizza cutter just with me 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.530
 so carvings 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:25.590
 Here comes the filling easy 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.590
 curl up and make a croissant 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.540
 I have from the part small ball 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.860
 shaped as big as a walnut and 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:18.299
 then simply evaluate these from the outside 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:21.240
 always three pieces next to each other and the 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.770
 are then simply superimposed 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.610
 so if it is so superimposed 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.530
 then you can just up here 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.110
 but the filling rows do not diminish 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.000
 below because we have the detail down there 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:41.860
 you could cut that off 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:45.180
 Just roll it up and then like that 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.180
 a rose shape 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.680
 the file under then becomes easy 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.520
 cut off you can either with 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:01.480
 a knife or a dental 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.490
 then it looks like we cut off 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.470
 did not fill in below 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.370
 because I knead it like that and 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.370
 can roll out 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:43.659
 it do I type 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.370
 175 degrees about twenty minutes now 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.550
 I'll be plenty with powdered sugar 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.259
 Sprinkle and chill 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.050
 then you can eat here 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:56.520
 Of course, interest still hears channel sound 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.520
 in powdered sugar 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.660
 because my apple cinnamon pastry in croissants 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.990
 form these are really delicious 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.570
 I can only recommend you 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.760
 because my apple cinnamon pastry in roses 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.260
 out of shape are really great too 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.360
 have become delicious 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.210

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.190
