it's<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.639> waiver<00:00:14.940> light<00:00:15.180> built<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:16.410> build<00:00:16.740> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
it's a waiver light built this build it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.010 
it's a waiver light built this build it
you<00:00:17.580> know<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> PTR<00:00:18.330> video<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
you know it is a PTR video so that

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.480 
you know it is a PTR video so that
doesn't<00:00:19.170> mean<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.650> build<00:00:19.920> will<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.190> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
doesn't mean that this build will be a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.300 
doesn't mean that this build will be a
good<00:00:20.760> alive<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.660> season<00:00:22.050> too<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.949> anyway<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
good alive and season too but anyway a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.040 
good alive and season too but anyway a
lot<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> people<00:00:23.910> want<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.179> play<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> PTR<00:00:24.840> right

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
lot of people want to play the PTR right

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.269 
lot of people want to play the PTR right
now<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.439> they're<00:00:25.529> questioning<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
now and they're questioning what the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.339 
now and they're questioning what the
best<00:00:26.429> build<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> moment<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.259> my

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
best build is at the moment and in my

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
best build is at the moment and in my
opinion<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.519> far<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> best<00:00:30.000> build

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
opinion this is so far the best build

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
opinion this is so far the best build
that<00:00:31.019> might<00:00:31.169> change<00:00:31.380> tomorrow<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:32.160> next<00:00:32.310> week

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
that might change tomorrow or next week

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.140 
that might change tomorrow or next week
but<00:00:32.790> anyway<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.780> why<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> made<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.500> video

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
but anyway that's why I made this video

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.520 
but anyway that's why I made this video
also<00:00:36.150> I<00:00:36.329> might<00:00:36.690> use<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> couple<00:00:37.230> different

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
also I might use a couple different

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.869 
also I might use a couple different
skills<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> other<00:00:38.010> monks<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.399> using<00:00:38.760> but

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
skills and other monks are using but

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.090 
skills and other monks are using but
personal<00:00:39.480> preferences<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.620> depending

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
personal preferences and also depending

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.369 
personal preferences and also depending
on<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.460> doing<00:00:41.700> grifts<00:00:42.079> rifts<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.230> greater

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
on if you doing grifts rifts for greater

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.790 
on if you doing grifts rifts for greater
rifts<00:00:43.649> anyway<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.329> built<00:00:45.809> resolves<00:00:46.649> around

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
rifts anyway the built resolves around

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.420 
rifts anyway the built resolves around
wave<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.789> light<00:00:48.059> pillar<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.690> ancients<00:00:49.430> that's

wave of light pillar of ancients that's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.849 
wave of light pillar of ancients that's
this<00:00:50.670> belt<00:00:50.940> looks<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.320> throw

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
this belt looks like this you just throw

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:54.560 
this belt looks like this you just throw
your<00:00:53.100> wave<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> light<00:00:53.640> underground<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> damage

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
your wave a light underground and damage

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.009 
your wave a light underground and damage
enemies<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> reason<00:00:56.340> why<00:00:56.699> monks<00:00:57.359> are<00:00:57.510> using

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
enemies the reason why monks are using

this<00:00:58.550> particular<00:00:59.550> skill<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.809> does

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this particular skill is because it does

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
this particular skill is because it does
a<00:01:01.260> lot<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.649> single<00:01:01.800> target<00:01:02.129> damage<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a lot of single target damage because of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.310 
a lot of single target damage because of
the<00:01:03.149> dot<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:04.980> here<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.340> does<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:06.320> 785

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the dot you can see here it does a 785

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.420 
the dot you can see here it does a 785
percent<00:01:08.210> over<00:01:09.210> 3<00:01:09.659> seconds<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.770> works

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
percent over 3 seconds and that works

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
percent over 3 seconds and that works
are<00:01:11.640> very<00:01:11.880> well<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.720> I'll<00:01:12.810> show<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.259> bit

why because it's working very well with
the<00:01:15.479> swk<00:01:16.080> set<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.710> remake<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.659> we<00:01:18.659> don't

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the swk set the remake that is we don't

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450 
the swk set the remake that is we don't
you<00:01:19.229> might<00:01:19.409> notice<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.220> use<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
have no problem with surviving you can

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
have no problem with surviving you can
also<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:50.250> insight<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.149> will<00:01:51.329> give<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
also use insight which will give you a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.209 
also use insight which will give you a
little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.079> extra<00:01:52.320> spiritual<00:01:52.860> regeneration

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
little bit extra spiritual regeneration

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.760 
little bit extra spiritual regeneration
but<00:01:53.969> for<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.240> build<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.079> should<00:01:55.259> use<00:01:55.409> desert

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
but for this build you should use desert

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.190 
but for this build you should use desert
shrub<00:01:56.270> then<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.360> use<00:01:57.479> dashing<00:01:57.990> strike
