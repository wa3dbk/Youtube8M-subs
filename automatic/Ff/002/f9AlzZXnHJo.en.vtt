00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.320
 here we have the more beauty connectors with it the open mouse the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.730
 keyboard violated 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.690
 the spokespersons of the serial ports mainly used for them 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.869
 printers or two devices 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.970
 electronic 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 we have video ports 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.130
 the vga port 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.130
 and wearing a baby brochu the screen 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.310
 usb connectors 2 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.940
 the pole gims 45 for the network cable 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.090
 and connectors for the loss of sound the direct mail 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.520
 here is a community of hard drives 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.350
 what is the capacity of the hard drives 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.820
 as a result of these 80 gigabytes stable in September it's starting to be a 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.260
 little 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 the past 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.439
 on average between 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.500
 from 300 to 500 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.690
 What is it 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.920
 these barrettes of ram 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770
 documentary 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 to make data access memory 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.340
 then it's a support an announcement of the very nature of these 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.920
 change 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.970
 so if there is still this processor 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 of thermal paste in their contacts by then I place myself 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 victor valdes with my style 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 the process 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.210
 what is it for 7 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.870
 it's the fate of the computer 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.020
 so here we have motherboard education challenge 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 another source of thousands of votes 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
 so it's a year for mathias tx 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.819
 I recognize the motherboard 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.179
 so on the motherboard in power 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.809
 this augmentation 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.269
 lactalis website here 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 and here 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.779
 so we have rather ambiguous 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.779
 for data transfer to ten dvd player pumps 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.599
 floppy drive pleaded for me 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.519
 it's harder 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.099
 the e-sata port 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.099
 which also serves for hard drives and cd player 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.279
 michele of ram strips 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.279
 Different colors of tienee pump is different 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.739
 the spokesperson of the processor 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 so wish it is called 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.709
 pci ports for summed cards 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.469
 the pci express 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.469
 this particular used for a video card 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.219
 here we have the northbridge 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.979
 who controls the processing of info from this part of a whole 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.999
 the hard disk of the processor 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.099
 and rowing 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.749
 here the southbridge I controlled info 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:26.899
 readers 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.899
 and additional cards 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.089
 after a short respite 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.329
 I am very happy 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.559
 ubs and brewing 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.559
 if that's the wiring abbey 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:53.409
 kiir in theaters 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.409
 after three years of absence 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.969
 against each other 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.789
 with settings 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.099
 the detonations 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.659
 it is then probable 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.150
 it is to know anyway 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
 that's life 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.919
 in front of a computer 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.090
 slightly 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.090
 fernandinho set up 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.689
 Montreal, Nov. 24 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.759
 process data 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.759
 tavares 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.229
 the encounter 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.229
 final with the earth a blog 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.580
 and you know 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.689
