a nice wide standing platform and you

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.870 
a nice wide standing platform and you
got<00:00:31.290> a<00:00:31.320> good<00:00:31.619> long<00:00:31.890> wheelbase<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.579> keep<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
got a good long wheelbase to keep you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900 
got a good long wheelbase to keep you
stable<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.750> also<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.469> these<00:00:34.949> drop<00:00:35.609> through

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
stable you also have these drop through

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.329 
stable you also have these drop through
truck<00:00:36.239> mountings<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.289> give<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> little

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
truck mountings to give you a little

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.310 
truck mountings to give you a little
lower<00:00:38.640> center<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> gravity<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:40.109> going<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
lower center of gravity it's going to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.569 
lower center of gravity it's going to
keep<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.589> little<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:40.949> stable<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.460> high

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
keep you a little more stable at high

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
keep you a little more stable at high
speeds<00:00:41.609> so<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.899> great<00:00:43.410> board<00:00:43.679> if<00:00:43.829> you're

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
speeds so a great board if you're

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.680 
speeds so a great board if you're
learning<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.370> escape<00:00:44.999> some<00:00:45.179> downhill<00:00:45.359> because

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
learning to escape some downhill because

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
learning to escape some downhill because
got<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> long<00:00:46.739> wheelbase<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.269> got<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
got that long wheelbase and you got that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
got that long wheelbase and you got that
lower<00:00:48.690> center<00:00:49.019> of<00:00:49.050> gravity<00:00:49.140> gonna<00:00:49.769> keep<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
lower center of gravity gonna keep you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.860 
lower center of gravity gonna keep you
stable<00:00:50.339> also<00:00:51.030> gives<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.629> lower

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
stable also gives you a little lower

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
stable also gives you a little lower
leverage<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.559> truck<00:00:52.859> so<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.190> easier<00:00:53.429> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
leverage on your truck so it's easier to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.389 
leverage on your truck so it's easier to
push<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.879> your<00:00:54.059> slides<00:00:54.769> good<00:00:55.769> board<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.069> free

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
push out your slides good board for free

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.180 
push out your slides good board for free
riding<00:00:56.609> for<00:00:56.969> those<00:00:57.059> reasons<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.600> well<00:00:58.190> it's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
riding for those reasons as well it's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.709 
riding for those reasons as well it's
also<00:00:59.339> got<00:00:59.609> these<00:00:59.760> cool<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.059> features<00:01:00.510> here

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
also got these cool little features here

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
also got these cool little features here
with<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.929> little<00:01:01.170> gas<00:01:01.409> pedal<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.789> your

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
with a little gas pedal so you have your

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.930 
with a little gas pedal so you have your
full<00:01:03.300> steepness<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.470> concave<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.580> then

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
full steepness of concave here and then

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.850 
full steepness of concave here and then
outwards<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.050> that<00:01:07.260> you've<00:01:07.500> got<00:01:07.650> these

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
outwards from that you've got these

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
outwards from that you've got these
little<00:01:07.920> gas<00:01:08.340> pedals<00:01:08.760> coming<00:01:09.060> down<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:09.870> of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
little gas pedals coming down a lot of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
little gas pedals coming down a lot of
gas<00:01:10.110> pedals<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.860> shave<00:01:11.190> off<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
gas pedals will kind of shave off that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
gas pedals will kind of shave off that
little<00:01:12.000> concave<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.690> have<00:01:12.810> less<00:01:13.020> concave

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
little concave so you have less concave

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.860 
little concave so you have less concave
not<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.550> same<00:01:15.180> steepness<00:01:15.480> all<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
not with this one same steepness all the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.410 
not with this one same steepness all the
way<00:01:15.960> through<00:01:16.230> and<00:01:16.440> then<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.340> those<00:01:18.090> gas

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
way through and then you have those gas

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.790 
way through and then you have those gas
pedals<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.840> outside<00:01:19.260> so<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.620> wrap

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
pedals on the outside so you can wrap

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.140 
pedals on the outside so you can wrap
your<00:01:19.860> toes<00:01:20.220> around<00:01:20.430> they're<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.730> little<00:01:21.030> more

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
your toes around they're a little more

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
your toes around they're a little more
spot<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> give<00:01:21.870> some<00:01:22.080> leverage<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.440> your<00:01:22.590> board

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
spot to give some leverage on your board

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.170 
spot to give some leverage on your board
when<00:01:23.370> you're<00:01:23.490> trying<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.730> push<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.060> your

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
when you're trying to push out your

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.020 
when you're trying to push out your
slides<00:01:24.450> great<00:01:25.380> feature<00:01:25.620> there<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.700> also<00:01:26.820> got

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
slides great feature there it's also got

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.250 
slides great feature there it's also got
the<00:01:27.150> cutouts<00:01:27.480> here<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:27.870> you'll<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.050> on

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
the cutouts here which you'll see on

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.750 
the cutouts here which you'll see on
most<00:01:28.410> drop-through<00:01:28.800> boards<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
most drop-through boards because you

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.000 
most drop-through boards because you
have<00:01:29.910> that<00:01:30.090> lower<00:01:30.330> platform<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:31.590> wheels<00:01:31.800> are

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
have that lower platform your wheels are

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.530 
have that lower platform your wheels are
gonna<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.460> close<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> your<00:01:32.940> board<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> have

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
gonna be close to your board so you have

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.930 
gonna be close to your board so you have
this<00:01:33.660> cutout<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> run<00:01:35.070> real<00:01:35.730> big

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
this cutout so that you can run real big

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.670 
this cutout so that you can run real big
wheels<00:01:36.180> without<00:01:36.390> worrying<00:01:36.780> about<00:01:36.990> wheel<00:01:37.410> bite

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
wheels without worrying about wheel bite
