00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hello folks and welcome back to our sea

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.509 
hello folks and welcome back to our sea
gladiators<00:00:04.290> today<00:00:05.130> we<00:00:05.430> do<00:00:05.670> review<00:00:07.519> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
gladiators today we do review the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.730 
gladiators today we do review the
difference<00:00:08.910> between<00:00:09.090> pigs<00:00:10.019> pitch<00:00:10.820> and

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
difference between pigs pitch and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:25.480 
difference between pigs pitch and
coaxial<00:00:14.089> RC<00:00:15.089> helicopters<00:00:20.810> let's<00:00:21.810> start<00:00:22.230> off

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:34.400 

yeah<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:28.130> fixed<00:00:29.130> pitched<00:00:32.450> these<00:00:33.450> helicopters

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
yeah a fixed pitched these helicopters

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.299 
yeah a fixed pitched these helicopters
are<00:00:35.250> often<00:00:35.760> called<00:00:36.110> fixed<00:00:37.110> pitch<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.649> single

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
are often called fixed pitch a single

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.690 
are often called fixed pitch a single
rotor<00:00:39.320> single<00:00:40.320> order<00:00:40.649> isn't<00:00:40.829> more<00:00:41.190> sensible

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
rotor single order isn't more sensible

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
rotor single order isn't more sensible
name<00:00:42.170> we<00:00:43.170> talk<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.500> fixed<00:00:43.920> picture<00:00:44.280> what

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
name we talk about fixed picture what

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.069 
name we talk about fixed picture what
that<00:00:44.579> means<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:45.239> single<00:00:45.629> board<00:00:45.840> basically

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that means what single board basically

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.180 
that means what single board basically
means<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:49.230> lifts<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
means is you get all your lifts in this

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.410 
means is you get all your lifts in this
rotor<00:00:53.960> in<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.170> rule<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.680> here

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
rotor in this rule right here

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.849 
rotor in this rule right here
it's<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.379> top<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's the kind of at the top from the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.950 
it's the kind of at the top from the
main<00:00:59.190> motor<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.570> main<00:01:01.320> motor<00:01:01.559> spins

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
main motor so when this main motor spins

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.170 
main motor so when this main motor spins
it<00:01:03.960> spins<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.830> direction<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.850> when<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it spins in this direction and when it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
it spins in this direction and when it
spins<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.689> direction<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.860> goes<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
spins in that direction it goes in a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.520 
spins in that direction it goes in a
helicopter<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.939> turn<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:10.020> way

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
helicopter to turn this way

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.210 
helicopter to turn this way
but<00:01:11.250> tell<00:01:11.670> pushes<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.689> air<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
but tell pushes out air that way and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
but tell pushes out air that way and
that<00:01:14.400> air<00:01:14.610> turns<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> helicopter<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.900> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that air turns to helicopter this way it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.609 
that air turns to helicopter this way it
keeps<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.530> straight<00:01:17.030> when<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> slows<00:01:18.509> down<00:01:18.619> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
keeps it straight when it slows down the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.600 
keeps it straight when it slows down the
talk<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> main<00:01:20.400> notice<00:01:22.340> overpowers<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
talk from the main notice overpowers and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.440 
talk from the main notice overpowers and
makes<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> turning<00:01:24.659> left<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.970> speeds<00:01:27.270> up

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
makes it turning left when it speeds up

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.440 
makes it turning left when it speeds up
the<00:01:27.810> talk<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> tail<00:01:28.979> motor<00:01:29.450> overpowers

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the talk from the tail motor overpowers

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.520 
the talk from the tail motor overpowers
and<00:01:30.810> turns<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:33.030> takes<00:01:33.390> less<00:01:33.810> power<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and turns right it takes less power to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.070 
and turns right it takes less power to
turn<00:01:34.770> left<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> does<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> turn<00:01:36.030> right

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.280 

a<00:01:42.740> coaxial<00:01:43.740> helicopter<00:01:43.820> however<00:01:45.290> doesn't

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
a coaxial helicopter however doesn't

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.020 
a coaxial helicopter however doesn't
need<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> tail<00:01:46.860> you'll<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.790> does<00:01:48.000> not

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
need a tail you'll see this one does not

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
need a tail you'll see this one does not
have<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:50.640> lift<00:01:51.180> comes<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.870> two<00:01:52.170> main

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
have one this lift comes from two main

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190 
have one this lift comes from two main
rotors<00:01:52.980> which<00:01:53.820> allows<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.510> which<00:01:55.050> allows

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
rotors which allows it which allows

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.910 
rotors which allows it which allows
these<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.090> heavier<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.410> weight<00:01:58.410> lifters

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
these to be heavier and weight lifters

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.020 
these to be heavier and weight lifters
and<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.660> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> main<00:02:01.500> rotor<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:02.820> one

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and so this is the main rotor this one

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
and so this is the main rotor this one
at<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.240> top<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.720> mean<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.470> main<00:02:04.650> rotor

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
at the top I mean it is the main rotor

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.440 
at the top I mean it is the main rotor
and<00:02:07.050> it<00:02:07.620> spins<00:02:08.070> in<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:08.640> direction<00:02:08.820> which

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and it spins in this direction which

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.270 
and it spins in this direction which
makes<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.840> helicopter<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.560> made<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.040> way

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
makes the helicopter is made this way

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.610 
makes the helicopter is made this way
well<00:02:12.240> at<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> top<00:02:12.720> from<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.930> bottom<00:02:13.050> rotor

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
well at the top from the bottom rotor

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.600 
well at the top from the bottom rotor
spins<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:16.080> way<00:02:16.350> which<00:02:16.740> makes<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.160> turn<00:02:17.310> this

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
spins this way which makes it turn this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.150 
spins this way which makes it turn this
week<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.360> they<00:02:18.840> constantly<00:02:19.380> fight<00:02:19.890> each<00:02:20.010> other

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
week so they constantly fight each other

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.949 
week so they constantly fight each other
over<00:02:20.459> torque<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.230> want<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.530> turn<00:02:22.740> left

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.070 

this<00:02:28.040> slows<00:02:29.040> down<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.970> speeds<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
this slows down in the speeds up the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.500 
this slows down in the speeds up the
difference<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.650> 12<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.310> turn<00:02:32.520> left<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
difference of 12 it's a turn left the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.699 
difference of 12 it's a turn left the
same<00:02:33.780> thing<00:02:34.050> when<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.290> want<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.500> turn<00:02:34.650> right

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
same thing when you want to turn right

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.540 
same thing when you want to turn right
this<00:02:35.550> speeds<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.290> slows<00:02:37.860> down<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
this speeds up and this slows down to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.710 
this speeds up and this slows down to
turn<00:02:38.760> right<00:02:43.250> if<00:02:44.250> you're<00:02:44.459> looking<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.090> start

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
turn right if you're looking to start

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.240 
turn right if you're looking to start

pitch can actually change the pitch of
the<00:04:26.990> rollers<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:27.650> they're<00:04:28.640> not<00:04:28.930> angled<00:04:29.930> like

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
the rollers so they're not angled like

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.790 
the rollers so they're not angled like
this<00:04:30.170> they<00:04:30.890> lie<00:04:31.160> flat<00:04:31.300> then<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.420> circle<00:04:32.840> just

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
this they lie flat then the circle just

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.560 
this they lie flat then the circle just
like<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.190> ones<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.580> these<00:04:34.760> that<00:04:35.060> make<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.360> move

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
like the ones on these that make it move

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.230 
like the ones on these that make it move
forward<00:04:36.500> back<00:04:36.740> side<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.580> side<00:04:39.310> those<00:04:40.310> change

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
forward back side to side those change

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.470 
forward back side to side those change
the<00:04:41.480> pitch<00:04:41.860> zero<00:04:42.860> pitch<00:04:43.130> which<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.670> flat<00:04:43.940> it's

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
the pitch zero pitch which is flat it's

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.380 
the pitch zero pitch which is flat it's
not<00:04:44.720> going<00:04:45.020> anywhere

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
not going anywhere

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.660 
not going anywhere
positive<00:04:47.390> pitch<00:04:47.600> which<00:04:47.930> is<00:04:48.110> like<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:48.980> will

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
positive pitch which is like this will

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
positive pitch which is like this will
go<00:04:49.730> up<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:50.680> negative<00:04:51.680> pitch<00:04:52.270> which<00:04:53.270> pushes<00:04:53.570> the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
go up a negative pitch which pushes the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.130 
go up a negative pitch which pushes the
air<00:04:53.990> downward<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:55.250> what<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.550> means<00:04:55.700> is<00:04:56.140> you

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
air downward and what that means is you

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.310 
air downward and what that means is you
can<00:04:57.200> fly<00:04:57.590> upside<00:04:58.100> down<00:04:58.310> with<00:04:58.550> no<00:04:58.700> problem

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
can fly upside down with no problem

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.040 
can fly upside down with no problem
that's<00:05:00.320> collective<00:05:00.980> pitch<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.870> change<00:05:02.870> the

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
that's collective pitch you change the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.910 
that's collective pitch you change the
pitch<00:05:03.260> fixed<00:05:03.710> pitch<00:05:04.090> fixed<00:05:05.090> means<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.680> can't

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
pitch fixed pitch fixed means you can't

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.219 
pitch fixed pitch fixed means you can't
move<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.510> and
