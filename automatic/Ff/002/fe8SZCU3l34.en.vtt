information<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> best<00:01:05.610> scan<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> PCI

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
information the best scan is a PCI

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.649 
information the best scan is a PCI
compliance<00:01:07.860> scan<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.119> scan<00:01:09.420> that's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
compliance scan it's the scan that's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
compliance scan it's the scan that's
required<00:01:10.020> by<00:01:10.409> credit<00:01:10.799> card<00:01:10.830> companies<00:01:11.430> like

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
required by credit card companies like

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.679 
required by credit card companies like
Visa<00:01:12.110> MasterCard<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> American<00:01:13.470> Express<00:01:14.689> why

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Visa MasterCard and American Express why

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
Visa MasterCard and American Express why
is<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.049> important<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> website

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
is this important because when a website

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.109 
is this important because when a website
passes<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> PCI<00:01:19.140> compliance<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.880> all

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
passes a PCI compliance can you know all

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.359 
passes a PCI compliance can you know all
the<00:01:21.390> security<00:01:21.960> holes<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.439> vulnerabilities

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the security holes or vulnerabilities

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.890 
the security holes or vulnerabilities
have<00:01:23.640> been<00:01:23.790> closed<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.509> your

have been closed and that your
information<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.770> safe<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.780> know

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
information is safe so how do you know

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.010 
information is safe so how do you know
if<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.350> site<00:01:28.619> has<00:01:28.829> been<00:01:29.009> scanned<00:01:29.329> first<00:01:30.329> look

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
if a site has been scanned first look

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410 
if a site has been scanned first look
for<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> security<00:01:31.829> scans<00:01:32.340> seal<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
for a security scans seal from one of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.440 
for a security scans seal from one of
the<00:01:33.540> top<00:01:33.810> scanning<00:01:34.320> sites<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.920> trust<00:01:35.189> guard

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the top scanning sites like trust guard

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.800 
the top scanning sites like trust guard
second<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.990> sure<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.500> seal<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.130> real

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
second make sure that the seal is real

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
second make sure that the seal is real
third<00:01:39.810> look<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> certificate<00:01:41.159> with

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
third look for a certificate with

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.969 
third look for a certificate with
detailed<00:01:42.270> information<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.470> site<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
detailed information about the site and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.850 
detailed information about the site and
the<00:01:44.280> scan<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:45.299> example<00:01:45.810> you'll<00:01:46.409> notice<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the scan for example you'll notice that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.280 
the scan for example you'll notice that
trust<00:01:47.369> guard<00:01:47.640> seals<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.240> quite<00:01:48.540> detailed<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
trust guard seals are quite detailed and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
trust guard seals are quite detailed and
they<00:01:49.500> always<00:01:49.770> include<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.549> website<00:01:50.970> or

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
they always include the website or

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.960 
they always include the website or
company's<00:01:51.720> name<00:01:51.960> inside<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.740> seal<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
company's name inside the seal this

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.539 
company's name inside the seal this
makes<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.479> seal<00:01:54.720> harder<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> copy<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.920> will

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
makes the seal harder to copy it will

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
makes the seal harder to copy it will
also<00:01:56.700> say<00:01:57.149> past<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:58.020> today's<00:01:58.439> date<00:01:58.740> or<00:01:58.979> valid

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
also say past with today's date or valid

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.780 
also say past with today's date or valid
through<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.299> future<00:02:00.810> date<00:02:00.990> next<00:02:01.920> drag<00:02:02.610> your
