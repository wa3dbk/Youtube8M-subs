Salman Khan about Jay who I think it's

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.330 
Salman Khan about Jay who I think it's
just<00:01:47.219> another<00:01:47.749> film<00:01:48.749> for<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> masses<00:01:49.590> just

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
intellectual I think it'll be like the

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.309 
intellectual I think it'll be like the
rest<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> his<00:01:57.179> movies<00:01:57.539> there'll<00:01:57.929> be<00:01:57.990> lots<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
rest of his movies there'll be lots of

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.859 
rest of his movies there'll be lots of
action<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.039> there'll<00:01:59.789> be<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.999> lot<00:02:00.389> of<00:02:00.420> defying

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
action and there'll be a lot of defying

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.199 
action and there'll be a lot of defying
of<00:02:01.049> physic<00:02:01.350> laws<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:02.009> at<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.819> didn't<00:02:03.119> like

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
the songs already released and waiting

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.190 
the songs already released and waiting
for<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.489> movie<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.390> Salman<00:02:27.840> Khan<00:02:28.019> Mubi

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
for the movie and it's Salman Khan Mubi

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.539 
for the movie and it's Salman Khan Mubi
as<00:02:28.379> he<00:02:28.530> said<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:28.829> it's<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> hit

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
as he said so it's going to be a hit

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.550 
as he said so it's going to be a hit
after<00:02:29.909> all<00:02:30.030> Salman<00:02:30.450> Khan's<00:02:30.720> movie<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.409> has

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
after all Salman Khan's movie so it has

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160 
after all Salman Khan's movie so it has
to<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.799> good<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.579> Salman<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.510> my<00:02:33.629> best<00:02:33.840> actor

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
to be good and Salman is my best actor

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.740 
to be good and Salman is my best actor
so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.620> think<00:02:34.769> he's<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> brilliant<00:02:35.220> action<00:02:35.750> hero

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
so I think he's a brilliant action hero

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.899 
so I think he's a brilliant action hero
but<00:02:37.409> then<00:02:37.560> acting<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.010> somewhere<00:02:38.280> very<00:02:38.459> nice<00:02:38.640> I

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
but then acting is somewhere very nice I

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.680 
but then acting is somewhere very nice I
don't<00:02:39.690> really<00:02:40.049> like<00:02:40.319> Salman<00:02:41.099> Khan<00:02:41.540> acting<00:02:42.540> or

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
don't really like Salman Khan acting or

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.420 
don't really like Salman Khan acting or
action<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.290> any<00:02:43.530> otherwise<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:44.099> don't<00:02:44.310> think

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
action or any otherwise I don't think

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.830 
action or any otherwise I don't think
it's<00:02:44.519> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:44.910> really<00:02:45.150> good<00:02:45.269> then<00:02:45.510> it's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
it's going to be really good then it's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.660 
it's going to be really good then it's
like<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.849> Salman<00:02:48.209> swim<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.870> eat

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670
