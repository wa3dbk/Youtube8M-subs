00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to set it for each role is something

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.840

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.230 
to remember now is sports interactive in
implementing<00:02:52.530> these<00:02:52.680> new<00:02:52.740> formations<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.730> now

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
implementing these new formations it now

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.180 
implementing these new formations it now
means<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.840> computer<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> AI<00:02:55.860> are

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
means that the computer and the AI are

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.470 
means that the computer and the AI are
going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> use<00:02:56.550> these<00:02:56.760> tactics<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.390> these

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
going to use these tactics and these

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.330 
going to use these tactics and these
formations<00:02:57.780> when<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.530> play<00:02:58.770> against<00:02:59.100> them

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.580 
and your tactics I'm hoping that this
can<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.210> far<00:03:09.450> more<00:03:09.480> challenging<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.470> that

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
can be far more challenging and that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.750 
can be far more challenging and that
we're<00:03:10.680> gonna<00:03:10.800> see<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> lot<00:03:11.160> more<00:03:11.220> kind<00:03:11.640> of

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
timeline which is great and I'm hoping

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.750 
the timeline is a lot more usable than
it<00:05:25.560> was<00:05:25.680> this<00:05:25.830> year<00:05:26.070> because<00:05:26.160> for<00:05:26.400> me<00:05:26.520> it

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
it was this year because for me it

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.610 
it was this year because for me it
always<00:05:26.940> felt<00:05:27.240> clunky<00:05:27.479> when<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.900> used<00:05:28.229> it<00:05:28.410> it

didn't quite do what I wanted to do and
it<00:05:30.780> also<00:05:30.990> looks<00:05:31.320> like<00:05:31.470> they've<00:05:31.590> improved

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890
