00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and it's the low carbon layer so many

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.440 
and it's the low carbon layer so many
people<00:00:58.200> ask<00:00:58.950> me<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.430> how<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.270> make

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
ok so first let's make the nylons coated

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.859 
ok so first let's make the nylons coated
steel<00:01:07.590> wire<00:01:07.940> well<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.860> nylon<00:01:11.250> coating

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
steel wire well the the nylon coating

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
steel wire well the the nylon coating
with<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.050> soft<00:01:13.440> flex<00:01:13.679> steel<00:01:13.890> wire<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
with the soft flex steel wire and the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.639 
with the soft flex steel wire and the
similar<00:01:15.209> types<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.289> wires<00:01:16.649> is<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.649> real

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
similar types of wires is the real

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.620 
similar types of wires is the real
important<00:01:20.310> part<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.789> making<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.330> letter

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
important part of making this letter

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960 
important part of making this letter
because<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.470> nylon<00:01:22.800> coating<00:01:23.190> can<00:01:23.550> actually

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
because the nylon coating can actually

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.100 
because the nylon coating can actually
be<00:01:24.090> melted<00:01:24.599> and<00:01:24.780> used<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.830> attach<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:27.390> bond<00:01:27.690> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
be melted and used to attach to bond the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
be melted and used to attach to bond the
letter<00:01:28.349> to<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.860> school<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.000> show<00:01:30.179> you

make a light ok so you just take steel

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.150 
make a light ok so you just take steel
copper<00:01:44.670> wire<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.330> will<00:01:45.539> use<00:01:45.899> 20<00:01:46.560> pounds<00:01:46.950> for

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
copper wire I will use 20 pounds for

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.229 
copper wire I will use 20 pounds for
most<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.550> my<00:01:47.640> situation<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:49.170> will<00:01:49.410> even<00:01:49.739> go

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.239 
most of my situation and I will even go

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.029 
most of my situation and I will even go
with<00:01:51.239> 15<00:01:51.899> pounds<00:01:52.319> it's<00:01:52.440> really<00:01:52.770> enough

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
with 15 pounds it's really enough

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.460 
with 15 pounds it's really enough
because<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.910> connection<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.599> so<00:01:54.780> strong<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
because this connection is so strong you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.399 
because this connection is so strong you
don't<00:01:55.500> need<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
don't need a

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.539 
don't need a
later<00:01:57.009> material<00:01:57.579> okay<00:01:58.299> so<00:01:58.979> run<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.039> letter

through the eye of a snap real simple

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.360 
through the eye of a snap real simple
make<00:02:05.439> like<00:02:06.450> five<00:02:07.799> till<00:02:08.799> seven<00:02:09.369> reps<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:11.370> now

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
make like five till seven reps and now

make like five till seven reps and now
with<00:02:12.910> an<00:02:13.090> even<00:02:13.510> move

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
with an even move

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.660 
with an even move
you<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.069> melt<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> non-coding<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
you have to melt the non-coding the the

non-coding you have to do it with an
even<00:02:22.420> move<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.440> melt<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.769> too<00:02:23.950> much<00:02:24.129> but

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
even move not to melt it too much but

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.940 
even move not to melt it too much but
you<00:02:24.819> have<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.239> melt<00:02:25.390> melt<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.989> enough<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.709> hold

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
you have to melt melt it enough to hold

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.030 
you have to melt melt it enough to hold
the<00:02:27.310> wraps<00:02:27.549> it's<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.680> complicated<00:02:29.680> but

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the wraps it's not that complicated but

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.710 
the wraps it's not that complicated but
you<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.790> some<00:02:30.970> practice<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.480> do<00:02:31.599> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
you have to have some practice to do it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.900 
you have to have some practice to do it
so<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.530> make<00:02:32.980> an<00:02:33.129> even<00:02:33.370> move<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:33.849> you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
so you just make an even move and you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.449 
so you just make an even move and you
can<00:02:34.060> visibly<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.750> when<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.799> coding<00:02:36.250> is

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
can visibly see when the the coding is

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.280 
can visibly see when the the coding is
getting<00:02:36.760> mail

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.830 

okay<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:43.790> side<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.090> over<00:02:45.939> and<00:02:46.939> I'll<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:47.450> make

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
okay one side is over and I'll just make

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.710 
okay one side is over and I'll just make
the<00:02:48.230> same<00:02:48.439> thing<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:49.310> other<00:02:49.340> side<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:50.120> will

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
the same thing on the other side I will

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.020 
the same thing on the other side I will
use<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.680> length<00:02:51.860> about<00:02:53.500> half<00:02:54.500> metre<00:02:54.879> so<00:02:55.879> how<00:02:56.000> I

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
use the length about half metre so how I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.649 
use the length about half metre so how I
will<00:02:56.840> take<00:02:57.140> my<00:02:57.590> next<00:02:57.860> we'll<00:03:01.090> make<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.360> same

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
will take my next we'll make the same

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.199 
will take my next we'll make the same
nine<00:03:02.989> five<00:03:03.440> or<00:03:03.590> ten<00:03:03.799> reps<00:03:04.129> but<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.489> will<00:03:04.700> destroy

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
nine five or ten reps but I will destroy

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.119 
nine five or ten reps but I will destroy
all<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.629> side<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.019> can<00:03:06.200> be<00:03:06.349> open<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> can

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
all on the side it can be open so I can

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.300 
all on the side it can be open so I can
free<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.500> we'll<00:03:09.500> do<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.799> same<00:03:10.010> thing

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
free it and we'll do the same thing

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.869 
free it and we'll do the same thing
again<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.930> an<00:03:11.930> even<00:03:12.200> move<00:03:12.409> melt<00:03:13.189> the<00:03:13.579> nylon

again with an even move melt the nylon

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:23.070 
again with an even move melt the nylon
coding

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.040 

okay<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.840> will<00:03:25.840> free

catch some water debris or weeds so you

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.200 
catch some water debris or weeds so you
just<00:03:57.870> heat<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.170> up<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.560> bit<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.520> press<00:03:59.910> with

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210
