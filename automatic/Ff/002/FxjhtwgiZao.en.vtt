00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
know because it's a big race I know the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.200 
know because it's a big race I know the
start<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.329> important<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.380> never<00:00:35.149> happen<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
start is important this never happen a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.530 
start is important this never happen a
little<00:00:36.329> crush<00:00:36.750> also<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.329> have

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
little crush also and then also you have

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.319 
little crush also and then also you have
to<00:00:39.690> look<00:00:39.809> after<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.920> few<00:00:41.579> important<00:00:42.059> teams

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to look after like few important teams

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.619 
to look after like few important teams
so<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.930> didn't<00:00:43.710> want<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.629> bad

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
so we didn't want to be in a bad

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
so we didn't want to be in a bad
position<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:46.980> throw<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
position so we just don't throw like a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.350 
position so we just don't throw like a
few<00:00:47.820> teams<00:00:48.800> when<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.309> team<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.579> chasing<00:00:50.969> like

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
few teams when the team is chasing like

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.200 
few teams when the team is chasing like
Niki<00:00:51.750> share<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.410> chasing<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.030> we

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
Niki share is chasing there and then we

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
Niki share is chasing there and then we
just<00:00:54.449> control<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> breaker<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> cause<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> was

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
just control the breaker it cause it was

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.119 
just control the breaker it cause it was
like<00:00:55.890> 17<00:00:56.550> minutes<00:00:56.879> something<00:00:57.230> but<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.590> quite

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
like 17 minutes something but I quite

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
like 17 minutes something but I quite
like<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
like it or not when it's like this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.270 
like it or not when it's like this
because<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.289> mean<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.890> finder

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
because then it's mean that the finder

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.889 
because then it's mean that the finder
is<00:01:02.399> always<00:01:02.730> fun<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is always fun because we don't have to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.370 
is always fun because we don't have to
go<00:01:04.049> any<00:01:04.580> any<00:01:05.580> time<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.350> big

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
go any any time and then it's just a big

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
go any any time and then it's just a big
possibility<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:08.970> better<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
possibility you know so it's better you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.590 
possibility you know so it's better you
have<00:01:09.750> no<00:01:09.930> time<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> rest<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.250> end<00:01:11.600> it's

75 80 K an hour we can see everyone
pushing<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.110> 5311<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:26.040> corners<00:01:26.520> we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
pushing like on the 5311 the corners we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.510 
pushing like on the 5311 the corners we
go<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.299> gas<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.810> come<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.740> very

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.359 
go with for gas you come it's like very
unique<00:01:29.939> descent<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.860> really<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.040> fast

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
unique descent because we really go fast

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.940 
unique descent because we really go fast
and<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> positioning<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.259> important<00:01:34.799> at

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and the positioning is so important at

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.819 
and the positioning is so important at
the<00:01:35.070> bottom<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> car<00:01:36.150> back<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.530> see

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829

mightily<00:02:43.250> strong<00:02:43.579> but<00:02:44.329> then<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.480> make<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
mightily strong but then I make the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.280 
mightily strong but then I make the
difference<00:02:45.799> meter<00:02:46.459> by<00:02:46.760> meter<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:47.299> know<00:02:47.329> you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290
