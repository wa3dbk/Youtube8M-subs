the baby hair the baby hair is much
longer<00:00:55.109> on<00:00:56.749> this<00:00:57.749> unit<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.800> body<00:00:59.010> wave<00:00:59.339> versus

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
longer on this unit the body wave versus

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.500 
longer on this unit the body wave versus
the<00:01:00.829> natural<00:01:01.829> wave<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> could<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.269> course

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the natural wave but it could of course

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.370 
the natural wave but it could of course
just<00:01:03.929> be<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.440> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:06.230> texture<00:01:07.230> of<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
just be because of the texture of the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.250 
just be because of the texture of the
hair<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.540> mean<00:01:09.840> she's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
hair I don't know but I mean she's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.540 
hair I don't know but I mean she's
beautiful<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:12.860> there's<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.010> many<00:01:14.160> things

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
beautiful and there's so many things

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.870 
beautiful and there's so many things
that<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.590> her<00:01:16.880> so

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that you can actually do with her so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:29.690 
that you can actually do with her so
many<00:01:18.150> things

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.209 

and<00:01:30.079> one<00:01:31.079> thing<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.189> about

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
and one thing that I really like about

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.660 
and one thing that I really like about
the<00:01:33.000> body<00:01:33.240> wave<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.530> once<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.070> curl<00:01:35.399> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the body wave is that once you curl the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.240 
the body wave is that once you curl the
body<00:01:35.850> wave<00:01:36.149> those<00:01:36.899> curls<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.710> lasts<00:01:38.159> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
body wave those curls really lasts in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.969 
body wave those curls really lasts in
there<00:01:38.460> an<00:01:38.610> extremely<00:01:39.240> long<00:01:39.420> time<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.229> although

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
I did take me a long time to curl and i

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.200 
I did take me a long time to curl and i
just<00:01:43.229> want<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> mention<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.070> i<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:44.640> using<00:01:44.909> my

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
have the dial settings and they probably

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.990 
have the dial settings and they probably
don't<00:02:36.810> even<00:02:36.989> make<00:02:37.319> these<00:02:37.500> anymore<00:02:37.769> but<00:02:38.400> once

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
don't even make these anymore but once

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.620 
don't even make these anymore but once
you<00:02:39.420> know<00:02:39.569> i<00:02:39.900> did<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.560> least<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:41.489> side<00:02:41.940> then<00:02:42.480> I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
you know i did at least this side then I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.270 
you know i did at least this side then I
was<00:02:42.810> good<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.139> go<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.590> started<00:02:44.130> remembering

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
was good to go and I started remembering

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
was good to go and I started remembering
and<00:02:44.910> getting<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> feel<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.900> curlers<00:02:46.410> but

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and getting the feel of the curlers but

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.680 
and getting the feel of the curlers but
they're<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.639> really<00:02:47.760> good<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
they're really really good so this is

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.259 
they're really really good so this is
