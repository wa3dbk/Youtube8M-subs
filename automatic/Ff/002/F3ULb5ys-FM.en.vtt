 hello to all and I hope you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.390
 Well here for the future of the steam agent 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.370
 eight for a new tutorial today 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 we will continue so the following of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.530
 our training dedicated to creation 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.719
 of a site in flash design so 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.439
 today we will realize the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.160
 html css montage of our model 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.630
 photoshop 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 so I can find you the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.920
 here present training 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.849
 you just have to type everything in the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.490
 search bar 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.460
 flatt design and you are going to land on 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 this training so this training 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.430
 was devoted to creating the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 mockup on photoshop 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.489
 today we are going to be able and well 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.879
 cutting and climbing and then blow 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.770
 make it a website pages we 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.129
 let's learn a lot from 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.320
 does a particular to make small 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.390
 animations like these in jquery at 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920
 rollover on our network icons 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.670
 social 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.100
 and then of course we will be able to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.830
 scrolled directly to our menu you 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.220
 see we click on service we arrive 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.229
 directly on and well start keep 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.630
 so the interest of a website 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.390
 Paige is that the entire 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.180
 site content of the site is on the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 same page so there you see that if I 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 go back on so welcome back 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 well at the top of the site 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.950
 and here I am going to ask you to do 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.780
 attention down right you go 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 see that as soon as we will dig a 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.189
 little bit and well a little button is going 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.189
 appear that will allow us to 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.350
 go back directly also to the top of the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.270
 site you see so we'll learn 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.400
 install all at a little button 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.880
 automatic appearing to manage his 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.740
 animation and so it's a page 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.920
 reference is there you also see that 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.220
 the interest also of this formation it is 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.049
 to keep a menu always apparent 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.840
 no matter where you go 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.079
 so this is really the interest of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.979
 training too so we're going 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.329
 realize a small gallery then with 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.970
 a small interaction sent to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.910
 wheels 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.340
 1 the pictures become how in 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.430
 colors so it's kind of 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.670
 portfolio infiltrated of course so here in 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.530
 As an example, we put the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.260
 same images that go what is repeated 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.510
 in white gold so with possibility of everything 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 display two filters and based on 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.240
 case of the categories that we are going 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.300
 insert in our code is of course at 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.910
 click a livebox that will allow us 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.240
 to display in large our image our 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.459
 reference with a little button next which 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.440
 will also be able to afford us low of 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.250
 navigate in our mail grid 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.580
 previous and next down previous 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.520
 next down here we have so a 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.900
 button to close the gallery if we 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.209
 go back to the top of the site 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.250
 we have exactly the same thing also on 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.920
 the latest projects for example add 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.110
 so alexis review the project we have a 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.080
 livebox so it's the same livebox so 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.270
 there you see we have four 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.739
 projects in the home page so we 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.060
 will create a group of four that she 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.660
 simply allows us to 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.150
 navigate 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.400
 you see images of four the image 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.560
 there now three out of four and images 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.810
 four out of four that are we 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.519
 so allow to navigate very 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.090
 easily between different 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:32.320
 galleries we have we go so 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.260
 create a contact page with the creation 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.120
 so of course a contact form 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.280
 and there you see that at the rollover on the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.920
 different fields and well the color 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.019
 change course info 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.630
 complementary small google maps 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.959
 as well useful we will create 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.000
 fully with php a captcha so 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.489
 all a plan that avoids 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 to receive from Spain 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:03.220
 so we can even do a little test 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:09.470
 so we go up to small but damien a 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:14.780
 address at the pif a subject quote request 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:17.989
 and test messages so we see that 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.049
 if we copy the cap ja and click 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.850
 on send and well everything works 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.900
 correctly your message was well 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.300
 sent 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.400
 and you will receive it in your 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:34.010
 mailbox 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:36.850
 so the opposite if the cap cat is bad 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.850
 informed 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.940
 so I make an express mistake and that I 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.010
 click on send you see that a 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.260
 message tells us that cap cat is 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.290
 invalid so with a small link back 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.630
 to the form so to retype it 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.240
 we will also see in a second time 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.220
 how to make this site responsive to 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.340
 that it adapts to any terminal 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.440
 like the phone 's from the table is 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.800
 so here here in this case we take 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.030
 an example we will be based on ipad 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.720
 so we can see right away too 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.120
 so that the site changes the graphics of the 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.970
 site changes so there we are on the format 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.640
 ipad portrait you see that the 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:24.169
 resolution and 768 pixels wide by 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:27.290
 1024 high so the graphics change the 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.120
 menu takes 100% of the width and then 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.580
 finally finally any merchant animations 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.950
 jquery also works 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:38.120
 well in short everything walks the gallery and 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.280
 well filterable to rollover them 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.100
 transitions blends perfectly 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.460
 so here we will see how small to 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.740
 small transformed the layout of the site 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.290
 if you have questions she well there 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.120
 do not hesitate to ask me I 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.169
 find you right away for 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.169
 start the tutorial
