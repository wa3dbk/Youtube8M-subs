00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
hey everyone this is a machine affect

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.620 
hey everyone this is a machine affect
our<00:00:05.190> killer<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:06.029> has<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> crystal<00:00:06.839> focus<00:00:07.290> inside

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
our killer it has a crystal focus inside

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.810 
our killer it has a crystal focus inside
this<00:00:09.630> was<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.260> more<00:00:10.889> tougher

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
this was one of the more tougher

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.549 
this was one of the more tougher
installs<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.570> I've<00:00:12.690> had<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.080> recently

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
installs that I've had to do recently

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.799 
installs that I've had to do recently
and<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.580> put<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> lot<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.240> man-hours<00:00:15.540> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
and the one I put a lot of man-hours and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.650 
and the one I put a lot of man-hours and
I'm<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.920> 10<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:18.199> it<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:20.580> client<00:00:21.119> requested

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
I'm up to 10 on it the client requested

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.660 
I'm up to 10 on it the client requested
that<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.140> switches<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.920> located<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.640> here

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that the switches be located up here

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
that the switches be located up here
which<00:00:24.300> made<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> rather<00:00:24.990> difficult<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.650> fit

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
which made it rather difficult to fit

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.210 
which made it rather difficult to fit
with<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> crystal<00:00:26.970> focus<00:00:27.359> inside<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.019> had<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.920> get

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
with a crystal focus inside I had to get

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.640 
with a crystal focus inside I had to get
a<00:00:29.429> little<00:00:29.609> bit<00:00:29.849> creative<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.900> also<00:00:31.170> did

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a little bit creative with it I also did

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
a little bit creative with it I also did
some<00:00:31.859> extra<00:00:32.279> weathering<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.360> just

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
some extra weathering on this one just

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.010 
some extra weathering on this one just
because<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.559> wanted<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> look<00:00:35.460> unique<00:00:36.020> from

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
because I wanted it to look unique from

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.209 
because I wanted it to look unique from
an<00:00:37.200> irregular<00:00:37.920> machine<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.460> star<00:00:38.790> killer

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
an irregular machine of that star killer

an irregular machine of that star killer
the<00:00:41.219> keoki<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> bottle<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:43.290> a
