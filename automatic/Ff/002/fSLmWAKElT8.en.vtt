we could have happened for a number of

we could have happened for a number of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
really good reasons here's a list of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270 
really good reasons here's a list of
reasons<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.020> noticed<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.159> my

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
reasons that I noticed going on with my

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.719 
reasons that I noticed going on with my
own<00:01:17.460> fails<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.060> friends<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> mine<00:01:19.549> just<00:01:20.549> not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
own fails and friends of mine just not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.060 
own fails and friends of mine just not
having<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> together<00:01:21.710> maybe<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> gave

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
having it together maybe you gave

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
having it together maybe you gave
yourself<00:01:23.220> five<00:01:23.729> weeks<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> study<00:01:24.299> when<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
yourself five weeks to study when you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
yourself five weeks to study when you
really<00:01:25.200> needed<00:01:25.530> eight<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> number

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
really needed eight this is the number

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870 
really needed eight this is the number
one<00:01:27.420> reason<00:01:27.570> most<00:01:27.960> people<00:01:28.110> fail<00:01:28.670> looking<00:01:29.670> back

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
one reason most people fail looking back

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.440 
one reason most people fail looking back
it's<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.479> best<00:01:30.750> reason<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> fail<00:01:31.530> an<00:01:31.710> exam<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
it's the best reason to fail an exam I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.850 
it's the best reason to fail an exam I
failed<00:01:33.450> both<00:01:33.720> building<00:01:34.259> systems<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
failed both building systems and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.399 
failed both building systems and
structural<00:01:35.610> systems<00:01:36.030> because<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.110> didn't

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
structural systems because I just didn't

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
structural systems because I just didn't
have<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> complete<00:01:38.100> understanding<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
have a complete understanding of the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.330 
have a complete understanding of the
material<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.689> later<00:01:40.680> went<00:01:40.860> back<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
material I later went back and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.780 
material I later went back and
assassinated<00:01:42.090> those<00:01:42.240> exams<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:44.399> were<00:01:44.549> dead

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
assassinated those exams you were dead

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.030 
assassinated those exams you were dead

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
site planning and design was my third

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
site planning and design was my third
test<00:01:49.229> when<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> took<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.640> had<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> lot<00:01:51.420> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
test when I took it I had a lot of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.399 
test when I took it I had a lot of
momentum<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.380> c.d.s<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> PPP<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> studied

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
momentum from c.d.s and PPP so I studied

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.160 
momentum from c.d.s and PPP so I studied
my<00:01:55.590> buns<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.659> mastered<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> vignettes

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
my buns off I mastered the vignettes

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.010 
my buns off I mastered the vignettes
inside<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.280> memorized<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.390> types<00:02:00.750> of

for this test when I started the exam
many<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> questions<00:02:14.580> weren't<00:02:15.060> even

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
many of the questions weren't even

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.630 
many of the questions weren't even
slightly<00:02:15.780> geared<00:02:16.260> towards<00:02:16.830> site<00:02:17.069> planning<00:02:17.370> in

outside of what I studied

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.900 
outside of what I studied
I<00:02:21.450> had<00:02:22.380> several<00:02:22.620> calculations<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.610> wasn't

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I had several calculations that I wasn't

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.270 
I had several calculations that I wasn't
prepared<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.319> moved<00:02:25.739> through<00:02:25.890> the

prepared for and as I moved through the
multiple-choice<00:02:26.730> questions<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.630> was

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
multiple-choice questions I was

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.490 
multiple-choice questions I was
continually<00:02:28.650> tagging<00:02:29.160> them<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.489> WTF<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:31.110> to

continually tagging them as WTF and to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.250 
continually tagging them as WTF and to
review<00:02:31.890> later<00:02:32.420> when<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> got<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.870> vignettes

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.400 
I took the test anyway definitely
unprepared<00:03:50.220> funny<00:03:51.090> thing<00:03:51.359> is<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.750> actually<00:03:51.780> did

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
unprepared funny thing is I actually did

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.160 
unprepared funny thing is I actually did
way<00:03:52.709> better<00:03:53.100> than<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.430> ever<00:03:53.609> thought<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.940> would

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
way better than I ever thought I would

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.690 
way better than I ever thought I would
this<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.530> dumbest<00:03:55.859> reason<00:03:55.980> ever<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.430> fail

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
this is the dumbest reason ever to fail

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.180 
this is the dumbest reason ever to fail
don't<00:03:57.329> be<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> fool<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.380> was<00:03:59.540> the<00:04:00.540> good<00:04:00.690> news

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
don't be a fool like I was the good news

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.319 
don't be a fool like I was the good news
honestly<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.549> worst<00:04:02.760> thing<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.000> can<00:04:03.269> happen

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
honestly the worst thing that can happen

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.420 
honestly the worst thing that can happen
is<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.870> will<00:04:03.989> lose<00:04:04.200> your<00:04:04.350> test<00:04:04.620> exam<00:04:04.920> fee<00:04:05.160> and

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
is you will lose your test exam fee and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.699 
is you will lose your test exam fee and
you<00:04:05.970> cannot<00:04:06.269> retake<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.959> exam<00:04:07.049> for<00:04:07.440> six

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
you cannot retake the exam for six

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.539 
you cannot retake the exam for six
months<00:04:08.239> that's<00:04:09.239> basically<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.870> worst<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.200> it

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
months that's basically the worst of it

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.890 
months that's basically the worst of it
luckily<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.700> have<00:04:12.030> also<00:04:12.299> learned<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.690> there

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
luckily I have also learned that there

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.129 
luckily I have also learned that there
are<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.139> few<00:04:13.230> positives<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.130> failing<00:04:14.549> an<00:04:14.670> exam

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
are a few positives in failing an exam

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.479 
are a few positives in failing an exam

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.910 
seriously and bone up on that
information<00:04:30.240> maybe<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.260> should<00:04:31.440> add<00:04:31.620> in<00:04:31.830> a

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920
