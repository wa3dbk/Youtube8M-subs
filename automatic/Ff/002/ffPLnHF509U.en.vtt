00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
I think basically it's just time that I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.809 
I think basically it's just time that I
finished<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:22.139> series<00:03:22.620> once<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.639> for<00:03:23.790> all

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
and I mean I can't just be judging this
