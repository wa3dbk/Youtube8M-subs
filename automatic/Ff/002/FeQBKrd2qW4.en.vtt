00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.190
 if you want to know something under the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 Keyword kiel have in germany 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.710
 actually went wrong is one 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.450
 look in the press 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.820
 in terms of so-called harder ones 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.169
 disciplines the harder disciplines that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 the subjects are the german students 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.970
 ward off the front and after high school also 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.850
 so reluctantly study at all 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.380
 Mathematics and physics come to the fore 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 the press after the terrorist attack in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.640
 New York 2001 turned out yet 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.050
 that some data offenders in craft 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.210
 engineering-based 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.770
 and did not describe the vehicles 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 any planning but curved 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.690
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.579
 about one of these assassins quote his 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.409
 subjects were mathematics mechanics and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.239
 Mechanical engineering must be a dash 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:47.039
 so nothing of social 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.789
 relevant for all engineers in the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.530
 audience with this time have written 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.870
 but that diligently strained relationship that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.399
 has announced to the harder disciplines 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.699
 Already a month before me 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.179
 quote the ride to 17 august 2001 the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.310
 Great French mathematician company 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:13.290
 came on 17 august 1601 so today 300 ago 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.900
 at least to the world at least was 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.640
 One should be the father of number theory 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 difficult so-called diouf 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.280
 table equations with integer ones 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.940
 solutions is equal to 2001 1601 first 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.410
 work through time 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.670
 but if now yes yes thinks the taz is 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.600
 that a bit the old venerable one 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.980
 aunt in the german press a lot 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.660
 imposing but boring also ours 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.240
 glorious südbeck from munich always 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.220
 Young naughty and left liberal also has 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.470
 certain problems with mathematics and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 makes the agency message 6 percent 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.340
 All Munich theater tickets are 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.720
 Free passes can pay any short 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.720
 sixth card a free card 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.930
 have that anni or should calculate that 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 and as the new line from the railway 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.710
 ingolstadt nuremberg was inaugurated the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:12.450
 fz thrilled the three sheep slopes 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:16.440
 up to 40 that is a reason 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.500
 the 40 percent wants to applaud 40 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.670
 we are not bad either but 40 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.930
 In any case, you do not have to be a mathematician 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.160
 be to see that something is not there 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.680
 Every car driver knows how to tune 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.630
 questioned 14 percent rise had 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.760
 harlachinger bergamt you must pack 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 Always get off the bike and in the car 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.459
 you have to get this first 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.260
 Otherwise , Karl wanted to 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.209
 backwards and even if they have one 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.010
 SUVs have one thing for whatever 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.950
 the big riddle of our time why 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.880
 does man need a SUV yes 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.140
 if you would make the most sense 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.610
 off-road vehicles only if they are on 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.500
 Friday afternoon with the off-road vehicle 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 stuck in the three games, the highway jam 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.280
 then somehow trick to the right 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.720
 On the footstep I fight for then 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.120
 happy in the right angle over the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.019
 potato fields of it but yes 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.609
 that dares such a 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.530
 SUV driver not because then 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.660
 nice suv yes daily are 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.280
 So even if you could do that 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.730
 SUVs then he manages if 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.640
 you're good at 43 35 percent and the 600 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.350
 meter long 800 ton heavy ic3 loses 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.209
 happy with 300 things 40 percent 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.430
 uphill says the focus 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.380
 then again registered instead of seven 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.530
 the researchers 14 deaths an increase 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.549
 by 50 percent now not only laugh 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.530
 all ten difficult if you are from seven 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.180
 For 14 years we have the seven 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.549
 have done seven more or 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.739
 the whole thing is done and the whole thing is 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.310
 an increase of 100 percent yes ok 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.810
 she learned what was okay well from the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.790
 press can lose any I have 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.950
 stopped collecting but some 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.470
 especially many still from the memory 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.430
 let them kempten on Allgäuer newspaper 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.380
 there you could read 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.970
 The number of nights has changed 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.989
 in comparison to the last season around the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.989
 half doubled 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.720
 after a long pondering I am to the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.510
 result she is the same 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.920
 stayed because if only what 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.510
 then half would take 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.180
 they are right where they started 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.870
 but have just in time 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.199
 especially in times of economic 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.759
 Stagnation sounds doubled significantly 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.919
 more dynamic than optimistic 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.970
 So you have stayed the same if you are in 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.800
 the industry work and one 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.509
 to deliver the annual report must say 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 Do not say the sales stagnated 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:32.410
 you have the turnover in half 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.880
 from porsche and will be thrilled 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.650
 also from the german private school is 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.479
 No improvement expected 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.490
 well-known private school from Lower Saxony 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.080
 has an internet presence with the 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.699
 lurid headline that was as 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.949
 facsimile in the mirror printed with the 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.270
 lurid headline four out of three 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.270
 Germans can not speak 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.729
 my ladies and gentlemen may the situation 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:05.219
 seriously is that the situation had seriously been 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.949
 always knew that by now 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.239
 have already come so far and that 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.069
 next example I have again 

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:13.619
 photocopied otherwise no one believes that 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:17.309
 was a newspaper from augsburg gets 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:20.329
 the one reads to the one fifth 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:22.319
 So almost 80 percent 

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:23.879
 what about this fifth of the 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:29.939
 population problems with the 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:32.899
 so he has that is one 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:35.339
 clear case of a 50 film professionals 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.849
 she is the first five to 80 percent off 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:39.839
 have problems with 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:47.399
 but most beautiful I think 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:52.819
 actually this almost came anyway 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:52.819
 it also has a bit of a difference for him ok
