the washes you're gonna see where all

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429 
the washes you're gonna see where all
this<00:02:00.030> texture<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:00.810> comes<00:02:01.140> into<00:02:01.350> play

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
this texture really comes into play

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.600 
this texture really comes into play
you'll<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.159> beautiful<00:02:02.610> designs<00:02:04.340> out<00:02:05.340> of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you'll get some beautiful designs out of

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:15.820 
you'll get some beautiful designs out of
this<00:02:05.700> texturing

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.800 

so<00:02:16.370> I'm<00:02:16.490> not<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.640> pulling<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.390> with<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.720> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
so I'm not just pulling it with just the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.320 
so I'm not just pulling it with just the
flat<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.170> my<00:02:18.200> brush<00:02:18.470> I'm<00:02:18.650> using<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.010> edge

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.600 

pulling<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.870> way<00:02:26.990> down<00:02:27.200> until<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.370> get

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
pulling it all the way down until I get

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.220 
pulling it all the way down until I get
to<00:02:30.580> basically<00:02:31.580> right<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:32.240> because<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.080> is

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
to basically right here because this is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
to basically right here because this is
where<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.590> switches<00:02:33.860> over<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.820> leaves

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
where it switches over and the leaves

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.050 
where it switches over and the leaves
petals<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.960> flower<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.890> are<00:02:37.100> behind<00:02:37.520> it

petals of the flower that are behind it

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.760 
petals of the flower that are behind it

at<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.880> 2<00:02:50.030> o'clock<00:02:50.060> line<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:52.010> gets<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.310> little

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
at the 2 o'clock line it gets a little

at the 2 o'clock line it gets a little
darker<00:02:53.030> as<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.210> goes<00:02:53.270> around<00:02:53.600> not<00:02:54.050> much<00:02:54.350> very

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
darker as it goes around not much very

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.410 
darker as it goes around not much very

subtle when you've got the front part of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.750 
subtle when you've got the front part of
the<00:02:56.510> flower<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.500> then<00:02:57.650> when<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:57.890> get<00:02:58.100> back<00:02:58.490> to

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
the flower but then when you get back to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.720 
the flower but then when you get back to
the<00:02:58.850> back<00:02:59.260> the<00:03:00.260> next<00:03:00.560> lightest<00:03:01.010> area<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.490> going

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
the back the next lightest area is going

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.890 
the back the next lightest area is going
to<00:03:01.790> be<00:03:01.940> at<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.300> top<00:03:02.710> right<00:03:03.710> up<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:03.980> here<00:03:04.900> and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
to be at the top right up in here and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.710 
to be at the top right up in here and
this<00:03:06.020> is<00:03:06.200> going<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.350> make<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.710> look

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
this is going to make it look

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.160 
this is going to make it look
three-dimensional

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
three-dimensional

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.330 
three-dimensional
now<00:03:09.890> as<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.220> come<00:03:10.430> around<00:03:11.710> I've<00:03:12.710> got<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.190> think

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
now as I come around I've got to think

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.710 
now as I come around I've got to think
in<00:03:13.520> terms<00:03:13.550> of<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.000> getting<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.330> little<00:03:14.570> bit

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
in terms of it getting a little bit

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.420 
in terms of it getting a little bit
darker<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.590> darkest<00:03:16.070> part<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.310> my

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
darker so that the darkest part of my

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.190 
darker so that the darkest part of my
flowers<00:03:16.880> gonna<00:03:17.060> be<00:03:17.210> right<00:03:17.420> here<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:18.050> going

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
flowers gonna be right here it's going

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.530 
flowers gonna be right here it's going
to<00:03:18.260> be<00:03:18.440> in<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.710> most<00:03:18.950> shade<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.730> any<00:03:20.330> of<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
to be in the most shade of any of the

brush<00:04:05.360> wait<00:04:05.989> pull<00:04:06.770> it<00:04:06.890> down<00:04:07.070> as<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.520> go<00:04:07.550> down<00:04:07.970> a

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
brush wait pull it down as I go down a

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.490 
brush wait pull it down as I go down a
little<00:04:08.270> bit<00:04:08.390> I'm<00:04:08.750> picking<00:04:09.020> up<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.200> little<00:04:09.350> bit

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
little bit I'm picking up a little bit

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.300 
little bit I'm picking up a little bit
more<00:04:09.620> my<00:04:09.830> black<00:04:11.200> mixing<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.320> up<00:04:12.350> keeping<00:04:13.220> it

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
more my black mixing it up keeping it

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.659 
more my black mixing it up keeping it
warm<00:04:13.610> but<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:14.150> little<00:04:14.630> bit<00:04:14.750> more<00:04:14.930> shadow<00:04:15.200> and

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
warm but a little bit more shadow and

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.140 
warm but a little bit more shadow and
lightly<00:04:16.669> bring<00:04:17.030> these<00:04:17.299> together<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:20.000> the

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
lightly bring these together so that the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.580 
lightly bring these together so that the
deepest<00:04:20.540> area<00:04:20.810> is<00:04:20.900> gonna<00:04:21.049> be<00:04:21.169> right<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.410> here

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
deepest area is gonna be right in here

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.050 
deepest area is gonna be right in here
and<00:04:21.890> then<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.160> will<00:04:22.310> give<00:04:22.430> me<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.610> wonderful

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
and then this will give me a wonderful

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.360 
and then this will give me a wonderful
contrast<00:04:23.540> right<00:04:24.200> in<00:04:24.380> here<00:04:24.740> once<00:04:24.979> I<00:04:25.100> start

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
contrast right in here once I start

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.550 
contrast right in here once I start
doing<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.240> lighter<00:04:26.479> go<00:04:26.990> back<00:04:27.169> in<00:04:27.380> with<00:04:27.500> a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
doing it lighter go back in with a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.409 
doing it lighter go back in with a
little<00:04:27.800> bit<00:04:27.890> of<00:04:27.919> my<00:04:28.070> white<00:04:28.370> still<00:04:28.880> got

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
together so that you get a nice soft

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.950 
together so that you get a nice soft
blend<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.550> there's<00:04:34.729> no<00:04:34.849> real<00:04:35.060> transition<00:04:35.569> line

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
blend so there's no real transition line

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.709 
blend so there's no real transition line
where<00:04:36.289> shadows<00:04:36.669> are<00:04:37.669> coming<00:04:37.879> in<00:04:38.210> see<00:04:38.599> what
