put a well I'll show you a little trick
to<00:02:53.740> keep<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.190> from<00:02:54.340> taking<00:02:54.550> fall<00:02:54.970> damage

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.000 

here's<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.540> sign<00:02:58.840> I'm<00:02:59.440> gonna<00:02:59.620> put<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.890> right

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
here's a sign I'm gonna put it right

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.750 
here's a sign I'm gonna put it right
there<00:03:00.420> next<00:03:01.420> I'm<00:03:02.230> going<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.740> get<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.160> bucket<00:03:03.580> of

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
there next I'm going to get a bucket of

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.600 
there next I'm going to get a bucket of
water<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:07.110> think<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:08.200> got<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.380> bucket<00:03:08.680> out<00:03:08.860> here

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.070 

now<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.090> trick<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.510> learned<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.870> long

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
now this is a trick I learned a long

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.460 
now this is a trick I learned a long
time<00:03:14.140> ago<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.800> if<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.400> fall<00:03:16.239> through<00:03:16.470> water

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
time ago that if you fall through water

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.940 
time ago that if you fall through water
before<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.340> hit<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.610> ground<00:03:19.470> you'll<00:03:20.470> not

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
before you hit the ground you'll not

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.580 
before you hit the ground you'll not
take<00:03:21.190> damage<00:03:21.700> as<00:03:21.880> long<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.780> waters<00:03:23.140> within

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
take damage as long as the waters within

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.820 
take damage as long as the waters within
three<00:03:23.950> or<00:03:23.980> four<00:03:24.100> blocks<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:25.680> where<00:03:26.680> you're

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
three or four blocks of where you're

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.090 
three or four blocks of where you're
landing<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:29.950> should<00:03:30.100> work<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.400> fine<00:03:30.730> for

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
landing and it should work just fine for

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.800 
landing and it should work just fine for
the<00:03:33.100> elevator<00:03:33.610> because<00:03:34.000> sometimes<00:03:34.420> you'll<00:03:34.660> go

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the elevator because sometimes you'll go

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.990 
the elevator because sometimes you'll go
up<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.350> then<00:03:35.470> you'll<00:03:36.100> get<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.489> little<00:03:36.640> bit<00:03:36.760> too

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
up and then you'll get a little bit too

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.259 
up and then you'll get a little bit too
far<00:03:37.269> away<00:03:37.390> from<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:38.019> elevator<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.730> then

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
far away from the elevator and then

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.220 
far away from the elevator and then
you'll<00:03:40.420> fall<00:03:40.540> back<00:03:40.780> down<00:03:42.450> I'll<00:03:43.450> have<00:03:43.630> this<00:03:43.780> two

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
you'll fall back down I'll have this two

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.250 
you'll fall back down I'll have this two
squares<00:03:44.560> up<00:03:44.820> also<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:46.090> could<00:03:46.420> use<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:47.140> an

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
squares up also I could use this as an

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.500 
squares up also I could use this as an
entrance<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.920> an<00:03:48.250> exit<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.940> can<00:03:49.030> go<00:03:49.150> up<00:03:49.300> and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
entrance and an exit so I can go up and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.810 
entrance and an exit so I can go up and
down<00:03:49.750> if<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.380> have<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.709> here<00:03:53.459> go<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.519> put<00:03:54.730> on

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
down if I have this here go and put on

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.080 
down if I have this here go and put on
my<00:03:55.000> own<00:03:55.060> boots<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:57.010> we<00:03:57.459> I'm<00:03:58.390> upstairs<00:04:00.090> very
