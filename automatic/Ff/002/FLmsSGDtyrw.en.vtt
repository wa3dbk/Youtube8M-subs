00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
modern terms is the sweetest sort of

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.839 
modern terms is the sweetest sort of
champagne<00:05:01.870> it's<00:05:02.439> much<00:05:02.770> sweeter<00:05:03.129> than<00:05:03.339> than

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
champagne it's much sweeter than than

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:04.890 
champagne it's much sweeter than than
brute<00:05:04.180> champagne

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
brute champagne

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.799 
brute champagne
but<00:05:05.229> it's<00:05:05.379> not<00:05:05.559> nearly<00:05:05.979> as<00:05:06.249> sweet<00:05:06.669> as<00:05:07.029> the

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:07.809 
but it's not nearly as sweet as the

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:09.420 
but it's not nearly as sweet as the
porter<00:05:08.169> so<00:05:08.349> tan<00:05:08.559> that<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:08.770> just<00:05:09.009> mentioned

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
porter so tan that you just mentioned

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.070 
porter so tan that you just mentioned
it's<00:05:09.580> got<00:05:09.729> a<00:05:09.759> crisp<00:05:10.150> fresh<00:05:10.509> acidity<00:05:10.809> to

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
it's got a crisp fresh acidity to

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.719 
it's got a crisp fresh acidity to
balance<00:05:11.229> out<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.770> sweetness<00:05:11.919> so<00:05:12.460> it's<00:05:12.610> that

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
balance out the sweetness so it's that

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.790 
balance out the sweetness so it's that
perfect<00:05:13.149> middle<00:05:13.270> ground<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.809> sweeten<00:05:14.529> desert

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800

perfect middle ground to sweeten desert
wine<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.189> to<00:05:15.339> suite<00:05:15.610> a<00:05:15.639> dessert<00:05:15.969> everything

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:16.749 
wine and to suite a dessert everything

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.839 
wine and to suite a dessert everything
gets<00:05:16.930> sort<00:05:17.139> of<00:05:17.279> complicated<00:05:18.279> and<00:05:18.430> muddled<00:05:18.759> in

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
gets sort of complicated and muddled in

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.339 
gets sort of complicated and muddled in
the<00:05:18.939> mouth<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.419> champagne<00:05:19.809> theoretically

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
the mouth so the champagne theoretically

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.409 
the mouth so the champagne theoretically
should<00:05:20.559> keep<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:20.860> fresh<00:05:21.099> exactly<00:05:21.999> shall<00:05:22.330> we

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
should keep it fresh exactly shall we

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:23.969 
should keep it fresh exactly shall we
try<00:05:22.629> it<00:05:22.659> with<00:05:22.839> the<00:05:22.990> fig<00:05:23.139> Napoleon<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.740> think

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
try it with the fig Napoleon I think

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.260 
try it with the fig Napoleon I think
it's<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.159> brilliant<00:05:24.370> idea<00:05:24.550> why<00:05:24.879> don't<00:05:25.029> you<00:05:25.089> try

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
it's a brilliant idea why don't you try

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.279 
it's a brilliant idea why don't you try
the<00:05:25.330> Napoleon<00:05:25.839> I<00:05:25.990> will<00:05:26.199> try<00:05:26.469> the<00:05:26.860> strawberry

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
the Napoleon I will try the strawberry

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.570 
the Napoleon I will try the strawberry
which<00:05:29.289> does<00:05:29.469> not<00:05:29.680> want<00:05:29.949> to<00:05:30.009> help<00:05:30.159> me<00:05:30.249> out<00:05:30.309> on<00:05:30.460> my

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
which does not want to help me out on my

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.320 
which does not want to help me out on my
spoon<00:05:35.430> it's<00:05:36.430> sweet<00:05:36.699> enough<00:05:36.909> that<00:05:37.029> I<00:05:37.059> wouldn't

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
spoon it's sweet enough that I wouldn't

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.659 
spoon it's sweet enough that I wouldn't
want<00:05:37.689> something<00:05:38.169> cloyingly<00:05:39.069> sweet<00:05:39.159> alongside

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
want something cloyingly sweet alongside

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.399 
want something cloyingly sweet alongside
that<00:05:40.089> I<00:05:40.149> think<00:05:40.389> it<00:05:40.479> would<00:05:40.539> just<00:05:40.749> ruin<00:05:41.199> the

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
that I think it would just ruin the

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.019 
that I think it would just ruin the
flavor<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.889> freshness<00:05:45.189> pairs<00:05:45.669> really<00:05:45.849> well

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
flavor the freshness pairs really well

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.209 
flavor the freshness pairs really well
with<00:05:46.209> the<00:05:46.449> figs<00:05:46.740> yeah<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.009> with<00:05:48.099> the
