00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
win and the team switch sides but that's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.219 
win and the team switch sides but that's
a<00:01:34.880> lot<00:01:34.970> harder<00:01:35.149> than<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.390> seems<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.930> actually

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
a lot harder than it seems you actually

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.330 
a lot harder than it seems you actually
do<00:01:36.320> have<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.560> use<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:36.680> lot<00:01:36.800> of<00:01:36.830> teamwork<00:01:37.009> and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
do have to use a lot of teamwork and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.590 
do have to use a lot of teamwork and
coordination<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.030> have<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.240> call<00:01:38.479> out

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
coordination you have to call out

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.840 
coordination you have to call out
enemies<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.830> make<00:01:39.979> sure<00:01:40.160> that<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.460> happens

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
enemies to make sure that this happens

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.400 
enemies to make sure that this happens
because<00:01:40.910> even<00:01:41.240> though<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.780> tank<00:01:42.080> there's

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
because even though it is a tank there's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.310 
because even though it is a tank there's
just<00:01:42.560> one<00:01:42.679> of<00:01:42.920> him<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.880> there's<00:01:44.479> enemy

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
just one of him and there's enemy

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.570 
just one of him and there's enemy
wraiths<00:01:45.560> there's<00:01:45.830> anybody<00:01:46.009> ghost<00:01:46.310> the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
wraiths there's anybody ghost the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.060 
wraiths there's anybody ghost the
enemies<00:01:46.850> have<00:01:47.000> fuel<00:01:47.539> rod<00:01:47.720> guns<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.890> have<00:01:48.920> to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
enemies have fuel rod guns you have to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.340 
enemies have fuel rod guns you have to
be<00:01:49.130> very<00:01:49.160> careful<00:01:49.580> otherwise<00:01:50.539> your<00:01:50.869> tank<00:01:51.110> will

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
be very careful otherwise your tank will

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.200 
be very careful otherwise your tank will
blow<00:01:51.530> up<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:52.130> will<00:01:52.280> lose<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.670> round<00:01:52.880> so

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
blow up and you will lose the round so

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.359 
blow up and you will lose the round so
you<00:01:53.690> do<00:01:53.810> have<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.140> be<00:01:54.289> smart<00:01:54.950> about<00:01:55.100> how<00:01:55.310> you

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
you do have to be smart about how you

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.130 
you do have to be smart about how you
move<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.270> kind<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.479> have<00:01:56.599> to<00:01:56.630> send<00:01:56.840> units

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
move and you kind of have to send units

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.600 
move and you kind of have to send units
ahead<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.500> make<00:01:57.619> sure<00:01:57.679> you<00:01:57.950> can<00:01:58.099> clear<00:01:58.340> out<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
ahead to make sure you can clear out the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.190 
ahead to make sure you can clear out the
enemy's<00:01:58.910> defenses<00:01:59.450> otherwise<00:01:59.810> your<00:02:00.020> tank

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
enemy's defenses otherwise your tank

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.020 
enemy's defenses otherwise your tank
I'll<00:02:00.319> just<00:02:00.440> blow<00:02:00.649> up<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.009> that's<00:02:01.520> not<00:02:01.759> good

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
I'll just blow up and that's not good

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.880 
I'll just blow up and that's not good
