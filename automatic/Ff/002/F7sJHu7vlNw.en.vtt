can get those on tackle warehouse it's
just<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.990> cooling<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.740> guess<00:01:18.250> it's<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:18.490> coaling

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
just a cooling I guess it's a coaling

just a cooling I guess it's a coaling
holding<00:01:19.359> clip<00:01:19.570> or<00:01:19.750> something<00:01:19.990> look<00:01:20.170> under<00:01:20.289> the

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
holding clip or something look under the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.590 
holding clip or something look under the
coaling<00:01:20.770> stuff<00:01:21.009> but<00:01:21.850> then<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.299> know<00:01:22.390> what<00:01:22.570> I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
coaling stuff but then you know what I

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.230 
coaling stuff but then you know what I
do<00:01:22.689> is<00:01:22.929> I<00:01:23.020> way<00:01:23.170> my<00:01:23.320> finished<00:01:23.679> if<00:01:23.799> it's<00:01:23.950> yellow

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
do is I way my finished if it's yellow

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.940 
do is I way my finished if it's yellow
drop<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.509> there<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:26.229> same<00:01:26.439> goes<00:01:26.469> for
