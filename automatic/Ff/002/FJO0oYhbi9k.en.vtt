00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.630
 voodoo 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.780
 Today is Aso High res correspondence usb duck borrowed from Orasonic 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.930
 Installed pre-main amplifier 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:26.180
 It is swimming but it is review last time by this time 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.320
 As I said before, I really feel like it 's a good r &amp; b or something 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.040
 OK 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:40.250
 This time I think I'm hard is to return your say Toka that want to emphasize Toka summarized story 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 This would like to recommend to what kind of person as a conclusion to talk to say I forgot that the degree or 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.920
 What does it mean 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.469
 I would like to talk to you 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.399
 Though it's such to first say that there's worth of Nari price Well I also Osaka human 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.289
 In 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.940
 It's a cost-effective way to say it, but it's all about it 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.200
 Is important 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.660
 This is by no means cheaper Manufacturer's suggested retail price 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.510
 75,600 yen including tax It was 59,800 yen including tax when we saw sweet vinegar a while ago 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.930
 I do a thing to say about 60,000 yen 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.540
 Though it is how to see this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.640
 I think it is worth 60,000 yen 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.000
 I have quite tried in various ways checked on the net attached to the product in this price range 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.030
 After all we ride high res boom and with each maker 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.010
 or a pre-main amplifier of usb Duck equipped 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.690
 Of course there are a lot of mini-components, but if there is the same price as this, more than this 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.530
 Some cheap ones 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.680
 Where you want to compare 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.970
 That's why I can not do it quite well 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:51.140
 Does not say truly is that it is this guy is the best is related to sound 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 Although I can not say it, I take it to many people unless he is particular about the audio. 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.550
 I think the sound is satisfactory 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.440
 By the way, this is a maker 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.330
 We speak in English when it compares with 200,000-300,000 amps 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:11.600
 In I sound that so, but it is indeed a small cat 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:18.410
 I don't mean it's such a small one but it does n't cost 60,000 yen 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:23.330
 Well I think that it is only 6 correct how to catch the Tteyuu before Te was able to make so small before 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.319
 As I said, the president of Towa Electronics making this is from Sony 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.730
 In a large area called Sony 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:36.120
 I think that I jumped out because I wanted to make something that I could not make 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.040
 After all, Sony's dna is working to make this better one smaller 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.719
 It may be 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.739
 What kind of mechanism do you get big power with this smallness ? 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.640
 Though 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:53.069
 Since I do not have properly understood even two is verse Ola Sonic's home 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:57.390
 I want you to look at the page I say to Truly easy hey, for example, it looks like the Prius 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.030
 I'm charging while running an electric car 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.120
 Good 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.360
 When I say that when I step on the accelerator I get a lot of power 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.019
 It seems to be the mechanism of such feeling Briefly 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.019
 It's funny, is not it 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.870
 Such the swimming 1 is what is you want to recommend it to what kind of person this is another very simple 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.610
 is not it 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:31.010
 Feel free to enjoy music with good sound easily 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:34.230
 This applies to most people, but in the old days listening to music with mini components and single components 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.959
 But for those who say they haven't heard so much lately 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:46.170
 After all, I want you to use all means keep Don' the large amplifier in the living room 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:50.159
 I think that quite difficult but the back like also obtained appreciated by this small and Design 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.220
 Maybe it's easy to do, and then audio equipment 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:57.280
 Start by Start Start by saying that portable audio such as headphones 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.510
 I want you to try it even if you are in 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:07.780
 Of course I do not want to deny portable audio 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:12.010
 Take music from the speakers and feel like the inside of the room is full of music 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.419
 I think I'd say I think we still say others 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.090
 On the contrary, people who can not recommend it 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.389
 It is an audio manual 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.800
 Of course you are inferior to this face 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:30.449
 It does not mean that the sound is not satisfactory to audiophiles 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:36.449
 Audiophiles are people who do not know that they are satisfied 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:38.080
 This guy because I but I was racial Tteyuu want to add something Toka want messing with Bocca always 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.919
 Unfortunately it is scalable 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:46.750
 There is no place to touch much because there is no 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:48.909
 I think the kana not suitable for audiophiles So that kind of people also subsystem 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.250
 I think there are many people who want it 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:58.070
 Good and I think I especially digital still to say or want to set one another for the bedroom 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:02.450
 All means to people who have never experienced an amplifier 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.690
 It might scales fall from one time I want to try eye 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:10.880
 Yes I would like to finish the review of 7 yu a 1 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:18.090
 Thank you very much for getting along with the long story, but this is the end 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:21.540
 The point of being an overseas-made speaker of 30,000 yen of actual sales that you want to match this guy as an extra edition 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.790
 If you 'd like to talk to you next time 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.120
 Please watch 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.120
 Well then 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.870
