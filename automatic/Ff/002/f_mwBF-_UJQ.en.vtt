so<00:00:05.759> we've<00:00:05.879> shown<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> basics<00:00:06.779> to

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
so we've shown you the basics to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.480 
so we've shown you the basics to
building<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.319> computer<00:00:07.560> before<00:00:07.830> but<00:00:08.250> there<00:00:08.400> are

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
building a computer before but there are

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.830 
building a computer before but there are
a<00:00:08.550> lot<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.700> things<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.540> don't<00:00:09.630> really

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
a lot of things that you don't really

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660 
a lot of things that you don't really
learn<00:00:10.050> until<00:00:10.440> you've<00:00:10.710> built<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.130> couple<00:00:11.309> but

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
learn until you've built a couple but

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.100 
learn until you've built a couple but
these<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:11.969> really<00:00:12.360> really<00:00:12.599> helpful

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
these are really really helpful

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.419 
these are really really helpful
especially<00:00:13.200> your<00:00:13.710> first<00:00:13.920> time<00:00:14.190> through

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
especially your first time through

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.890 
especially your first time through
building<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.210> today<00:00:15.450> we're<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> share

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
building so today we're going to share

building so today we're going to share
with<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.170> six<00:00:16.529> tips<00:00:16.859> every<00:00:17.310> first-time

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
with you six tips every first-time

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.960 
with you six tips every first-time
builder<00:00:18.090> should<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.900> probably<00:00:19.500> doesn't

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
builder should know but probably doesn't

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.120 
builder should know but probably doesn't
here's<00:00:20.970> tip<00:00:21.150> number<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.769> before<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.920> build

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
here's tip number one before you build

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.460 
here's tip number one before you build
anything<00:00:23.550> inside<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.449> case<00:00:24.630> build<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
anything inside your case build it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
anything inside your case build it
outside<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.070> case<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.640> sure<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.910> works

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
outside your case and make sure it works

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.560 
outside your case and make sure it works

up to a monitor see if you can boot in
the<00:00:49.410> BIOS<00:00:49.739> you'll<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.340> much<00:00:50.550> better<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:51.059> and

note everything works before you go
through<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> trouble<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.699> building<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
through the trouble of building it

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
through the trouble of building it

inside the case while we're on the
subject<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.329> CPUs<00:00:57.780> let's<00:00:58.199> talk<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
subject of CPUs let's talk about the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
subject of CPUs let's talk about the
coolers<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.460> importantly<00:00:59.940> thermal

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
coolers and more importantly thermal

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
coolers and more importantly thermal
paste<00:01:00.770> first<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:02.010> builders<00:01:02.340> may<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.670> need

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
paste first time builders may not need

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
paste first time builders may not need
this<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.539> box<00:01:04.320> CPU<00:01:04.830> coolers

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this because a lot of box CPU coolers

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649 
this because a lot of box CPU coolers
come<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.519> thermal<00:01:05.790> paste<00:01:05.939> RT<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.510> but

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
come with thermal paste RT on them but

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
come with thermal paste RT on them but
if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> ever<00:01:06.960> replace<00:01:07.350> your<00:01:07.530> cooler<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
if you ever replace your cooler or use a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550 
if you ever replace your cooler or use a
bigger<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.090> third-party<00:01:09.600> cooler<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.439> going

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
bigger a third-party cooler you're going

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
bigger a third-party cooler you're going
to<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> apply<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> CPU<00:01:11.549> thermal<00:01:11.909> paste

spreading it out with a credit card
before<00:01:33.140> they<00:01:33.409> actually<00:01:33.530> put<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.829> heats<00:01:34.070> and

gone it's much simpler than that all you

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.130 
gone it's much simpler than that all you

just<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:57.709> put<00:01:57.860> too<00:01:58.009> much<00:01:58.039> on<00:01:58.340> less<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.179> more

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
just don't put too much on less is more

you<00:03:06.349> look<00:03:06.470> at<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.650> side<00:03:06.829> of<00:03:06.950> your<00:03:07.010> fan<00:03:07.250> you'll

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
you look at the side of your fan you'll

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.069 
you look at the side of your fan you'll
see<00:03:07.669> a<00:03:07.700> little<00:03:07.880> arrow<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.269> points<00:03:08.569> to<00:03:08.840> which

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
see a little arrow that points to which

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.289 
see a little arrow that points to which
direction<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.650> air<00:03:09.799> flows<00:03:10.160> through<00:03:10.609> that<00:03:10.639> fan

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
direction the air flows through that fan

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.349 
direction the air flows through that fan
use<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.319> plan<00:03:12.560> your<00:03:12.859> airflow<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.730> want

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
use that to plan your airflow you want

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.659 
use that to plan your airflow you want
to<00:03:14.419> think<00:03:14.569> about<00:03:14.750> two<00:03:14.959> things<00:03:15.169> one<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.280> want

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
to think about two things one you want

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.339 
to think about two things one you want
your<00:03:16.790> airflow<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.150> kind<00:03:17.419> of<00:03:17.510> all<00:03:17.690> move<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.200> one

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
your airflow to kind of all move in one

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.440 
your airflow to kind of all move in one
direction<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.099> usually<00:03:19.459> people<00:03:19.790> have<00:03:19.910> intake

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
direction so usually people have intake

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.289 
direction so usually people have intake
fans<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.959> front<00:03:21.639> exhaust<00:03:22.639> fans<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.239> the

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
fans in the front exhaust fans in the

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.540 
fans in the front exhaust fans in the
back<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.750> everything<00:03:24.230> flows<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.829> one<00:03:25.069> direct

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
back so everything flows in one direct

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.600 
back so everything flows in one direct
-<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.750> want<00:03:26.960> to<00:03:27.020> think<00:03:27.380> about<00:03:27.500> positive<00:03:28.070> air

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
- you want to think about positive air

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.770 
- you want to think about positive air
pressure<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.330> means<00:03:29.510> having<00:03:29.660> more

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
pressure and that means having more

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.290 
pressure and that means having more
intake<00:03:30.620> fins<00:03:30.920> than<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.370> have<00:03:31.550> exhaust<00:03:31.940> fans

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
intake fins than you have exhaust fans

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.630 
intake fins than you have exhaust fans
if<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.870> put<00:03:33.080> filters<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.800> all<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.220> your<00:03:34.280> intake

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
if you put filters on all of your intake

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.670 
if you put filters on all of your intake
fans<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.570> means<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:36.080> your<00:03:36.200> computer<00:03:36.590> is

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
fans that means that your computer is

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.260 
fans that means that your computer is
going<00:03:36.740> to<00:03:36.890> be<00:03:36.950> much<00:03:37.130> more<00:03:37.310> dust<00:03:37.610> free<00:03:37.910> it's

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
going to be much more dust free it's

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.210 
going to be much more dust free it's
going<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.450> run<00:03:38.600> cooler<00:03:38.870> quieter<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.920> for<00:03:40.190> a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
going to run cooler quieter and for a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.910 
going to run cooler quieter and for a
longer<00:03:40.430> period<00:03:40.550> of<00:03:40.940> time<00:03:41.470> tip<00:03:42.470> number<00:03:42.620> five<00:03:42.890> is

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
longer period of time tip number five is

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.950 
longer period of time tip number five is
simple<00:03:43.370> you're<00:03:43.880> going<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.060> get<00:03:44.150> these<00:03:44.300> driver
