00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.740
 electronic school monte 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.020
 good afternoon young 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.570
 I'm the engineer Juan Manuel Canto 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.270
 roses right now you are in the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.850
 laboratory that corresponds to the third 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.310
 semester of the electricity and 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.960
 winding motors 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.220
 also here what is offered is offered 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.240
 course electric motor control 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.070
 obviously as we see our 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.250
 around so we have more here 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.770
 because they are good engines and it is in this 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.380
 course and in this semester the goal 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.440
 main is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.610
 talk about single-phase electric motors 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.770
 and three-phase physicists and apart 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.520
 elements or devices that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.740
 they need to control too 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.360
 we use the main tool or 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.970
 basic what are the multimeters 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 digital multimeter 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.620
 we use what is the multimeter 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.250
 hook ammeter with accessory 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.500
 of hook that is a basic tool 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.320
 for motor control since with 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 this one we can be 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.990
 controlling or diagnosing any 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.040
 damage to an engine and it is so simple to measure 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.670
 the current with this device 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.430
 tool works devices that 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.550
 they are used for control as 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.300
 starters 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.300
 times 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:38.500
 self-control 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:41.329
 starters all these devices 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:47.110
 they obviously look theoretical and practical 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.110
 they show how you work with them 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.690
 and basically that's what constitutes 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.750
 all this course obviously right now 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.400
 As it is a quick visit, what is 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.560
 pretend is that you know the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.960
 most laboratories then 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.430
 this will be a panorama more than anything 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.340
 that you see in each course I do not know if they have 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.000
 some question some doubt 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.000
 the base 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 here the main objective is already told 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.280
 is that they know the types of engines 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.680
 single-phase and three- phase physical age and 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.610
 elements to control place by 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.710
 example 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.480
 in a vulcanizer they use a lot 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.360
 which are the compressors the pressure of the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.580
 then all of a sudden today is 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.130
 pull that motor are pulling an engine and 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.020
 comes to a tank pressure and only gets 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.900
 disable 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.490
 there is a control there because the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.690
 compressor is activated by an engine 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.510
 electric 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.400
 then you use the hose make air air 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.790
 pressurized air and all the pressure is lowered 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.590
 and restart that engine again 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.160
 control is what it would be who has 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.930
 this q in these courses that offer 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.930
 and you are floor mechanics 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.520
 with more good tool machines the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.520
 lathes the strawberries all work with 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.100
 electric motors then you nothing else 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.100
 you will give the measurements to the pieces or 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.080
 you are going to program it and through a 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.260
 brain is going to send the orders to 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.000
 the engines and control is part of what 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.340
 which is a stage because the electronic and 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.830
 the programmer is a stage that are 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.420
 happy and the other stage is control 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.990
 this goes very hand in hand with machines 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.490
 tools and with what is this 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.470
 prison mechanics 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.790
 the one you asked me that if you 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.440
 opened the engine inside the most 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.780
 nothing what was here in fourth I do not know if 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.120
 now they will move to fourth there if 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.700
 open the motor and the coils that are 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.430
 here inside they take out they count the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.900
 turns and the mobile is done here is 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.099
 the control 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.720
 this Saturday courses are offered 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.269
 this next Saturday of this Saturday 8 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.890
 days begins the Latin course and can 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.409
 you to enrich your resume 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.099
 we will be leading in your career 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.500
 mechanical floor machine tools 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.110
 but come on Saturdays and see pure 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.680
 electrical control 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.250
 and it would be right now to invest in 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.829
 learn what is vulnerable to a 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.479
 future 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.990
 some other comment some other 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.150
 Question 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.099
 good as time is short and they have 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.740
 to visit more laboratories on my part 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.740
 it would be all thank you very much for the visit
