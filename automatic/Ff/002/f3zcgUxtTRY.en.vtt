00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
this was the poorest overall performance
and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.700> thought<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.329> spectacular

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and I thought it would be spectacular

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.230 
and I thought it would be spectacular
but<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> injury<00:01:40.650> 2mon<00:01:41.430> who<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.850> changed

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
but the injury 2mon who just changed

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
but the injury 2mon who just changed
everything<00:01:42.390> Robert<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> most<00:01:43.649> part<00:01:43.829> this

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
everything Robert for the most part this

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
everything Robert for the most part this
is<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> different<00:01:44.790> team<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is a different team than the one that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
is a different team than the one that
lost<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.470> Argentina<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.430> two<00:01:47.610> thousand

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
four games but let's say that we got to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.609
