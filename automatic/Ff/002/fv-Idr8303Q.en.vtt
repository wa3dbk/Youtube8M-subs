00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 and then she here who speaks is the face and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.710
 Welcome to another video is 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.219
 maybe my dog is barking 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.870
 back there I do not know whether to give to hear 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.150
 Well, guys, I'll teach you the video. 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 you to make a story in 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.330
 comics I'm talking fast because 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.730
 I want to decrease the size of my 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.769
 videos right 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.539
 Well, let's go to the first one. 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 step on this would be the idea if you type 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 to write our someone came home 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.390
 Now you write history is fine. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.590
 simply good ideas sometimes have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.050
 a total block 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.100
 I have several but it's write choose 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.649
 gender and such 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 the third group is the second step in this self 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.699
 Forget the character that would be what 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:01.550
 you draw the character as much as 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:03.660
 you can kind of draw it right side 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.129
 to draw aside 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.129
 he is different 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:24.900
 talking and draw more strings 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.490
 difficult history right this skit 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.960
 also plans the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 character and things is kind a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.829
 planning without you having to have 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 all their characters because when 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.750
 Do you have a drawing, forget how it is? 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.390
 that character is drawn you pick up 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.680
 the sketch and you already know the accessories of such 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.070
 character use 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.899
 the third would be the map of history that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.869
 wanted to be a name that what is a 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.229
 very basic story, this is where I 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.729
 I did it, I put a lot of details 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.170
 but do not need to go back with the details 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.960
 with less details 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.630
 I know the map, the name and if there 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.240
 the story of what it is for when 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.690
 You're going to make the story, you're done. 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.560
 she is cleaner easier to 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.140
 do 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.230
 It is risky to make history without 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.230
 Sir, did you come into my room now? 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.550
 the last step would be to move to the role 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.489
 This is history, I just passed the paper. 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.880
 I formed a helping hand because I was 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.000
 using tena tip I'm not 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:54.239
 very accustomed but it was even good that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:57.630
 have other pages finalized by making and 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.830
 well guys, that's the basics of a 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.080
 history would do that 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.440
 Do not forget that I need to train a lot. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.010
 people know your drawing and every time 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.030
 getting used more because it 's not easy 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:19.140
 to draw is hard, but it's just 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.690
 to train and train that a 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.459
 time you get fit and start 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.700
 to draw good to fuck so well but to give 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.700
 pro expense 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:39.170
 galley and now you will have a kayak 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.170
 second part of that video I went there
