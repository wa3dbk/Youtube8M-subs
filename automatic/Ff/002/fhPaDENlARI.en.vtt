00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.120 
the rest of them I'm just gonna wait
till<00:07:11.040> they<00:07:11.280> start<00:07:11.340> showing<00:07:11.910> up<00:07:12.180> in<00:07:12.330> the<00:07:12.419> US<00:07:13.130> and

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
till they start showing up in the US and

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:26.530 
till they start showing up in the US and
we'll<00:07:14.400> pick<00:07:14.610> them<00:07:14.700> up<00:07:14.850> locally

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.150 

oddly<00:07:27.540> enough<00:07:27.780> we<00:07:28.410> we<00:07:28.680> got<00:07:28.830> a<00:07:28.860> higher

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
oddly enough we we got a higher

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.720 
oddly enough we we got a higher
percentage<00:07:29.880> of<00:07:30.270> the<00:07:30.950> foil<00:07:31.950> cards<00:07:32.340> I<00:07:32.460> think

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:32.730 
percentage of the foil cards I think

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.620 
percentage of the foil cards I think
completed<00:07:33.420> then<00:07:33.660> we<00:07:33.810> did<00:07:34.020> the<00:07:34.200> main<00:07:34.410> set<00:07:35.630> which

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630 
completed then we did the main set which

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.330 
completed then we did the main set which
is<00:07:36.810> odd<00:07:36.960> it's<00:07:37.560> typically<00:07:37.980> the<00:07:38.070> other<00:07:38.190> way

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
is odd it's typically the other way

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.920 
is odd it's typically the other way
around<00:07:39.980> and<00:07:40.980> I<00:07:41.520> have<00:07:42.350> probably<00:07:43.350> half<00:07:43.890> of

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:44.930 
around and I have probably half of

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.180 
around and I have probably half of
another<00:07:45.930> binder<00:07:47.600> almost<00:07:48.600> complete<00:07:49.190> well

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.190 
another binder almost complete well

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.620 
another binder almost complete well
there<00:07:50.490> you<00:07:50.550> go

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:51.630 
there you go

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.980 
there you go
