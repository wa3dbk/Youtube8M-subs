running around getting fabrics working I

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.880 
running around getting fabrics working I
wasn't<00:03:07.600> wasn't<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.110> sitting<00:03:08.470> there<00:03:08.500> like

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
wasn't wasn't just sitting there like

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.690 
wasn't wasn't just sitting there like
look<00:03:09.430> at<00:03:09.550> me<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.910> know

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.460 

things<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.970> gods<00:03:15.210> and<00:03:15.450> closer<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.410> Sun<00:03:18.470> and

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
things of gods and closer to the Sun and

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.740 
things of gods and closer to the Sun and
so<00:03:19.740> far<00:03:20.310> best<00:03:20.520> that<00:03:20.700> when<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:20.850> came<00:03:21.090> here<00:03:21.390> she

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
so far best that when I came here she

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.060 
so far best that when I came here she
needed<00:03:21.990> someone<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.530> because<00:03:22.680> she

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
needed someone like that because she

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.310 
needed someone like that because she
uses<00:03:23.400> quite<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> bit<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.880> vintage<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.420> images

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
uses quite a bit of vintage and images

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.810 
uses quite a bit of vintage and images
and<00:03:25.500> books<00:03:25.770> whatever<00:03:26.070> that's<00:03:26.490> gonna<00:03:26.700> be

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
and books whatever that's gonna be

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.340 
and books whatever that's gonna be
inspiration<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.600> think<00:03:27.960> it's<00:03:28.230> really

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
inspiration I think it's really

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.270 
inspiration I think it's really
important<00:03:28.890> because<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:30.530> some<00:03:31.530> details<00:03:32.010> and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
important because it's some details and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.190 
important because it's some details and
some<00:03:32.550> especially<00:03:33.510> for<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.750> details<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.170> think

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
some especially for the details I think

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.620 
some especially for the details I think
more<00:03:34.530> than<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.680> design<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:36.150> made<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.510> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
more than the design I just made in a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.100 
more than the design I just made in a
way<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.990> today<00:03:37.470> doesn't<00:03:37.740> exist<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.100> much

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.260
