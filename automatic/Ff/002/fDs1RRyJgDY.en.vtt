00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.160
 and 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.440
 good and again in the section we are going to 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.780
 talk about another of the heavyweights of 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.340
 film world christopher nolan that 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.460
 was in second position after 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.810
 Stanley Kubrick on the day of the vote 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.010
 christopher nolan is a director who does not 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.990
 has not even reached the ten films 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.310
 but that has already been consecrated with one of 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.320
 the greatest directors he has had 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.200
 the world is a director who always 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.759
 He liked to surround himself with a cast of 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.529
 a lot of height to have scripts 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.620
 elaborated and frequent the subjects 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.540
 psychological introspective but that 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.430
 also he has never lost his identity 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.649
 and that can be noticed from the first 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.480
 movie to the last which is appreciated 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.489
 very much since it has not been left 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.690
 to blind for the money the fame and the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.670
 succulent offers that you have been able to 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.559
 come he would have been firm in his 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.379
 decisions and I think he has prioritized very 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.510
 well your ideas I love as a director 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.190
 obviously it is also worth noting that 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.350
 been many times working with me 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.510
 elbow with his younger brother jonathan nolan 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.679
 that has helped him especially in the subject 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.839
 of the script and production of some 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.580
 movies for example memento or this 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.230
 last interstellar above all 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.270
 interstellar in which he got involved 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.130
 especially nolan as director 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.039
 screenwriter and producer born 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.719
 london in July 1970 from his 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.390
 beginnings already had an attachment to the cinema 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.430
 staunch and at seven he recorded with 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.009
 a super 8 camera of his father with his 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.299
 toys and soon after it started 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.670
 involves in the world of cinema with 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.950
 some short films some of them 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.259
 they were published then projected in 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.840
 some festivals for example the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.060
 cambridge film festival in 96 all the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.759
 bac is one of its most notable but not 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.210
 it was until 1998 that he directed his first 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.939
 movie 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.349
 following which describes a 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.450
 writer obsessed with tracking 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.099
 to other people this does not say much but 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.990
 the truth is that here you can see very 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.330
 well how do they treat or talk about all 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.100
 the psychological issues 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.780
 a film very close to this one that is 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.370
 the one that came later and the one that also 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.290
 gave fame after the little hole that 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.200
 was done with following in hollywood and the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.490
 world in general is an event is one of 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.110
 the best movies that have their 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.700
 filmography and unfortunately not very 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 known by the people who usually 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.020
 continue today which is a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 little painful but good 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.530
 is one of the few movies that has 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.150
 the peculiarity of being assembled from 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.100
 final at the beginning is to tell the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.020
 history upside down just like it is 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.510
 reversible has the similar idea is 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.090
 say that you ride with the scenes 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.710
 becoming segments by fragmenting the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.090
 story and counting the one from the end to 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.470
 start 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.210
 curiously making a start that is 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.550
 final and an ending that that start very 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.900
 paradoxical the whole movie maybe a 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.060
 little hard to follow but it's a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.310
 wonder and one of the best that has 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.020
 I've already said a moment was made to 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.240
 from a written by his younger brother 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.040
 jonathan nolan and it was from this 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.110
 that he already made a name which 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.700
 allowed to increase your budget a little 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.830
 and have more familiar faces for their 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.320
 next movies the immediate one is 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.540
 insomnia made in 2002 has the 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.580
 acclaimed the pacino as head of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.860
 cast also with robin williams or 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.660
 hilary swank would not say insomnia 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.220
 france one of his best movies but 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.180
 obviously it 's a very good movie 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.180
 It may pass as his other as 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.950
 an event or as the final trick that I 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.040
 I'm a bit overshadowed by the more 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.349
 blockbuster which is a shame though 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.209
 I really believe that origin for example 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.310
 that follows in macul pasteur has more 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.859
 level but good that would already go to level 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.290
 staff and in 2005 he made the movie that 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.569
 he consecrated it rather for all 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.730
 casual of 100 and even batman begins 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.430
 which would initiate the trilogy of 'the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.389
 dark knight ' starring 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.069
 christian bale and with a pretty guy 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.470
 frequented in his filmography michael 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.629
 caine no land embarked on doing his 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.400
 own vision of the dark knight of 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.129
 batman the superhero of dc 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.340
 giving you a much darker vision 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.829
 much more more psychological stark more 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.900
 realistic and more serious we go or at least 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.909
 that seems to me I'm just going to say 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.920
 that this guy has got me to see me 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.230
 this saga with an incessant vice and I 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.000
 I hate batman I think it does not 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.130
 I need to say nothing more 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.200
 between batman begins and the second installment 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.940
 did the final trick the comedian was a 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.890
 little overshadowed by the hype of this 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.140
 saga origin etc but that is a 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.880
 movie hugh jackman and christian bale 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.220
 in the cast of new michael caine 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 scarlett johansson david bowie I want 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.299
 say the guy has continued to surround himself 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.280
 high budgets and a distribution of 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.110
 luxury which already gives you enough whole 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.450
 to his films in and of itself without 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.070
 even talk about screenplay photography 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.920
 which obviously is also very 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.110
 care in your movies 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.380
 then he would lead three years after 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.810
 batman begins the dark knight 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.070
 we go the one that is the most loved by all 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.710
 fans of the franchise and the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.970
 nolan followers at a general level 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.160
 headless jr as one of the most jockers 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.800
 great ones who have seen pity 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.880
 died shortly after filming 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.230
 christopher nolan contracted with this 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.180
 delivery that was quite difficult to 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.070
 overcome and I think the legend is reborn 'it 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.530
 it was a little bit below without being bad 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.840
 It's where I show more places for 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.730
 define your batman a movie 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.400
 impressive from start to start 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.470
 final two years after and before doing 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.150
 the dark knight made origin is 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.530
 curiously it was not overshadowed as 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.330
 the final trick that comes between the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.650
 first and second delivery maybe 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.270
 because people felt that with the 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.160
 dark knight had reached a 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.660
 very high level that surely the 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.000
 dark knight the legend is reborn 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.530
 I could not give but also have to 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.970
 see that the original budget was 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.590
 quite taller and I guess the 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.630
 plot called a lot more attention 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.240
 although it was more psychological 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.160
 and that he has a very introspection 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.170
 curious and the script is very worked 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.820
 starring leonardo dicaprio 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.460
 joseph gordon levitt 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.980
 paige among others the movie billed 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.680
 exceedingly and it gave him more fame even if 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.820
 fits christopher nolan showing that 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.880
 the guy had not forgotten his origins 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.860
 with movies like memento etcetera and in 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.190
 2012 would close his knight trilogy 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.200
 dark the legend is reborn 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.610
 I really like to be able to say that so much 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.290
 this phenol and as christian bale 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.120
 they were very clear that he wanted to lock up 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.550
 his saga with a good third installment and 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.990
 Do not get carried away by dirty money and 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.000
 you make deliveries that surely 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.440
 they could have done very badly to the saga 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.390
 both cristian viel and christopher 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.650
 nolan you already notice what kind of people 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.500
 they are on the margin of 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.259
 its doing in the world of cinema and we're going 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.699
 I think that much support is appreciated 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:19.849
 much the decision and I think obviously 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.789
 because there was no need to continue with more 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.099
 and in 2014 this past year he directed his 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.789
 latest interstellar movie 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.679
 starring matthew mcconaughey 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.599
 boy and hathaway of all his movies 

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:31.189
 possibly this is the one that has more 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.979
 science fiction dyes 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:36.379
 space rocket et cetera although origin 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.779
 he also had his dose the movie did not 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:40.189
 I think it's a movie '' the o but the 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.559
 truth is that it should be noted that it is very 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:45.770
 well staying on par with the other 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:48.319
 minor films that I pointed out though 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.849
 this has had an excessive hype has not 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.889
 never won any Oscar but is 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.449
 nominated three times himself with the 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.589
 Golden balloons although I think it's 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.869
 a matter of time if you continue with 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:58.789
 products of this quality also fits 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:00.289
 highlight that he made a huge box office 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.959
 with his dark hair technology 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:05.389
 thing that among other factors 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:07.369
 -clearly- led him to be the fourth 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.490
 producer or hollywood personality 

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:12.830
 who earned the most in a year with 71.4
