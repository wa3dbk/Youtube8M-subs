is to remove the label with hot soapy

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.740 
is to remove the label with hot soapy
water<00:00:29.750> like<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.180> draw<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
water like this now you want to draw a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.830 
water like this now you want to draw a
circle<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> material<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> cut<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.329> you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
circle on a material to cut out and you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.080 
circle on a material to cut out and you
want<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.260> about<00:00:37.380> an<00:00:37.649> inch<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.340> why

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
want it to be about an inch or so why

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810 
want it to be about an inch or so why
during<00:00:39.390> radius<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.680> jam<00:00:41.040> jar<00:00:41.309> lid<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
during radius then your jam jar lid and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.360 
during radius then your jam jar lid and
now<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> cut<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> circle<00:00:44.190> out

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
now you just want to cut that circle out

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
now you just want to cut that circle out
like<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.329> I've<00:00:45.750> used<00:00:45.989> pinking<00:00:46.440> scissors

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
like this and I've used pinking scissors

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.369 
like this and I've used pinking scissors
so<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.910> edges<00:00:48.329> went<00:00:48.510> free<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.350> just

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
so the edges went free but you can just

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.220 
so the edges went free but you can just
use<00:00:49.620> normal<00:00:50.309> fabric<00:00:50.489> scissors<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.170> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
use normal fabric scissors so now you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900 
use normal fabric scissors so now you
want<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> take<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.920> needle<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> thread<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
want to take your needle and thread and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660 
want to take your needle and thread and
you're<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.960> sew<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.800> running

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you're just going to sew a running

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.240 
you're just going to sew a running
stitch<00:00:57.000> all<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:58.170> around<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.710> edge<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
stitch all the way around the edge of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
stitch all the way around the edge of
the<00:00:59.670> circle<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.559> doesn't

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the circle like this and it doesn't

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
the circle like this and it doesn't
matter<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> stitches<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:02.969> really<00:01:03.480> messy

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
matter if the stitches are really messy

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.800 
matter if the stitches are really messy
because<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.650> won't<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.040> them<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> end

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
because you won't see them in the end

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
because you won't see them in the end
also<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> should<00:01:07.080> probably<00:01:07.229> say<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.360> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
also I should probably say now that it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
also I should probably say now that it
will<00:01:09.540> only<00:01:09.720> work<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.619> use<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.280> piece<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
will only work if you use one piece of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
will only work if you use one piece of
thread<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> whole<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.400> run

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
thread for the whole way so if you run

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.880 
thread for the whole way so if you run
out<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> thread<00:01:15.030> halfway<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.080> won't<00:01:16.320> work<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
out of thread halfway it won't work you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890 
out of thread halfway it won't work you
need<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.369> enough<00:01:17.670> red<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.570> able<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
need to have enough red to be able to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
need to have enough red to be able to
sew<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.680> around<00:01:19.799> without<00:01:20.759> stopping

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
sew all the way around without stopping

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.200 
sew all the way around without stopping
so<00:01:22.110> once<00:01:22.680> you've<00:01:22.860> done<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> put

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
so once you've done that you want to put

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
so once you've done that you want to put
a<00:01:24.240> tiny<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> stuffing<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> middle<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
a tiny bit of stuffing in the middle and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.240 
a tiny bit of stuffing in the middle and
you<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.210> want<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> pull<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.400> thread<00:01:29.729> tight

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.040 

and<00:01:36.250> you'll<00:01:36.490> have<00:01:36.640> something<00:01:36.910> like<00:01:37.210> this<00:01:37.510> so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
and you'll have something like this so

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.140 
and you'll have something like this so
now<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.620> just<00:01:38.740> want<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.100> keep<00:01:39.370> on<00:01:39.610> stopping

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
now you just want to keep on stopping

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.410 
now you just want to keep on stopping
until<00:01:41.080> it's<00:01:41.350> really<00:01:41.860> fun<00:01:42.130> because<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.210> going

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
until it's really fun because it's going

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.030 
until it's really fun because it's going
to<00:01:43.510> be<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.660> pin<00:01:43.930> cushion<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.740> needs<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.950> have

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
to be a pin cushion so it needs to have

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.580 
to be a pin cushion so it needs to have
enough<00:01:45.400> stuffing<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.750> be<00:01:46.870> able<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.170> hold<00:01:47.290> pins

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
enough stuffing to be able to hold pins

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.410 
enough stuffing to be able to hold pins
so<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.130> really<00:01:48.370> want<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.580> overstuff<00:01:49.090> this

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
so you really want to overstuff this

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.020 
so you really want to overstuff this
like<00:01:49.870> this<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:50.890> now<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.370> just<00:01:51.490> want<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.940> use

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
like this so now you just want to use

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.990 
like this so now you just want to use
your<00:01:52.390> hot<00:01:52.630> glue<00:01:52.780> gun<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.370> stick<00:01:54.370> these<00:01:54.700> two

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
your hot glue gun to stick these two

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.359 
your hot glue gun to stick these two
together<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:08.590> looks<00:02:08.950> really

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
together like this and it looks really

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.060 
together like this and it looks really
