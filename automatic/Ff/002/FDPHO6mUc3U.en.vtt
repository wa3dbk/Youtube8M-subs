00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.890
 we are on the state 36 at the entrance of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.290
 monza 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 we have just come out of liscione then 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.719
 from the echo towards Milan and 3 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.750
 April 2013 is the 22nd tunnel 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.680
 monza has been open for just over eight hours 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:23.180
 for the public like us and we are 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.180
 just taking the last stretch 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.439
 the last stretch then the first exit 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 monza output also says the output 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.350
 monza center to go directly 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.690
 to the real villa if not exact 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 we note that direction lecco le 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.860
 workers are still working 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.930
 actively not they don't know it but 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.110
 they are an integral part of history 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.320
 now we try the tunnel of Monza e 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.800
 then we will do in the next episode 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.809
 the monza villa reale exit is precisely that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.539
 review on fucking guys we are 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.039
 at the entrance to the tunnel of Monza 1800 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.379
 meters built in the last five years 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:08.460
 we play the horn to make it clear that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.280
 we are very satisfied with the result 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.770
 it looks great heck it seems to be 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.299
 in Europe 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.700
 diego agreed that if you ate 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.490
 europa we have speed limit of 90 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.189
 km per hour but boys it's hard to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.259
 keep it we block with the clash 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:34.750
 the speed of 100 km and an environment 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.590
 completely innovative futuristic 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.189
 we saw something similar 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 recently to lecco but the other thing 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.420
 ladies two lanes 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:56.299
 we are crossing san fruttuoso monza 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:02:00.229

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.989

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.560
 cinisello balsam 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.739
 at this point we have polimi 20 30 ci 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.010
 it's up to the peel back to come back 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.010
 to normality 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.889
 what used to be done in 20 minutes 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.000
 now it's done in a minute 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:28.430
 gentlemen but perhaps we are not even at 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.079
