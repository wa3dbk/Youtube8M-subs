00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.489
 m 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.760
 yes hello everyone to the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.760
 geo teen magazine 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.210
 thank you 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.690
 there we are followed by a Zionist muscle 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.460
 who is who made us a program 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.330
 so because we do not have bread 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.730
 every day of bata spread all this 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.060
 so that's for sure it's weird 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.150
 cut like this but after to arrive 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.950
 there at the forum and the hygiene of life sometimes 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.480
 First ask me to tea to your family 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.710
 to send you parcels with the stuff 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:46.030
 which you will be called that you do not have the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:48.040
 right to eat to I already thought about 9 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.350
 hours square over two floors floor 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.520
 it's the teachers who come that puts me 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:59.410
 an interro it remains an interro me I 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.600
 know that I'm going to do a course and 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:08.050
 continues the lady after I do not know about 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.210
 What you do not know at all necessarily 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.980
 happy because the past I had 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.110
 wrong anyway 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.230
 with the teachers and everything but here they are 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.520
 cool they leave us not like I 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.830
 said when we arrive Saturday 8 in 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.530
 delay they say nothing after during the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.950
 courses we can take breaks but everything 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.950
 by remaining simple 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.930
 the preparation of what is there ready and 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.870
 you are a very important element 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.870
 that is to say not only do 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.630
 athletes but one hamm is to try or 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.580
 a fashion to propose to them to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.270
 build from time to time as in 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.270
 as a human being 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.660
 he should be accompanied in the room 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.400
 they have a program that must follow 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.140
 but with these young boys you have to 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.240
 sometimes be careful because they are 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.670
 very interested also by taking 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.590
 muscle mass and the image actually 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.990
 the image of the muscular body of the athlete etc 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.650
 and in very young boys that and 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.220
 already working 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.360
 so you have to be vigilant about it 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.740
 it's during training so I 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.760
 just put on my outfit 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.250
 the socks the shorts and the and the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.380
 little sweater so colors I'm 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.120
 are young people who are who went 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.010
 so that's it before going back to 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.570
 training center where this is my case 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.640
 I hope I'm going to sign my 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.200
 first pro contract at the end of the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.010
 day we will take you obviously 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.600
 aware 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.310
 but I have to go 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.310
 because the coach gave me so much 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.150
 yeah 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.500
 before training during 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.820
 training and after training 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.700
 to pay attention to their diet 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.900
 it's well balanced it's not 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.970
 always easy to make them understand 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.769
 because it's a young clientele 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.860
 whose clientele world 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.990
 hamburgers and sweets so but in 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:27.510
 principle it happened today 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.060
 yeah and today it was good but 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.720
 the players themselves while they are not 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.340
 that it was not good at all and vegetables 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.630
 I do not like vegetables and vegetables 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.050
 but also it was not good it was not 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.520
 good and when people tell you 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.840
 just be careful there is 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.930
 things you can not eat while 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.700
 it to be physically 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.860
 because it is linked to it that thou 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.050
 understand you accept it 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.050
 I accept but you full whip 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.849
 so here we just took the metro the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.039
 young people had taken shuttle until 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.110
 to the nearest metro is there they 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.180
 are leaving on the island this is 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.610
 one of two afternoons of free time 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.630
 which is that he would have granted therefore by 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.630
 by the club 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.300
 what they earn about 1000 euros per 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.650
 month allows them to blaze in the 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.499
 downtown lille shops 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.240
 but the return to reality is hard they 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.719
 know that the path to the pro contract 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.719
 and strewn with pitfalls 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:55.879
 I signed a three-year contract with 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.849
 the losc after after to me during these 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.370
 three years to prove that I have my place 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.259
 to play higher has happened 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.180
 maybe played with the professionals 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.069
 no I'm moving gilles boyer that's the 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:15.349
 shoe but shine as he 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:18.110
 works as it should be said no because 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.479
 that what I did it brings back good 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.430
 moments and that taught me a lot of 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.680
 things the one I did what 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.129
 others never do as before has 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.810
 still need parents to 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:34.819
 help us and their advice 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.550
 the fact that parents are missing out 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.419
 some cases so reminding you of their 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.550
 cheer up 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.949
 the kid has to be really safe 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.080
 morally strong is very difficult 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.289
 to appreciate the years we should have 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.819
 family background they are 15 years old and for 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.050
 a kid who has held his parents of 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.240
 three times more twice a year or 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.509
 three times maximum is huge when 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.819
 even 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.199
 they made the presence of Daddy's 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.120
 the mother 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.219
 we can not replace your time 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.199
 life is going the better it will be 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:06.589
 what, as we imagine, has already yielded 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:10.490
 contract pro that would be the dream me like 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:12.860
 for everyone here I think you know 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.300
 how many of you are there among 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.210
 people in your age group 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.569
 how many of you will not sign 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:23.199
 a lot you have very little 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:23.199
 it must be me 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.280
 as for me 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.650
 big disappointment the coach does not want 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.340
 keep me too bad and his death is 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.340
 yet much more
