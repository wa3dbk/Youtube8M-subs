00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello I am your muscle make this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.530
 Video is about a very interesting 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.330
 thing even if now many 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.980
 surely simon will show us 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 prefer a cool muscle building exercise 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.609
 this is an extremely important one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 thing that is always underestimated 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.689
 I'm kicking luxem for the first time 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.650
 Cuba libre here very well 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.080
 superlists not quite so 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 I drink still water with one 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 little bit of lemon in it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.750
 really great and very cheap 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.500
 Fitness pushes but that's what it's about 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.600
 not in this video 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.210
 I'll show you how to best one 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 Stange money you get over it if you 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.469
 Now for example when cross lifting is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 So the classic exercise dead lift then 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.469
 I have already told you how 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.610
 important it is with the finger too 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.440
 to handle the dumbbells 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 Of course you can also cross 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.309
 still the representative technique where to apply 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.660
 you twisted into the city goes in that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 here we are, so to speak, the cross handle 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.980
 Of course, twisting is a lot more 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 apart so you through the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.149
 turn makes sure that the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.680
 trade here in the middle of the hand in it 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.119
 That is, for example, if he is too 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.890
 Exercises are quite interesting that one 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.659
 so a bit twisted goes in the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 you can do it too if you are short 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.680
 Trade tube mask quite unpopular 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 Exercise that you also have something deeper with it 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.369
 the hand in the handle goes in so that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.020
 You grabbed a lot here meat 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.570
 but I see this here with me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.909
 small horny skin layer here this 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.020
 I also have education there 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.700
 of course, the side effect 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 or the side effects completely 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 Of course these are the ones you play 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.520
 can also decouple nicely when the end 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.020
 I'll be there for a long time, but that's just it 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.210
 for the handle already something completely different you 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 have a much firmer, more compact grip 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.799
 I also say the train exercises 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.820
 always with the thumb goes right around the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.040
 So do not stand around here 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 spider monkey handle suicide grip 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.680
 but really nice to go around 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.149
 one has since of course the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 possibility even if it is a pretty 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.049
 it seems absurd that one here with 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.420
 the hand closes alone, so to speak 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.110
 printing on the hand trade here is one 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 completely different 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.950
 so I advise always at train 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 about and chin up and so on what you 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.820
 classically in the area there 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.590
 behind, or here that one there 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.390
 do not handle the spider monkeys 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.829
 Of course you can do that at exercise 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.910
 also do that is partly even 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.380
 quite pleasant 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.120
 but you have just at higher 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.130
 weight the problem that the hand 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.480
 gradually rises and it has nothing of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.580
 hate to happen from now on 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.410
 but successively it opens up with it 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.670
 Of course you are already if parts 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.920
 weakens I can just anyone 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.560
 guessing is right about train exercises 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.150
 the increase is fixed 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.870
 and mentally gives you a completely different one 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.060
 feeling 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.050
 so now again for all those who 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.400
 say yes what does that mean now? 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.080
 Muscle building has to do it actually 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.910
 even in the faintest sense what with 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.920
 to do muscle building if your right 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.810
 then, of course, will also be effective 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.670
 forearm and hand musculature in 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.650
 other way if you ask 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.300
 just headless in the thing purely 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.470
 just goes to bar access there you 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.300
 could now with this handle here 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.670
 you will notice, for example, detlef 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.020
 that of course that hunt trade and 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.910
 even the forearm sometime flimsy 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.170
 Power is easy to notice then 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.670
 Of course you do not have that many 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.740
 get repeated like it 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.120
 actually possible again and that has 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.890
 of course, again on the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.210
 Muscle building is the whole thing 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.650
 always underestimated many need 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.970
 could break off somehow 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.890
 Maybe by the wall now 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.750
 less but always with pull-ups 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.190
 cancel again because it's easy from the beginning 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.530
 was not understood correctly 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.720
 Therefore, with concentration in the handle 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.459
 Going in thus starting each exercise is one 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.780
 very important tip all right, I hope 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.010
 Today we like our video 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.180
 us in the next video there is 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.250
 again determines a very interesting 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.420
 muscle building exercise we see each other many 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.420
