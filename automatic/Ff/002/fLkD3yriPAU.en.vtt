Gizmodo<00:02:02.820> happened

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
Gizmodo happened

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.680 
Gizmodo happened
I<00:02:04.630> got<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> lot<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.020> advice<00:02:06.939> from<00:02:07.939> people<00:02:08.239> that

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
I got a lot of advice from people that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.280 
I got a lot of advice from people that
said<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:10.220> got<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.759> just<00:02:10.970> let<00:02:11.269> it<00:02:11.450> slide

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
said you got to just let it slide

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.850 
said you got to just let it slide
you<00:02:13.010> shouldn't<00:02:13.430> go<00:02:14.360> after<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.140> journalist

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
you shouldn't go after a journalist

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.229 
you shouldn't go after a journalist
because<00:02:16.150> they<00:02:17.150> bought<00:02:17.480> stolen<00:02:18.080> property<00:02:18.920> and

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
because they bought stolen property and

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.839 
because they bought stolen property and
they<00:02:20.239> tried<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:20.599> extort<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.379> and<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.489> thought

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
they tried to extort you and I thought

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.960 
they tried to extort you and I thought
deeply<00:02:23.360> about<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.400> ended<00:02:25.790> up

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
deeply about this and I ended up

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.809 
deeply about this and I ended up
concluding<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.920> worst<00:02:28.310> thing<00:02:28.790> that

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
concluding that the worst thing that

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.530 
concluding that the worst thing that
could<00:02:29.239> possibly<00:02:29.269> happen<00:02:30.260> as<00:02:30.709> we<00:02:31.459> get<00:02:31.640> big<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
could possibly happen as we get big and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.780 
could possibly happen as we get big and
we<00:02:33.200> get<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.470> little<00:02:33.860> more<00:02:34.040> influence<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
we get a little more influence in the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.890 
we get a little more influence in the
world<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:36.019> we<00:02:36.290> change<00:02:36.860> our<00:02:37.849> core<00:02:38.299> values

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
world is if we change our core values

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.030 
world is if we change our core values
and<00:02:39.260> start<00:02:40.040> letting<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.640> slide<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.769> can't<00:02:42.769> do

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
and start letting it slide I can't do

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.990 
and start letting it slide I can't do
that<00:02:43.360> I'd<00:02:44.360> rather<00:02:44.599> quit<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.700> same

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
that I'd rather quit we have the same

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.440 
that I'd rather quit we have the same
values<00:02:47.660> now<00:02:47.959> as<00:02:48.230> we<00:02:48.379> had<00:02:48.650> then<00:02:48.980> we're<00:02:49.910> maybe<00:02:50.329> a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
values now as we had then we're maybe a

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.180 
values now as we had then we're maybe a
little<00:02:50.690> more<00:02:50.900> experienced<00:02:51.560> certainly<00:02:52.010> more

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
little more experienced certainly more

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.199 
little more experienced certainly more
beat<00:02:52.459> up<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.160> core<00:02:55.459> values<00:02:55.910> are<00:02:55.940> the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
beat up but but the core values are the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.530 
beat up but but the core values are the
same<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:58.390> we<00:02:59.390> come<00:02:59.629> into<00:02:59.810> work<00:03:00.370> wanting<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.700> do
