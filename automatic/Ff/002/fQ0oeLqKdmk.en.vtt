00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 how about friends from veracruz agropecuario 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.760
 this time we are going to talk about the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.190
 backyard bird production and good 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.190
 Well, let's start this program 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.829
 the conditions of the Mexican backyard 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.759
 It has deficiencies in infrastructure 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:30.460
 food and health management which 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.230
 impacts on low production of meat and 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.989
 egg in higher incidence of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.000
 diseases in high mortality and in 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.710
 low reproductive efficiency is 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.570
 necessary to have the support of 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.300
 medical specialists producers 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.760
 veterinarians and health authorities for 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.769
 strengthen backyard activity are 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.379
 the members of the families who 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.390
 they are dedicated to watch over feed and cure 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.000
 the birds however each member 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.190
 must have adequate training 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.120
 to ensure production either 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.340
 meat or egg 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.680
 it's important that they have a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.150
 closed space that has the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.470
 characteristics especially of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.229
 lighting and ventilation are both 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.570
 important elements for the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.300
 egg production in backyard good 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.920
 within the care is like 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.750
 I first commented that I was 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.740
 ventilated that has adequate space 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.810
 and especially that they have an atmosphere with 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.420
 an adequate number of feeders and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.869
 waterers because this will allow 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.360
 I do not know that there is no competition for 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.149
 food and that allows all 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.470
 animals eat at the same time good the 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.440
 backyard can be grass this grains 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.170
 like barley corn supplemented with a 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.880
 balanced food but what always 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.039
 look for us is that there is a 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.429
 balance in the diet that 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.530
 allow the good development of the birds 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.170
 we handle two races that are the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 dual purpose races that is the rhode 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 island 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.830
 and what is the red the red hen like the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.890
 we know and the Havana or lemon rock good 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.500
 first there is a control that they 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.050
 they should know that if we have 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.670
 bad this with bad cleaning bad hygiene 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.599
 obviously that is a source of infection 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.160
 for the birds and especially so 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.590
 avoid that I have strong airs 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.680
 and elevation of temperature so what 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.810
 more important is that people 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.380
 train them to have an orientation 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.569
 previous for what is the construction and 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.510
 for the management of the birds which 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.080
 only one that you will allow is that they have 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.090
 Favorable results 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.720
 we returned to the study in veracruz 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.720
 agricultural
