00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
let's the risk zero is my ten gigs

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.720 
let's the risk zero is my ten gigs
virtual<00:02:48.420> hard<00:02:48.870> drive<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:50.190> disk<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:50.549> is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
virtual hard drive and the disk one is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.229 
virtual hard drive and the disk one is
my<00:02:50.940> eight<00:02:51.410> gigabyte<00:02:52.580> flash<00:02:53.580> drive

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
my eight gigabyte flash drive

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.819 
my eight gigabyte flash drive
alright<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:54.720> we're<00:02:54.870> gonna<00:02:54.959> select<00:02:55.200> disk<00:02:55.590> one

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
alright so we're gonna select disk one

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:02.509 
alright so we're gonna select disk one
type<00:02:56.790> select<00:02:58.880> disk<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.750> equal<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:02.100> yeah

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
type select disk is equal to like yeah

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.699 
type select disk is equal to like yeah
equal<00:03:02.970> sign<00:03:03.180> one<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.049> this<00:03:04.170> one<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.470> not<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
equal sign one so this one is not the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.310 
equal sign one so this one is not the
selected<00:03:05.100> disk<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> then<00:03:06.450> after<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.200> got

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320

a select disk select partition okay we
can<00:03:13.079> just<00:03:13.260> list<00:03:14.190> partition<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.910> check<00:03:15.510> if

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
can just list partition if you check if

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.729 
can just list partition if you check if
you<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.140> know<00:03:16.260> more<00:03:16.470> than<00:03:16.590> one
