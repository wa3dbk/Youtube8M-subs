pretty<00:01:56.020> much<00:01:56.140> ambidextrous<00:01:56.860> except<00:01:57.310> for<00:01:57.459> one

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
pretty much ambidextrous except for one

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.550 
pretty much ambidextrous except for one
point<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.360> thumb<00:01:58.600> stud<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.079> same<00:01:59.289> on<00:01:59.409> both

sides and the handles machine the same

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.779 
sides and the handles machine the same
on<00:02:02.020> both<00:02:02.170> sides<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:03.069> if<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.219> switch<00:02:03.369> this<00:02:03.610> over

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
on both sides so if you switch this over

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.580 
on both sides so if you switch this over
you're<00:02:04.450> still<00:02:04.659> gonna<00:02:04.750> have<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:04.990> scoop<00:02:05.380> out

there<00:02:06.929> obviously<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.170> axis<00:02:08.649> system<00:02:08.830> is

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
there obviously the axis system is

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.240 
there obviously the axis system is
ambidextrous<00:02:10.690> sorry<00:02:11.230> my<00:02:11.380> focus<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.920> taking<00:02:12.190> a

ambidextrous sorry my focus is taking a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.150 
ambidextrous sorry my focus is taking a
little<00:02:12.340> bit<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.579> time<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:14.709> only<00:02:14.890> thing

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
little bit of time so the only thing

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.559

that<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.810> ambidextrous<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.829> safety

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
that is not ambidextrous is the safety

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.309 
that is not ambidextrous is the safety
which<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:20.370> very<00:02:21.370> cool<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
which is very cool I like the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.309 
which is very cool I like the
positioning<00:02:23.829> of<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> safety<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.230> a

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
positioning of the safety I think it's a

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.780 
positioning of the safety I think it's a
good<00:02:26.560> spot<00:02:26.890> locks<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.700> up<00:02:27.760> nice<00:02:29.549> that's<00:02:30.549> a<00:02:30.640> nice

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
good spot locks it up nice that's a nice

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.630 
good spot locks it up nice that's a nice
safety<00:02:31.090> that's<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.420> same<00:02:31.630> one<00:02:31.810> that's<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
safety that's the same one that's on the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.710 
safety that's the same one that's on the
