00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.230 

so<00:00:04.630> I<00:00:04.660> take<00:00:04.960> the<00:00:05.170> first<00:00:05.519> the<00:00:06.519> breath<00:00:06.729> is<00:00:06.939> coming

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
so I take the first the breath is coming

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.780 
so I take the first the breath is coming
out<00:00:07.359> of<00:00:07.390> that<00:00:07.510> first<00:00:07.630> step<00:00:08.170> and<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:09.490> take<00:00:09.760> my

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
out of that first step and I take my

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.960 
out of that first step and I take my
fingers<00:00:10.570> and<00:00:10.750> I'm<00:00:10.840> rocking<00:00:11.350> it<00:00:11.970> perpendicular

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970 
fingers and I'm rocking it perpendicular

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.090 
fingers and I'm rocking it perpendicular
to<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.570> rib<00:00:13.720> back<00:00:13.990> and<00:00:14.320> forth<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:14.710> back<00:00:14.890> and

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
to the rib back and forth the back and

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.620 
to the rib back and forth the back and
forth<00:00:15.310> and<00:00:15.490> you'll<00:00:15.610> notice<00:00:15.940> as<00:00:16.059> it<00:00:16.209> tightens

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
forth and you'll notice as it tightens

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.240 
forth and you'll notice as it tightens
then<00:00:16.869> not<00:00:17.019> actually<00:00:17.470> goes<00:00:17.619> down<00:00:17.859> underneath

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
then not actually goes down underneath

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.200 
then not actually goes down underneath
the<00:00:18.460> fabric<00:00:18.869> take<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.050> second<00:00:20.470> thread<00:00:21.339> and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
the fabric take the second thread and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.739 
the fabric take the second thread and
start<00:00:22.419> pulling<00:00:22.810> it<00:00:23.230> over<00:00:23.470> to<00:00:24.339> the<00:00:24.429> west<00:00:24.699> and<00:00:25.630> it

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
start pulling it over to the west and it

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.140 
start pulling it over to the west and it
tightens<00:00:26.169> down<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:27.009> not<00:00:27.189> actually<00:00:27.909> just

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
tightens down and the not actually just

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.229 
tightens down and the not actually just
goes<00:00:28.300> right<00:00:28.569> into<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.140> fabric<00:00:29.319> on<00:00:29.679> its<00:00:29.859> own

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
goes right into the fabric on its own

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.569 
goes right into the fabric on its own
that<00:00:31.239> is<00:00:31.509> that<00:00:31.960> is<00:00:32.230> essentially<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.130> stitch

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
that is that is essentially the stitch

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.750 
that is that is essentially the stitch
and<00:00:34.360> we're<00:00:34.570> just<00:00:34.720> going<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:34.960> go<00:00:35.430> get<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.640> the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
and we're just going to go get to the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.070 
and we're just going to go get to the
third<00:00:36.970> gotta<00:00:37.300> go<00:00:37.450> to<00:00:37.510> get<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:37.900> third

over<00:00:41.920> here<00:00:44.850> take<00:00:45.850> all<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.390> slack<00:00:46.630> out<00:00:46.840> go<00:00:47.740> down

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
over here take all the slack out go down

over here take all the slack out go down
the<00:00:48.670> east<00:00:48.880> side<00:00:49.560> now<00:00:50.560> the<00:00:50.620> rib<00:00:50.890> out<00:00:51.580> you<00:00:52.300> set

separate<00:01:07.150> those<00:01:07.390> two<00:01:07.420> things<00:01:07.930> with<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.740> east

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950

side thread that's laying there and the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.640 
side thread that's laying there and the
loop<00:01:11.590> goes<00:01:11.980> to<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.310> cell<00:01:12.540> step<00:01:13.540> one<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.290> bring

loop goes to the cell step one and bring

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.310 
loop goes to the cell step one and bring
that<00:01:17.830> down<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:19.330> don't<00:01:19.570> type<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:20.020> all<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.200> way

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320 
that down but don't type it all the way
now<00:01:21.310> we're<00:01:21.490> going<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.670> make<00:01:21.850> sure<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.180> that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
now we're going to make sure that that

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.899 
now we're going to make sure that that
loop<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:22.840> going<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.350> east<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:24.220> excess

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.290 
loop is going to the east that excess
thread<00:01:25.240> we're<00:01:25.990> going<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.170> go<00:01:26.290> underneath<00:01:26.740> and

thread we're going to go underneath and
back<00:01:28.300> out<00:01:28.540> above<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:30.310> loop<00:01:30.550> thread<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.409> it's

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
back out above the loop thread so it's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.719 
back out above the loop thread so it's
an<00:01:32.710> under<00:01:33.040> over<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.659> bring<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.409> get<00:01:36.310> most<00:01:36.520> of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
the slack out of there go back to step

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.310 
the slack out of there go back to step
one<00:01:39.310> grab<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.940> thread<00:01:40.090> rock<00:01:40.720> back<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.020> forth

perpendicular if you rock parallel you

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.070 
perpendicular if you rock parallel you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
could tear the fabric it's possible so

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.660 
could tear the fabric it's possible so

stitch so you're going to go underneath
down<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.320> next<00:02:02.560> stitch<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:03.010> know<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.760> is

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
down to the next stitch I know this is

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.310 
down to the next stitch I know this is
repetitious<00:02:04.570> but<00:02:04.750> we've<00:02:04.900> only<00:02:04.990> got<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.290> couple

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
repetitious but we've only got a couple

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.530 
repetitious but we've only got a couple
more<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:06.400> do<00:02:06.580> before<00:02:06.760> we<00:02:06.970> finish<00:02:07.360> this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
more to do before we finish this

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.990 
more to do before we finish this
particular<00:02:08.080> rib<00:02:08.260> and<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.100> think<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.369> just<00:02:09.520> put

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
particular rib and I think I just put

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
two threads and just bring it up and

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.430 
two threads and just bring it up and
leave<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.190> hanging<00:04:55.750> now<00:04:56.750> go<00:04:56.930> back<00:04:57.139> to

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
step to rock now you end up with a loop

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.900 
step to rock now you end up with a loop
and<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.370> tail

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
and a tail

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.730 
and a tail
you've<00:05:08.570> got<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.840> loop<00:05:08.960> down<00:05:09.170> here<00:05:09.410> take<00:05:09.590> the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
you've got the loop down here take the

tail to the south through the loop and

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.180 
tail to the south through the loop and
tighten<00:05:12.980> it<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.670> that<00:05:13.910> is<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.600> half<00:05:15.140> hitch<00:05:15.440> at

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
tighten it and that is a half hitch at

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.000 
tighten it and that is a half hitch at
the<00:05:16.430> end

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.640

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
when I take I'm using flat chord which

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.130 
when I take I'm using flat chord which
is<00:06:11.670> much<00:06:11.970> easier<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.450> use<00:06:12.570> than<00:06:12.720> round<00:06:12.930> four

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
is much easier to use than round four

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.630 
is much easier to use than round four
and<00:06:13.410> he<00:06:13.530> likes<00:06:13.740> it<00:06:13.860> when<00:06:13.950> I<00:06:14.010> take<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.430> back<00:06:14.580> of

and he likes it when I take the back of

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.210 
and he likes it when I take the back of
the<00:06:14.910> needle<00:06:15.060> just<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:15.480> round<00:06:15.660> part<00:06:16.170> and<00:06:16.440> I<00:06:16.920> run

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
the needle just the round part and I run

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.850 
the needle just the round part and I run
it<00:06:17.370> across<00:06:17.550> each<00:06:18.540> of<00:06:18.810> the<00:06:18.930> stitches<00:06:19.140> and<00:06:19.620> you

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
it across each of the stitches and you

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.790 
it across each of the stitches and you
can<00:06:20.100> see<00:06:20.460> you<00:06:20.730> can<00:06:20.880> actively<00:06:21.180> see<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:22.440> thread

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
can see you can actively see the thread

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.010 
can see you can actively see the thread
flattening<00:06:23.610> out<00:06:23.790> even<00:06:24.360> more<00:06:24.390> than<00:06:24.600> it<00:06:24.840> already

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
flattening out even more than it already

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.400 
flattening out even more than it already
is<00:06:25.410> just<00:06:25.890> by<00:06:26.610> rubbing<00:06:26.940> that<00:06:27.390> back<00:06:28.200> of<00:06:28.350> that

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
is just by rubbing that back of that

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.100 
is just by rubbing that back of that
needle<00:06:28.680> across<00:06:29.040> those<00:06:29.280> stitches<00:06:29.900> it<00:06:30.900> makes

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
needle across those stitches it makes

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.430 
needle across those stitches it makes
for<00:06:31.260> a<00:06:31.320> very<00:06:31.380> very<00:06:31.740> smooth<00:06:32.490> finish<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:33.440> that's

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
for a very very smooth finish and that's

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.650 
for a very very smooth finish and that's
it
