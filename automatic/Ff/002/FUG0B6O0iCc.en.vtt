morning<00:01:56.670> noon<00:01:57.670> night<00:01:58.110> some<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.230> us<00:01:59.320> eat<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.740> our

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
morning noon night some of us eat in our

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.090 
morning noon night some of us eat in our
sleep<00:02:00.570> I'm<00:02:01.570> not<00:02:01.690> going<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:01.930> name<00:02:02.050> any<00:02:02.770> names

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
sleep I'm not going to name any names

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.210 
sleep I'm not going to name any names
but<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.850> know<00:02:04.270> people<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.990> sleep<00:02:05.350> walk<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.100> go

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
but I know people that sleep walk and go

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.639 
but I know people that sleep walk and go
to<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.520> fridge<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:06.820> open<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.900> start<00:02:08.319> eating

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
to the fridge and open and start eating

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.250 
to the fridge and open and start eating
so<00:02:09.580> we<00:02:09.819> really<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:11.500> our<00:02:11.739> sleep<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.330> one<00:02:14.050> thing

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
so we really in our sleep and one thing

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.399 
so we really in our sleep and one thing
I<00:02:14.379> think<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:14.739> can<00:02:14.890> all<00:02:15.040> see<00:02:15.540> right<00:02:16.540> now<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:17.019> how

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
I think we can all see right now is how

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.790 
I think we can all see right now is how
the<00:02:17.470> world<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.129> totally<00:02:19.120> out<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.330> balance<00:02:19.800> said

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
the world is totally out of balance said

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.850 
the world is totally out of balance said
right

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
right

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.030 
right
