quarters<00:00:45.020> let's<00:00:45.410> break<00:00:45.590> this<00:00:45.710> trick<00:00:45.950> down

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
quarters let's break this trick down

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.910 
quarters let's break this trick down
into<00:00:46.340> five<00:00:46.579> easy<00:00:47.090> steps<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:47.960> step<00:00:48.260> one<00:00:48.500> is<00:00:48.770> the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
into five easy steps so step one is the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.470 
into five easy steps so step one is the
approach<00:00:49.280> now<00:00:49.850> when<00:00:50.000> trying<00:00:50.210> frontside

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
approach now when trying frontside

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.940 
approach now when trying frontside
tailslide<00:00:50.719> you<00:00:51.260> want<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.469> be<00:00:51.530> approaching<00:00:51.920> the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
tailslide you want to be approaching the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.830 
tailslide you want to be approaching the
coping<00:00:52.340> at<00:00:52.430> like<00:00:52.520> a<00:00:52.550> 45<00:00:52.940> degree<00:00:53.239> angle<00:00:53.420> and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
coping at like a 45 degree angle and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.959 
coping at like a 45 degree angle and
then<00:00:54.260> start<00:00:54.500> curving<00:00:54.860> in<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.850> getting

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
then start curving in and getting

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.430 
then start curving in and getting
parallel<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.600> coping<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.020> yet<00:00:57.199> closer

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
parallel to the coping is yet closer

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.439 
parallel to the coping is yet closer
this<00:00:58.039> will<00:00:58.190> set<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.460> up<00:00:58.520> for<00:00:58.579> step<00:00:58.940> two<00:00:59.210> the

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
this will set you up for step two the

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.319 
this will set you up for step two the
man<00:01:00.050> alright<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.010> step<00:01:01.039> two<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:01.850> actually<00:01:02.239> the

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
man alright so step two is actually the

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.819 
man alright so step two is actually the
key<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.719> overcoming<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.230> most<00:01:03.410> difficult

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
key to overcoming the most difficult

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.499 
key to overcoming the most difficult
part<00:01:03.859> of<00:01:04.070> this<00:01:04.160> trick<00:01:04.460> which<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:04.940> getting<00:01:05.239> your

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
part of this trick which is getting your

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.960 
part of this trick which is getting your
tail<00:01:05.810> into<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.289> frontside<00:01:06.710> tailslide<00:01:06.970> step

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
tail into the frontside tailslide step

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.000 
tail into the frontside tailslide step
two<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.450> basically<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.900> shifting<00:01:09.229> engine<00:01:09.380> all

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
two is basically the shifting engine all

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.590 
two is basically the shifting engine all
you<00:01:10.189> want<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.430> be<00:01:10.490> doing<00:01:10.640> here<00:01:10.939> is<00:01:11.060> once<00:01:11.479> you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
you want to be doing here is once you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.120 
you want to be doing here is once you
complete<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.200> approach<00:01:12.470> you're<00:01:12.710> coming<00:01:13.010> in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
complete the approach you're coming in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.340 
complete the approach you're coming in
at<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.310> 45<00:01:13.790> sweeping<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.390> when<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.140> wheel

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
at that 45 sweeping in when the wheel

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.080 
at that 45 sweeping in when the wheel
gets<00:01:15.560> really<00:01:15.860> close<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.220> coping<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:16.939> want

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
gets really close to the coping you want

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.310 
gets really close to the coping you want
to<00:01:17.180> lift<00:01:17.360> up<00:01:17.510> into<00:01:17.659> a<00:01:17.780> manual

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
to lift up into a manual

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.600 
to lift up into a manual
and<00:01:18.620> turn<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:18.950> front<00:01:19.190> into<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> frontside

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
and turn it front into a frontside

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.790 
and turn it front into a frontside
shifty<00:01:20.030> man<00:01:20.150> that'll<00:01:20.990> make<00:01:21.050> your<00:01:21.170> tail<00:01:21.380> kind

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
shifty man that'll make your tail kind

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.410 
shifty man that'll make your tail kind
of<00:01:21.860> float<00:01:22.130> right<00:01:22.490> over<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.970> coping<00:01:23.150> and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
of float right over the coping and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.000 
of float right over the coping and
you'll<00:01:23.540> be<00:01:23.630> ready<00:01:23.750> for<00:01:23.930> step<00:01:24.140> three<00:01:24.409> all<00:01:24.920> right

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
you'll be ready for step three all right
