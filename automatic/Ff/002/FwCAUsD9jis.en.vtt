00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.290
 put the us before the ego 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.780
 cesare prandelli has no doubts in brazil 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.480
 will need a group a united group will be 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.000
 this is the first condition to dispute 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 a good world in the first day of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.590
 work at coverciano at 26 days 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.109
 from the world debut with england 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.710
 the blue coach clearly says that not 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.890
 there will be room for individualism 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.980
 these thirty players then 23 must 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 being 23 resources for us must have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.380
 all the knowledge that it could 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.610
 just take a few minutes to leave 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.390
 leave the mark 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.390
 so maximum availability we put from 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 part god but we think we think 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.460
 to the team if we start already with these 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.100
 assumptions means that we have already 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 understood what awaits us there 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 centrality of the group does not leave in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.399
 second floor the individual prandelli spends 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.770
 important words for cassano is his 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.940
 last big chance says it makes 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.420
 honor to giuseppe rossi 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.460
 an example according to the gip his 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 determination his will that of 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 recover the gods first to do 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.430
 a thousand sacrifices to be here is the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.110
 demonstration that even the champions must 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.680
 put so much character into what 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.970
 they do 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.970
 so it can be an example can be 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.820
 a reference for the whole group on 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.680
 field immediately an intense double session of 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.479
 work for the Azzurri from the point of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 view of the resistance prandelli ha 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.920
 found the boys in excellent condition 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 so in these first three days of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.659
 withdrawal before you break the lines of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.299
 Thursday the preparation will be concentrated 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.490
 on strength a special training is 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.520
 It was then organized into a structure 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.040
 made ad hoc to recreate the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.979
 high humidity conditions 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.119

 england city ​​where the average of 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.549
 humidity of the period is equal to 83 per 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.530
 one hundred 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.570
 if you worked on your muscles in the morning 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.430
 in the afternoon we went to the head 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.710
 with the first tactical tests for one 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.440
 team that said prandelli will have to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.000
 be flexible and not anchored to one person 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.830
 marco form 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.930
