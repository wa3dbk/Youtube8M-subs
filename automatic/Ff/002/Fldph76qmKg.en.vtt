00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.330
 now i think this is a fix 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.089
 will look at up to 5 0 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.710
 if you count like 53 year old 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.059
 anniversary 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.399
 with them goes 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.139
 but it is only a lazy case 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.050
 Enough enjoy the transfer count let's 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.079
 make the phone look at it 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.579
 it's made of plastic for screen 354 on 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.070
 screen resolution by the way 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.070
 quite good for this size 320 by 480 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.960
 there are four touch buttons here 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.290
 thank god anyway there are buttons that 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.540
 the result is always happy when they 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.700
 are present 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.590
 percentage let's look at the top 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.610
 such a shiny plastic socket 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.550
 headphone button 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.730
 everything is clear side adjustment 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.200
 volume and a button for the camera on the copper 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.030
 take off 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.930
 this is also a very good plus price of 2 5 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.660
 thousands of surfaces wings beating 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.630
 ensign 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.670
 Well, behind us is waiting for the five-megapixel 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.100
 the camera is there neatly here i am 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.010
 in money 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.890
 here is such a aviakorpusa came out 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.229
 against 0 3 by the way 700 megahertz 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.160
 processors if there is this module 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.340
 that in general the fact that many will please but 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.710
 let's turn on Lyon 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260
 and we have 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.150
 it costs an android with barely barely anyway 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.280
 all interface sata phone russia 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.970
 changed in my opinion it is divided 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.650
 in two parts that neither is very beautiful 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.890
 another but not so beautiful change 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.250
 as a beauty 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.990
 with more of it left from hunger and 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 Toronto 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.440
 android this policy can be 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.070
 short on the page is to transfer the composition 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.090
 pretty 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.800
 although it is not always necessary to say it is convenient 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.810
 there is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.350
 Exodus Zhebriv deals what happened 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.800
 It does not always work 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.350
 she quickly lock screen a 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.360
 Here is the main screen for 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.860
 an account yes in general, do not get sick some see 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.909
 always hanging here 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.409
 and in every way his tanya 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.700
 there is here but 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.969
 some interesting things for example if 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:03.369
 my 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.800
 move this way 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.289
 then we see 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.140
 and here such as in the media rf media section 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.400
 in which there is 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.069
 pictures have music 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.459
 and there is a leonid adding us here 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.719
 she is not 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.680
 Vobschem such a small scout 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.909
 than enough 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.499
 interesting nicely done already

 you can live our pace at our place 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.699
 open position which 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.249
 is responsible 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.429
 proper percentage is this file in which on 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.479
 which she is the hall if you bailiffs another 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.159
 side here we will be a list of running or 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.620
 I will not give running applications 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.539
 leading akiva cute 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.279
 followers 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.509
 which is generally the same saturated 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.049
 Makarov pace today 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.789
 may be helpful to use 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.659
 and if we ask here and so department down then 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.549
 we will have a full list of applications and 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.359
 here it is already divided by pages and you can 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.109
 you can edit it 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.879
 drag all programs to change 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.280
 places you can drive 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.780
 programs here laptop dock main 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.889
 which will be silver 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.799
 general project is quite convenient 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.499
 Well, where is hot notify widgets and 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.190
 you say, and for this there are special 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.319
 button 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.739
 so with the button she opens us here in 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.649
 Generally normal android 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.369
 in the registration process throughout 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:20.040
 country 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.450
 on which we can add a movie here 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.080
 you can only talk budgets 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.569
 references to citizens can not speak 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.699
 in society own in 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.479
 interface adding here 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:31.869
 list of all kinds there are several 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.299
 standard weather treats in the cockpit 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.969
 music 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.489
 by the way interesting by the way too 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.759
 to budget 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.189
 and here, too, there is an ivy button with 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.179
 You can also add it using it. 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.909
 moved all the same pages on them 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.659
 located budgets 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.790
 in general, attacks implemented from above 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.469
 pressure panel she's different too 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.979
 just do not pull 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.179
 like this in all other androids 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.759
 documents we will sort so low 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.379
 you just need to click on it 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.719
 if it consists of several sections 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.999
 what topics 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.349
 and you are here in the morning in one section themselves 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.729
 here's the dam's notice here are the various 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.889
 switch settings and status 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.209
 You can turn on turn off Wi-Fi 2300 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.309
 ha 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.090
 and another section with a clock in which we 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.289
 we can watch the date and manage it 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.999
 alarm clock 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.370
 here you can 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 such a thing 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.849
 It is in short what 10 percent is 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:31.469
 there is 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.599
 in some modified what to buy if 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.050
 press the home button then 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.480
 raise selling prices 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.159
 main screen 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.279
 and if for his attempt home is only lifting 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.580
 faucet flowery 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.509
 here on this 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.580
 ohh mkh well what's inside here 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.950
 preinstalled 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.699
 quite a lot of application 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.749
 steppe applications 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:55.199
 For example, for example, a display like 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.549
 installed programs adobe stubbom possible when 

00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:59.099
 help not edited 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.339
 and view 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.599
 office documents 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.219
 the percentage is also in canada ready 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.939
 navigator 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.939
 the percentage which is called 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.669
 but also retail it is installed 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.639
 also in general 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.499
 good surprise for car enthusiasts 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:17.379
 questions because conveniently brilliant 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:18.909
 along with a big screen pole 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.580
 car on which but 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.419
 in general, he is here 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.680
 also from programs that are already here 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.199
 there is worth noting 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.499
 here is such a substance which is not called 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:30.749
 could alas not 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.529
 so universal to me the programs themselves 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.089
 to manage various rallies 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.900
 does not sing ethics 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.780
 she has a section with an image here 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.639
 a minute as beautiful as Yeltsin here 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.919
 picture 4 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.139
 but you can also look at the folders 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.189
 various images 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.330
 still other sections such here 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.059
 nice to eat 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.369
 percentage is it feel shock 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.980
 friday 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.330
 with different emotions 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.249
 in eastern health duma 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.680
 and there is a section with music 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.180
 here in general the usual plastic 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.389
 artist album and all that 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.430
 married originally made I undressed 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.369
 video can also be watched 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:15.369
 timoshkin if some small role 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.659
 generally there 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:19.830
 On this 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.710
 probably will be presented perfectly 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.539
 it turns out 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.889
 Kaas these application standards android glasses 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.800
 it looks quite simple here 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.029
 but for example Samara 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:30.860
 by phone by the way 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.879
 modified a little bit externally and 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.889
 he looks like a real painter in what their russia 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:37.719
 the science 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.919
 but like the little letters and counting the numbers by 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.080
 according to 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.849
 equally and successfully works 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.210
 this profession 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.940
 standard sections inevitably general 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.970
 nothing tons modified 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.899
 this phone 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:54.629
 and the keyboard here is standard too 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.249
 several opinion UAH try 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.240
 what will write 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.889
 that's that but look like this 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.139
 here is the percentage 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.039
 as you can see which buttons 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.399
 but also because the brand is its exhibition 

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:08.439
 quality 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.099
 as we know the most beautiful 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:12.959
 but if everything is written in such 

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.939
 can switch language 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:18.210
 can be customized therefore 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.930
 east interesting so here is the solution 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.770
 Spartak Nalchik 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.370
 wide phone man 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.719
 yes in general 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:27.429
 sufficiently second 

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:30.389
 the percentage is quite light compact 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:32.930
 than and still almost outwardly 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.319
 ordinary citizens 

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:37.110
 similar investors
