00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
mm-hmm anyway so we have two canisters

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.350 
mm-hmm anyway so we have two canisters
of<00:00:32.360> absorbent<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.829> flow<00:00:34.550> comes<00:00:34.850> in<00:00:35.120> goes

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
of absorbent the flow comes in goes

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.850 
of absorbent the flow comes in goes
through<00:00:35.570> one<00:00:35.720> of<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.900> scrubbers<00:00:36.320> goes<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:36.770> our

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
through one of the scrubbers goes to our

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.460 
through one of the scrubbers goes to our
counter<00:00:37.250> lungs<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.760> then<00:00:38.090> flows<00:00:38.329> back<00:00:38.360> up<00:00:38.809> we

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
counter lungs and then flows back up we

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.280 
counter lungs and then flows back up we
have<00:00:39.589> oxygen<00:00:39.800> sensors<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.640> here<00:00:41.170> measures<00:00:42.170> the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
have oxygen sensors in here measures the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.229 
have oxygen sensors in here measures the
oxygen<00:00:42.710> level<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.100> whatever<00:00:43.460> needs<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.089> be

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
oxygen level and whatever needs to be

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.140 
oxygen level and whatever needs to be
added<00:00:44.900> gets<00:00:45.559> added<00:00:45.739> through<00:00:46.160> an<00:00:46.699> ADD<00:00:46.850> valve

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
added gets added through an ADD valve

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.210 
added gets added through an ADD valve
over<00:00:47.449> here<00:00:47.660> what's<00:00:48.410> really<00:00:48.710> unique<00:00:48.890> about

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
over here what's really unique about

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.189 
over here what's really unique about
this<00:00:49.519> rebreather<00:00:50.000> though<00:00:50.269> is<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.079> has

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
this rebreather though is that it has

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.990 
this rebreather though is that it has
wraparound<00:00:51.710> counterlungs<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:52.699> they<00:00:52.820> come

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
wraparound counterlungs so they come

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.020 
wraparound counterlungs so they come
around<00:00:53.150> your<00:00:53.600> chest<00:00:53.839> okay<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:54.800> faith<00:00:55.579> overall

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
around your chest okay so faith overall

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.569 
around your chest okay so faith overall
look<00:00:56.449> it's<00:00:56.870> easier<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.410> breathe<00:00:57.590> because<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
look it's easier to breathe because the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.000 
look it's easier to breathe because the
lungs<00:00:59.270> are<00:00:59.510> wrapped<00:00:59.719> around<00:00:59.899> your<00:01:00.230> lungs<00:01:00.440> so

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
lungs are wrapped around your lungs so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.819 
lungs are wrapped around your lungs so
no<00:01:01.190> matter<00:01:01.309> what<00:01:01.489> position<00:01:01.670> you're<00:01:02.120> in<00:01:02.710> it's<00:01:03.710> a

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
no matter what position you're in it's a

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.389 
no matter what position you're in it's a
lot<00:01:03.980> easier<00:01:04.160> to<00:01:04.460> breathe<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:06.250> for<00:01:07.250> this

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
lot easier to breathe and so for this

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.609 
lot easier to breathe and so for this
year<00:01:07.700> we're<00:01:08.000> introducing<00:01:08.539> a<00:01:08.690> lite<00:01:08.990> version<00:01:09.020> of

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
year we're introducing a lite version of

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.870 
year we're introducing a lite version of
it<00:01:09.770> which<00:01:10.759> is<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> lot<00:01:11.270> lighter<00:01:11.570> weight<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.880> in

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
it which is a lot lighter weight and in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.300 
it which is a lot lighter weight and in
a<00:01:14.060> lot<00:01:14.240> less<00:01:14.450> expensive<00:01:14.979> we've<00:01:15.979> done<00:01:16.190> away

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
a lot less expensive we've done away

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.859 
a lot less expensive we've done away
with<00:01:16.429> a<00:01:16.580> lot<00:01:16.789> of<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.000> stainless<00:01:17.420> steel<00:01:17.630> and

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
with a lot of the stainless steel and

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.580 
with a lot of the stainless steel and
we've<00:01:17.990> got<00:01:18.229> an<00:01:18.350> ABS<00:01:18.920> plastic<00:01:19.660> backplate<00:01:20.690> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
we've got an ABS plastic backplate and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.109 
we've got an ABS plastic backplate and
the<00:01:21.710> harness<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.280> integrated<00:01:22.850> into<00:01:23.000> that

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
the harness is integrated into that

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.810 
the harness is integrated into that
backplate<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.560> this<00:01:24.830> more<00:01:25.070> like<00:01:25.429> if<00:01:25.640> for

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
backplate so this more like if for

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.669 
backplate so this more like if for
traveling<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.479> stuff<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:26.869> will<00:01:27.050> be<00:01:27.440> great

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
traveling and stuff this will be great

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.690 
traveling and stuff this will be great
for<00:01:27.860> traveling<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:29.090> has<00:01:29.569> a<00:01:29.599> cam<00:01:30.020> bands<00:01:30.700> that

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
for traveling it has a cam bands that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.020 
for traveling it has a cam bands that
the<00:01:31.940> collapse<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.569> it<00:01:32.720> foap<00:01:33.160> another<00:01:34.160> thing

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
the collapse and it foap another thing

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.699 
the collapse and it foap another thing
that's<00:01:35.179> really<00:01:35.330> good<00:01:35.630> about<00:01:35.660> our<00:01:36.050> units<00:01:36.500> is

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
that's really good about our units is

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.889 
that's really good about our units is
that<00:01:36.740> everything<00:01:37.640> comes<00:01:37.819> apart<00:01:38.030> by<00:01:38.390> hand<00:01:38.599> with

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
that everything comes apart by hand with

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.109 
that everything comes apart by hand with
no<00:01:39.080> tools<00:01:39.349> okay<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:40.610> matter<00:01:40.910> of<00:01:41.000> just

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
no tools okay and in a matter of just

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.479 
no tools okay and in a matter of just
minutes<00:01:41.750> okay<00:01:42.289> you<00:01:42.530> can<00:01:42.709> service<00:01:43.009> your<00:01:43.340> whole

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:43.489 
minutes okay you can service your whole

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.880 
minutes okay you can service your whole
rebreather

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
rebreather

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.580 
rebreather
but<00:01:46.160> it's<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:46.790> real<00:01:47.030> modular<00:01:47.660> so<00:01:48.290> it's<00:01:48.410> real

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
but it's it's real modular so it's real

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.480 
but it's it's real modular so it's real
easy<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.980> pack<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.770> sensors<00:01:52.160> go<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.400> the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
easy to pack and the sensors go in the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.370 
easy to pack and the sensors go in the
look<00:01:52.670> plate<00:01:52.910> there<00:01:53.150> so<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.200> say

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
look plate there so like I say

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.190 
look plate there so like I say
everything<00:01:55.160> is<00:01:55.490> no<00:01:55.970> tools<00:01:56.650> very<00:01:57.650> simple<00:01:58.190> diver

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
everything is no tools very simple diver
