we initially bond it and then like

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.640 
we initially bond it and then like

everything went on with the season and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.979 
everything went on with the season and
stuff<00:02:41.769> like<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:41.950> was<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.880> stronger<00:02:43.870> as<00:02:43.959> a

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
stuff like that was just a stronger as a
