00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
bit of a mess we went off the main road

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.640 
bit of a mess we went off the main road
to<00:01:42.540> take<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.530> photos<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
to take some photos and

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.410 
to take some photos and
well<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:47.450> got<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> bit<00:01:48.020> rough<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:49.150> we<00:01:50.150> could

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
well it got a bit rough and we could

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.690 
well it got a bit rough and we could
have<00:01:50.570> used<00:01:50.810> four-wheel-drive<00:01:51.260> well<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:52.520> we

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
have used four-wheel-drive well but we

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.520 
have used four-wheel-drive well but we
managed<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.510> it's<00:01:53.900> not<00:01:54.050> something<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.500> really

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
managed so it's not something you really

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.740 
managed so it's not something you really
need<00:01:54.770> every<00:01:55.190> day<00:01:55.340> today<00:01:55.940> we<00:01:56.210> are<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:56.660> a
