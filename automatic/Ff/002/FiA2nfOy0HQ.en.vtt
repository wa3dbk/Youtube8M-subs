a<00:00:12.660> lot<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.410> people<00:00:13.650> don't<00:00:13.740> know<00:00:13.889> about<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.309> I

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
was I think I'm like the only one in my

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.890 
was I think I'm like the only one in my
entire<00:00:18.060> school<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.449> moves<00:00:18.630> about<00:00:18.779> it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
entire school that moves about it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.660 
entire school that moves about it
probably<00:00:19.170> because<00:00:19.470> I'm<00:00:20.070> 13<00:00:20.369> whatever

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
probably because I'm 13 whatever

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.900 
probably because I'm 13 whatever
but<00:00:23.810> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.990> both<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:26.720> CMD<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.099> terminal<00:00:29.099> but

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
but this is both on CMD and terminal but

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.609 
but this is both on CMD and terminal but
I<00:00:29.939> don't<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.750> they're<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> same<00:00:31.080> exact

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
I don't know if they're the same exact

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.069 
I don't know if they're the same exact
code<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.369> look<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.669> yourself

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
code but you can look that up yourself

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
code but you can look that up yourself
I'm<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> paste<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.770> terminal<00:00:35.370> command

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
I'm going to paste the terminal command

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
I'm going to paste the terminal command
or<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> terminal<00:00:37.260> prompt<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
or the terminal prompt in the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.310 
or the terminal prompt in the
description<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.760> you're<00:00:39.420> too<00:00:39.629> lazy<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.110> go<00:00:40.290> out

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
description if you're too lazy to go out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
description if you're too lazy to go out
and<00:00:40.800> find<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and find it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.760 
and find it
but<00:00:42.480> basically<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:43.050> you're<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> want

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
but basically what you're going to want

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.369 
but basically what you're going to want
to<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:45.200> you're<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.469> type<00:00:46.800> telnet

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.610 

cowl

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
cowl

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.910 
cowl
dot<00:00:53.520> blink<00:00:54.059> ten<00:00:54.600> lights<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.559> had<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
dot blink ten lights I had to think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.060 
dot blink ten lights I had to think
there<00:00:56.160> dot<00:00:56.910> NL<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.739> is<00:01:00.020> that<00:01:01.070> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there dot NL and I think that is that so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.289 
there dot NL and I think that is that so
basically<00:01:02.690> this<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.899> Star<00:01:04.140> Wars<00:01:04.170> yeah<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
basically this is Star Wars yeah it's a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.310 
basically this is Star Wars yeah it's a
Star<00:01:06.570> Wars<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.580> I<00:01:08.580> don't<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.689> how

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
Star Wars are here and I don't know how

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.070 
Star Wars are here and I don't know how
far<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.979> goes<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> whole

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
far this goes I know it's not the whole

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
far this goes I know it's not the whole
movie<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.950> think<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.880> might<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.240> have

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
movie I don't think it might be have

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
movie I don't think it might be have
never<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:16.259> holy<00:01:17.400> I've<00:01:17.490> never

be in this size box
so<00:01:46.259> whatever<00:01:46.829> terminal<00:01:47.460> starts<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.119> you're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so whatever terminal starts up in you're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
so whatever terminal starts up in you're
going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.409> want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:50.040> move<00:01:50.280> around<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.030> it's

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
going to want to not move around so it's

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.510 
going to want to not move around so it's
got<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> stay<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.840> size<00:01:52.140> oh<00:01:54.799> no<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
got to stay this size oh no and like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.940 
got to stay this size oh no and like
doubled<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> lines<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> second<00:01:59.630> but

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
Easter eggs like this actually this

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.080 
Easter eggs like this actually this
requires<00:02:12.959> um

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
requires um

requires um
internet<00:02:15.870> connection<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.160> if<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:18.060> don't<00:02:18.300> have

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
internet connection so if you don't have

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 
internet connection so if you don't have
internet<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.260> would<00:02:20.070> not<00:02:20.190> be<00:02:20.340> watching<00:02:20.490> this

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
internet you would not be watching this

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.910 
internet you would not be watching this
video<00:02:21.060> but<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.840> do<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.230> internet<00:02:22.620> this

video but if you do have internet this

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.040 
video but if you do have internet this
will<00:02:23.100> run<00:02:23.250> fine<00:02:23.610> for<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.750> have<00:02:24.840> slow
