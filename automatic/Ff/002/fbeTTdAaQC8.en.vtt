00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
overtake someone it's just kind of just

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.630 
overtake someone it's just kind of just
one<00:01:43.899> of<00:01:43.990> those<00:01:44.080> things<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.619> all<00:01:44.920> means<00:01:45.220> all

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
one of those things and it all means all

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.479 
one of those things and it all means all
the<00:01:45.849> problems<00:01:46.239> with<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.420> car<00:01:46.660> stemmed<00:01:47.319> from

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:47.489 
the problems with a car stemmed from

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
the problems with a car stemmed from
from<00:01:48.489> that<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:48.789> thing<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.239> i<00:01:49.270> think<00:01:49.330> we<00:01:49.479> had

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
from that one thing so i think we had

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.080 
from that one thing so i think we had
three<00:01:49.840> different<00:01:49.989> stops<00:01:50.500> for<00:01:51.369> three<00:01:51.580> hours<00:01:51.610> or

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
three different stops for three hours or

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.320 
three different stops for three hours or
more<00:01:52.239> because<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.929> that<00:01:52.959> so<00:01:53.670> after<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:55.030> it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
more because of that so after that it's

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.270 
more because of that so after that it's
hard<00:01:55.569> to<00:01:55.750> sort<00:01:55.989> of<00:01:56.020> pick<00:01:56.170> yourself<00:01:56.500> up<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:56.890> get

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
hard to sort of pick yourself up and get

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.559 
hard to sort of pick yourself up and get
back<00:01:57.489> driving<00:01:57.789> again<00:01:58.149> but<00:01:58.239> as<00:01:58.300> soon<00:01:58.420> as<00:01:58.509> you

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
back driving again but as soon as you

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.660 
back driving again but as soon as you
get<00:01:58.660> in<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.840> car<00:01:59.020> it's<00:01:59.310> amazing<00:02:00.310> realities
