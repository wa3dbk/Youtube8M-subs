00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the cases of doctors addicted to dollars 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.000
 before us are no longer isolated cases 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.400
 no piauÃ­ 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.590
 these cases will be investigated 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.840
 by the federal police through 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.849
 open by the board 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.240
 regional level of medicine and surveillance 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.029
 state case the case is faced with 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 drug trafficking and has already resulted in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.039
 death of a surveillance officer 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.130
 I see with great sadness and with 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.040
 apprehension because the doctor is a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.350
 citizen as any other and he is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.600
 subject to all hazards 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.390
 particularly in relation to drugs that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 the general population is also subject 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.410
 and a doctor has a plus that would be the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.489
 ease of arranging the drug in which 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.559
 he becomes addicted 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.059
 for example if he uses the be assumes the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 my latina case he has in the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.770
 facility within the hospital 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 get that drug on the journey 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.110
 excessive stress and stress. 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.210
 great facility for the acquisition of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.400
 are some of the factors that come 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.130
 contributing to the increase in the number of 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.689
 doctors dependent on this drug 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.970
 according to the regional council of 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.850
 medicine from the moment that this 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.979
 chemical dependency is proven 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 professional is removed from his or her 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.470
 the council he receives the denunciations and 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.240
 he opened the investigation within that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.880
 if the evidence proving that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.250
 really this individual is used of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.710
 drug and immediately restrained 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.110
 denunciations indicate that a director of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.869
 hospital in Teresina was reported to the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.119
 by the parents themselves in the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.869
 attempt to quit the addiction and 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.240
 seek a detoxification treatment 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.450
 the president of crm 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.159
 makes some considerations and states that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.840
 new cases must actually surface 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.780
 regional council of medicine and the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.149
 federal council are extremely 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.939
 apprehensive with the exaggerated increase 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.220
 physician and therefore appearance of this 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.040
 kind of thing means increase 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.010
 exaggerated one of the doctors who really 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.159
 without greater perspective because they were not 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.299
 retired they depart to 111 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.299
 derivation like this
