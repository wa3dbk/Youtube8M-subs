00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.330 
here q pair activated on both of these
devices<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:34.750> see<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.140> notification<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:35.979> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
devices you see the notification in the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.370 
devices you see the notification in the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
notification area here and I can for

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.920 
notification area here and I can for
example<00:01:38.439> call<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.759> can<00:01:39.909> send<00:01:40.270> text<00:01:40.420> messages

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
example call I can send text messages

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.810 
example call I can send text messages
and<00:01:41.140> they'll<00:01:41.229> pop<00:01:41.409> up<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.890> display<00:01:42.280> itself

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
and they'll pop up on the display itself

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.130 
and they'll pop up on the display itself
here<00:01:43.030> now<00:01:43.119> what's<00:01:43.299> particularly<00:01:43.689> interesting

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
here now what's particularly interesting

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.929 
here now what's particularly interesting
is<00:01:44.229> as<00:01:44.380> far<00:01:44.590> as<00:01:44.619> I'm<00:01:44.890> concerned<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.549> perhaps

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
is as far as I'm concerned and perhaps

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.029 
is as far as I'm concerned and perhaps
I'm<00:01:46.270> wrong<00:01:46.299> but<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.229> far<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.649> can<00:01:47.710> tell<00:01:48.009> I

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
I'm wrong but so far as I can tell I

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.889 
I'm wrong but so far as I can tell I
can't<00:01:48.369> actually<00:01:48.610> go<00:01:49.119> into<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.479> message<00:01:49.780> so

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
can't actually go into a message so

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.209 
can't actually go into a message so
let's<00:01:49.930> say<00:01:50.140> for<00:01:50.289> example<00:01:50.320> somebody<00:01:50.740> sends<00:01:51.130> me

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
let's say for example somebody sends me

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.950 
let's say for example somebody sends me
a<00:01:51.250> text<00:01:51.340> message<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.479> would<00:01:52.630> love<00:01:52.840> to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
a text message and I would love to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.599 
a text message and I would love to
manipulate<00:01:53.469> this<00:01:53.619> let<00:01:53.829> me<00:01:53.920> see<00:01:54.070> what<00:01:54.189> I<00:01:54.219> can<00:01:54.399> do

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
manipulate this let me see what I can do

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.069 
manipulate this let me see what I can do
let's<00:01:55.090> say<00:01:55.210> somebody<00:01:55.570> sends<00:01:55.840> me<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.020> text

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
let's say somebody sends me a text

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.779 
let's say somebody sends me a text
message<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.979> I'm<00:01:57.189> looking<00:01:57.490> at<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:57.759> my

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
message and I'm looking at it on my

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.520 
message and I'm looking at it on my
tablet<00:01:58.329> I<00:01:58.359> don't<00:01:58.539> have<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.659> dedicated<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.320> far

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
tablet I don't have a dedicated so far

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.039 
tablet I don't have a dedicated so far
as<00:01:59.619> I<00:01:59.799> can<00:01:59.859> see<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.399> dedicated<00:02:01.149> message<00:02:01.719> area

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
as I can see a dedicated message area

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.349 
as I can see a dedicated message area
all<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.380> happens<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.009> pops<00:02:03.280> up<00:02:03.549> on<00:02:03.759> the

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
all that happens is it pops up on the

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.270 
all that happens is it pops up on the
display<00:02:04.630> itself<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.619> for<00:02:05.649> example<00:02:06.100> if<00:02:06.159> I'm

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
display itself so for example if I'm

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.359

phone number I'm going to say hey there
so<00:02:25.510> for<00:02:25.630> example<00:02:25.930> you're<00:02:26.050> gonna<00:02:26.140> see<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.380> popup

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
so for example you're gonna see a popup

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.460 
so for example you're gonna see a popup
on<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> g2<00:02:28.210> but<00:02:28.510> then<00:02:28.870> you're<00:02:28.990> also<00:02:29.110> gonna<00:02:29.290> see

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
on the g2 but then you're also gonna see

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
a pop-up on the tablet as well so

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.460 
a pop-up on the tablet as well so

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
to see it in quadrant standard I would

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.309 
to see it in quadrant standard I would
guess<00:03:49.389> you'd<00:03:49.569> see<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:49.930> quadrant<00:03:50.260> standard

guess you'd see it in quadrant standard

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.470 
guess you'd see it in quadrant standard
but<00:03:50.680> overall<00:03:50.919> been<00:03:51.609> very<00:03:51.879> pleased<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.329> day<00:03:52.419> to

like combined with the display it's

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.020 
like combined with the display it's
really<00:03:59.799> an<00:03:59.859> impressive<00:04:00.040> tablet<00:04:00.549> all<00:04:00.669> around<00:04:00.940> I

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
really an impressive tablet all around I

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.129 
really an impressive tablet all around I
like<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.299> design<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.810> knock-on

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
like the design and the knock-on

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.869 
like the design and the knock-on
features<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.709> things<00:04:02.889> like<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:03.489> we'll

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
features and things like that but we'll

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.110 
features and things like that but we'll
say<00:04:04.090> battery<00:04:04.449> life<00:04:04.569> has<00:04:04.690> been<00:04:04.810> great<00:04:05.019> as<00:04:05.260> well

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
say battery life has been great as well

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.759 
say battery life has been great as well
4600<00:04:07.120> milliamp<00:04:07.480> hour<00:04:07.629> non<00:04:07.959> removable<00:04:08.230> battery
