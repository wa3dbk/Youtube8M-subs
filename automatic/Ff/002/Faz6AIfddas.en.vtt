Welcome to this week's webisode of Insider's
Look at Grand Canyon. I'm your host Ranger

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.690
Lori Rome. And my guest today is Ranger Pat
Gamman. Hi, Pat.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.139
Hey, it is great to be on the show and not
be the host.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.910
Hey, so what is this podcast all about?
Well, I wanted to share about dogs at National

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.800
Parks, because in a lot of National Parks
dogs can't go out on trails. So, there is

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.689
something special going on at Grand Canyon
that's what I want to share with everyone.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.810
That's wonderful, so where can you take a
dog?

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.300
Well, here at Grand Canyon, first thing is
let's talk about, let's say you're not

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.530
in the canyon, let's say you're a visitor
here, one thing I think folks would like to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.920
know is that this is one of the national parks
that has a dog kennel. And if you look at

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.539
the park map when you get your park newspaper,
it is right on there. If you can not find it,

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.149
ask at a visitor center. We will tell you
how to get to the kennel. You can make reservations.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.280
So, if you are going to on a hike for a few
days, your dog cannot go on the trails, but

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.780
you have a place to put them.
So, are dogs allowed on any trails at Grand

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.539
Canyon?
They are not allowed in the Inner Canyon.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.580
There is a reason for that. Remember there
is wildlife down there; we don't want dogs

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.650
to harass them. But also, I am sure if you
bring your dog it is because you love your

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.360
dog and would not want to see your dog get
eaten by a mountain lion. If you were at Yellowstone

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.009
you wouldn't want to see it eaten by a bear.
No, no, I love my dog and I am sure you do

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.659
too. So, not in the canyon. Besides that,
the heat is so bad there, it would be really

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.630
rough on a dog to be in there. But on the
rim, now let's first think (about) the North

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.259
Rim has a bunch of backcountry trails and
dogs cannot be there. But here on the South

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.390
Rim, because there is Grand Canyon Village,
because we have a lot of paved trails, we

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.250
have 12 miles of paved trails on the South
Rim where dogs can go.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.509
Oh, that's great.
The thing is, it is an interface, just like,

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.380
there is a little town; Grand Canyon Village,
here. They are on the paved trails, but think

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.399
of it just like if you are at home. You've got
to take care of your dog, you've got to clean

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.500
up after it. Bring those plastic bags and
then when you are here, you're like, what

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.350
am I going to do with that (dog waste). We've
got garbage cans everywhere. Make sure that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.190
you dump that in a nice sealed plastic bag,
any dog droppings, in a garbage can that is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.860
outdoors, never an indoor garbage can.
Ha, ha.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.329
You know, I think that is the best thing to
do. Since I brought up garbage cans, you

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.019
probably noticed this, Lori; is that we have
a lot of dumpsters as well, around the park.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.540
Usually there is a green and white one. The
white one has a big sticker that says; RECYCLE,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.889
don't put the dog droppings there.
OH. Right.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:32.030
Put the dog droppings in the trash (green)
one. So, any outdoor trash can that does not

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.810
say recycle is O.K. for dog droppings. In
addition to that there are a lot of people

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.220
on our trails and there is a lot of other
people that love to bring their dogs as well.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.209
So, let's say you are on the South Rim, you're
on one of the paved trails, make sure for

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.600
your dog's safety have it on a leash and
for the other visitors, other dogs, the friendlier

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.840
your dog the better. If you know your dog
likes male dogs or female dogs better, keep

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.090
that under consideration; keep your dog on
a short leash until it has met the other dog.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.040
This is common take care of your dog stuff.
And I feel it is really great, of all the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.489
parks I have worked at, we (Grand Canyon)
have a park where you can bring your dog.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.470
Oh, it's wonderful. Now, that's great we
can hike on the Rim Trail on the South Rim

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.180
with our dogs, what about the bus though?
Can they come back on the bus?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.199
That's a real important question? If it a
"SERVICE DOG" yes. But if it is not a Service

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.709
Dog, all Service Dogs, actually, are marked...
you know you might think your dog is your

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.160
service dog because it
is your best friend, and you love your dog...

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.699
I would love to say that about mine, but they're
not, they're

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:36.030
not. There are certain people who do need
them and they will be clearly marked. A lot

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.570
of folks who get on the bus may be allergic
to dogs, so... dogs are not allowed on the

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.690
buses here. I think that brings up a good
point; is that we do have this shuttle route

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.030
called the RED route. It is seven miles out
there to Hermit's Rest and seven miles back

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.440
and there is a great trail out there. So,
some people, if you are a hiker without any

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.570
pets at all... a lot of people hike out the
trail and they get on the bus to come back.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.070
Well, you couldn't do that with a dog. So,
make sure that you don't hike the whole seven

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.100
miles with your dog and think you're going
to get a ride back. Make sure you know your

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.229
dog; how old is your dog, how far can your
dog hike, and how hot is it out there? So,

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.440
no dogs on the buses, but you can take them
on that Rim trail towards Hermit's Rest.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.430
What about some of the fun ranger programs,
could my dog go to those?

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.380
Well, if you think your dog is friendly enough.
We've got all of these nice ranger walks

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.630
on the rim; they are great, anything, pretty
much outdoors. So here is the key thing; we

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.030
give these evening programs that are a lot
of fun. When you get here, in the paper you

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.380
will see what time, what topic, all that.
In the winter it is indoors, so dogs not so

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.590
good. In the summer we've got this great
(outdoor) amphitheater. And if you think your

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.910
dog is friendly, likes people, and won't
be barking during the program you could bring

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.140
your dog. Actually a lot of rangers really
love it when you bring your dog, it means;

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.180
hey, this is a fun, friendly dog.
Well, what about any special places we could

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.870
go with our dogs?
Well, since you mentioned it, there is one...

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.710
you would have to inquire about it. This is
not something in the newspaper or anything,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.210
but for folks who really want to bring their
dog here and have something special on the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.210
South Rim there is one place. And it is a
mile out and a mile back, and it is great

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.260
for everybody because the dog gets a great
walk through a beautiful ponderosa pine forest

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.260
and when you get to the end there is an incredibly
special view of the canyon! It is called Shoshone

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.810
Point. But, I must tell you that Shoshone
Point is our special use permit place. This

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.640
is where weddings happen. And the reason that
dogs are allowed on this is.. is that it is

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.000
not a trail. It is a road, an old dirt road.
So, what happens is that you need to come

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.180
to the visitor center. See if that place,
Shoshone Point, is being used that day. Because

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.840
it is by permit, those people have priority;
they do pay to use that area. It might be

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.620
a wedding; it might be a special function.
It is a really great place, picnic tables,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.120
and restroom. But, when you go down there;
of course get your dog on a leash, bring the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.430
poop bags, one of the things I do is that,
when your dog defecates put it in the bag.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.180
Hang it in a tree and you can get that on
the way back. If you do not feel like carrying

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.130
for the whole hike, I understand.
As long as we don't forget, huh?

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.310
Ha, ha... do not forget that! As long as we
are good dog people and we clean up after

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.840
ourselves, make sure that everybody that you
meet has a good interaction with your dog

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.190
then this will continue, at the South Rim,
to be a welcome thing to bring your dog. I

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.530
think it is so rare and so awesome that we
get to do at this park.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.030
Sounds like Grand Canyon is a great spot for
pets and people!

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:38.230
That's right Lori! So, if you are coming
to the Grand Canyon just know that you and

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.730
your pets are welcome.
Thanks Pat. Hey, my pleasure. We'll catch

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.420
you folks next time
