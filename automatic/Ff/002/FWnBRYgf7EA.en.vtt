00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so we started off showing you the the PV

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.519 
so we started off showing you the the PV
panels<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.850> solar<00:00:03.060> panels<00:00:03.449> outside<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.230> of

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
panels the solar panels outside and of

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.320 
panels the solar panels outside and of
course<00:00:04.740> they<00:00:04.890> generate<00:00:05.279> electricity<00:00:05.970> from

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
course they generate electricity from

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.629 
course they generate electricity from
the<00:00:06.420> Sun<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.930> such<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.490> you're<00:00:08.490> going<00:00:08.580> to

there's various different angles and
such<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> need<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.980> put<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> panels<00:00:14.460> at

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
such that you need to put the panels at

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.519 
such that you need to put the panels at
you<00:00:15.389> need<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.630> talk<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:15.990> your<00:00:16.109> installer

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
you need to talk with your installer

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.830 
you need to talk with your installer
about<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.210> one<00:00:18.210> thing<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.660> this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
about that one thing about this

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.929 
about that one thing about this
particular<00:00:19.050> install<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.340> Frank<00:00:20.670> was<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
particular install and Frank was the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
particular install and Frank was the
first<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> tell<00:00:21.480> me<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.900> make<00:00:22.080> mention<00:00:22.289> of

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
first to tell me this to make mention of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.080 
first to tell me this to make mention of
it<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:22.859> he<00:00:23.369> didn't<00:00:23.550> want<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> bunch

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it because he didn't want to see a bunch

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.970 
it because he didn't want to see a bunch
of<00:00:24.269> stupid<00:00:24.449> comments<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.109> YouTube<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.619> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
of stupid comments on YouTube but it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.839 
of stupid comments on YouTube but it
isn't<00:00:26.720> necessarily<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.289> cleanest<00:00:29.160> install

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
isn't necessarily the cleanest install

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.269 
isn't necessarily the cleanest install
you'll<00:00:30.240> notice<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.660> lot<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.470> these<00:00:31.679> wires<00:00:31.980> are

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you'll notice a lot of these wires are

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.000 
you'll notice a lot of these wires are
loose<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.790> they're<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.210> loose<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.930> loose<00:00:34.800> is

you feel the need to put a stupid
nitpicking<00:00:58.590> comment<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.059> just

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
nitpicking comment out there you just

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900 
nitpicking comment out there you just
shows<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:01.140> immaturity<00:01:01.559> anywho<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
shows your your immaturity anywho the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.960 
shows your your immaturity anywho the
power<00:01:03.359> comes<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> solar<00:01:04.650> panels<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
power comes in from the solar panels to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
power comes in from the solar panels to
two<00:01:06.119> devices<00:01:06.450> well<00:01:06.840> first<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.320> goes<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
two devices well first off it goes to a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.740 
two devices well first off it goes to a
a<00:01:07.920> safety<00:01:08.670> disconnect<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.299> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> hard<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
a safety disconnect it's kind of hard to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.950 
a safety disconnect it's kind of hard to
see<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.070> dark<00:01:11.340> room<00:01:11.960> but

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
see this in this in this dark room but

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480 
see this in this in this dark room but
when<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.229> goes<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.010> things<00:01:14.220> these

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
when it goes to these two things these

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
when it goes to these two things these
are<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.820> their<00:01:15.450> chart<00:01:15.720> they're<00:01:15.990> called

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
are two their chart they're called

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
are two their chart they're called
charge<00:01:16.530> controllers<00:01:17.009> now<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
charge controllers now this is going to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
charge controllers now this is going to
basically<00:01:17.939> regulate<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.470> amount<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> power

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
basically regulate the amount of power

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.280 
basically regulate the amount of power
that<00:01:20.580> goes<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> panels<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
that goes in from the panels to the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
that goes in from the panels to the
battery<00:01:22.619> bank<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.759> I'll<00:01:23.880> zoom<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.270> so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
battery bank and I'll zoom in here so

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
battery bank and I'll zoom in here so
you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> features<00:01:25.439> right

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you can see some of the features right

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
you can see some of the features right
now<00:01:26.520> got<00:01:26.939> some<00:01:27.150> excellent<00:01:27.509> power<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.049> these

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
now got some excellent power in these

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.190 
now got some excellent power in these
batteries<00:01:28.909> 26.2<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.840> battery<00:01:31.170> voltage

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
batteries 26.2 is the battery voltage

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.170 
batteries 26.2 is the battery voltage
there<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> side<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
there on the side that you can see and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.170 
there on the side that you can see and
the<00:01:34.079> other<00:01:34.470> charge<00:01:35.220> controller<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.820> reading

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the other charge controller is reading

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.789 
the other charge controller is reading
very<00:01:36.360> similar<00:01:36.780> 20<00:01:37.590> yet<00:01:37.680> also<00:01:38.030> 26.2<00:01:39.619> what<00:01:40.619> these

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
very similar 20 yet also 26.2 what these

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.730 
very similar 20 yet also 26.2 what these
and<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> 24<00:01:41.549> volt<00:01:41.909> system<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.990> they're

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and this is a 24 volt system so they're

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
and this is a 24 volt system so they're
at<00:01:43.979> their<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.759> i've<00:01:45.149> seen<00:01:45.420> these<00:01:45.570> go<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.810> little

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
at their at i've seen these go a little

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.660 
at their at i've seen these go a little
higher<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> say<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.340> from

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
higher what would you say about from

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.410 
higher what would you say about from
something<00:01:48.140> 2728<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.299> know

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
something 2728 that you can get you know

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.100 
something 2728 that you can get you know
in<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.350> max<00:01:52.560> power<00:01:53.149> type<00:01:54.149> situation<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.930> such

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
in a max power type situation as such

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.749 
in a max power type situation as such
and<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> other<00:01:55.649> thing<00:01:55.710> too<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.399> indicator

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and the other thing too is the indicator

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
and the other thing too is the indicator
light<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.360> blinking<00:01:57.899> green<00:01:57.930> when<00:01:58.860> they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
light there is blinking green when they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.580 
light there is blinking green when they
are<00:01:59.189> fully<00:01:59.520> fully<00:01:59.729> charged<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.350> just

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
are fully fully charged it it will just

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 
are fully fully charged it it will just
just<00:02:01.950> sit<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> solid<00:02:02.850> green<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.509> such<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
just sit at a solid green and such but

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.560 
just sit at a solid green and such but
the<00:02:04.469> power<00:02:04.649> comes<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.430> them<00:02:05.610> from<00:02:06.420> the

took a solar panel right to a battery

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.320 
took a solar panel right to a battery
you'll<00:02:17.770> eventually<00:02:18.040> destroy<00:02:18.820> battery

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
you'll eventually destroy battery

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.730 
you'll eventually destroy battery
because<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:19.840> going<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.230> keep<00:02:20.410> going

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
because it's just going to keep going

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.070 
because it's just going to keep going
keep<00:02:21.370> putting<00:02:22.000> power<00:02:22.210> in<00:02:22.480> over<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.840> over<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
keep putting power in over and over and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.140 
keep putting power in over and over and
over<00:02:23.170> okay<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.220> eventually<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:24.970> going<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
over okay and eventually it's going to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.810 
over okay and eventually it's going to
hurt<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.390> battery<00:02:25.750> from<00:02:25.960> from<00:02:26.380> doing<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.890> so

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
hurt the battery from from doing so so

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.580 
hurt the battery from from doing so so
once<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.270> once<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:28.840> got<00:02:28.990> in<00:02:29.110> here<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
once it's once it's got in here the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.800 
once it's once it's got in here the
other<00:02:29.710> thing<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> does<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.340> well<00:02:30.700> too<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.210> this

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
other thing it does is well too is this

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.630 
other thing it does is well too is this
is<00:02:32.020> going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.470> it's<00:02:33.130> going<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.460> two<00:02:33.610> things

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
is going to it's going to do two things

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.270 
is going to it's going to do two things
it's<00:02:34.060> also<00:02:34.210> going<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.570> allow<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.560> equalize

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
it's also going to allow you to equalize

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.490 
it's also going to allow you to equalize
the<00:02:36.640> batteries<00:02:37.240> approximately<00:02:37.960> once<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.320> month

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the batteries approximately once a month

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.600 
the batteries approximately once a month
and<00:02:39.160> you'll<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.550> here<00:02:41.220> really<00:02:42.220> hard<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.520> get

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
and you'll see here really hard to get

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.790 
and you'll see here really hard to get
in<00:02:42.760> close<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.240> these<00:02:43.450> things<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.440> give

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
in close on these things and and give

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.040 
in close on these things and and give
you<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.010> descriptions<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.670> such<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.420> what

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
you the descriptions and such but what

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.320 
you the descriptions and such but what
it's<00:02:47.170> also<00:02:47.350> going<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.650> do<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:48.040> when<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.820> eq<00:02:49.210> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
it's also going to do is when you eq the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.780 
it's also going to do is when you eq the
batteries<00:02:50.100> basically<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> batteries<00:02:51.610> are

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
batteries basically the batteries are

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.970 
batteries basically the batteries are
going<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.090> get<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.480> fair<00:02:52.930> amount<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.380> sulfate<00:02:53.830> on

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
going to get a fair amount of sulfate on

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.040 
going to get a fair amount of sulfate on
the<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.400> plates<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.180> what's<00:02:55.870> going<00:02:55.990> to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
the on the plates and what's going to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.050 
the on the plates and what's going to
happen<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.590> proximately<00:02:57.130> once<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.490> month<00:02:57.670> or<00:02:57.880> so

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
happen is proximately once a month or so

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.400 
happen is proximately once a month or so
and<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.510> can<00:02:58.660> do<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.960> if<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.380> a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
and you can do this if you have a

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.740 
and you can do this if you have a
generator<00:02:59.890> set<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.820> easiest<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.600> with

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
generator set it's easiest to do it with

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.510 
generator set it's easiest to do it with
the<00:03:01.840> generator<00:03:02.260> set<00:03:02.560> but<00:03:02.800> it's<00:03:02.980> also<00:03:03.220> good

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
the generator set but it's also good

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.890 
the generator set but it's also good
from<00:03:03.670> time<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.970> time<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.240> do<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.720> your

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
from time to time to do it with your

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.840 
from time to time to do it with your
with<00:03:05.230> your<00:03:05.260> solar<00:03:05.620> panels<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.730> would

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
with your solar panels and I would

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.730 
with your solar panels and I would
recommend<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.360> do<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.720> about<00:03:08.350> once<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.710> month

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
recommend you do that about once a month

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.370 
recommend you do that about once a month
or<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.460> eq<00:03:09.850> your<00:03:10.030> batteries<00:03:10.450> what<00:03:11.200> that's

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
or so is eq your batteries what that's

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.840 
or so is eq your batteries what that's
going<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> do<00:03:11.770> is<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.010> puts<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.400> basically

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
going to do is it puts in basically

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.060 
going to do is it puts in basically
basically<00:03:13.480> an<00:03:13.780> overcharge<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.740> keep<00:03:14.920> it

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
basically an overcharge to keep it

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.050 
basically an overcharge to keep it
simple<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.460> we're<00:03:15.610> not<00:03:15.670> going<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.910> use<00:03:16.030> a

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
simple and we're not going to use a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.729 
simple and we're not going to use a

that don't know about the sort of thing

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.460 
that don't know about the sort of thing
can<00:03:23.800> understand<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.580> no<00:03:25.180> need<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:26.200> slay<00:03:26.440> us

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
can understand so no need to to slay us

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.960 
can understand so no need to to slay us
for<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.860> fact<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.160> we're<00:03:27.340> not<00:03:27.459> using<00:03:27.700> the

like that okay okay anywho getting back
to<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.840> what's<00:03:35.020> going<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.230> do<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:35.530> going

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
to it what's going to do is it's going

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.190 
to it what's going to do is it's going
to<00:03:35.830> put<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.510> essentially<00:03:37.510> an<00:03:37.600> overcharge

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
to put in a essentially an overcharge

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.290 
to put in a essentially an overcharge
and<00:03:38.470> what<00:03:39.160> that's<00:03:39.310> going<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.489> do<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
and what that's going to do is the

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.060 
and what that's going to do is the
excess<00:03:40.660> power<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.230> such<00:03:41.410> is<00:03:41.590> going<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.830> create

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
excess power and such is going to create

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.710 
excess power and such is going to create
a<00:03:42.160> condition<00:03:42.610> in<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.730> batteries<00:03:43.180> where<00:03:43.360> it

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
a condition in the batteries where it

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.740 
a condition in the batteries where it
more<00:03:44.050> or<00:03:44.110> less<00:03:44.230> self<00:03:44.590> cleans<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.100> place<00:03:45.750> to

a<00:04:50.330> valve<00:04:50.690> all<00:04:51.380> right<00:04:51.590> they're<00:04:51.889> regulating<00:04:52.520> the

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
a valve all right they're regulating the

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.050 
a valve all right they're regulating the

you<00:04:56.270> can<00:04:56.450> look<00:04:56.600> at<00:04:56.810> is<00:04:56.990> more<00:04:57.200> or<00:04:57.290> less<00:04:57.350> like<00:04:57.620> a

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
you can look at is more or less like a

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.640 
you can look at is more or less like a

metal prices going up and such but what

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.650 
metal prices going up and such but what
they're<00:05:31.220> using<00:05:31.400> is<00:05:31.640> they're<00:05:31.790> using<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.090> 24<00:05:32.630> volt

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
they're using is they're using a 24 volt

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.290 
they're using is they're using a 24 volt
system<00:05:33.290> okay<00:05:34.190> each<00:05:34.460> one<00:05:34.700> of<00:05:34.729> these<00:05:34.880> batteries

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
system okay each one of these batteries

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.260 
system okay each one of these batteries
is<00:05:35.570> six<00:05:35.840> volt<00:05:36.080> okay<00:05:37.040> so<00:05:37.669> they're<00:05:37.850> wired<00:05:38.060> and

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
is six volt okay so they're wired and

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.750 
is six volt okay so they're wired and
parallel<00:05:38.690> to<00:05:38.840> make<00:05:38.990> up<00:05:39.169> to<00:05:39.260> 24<00:05:39.800> so<00:05:40.400> you'll<00:05:40.580> see

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
parallel to make up to 24 so you'll see

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.029 
parallel to make up to 24 so you'll see
six<00:05:41.060> times<00:05:41.300> for<00:05:41.570> it<00:05:41.720> goes<00:05:41.870> 24<00:05:42.410> volts<00:05:42.710> this<00:05:42.860> is

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
six times for it goes 24 volts this is

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.010 
six times for it goes 24 volts this is
this<00:05:43.550> is<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:43.850> voltage<00:05:44.030> of<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.479> system<00:05:44.870> and

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
this is the voltage of the system and

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.670 
this is the voltage of the system and
then<00:05:45.919> they're<00:05:46.070> wired<00:05:46.280> in<00:05:46.460> series<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:47.720> bump<00:05:48.470> up

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
then they're wired in series to bump up

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.880 
then they're wired in series to bump up
the<00:05:49.100> the<00:05:49.729> total<00:05:50.120> amperage<00:05:50.600> and<00:05:50.810> such<00:05:50.960> of<00:05:51.140> the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
the the total amperage and such of the

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.140 
the the total amperage and such of the
of<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:53.260> total<00:05:54.260> power<00:05:54.410> essentially<00:05:54.950> of<00:05:55.220> the<00:05:55.460> of

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
of the total power essentially of the of

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.480 
of the total power essentially of the of
the<00:05:56.300> battery<00:05:56.630> bank<00:05:56.870> alright<00:05:57.740> so<00:05:57.979> after<00:05:58.250> it

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
the battery bank alright so after it

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.670 
the battery bank alright so after it
leaves<00:05:58.700> so<00:05:59.180> again<00:05:59.390> we're<00:06:00.200> starting<00:06:00.530> at<00:06:00.650> the

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
leaves so again we're starting at the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.310 
leaves so again we're starting at the
solar<00:06:01.010> panels<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:02.240> power<00:06:02.510> comes<00:06:02.840> in<00:06:03.080> there

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
solar panels the power comes in there

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.230 
solar panels the power comes in there
comes<00:06:03.770> down<00:06:04.039> through<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.490> switch<00:06:04.760> through

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
comes down through the switch through

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.180 
comes down through the switch through
the<00:06:05.390> safety<00:06:05.750> switch<00:06:06.020> goes<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:06.950> charge

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
the safety switch goes to the charge

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.980 
the safety switch goes to the charge
controllers<00:06:07.700> which<00:06:07.850> regulate<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.450> power<00:06:08.630> and

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
controllers which regulate the power and

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.960 
controllers which regulate the power and
then<00:06:09.410> in<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.710> batteries<00:06:10.130> now<00:06:10.310> all<00:06:10.550> throughout

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
then in the batteries now all throughout

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.920 
then in the batteries now all throughout
this<00:06:11.240> process<00:06:11.510> this<00:06:12.380> is<00:06:12.590> 24<00:06:13.250> volts<00:06:13.760> DC<00:06:14.210> direct

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
this process this is 24 volts DC direct

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.920 
this process this is 24 volts DC direct
current<00:06:15.320> okay<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:16.340> solar<00:06:16.760> panels<00:06:17.180> put<00:06:17.390> out<00:06:17.510> 12

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
current okay the solar panels put out 12

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.400 
current okay the solar panels put out 12
volts<00:06:18.350> DC<00:06:19.070> each<00:06:19.580> and<00:06:19.940> they're<00:06:20.240> wired<00:06:20.510> in<00:06:20.750> twos

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
volts DC each and they're wired in twos

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.460 
volts DC each and they're wired in twos
okay<00:06:21.979> in<00:06:22.190> pairs<00:06:23.000> and<00:06:23.360> so<00:06:23.960> each<00:06:24.110> pair

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
okay in pairs and so each pair

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.890 
okay in pairs and so each pair
essentially<00:06:25.039> is<00:06:25.160> putting<00:06:25.490> out<00:06:25.610> 24<00:06:26.240> volts<00:06:26.810> and

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
essentially is putting out 24 volts and

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.060 
essentially is putting out 24 volts and
again<00:06:27.080> we're<00:06:27.229> trying<00:06:27.440> to<00:06:27.500> keep<00:06:27.650> this<00:06:27.800> very

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
again we're trying to keep this very

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.190 
again we're trying to keep this very

terms and such like that we're trying to

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.029 
terms and such like that we're trying to
keep<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.479> on<00:06:32.570> the<00:06:32.720> the<00:06:33.229> real<00:06:33.440> simple<00:06:33.860> type

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
keep it on the the real simple type

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.130 
keep it on the the real simple type
thing<00:06:34.280> here<00:06:34.460> okay<00:06:35.030> so<00:06:35.090> to<00:06:35.630> this<00:06:35.840> point
