been a pretty good marker you know if

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.880 
been a pretty good marker you know if
sometimes<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.839> don't<00:00:16.020> shake<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.710> lot

it<00:00:17.070> turns<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.390> paint<00:00:18.600> kind<00:00:18.750> of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it turns that the paint kind of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.980 
it turns that the paint kind of
separates<00:00:19.410> from<00:00:19.650> itself<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.580> gotta<00:00:20.990> kick

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
separates from itself so you gotta kick

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.070 
separates from itself so you gotta kick
it<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> little<00:00:22.410> bit<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.039> started

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080
