choose a different character or object
from<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.050> library<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.539> the

from the library so as you can see the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.319 
from the library so as you can see the
object<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.379> changed<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.730> also<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
object just changed and it also got the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.360 
object just changed and it also got the
exact<00:00:51.600> enter<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.230> exit<00:00:52.590> effects<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
exact enter and exit effects that the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.420 
exact enter and exit effects that the
previous<00:00:53.760> object<00:00:54.149> had<00:00:55.039> more<00:00:56.039> or<00:00:56.070> less<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
previous object had more or less the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
previous object had more or less the
same<00:00:56.579> size<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.020> same<00:00:58.260> duration<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
same size and the same duration so this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.619 
same size and the same duration so this
is<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.260> useful<00:01:01.699> especially<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:03.239> you're

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
is very useful especially when you're

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.020 
is very useful especially when you're
working<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> templates<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.820> want

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
working with the templates and you want

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.789 
working with the templates and you want
to<00:01:06.150> replace<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.020> objects<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
to replace the objects now if you go to

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.000 
to replace the objects now if you go to
the<00:01:10.799> middle<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:12.390> timeline<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.799> can

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the middle of the timeline now you can

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
the middle of the timeline now you can
see<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.670> another<00:01:15.180> button<00:01:15.509> which

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
see that you have another button which

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.350 
see that you have another button which
is<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.350> split<00:01:16.650> button<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.340> what<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
is the split button and what this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
is the split button and what this
function<00:01:18.600> does<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:20.040> enables<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.750> split

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
function does is it enables you to split

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.980 
function does is it enables you to split
this<00:01:22.439> object<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.369> different<00:01:23.580> objects<00:01:24.270> one

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
this object to two different objects one

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.899 
this object to two different objects one
will<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.439> until<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.070> second<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> other

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
will be until this second and the other

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.630 
will be until this second and the other
one<00:01:27.119> will<00:01:27.299> start<00:01:27.540> from<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.460> just

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
one will start from here now I will just

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.260 
one will start from here now I will just
demonstrate<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.740> guy<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.340> click<00:01:33.119> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
demonstrate here on this guy I click it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
demonstrate here on this guy I click it
and<00:01:33.420> let's<00:01:33.720> say<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> 2nd<00:01:34.530> 8th<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.250> him

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and let's say that on 2nd 8th I want him

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.390 
and let's say that on 2nd 8th I want him
to<00:01:35.490> change<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> different<00:01:36.479> pose<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.920> take

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
to change to a different pose so I take

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300 
to change to a different pose so I take
the<00:01:38.579> playhead<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> choose<00:01:40.770> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the playhead here and now I choose this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.899 
the playhead here and now I choose this
split<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:43.049> choose<00:01:43.610> his<00:01:44.610> sad<00:01:45.210> host<00:01:45.720> instead

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
split and I choose his sad host instead

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
split and I choose his sad host instead
now<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.439> objects<00:01:49.890> split<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
now as you can see the objects split to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.910 
now as you can see the objects split to
two<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> non<00:01:52.229> effect<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
two and here I get the non effect and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.060 
two and here I get the non effect and
the<00:01:53.759> previous<00:01:54.210> object<00:01:54.659> actually<00:01:55.020> ends<00:01:55.740> now

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the previous object actually ends now

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.429 
the previous object actually ends now
with<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.610> non<00:01:56.969> effect<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.259> will

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
with the non effect so this will

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
with the non effect so this will
actually<00:01:58.649> look<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.579> character<00:01:59.969> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
actually look like the character is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.709 
actually look like the character is
changing<00:02:00.780> between<00:02:01.710> two<00:02:01.860> poses<00:02:02.329> of<00:02:03.329> course<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
changing between two poses of course you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.350 
changing between two poses of course you
can<00:02:03.899> adjust<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.680> position<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.490> bit<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:06.180> fit

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
can adjust the position a bit to fit

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.319 
can adjust the position a bit to fit
better<00:02:06.600> let's<00:02:07.530> play<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.550> without<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.330> sound

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.349 

and<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.159> changed<00:02:17.579> pretty<00:02:18.120> well

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
and you see that it changed pretty well

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.709 
and you see that it changed pretty well
so<00:02:19.349> basically<00:02:20.069> that's<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.730> these<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.450> new

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
so basically that's it these are the new

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.209 
so basically that's it these are the new
two<00:02:22.560> functions<00:02:24.230> hope<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.439> like<00:02:25.620> them<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:26.010> let

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
two functions hope you like them and let

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.470 
two functions hope you like them and let
us<00:02:26.340> know<00:02:26.489> what<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.760> think<00:02:26.909> about<00:02:27.030> them

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.170 
us know what you think about them
