Sowell<00:00:18.359> garmin-sharp<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:18.990> really<00:00:19.170> trying<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
Sowell garmin-sharp are really trying to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.080 
Sowell garmin-sharp are really trying to
optimize<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> technology<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.060> use

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
optimize all the technology that we use

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.000 
optimize all the technology that we use
in<00:00:21.390> any<00:00:21.510> given<00:00:21.810> stage<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.410> cervelas

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
in any given stage and that cervelas

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
in any given stage and that cervelas
done<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:23.550> nice<00:00:23.730> job<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> s5<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
done a really nice job with the s5 and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.179 
done a really nice job with the s5 and
making<00:00:25.500> sure<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> most

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
making sure that it's the most

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.269 
making sure that it's the most
aerodynamic<00:00:26.490> road<00:00:27.150> bike<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.810> use

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
aerodynamic road bike that we can use

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.500 
aerodynamic road bike that we can use
the<00:00:29.279> bicycle<00:00:29.429> I'm<00:00:29.789> working<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.240> now

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the bicycle I'm working on right now

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.840 
the bicycle I'm working on right now
would<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.160> hundredth<00:00:32.160> Edition<00:00:32.550> Tour<00:00:32.730> de

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
would be the hundredth Edition Tour de

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.120 
would be the hundredth Edition Tour de
France<00:00:33.059> S<00:00:33.300> 5<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:33.989> Cervelo<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
France S 5 from Cervelo it's really a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.869 
France S 5 from Cervelo it's really a
nice<00:00:35.309> bike<00:00:35.960> super<00:00:36.960> aerodynamic<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
nice bike super aerodynamic so this

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.479 
nice bike super aerodynamic so this
frame<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:39.989> different

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
frame as you can see has different

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.530 
frame as you can see has different
aerodynamic<00:00:41.489> shapes<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.239> make<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
aerodynamic shapes to it that make it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.959 
aerodynamic shapes to it that make it
different<00:00:43.140> than<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.860> our<00:00:44.010> series<00:00:44.430> bike<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
different than the our series bike and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.959 
different than the our series bike and
make<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> better<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.039> flat<00:00:47.039> stages<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.730> when

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
make it better for flat stages and when

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
make it better for flat stages and when
the<00:00:48.090> riders<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.600> riding<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> front<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the riders are riding on the front and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
the riders are riding on the front and
going<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.520> fast<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.270> think<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> most

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
going really fast I think the most

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
going really fast I think the most
special<00:00:52.680> points<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.579> bike<00:00:53.820> obviously

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
special points of this bike obviously

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.990 
special points of this bike obviously
would<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.860> aerodynamic<00:00:56.460> advantage<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
would be the the aerodynamic advantage I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299 
would be the the aerodynamic advantage I
mean<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:58.199> Sorella<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:59.010> after

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
mean that's what Sorella was going after

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
mean that's what Sorella was going after
when<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.579> designed<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.059> bike<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> try<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
when they designed this bike to try and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.130 
when they designed this bike to try and
make<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> advantageous<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:03.690> terms<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
make it advantageous in terms of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.640 
make it advantageous in terms of
aerodynamics<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:06.570> certain<00:01:07.409> wheels

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
aerodynamics where with certain wheels

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
aerodynamics where with certain wheels
and<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> bike<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> little

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and this bike we really can do a little

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.450 
and this bike we really can do a little
better<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> bike<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.340> know

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
better just because of the bike you know

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.080 
better just because of the bike you know
I'm<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> s5<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.740> use<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.340> throughout<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I'm on the s5 I use that throughout the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.859 
I'm on the s5 I use that throughout the
whole<00:01:15.210> race<00:01:16.670> usually<00:01:17.670> fanatic<00:01:18.090> 60<00:01:18.479> wheels<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
whole race usually fanatic 60 wheels the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.620 
whole race usually fanatic 60 wheels the
new<00:01:18.990> wheels<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:20.100> yes<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.420> cool

new wheels it's yes and it's pretty cool

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.859 
new wheels it's yes and it's pretty cool
right

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

it's<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> bikes<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:24.000> are

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it's one of the bikes that actually are

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.960 
it's one of the bikes that actually are
the<00:01:24.420> pros<00:01:24.630> come<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.110> commentator<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the pros come up and commentator so the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
the pros come up and commentator so the
lug<00:01:27.180> bastardos<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> mean<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.710> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
lug bastardos I mean it's one of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.070 
lug bastardos I mean it's one of
aerodynamically<00:01:29.670> its

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
aerodynamically its

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.600 
aerodynamically its
when<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.170> was<00:01:32.290> released<00:01:32.770> as<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.010> fastest<00:01:33.430> bike

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
when it was released as the fastest bike

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.400 
when it was released as the fastest bike
in<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.820> world<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.300> mean<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.780> says<00:01:35.020> pretty

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
in the world I mean it says pretty

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.200 
in the world I mean it says pretty
incredible<00:01:35.890> bike<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:36.760> know<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:36.910> said<00:01:37.000> good

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
incredible bike and you know I said good

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
it I mean the stage I won the Tour de

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.050 
it I mean the stage I won the Tour de
France<00:01:40.660> last<00:01:41.080> year<00:01:41.290> as<00:01:41.380> I'm<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:41.560> s5<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.190> we<00:01:42.280> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
France last year as I'm in s5 and we the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.490 
France last year as I'm in s5 and we the
first<00:01:43.330> half<00:01:43.540> was<00:01:43.690> in<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.840> mountains<00:01:44.260> over

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
first half was in the mountains over

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.350 
first half was in the mountains over
category<00:01:44.950> 1<00:01:45.130> mountains<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.940> then<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.210> was

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
category 1 mountains and then it was

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.050 
category 1 mountains and then it was
flat<00:01:47.350> for<00:01:47.500> 100k<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.400> know<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:48.970> was

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
flat for 100k so you know and I was

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.300 
flat for 100k so you know and I was
first<00:01:49.780> over<00:01:50.260> basically<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.800> mountains<00:01:51.190> on

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
first over basically the mountains on

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.950 
first over basically the mountains on
the<00:01:51.340> Ness<00:01:51.550> 5<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.150> goes<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.510> show<00:01:52.660> it<00:01:52.780> could<00:01:52.870> be

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
the Ness 5 so goes to show it could be

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.630 
the Ness 5 so goes to show it could be
anything<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:53.770> always<00:01:54.190> need<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.370> make<00:01:54.610> sure

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
anything we always need to make sure

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.340 
anything we always need to make sure
that<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.000> athletes<00:01:55.420> feel<00:01:55.660> like<00:01:55.900> they<00:01:56.110> have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
that the athletes feel like they have

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.920 
that the athletes feel like they have
the<00:01:57.190> highest<00:01:57.460> level<00:01:57.820> equipment<00:01:58.270> in<00:01:58.390> the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
the highest level equipment in the

with the equipment never a disadvantage
personally<00:02:31.930> for<00:02:32.140> me<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.410> differences

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
personally for me the differences

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.530 
personally for me the differences
between<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.340> Cervelo<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> other<00:02:34.240> bikes

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
between the Cervelo and the other bikes

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.540 
between the Cervelo and the other bikes
are<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.680> different<00:02:36.010> technologies<00:02:36.520> that

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
are the the different technologies that

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.030 
are the the different technologies that
they<00:02:36.850> really<00:02:37.090> put<00:02:37.270> into<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.570> bike

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
they really put into the bike

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.229 
they really put into the bike
comparatively<00:02:39.040> speaking<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.550> other<00:02:39.700> brands<00:02:40.030> I

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
comparatively speaking to other brands I

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.300 
comparatively speaking to other brands I
think<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.600> they<00:02:40.800> really<00:02:41.800> go<00:02:41.920> above<00:02:42.130> and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
think that they really go above and

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.300 
think that they really go above and
beyond<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:43.270> far<00:02:43.480> as<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.660> technical<00:02:44.380> aspect<00:02:44.950> to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
beyond as far as the technical aspect to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.979 
beyond as far as the technical aspect to
really<00:02:45.580> maximize<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.120> design<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.750> bike

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
really maximize the design of the bike

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.199 
really maximize the design of the bike
that<00:02:47.410> being<00:02:47.620> said<00:02:47.890> also<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.700> quality<00:02:49.120> of

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
that being said also to the quality of

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.510 
that being said also to the quality of
the<00:02:49.300> bike<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.660> amazing<00:02:50.170> we<00:02:50.830> really<00:02:51.100> never<00:02:51.310> have

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
the bike is amazing we really never have

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.890 
the bike is amazing we really never have
any<00:02:51.700> problems<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
any problems if I was to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.690 
any problems if I was to
look<00:02:54.470> up<00:02:54.620> into<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.920> sky<00:02:55.129> and<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.459> pick

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
look up into the sky and just pick

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.130 
look up into the sky and just pick
whatever<00:02:55.879> bike<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.390> wanted<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.810> would<00:02:56.930> still

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
think of Civello honestly so from either

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.400 
think of Civello honestly so from either
great<00:02:59.780> bikes<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.260> know<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.709> best<00:03:01.129> bikes
