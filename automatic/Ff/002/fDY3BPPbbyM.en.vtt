and<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:37.500> jump<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.890> top<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.310> after<00:02:38.610> that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and just jump on top of that after that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.820 
and just jump on top of that after that
and<00:02:38.970> come<00:02:39.840> back<00:02:39.990> on<00:02:40.050> yourselves<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:40.560> bit

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
and come back on yourselves a little bit

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.560 
and come back on yourselves a little bit
and<00:02:40.980> you'll<00:02:41.430> bump<00:02:41.610> into<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.940> big<00:02:42.150> structure

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
and you'll bump into this big structure

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.480 
and you'll bump into this big structure
here<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.050> next<00:02:43.290> level<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.860> there<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.460> a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
here on the next level up and there is a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.620 
here on the next level up and there is a
small<00:02:44.790> dial<00:02:45.060> Jeff<00:02:45.300> SAT<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.840> here<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:46.260> well

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
small dial Jeff SAT right here as well

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.960 
small dial Jeff SAT right here as well
so<00:02:48.630> that's<00:02:48.750> two<00:02:49.050> pretty<00:02:49.530> close<00:02:49.770> together<00:02:50.010> now

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
so that's two pretty close together now

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.780 
so that's two pretty close together now
after<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.600> we're<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:51.990> going<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.230> turn<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
after that we're just going to turn and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.980 
after that we're just going to turn and
progress<00:02:53.790> into<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.180> area<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.540> bit<00:02:54.630> further

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
progress into this area a bit further

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.050 
progress into this area a bit further
and<00:02:55.410> we're<00:02:56.190> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.340> go<00:02:56.490> right<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.910> other

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
and we're going to go right to the other

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.730 
and we're going to go right to the other
side<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:57.570> left-hand<00:02:58.020> side<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.260> running

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
side of this left-hand side is running

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.820 
side of this left-hand side is running
down<00:02:58.890> now<00:02:59.210> because<00:03:00.210> our<00:03:00.360> next<00:03:00.690> area<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
down now because our next area is a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.670 
down now because our next area is a
little<00:03:02.280> toilet<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.240> pick<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.540> as<00:03:03.720> well<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.470> it's

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
little toilet to pick up as well so it's

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.500

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
quite a long remain a load of enemies

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.850 
quite a long remain a load of enemies
and<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.960> make<00:03:07.140> sure<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.350> fight<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.590> all
