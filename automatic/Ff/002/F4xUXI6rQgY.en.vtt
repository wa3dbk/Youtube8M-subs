the<00:00:14.770> kick<00:00:15.010> phase<00:00:15.219> when<00:00:15.639> you<00:00:15.730> push<00:00:15.910> off<00:00:16.090> the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
the kick phase when you push off the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.359 
the kick phase when you push off the
snow<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.510> propel<00:00:16.930> yourself<00:00:17.020> forward<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
snow and propel yourself forward the

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.550 
snow and propel yourself forward the
glide<00:00:18.640> phase<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.269> the<00:00:19.869> transition<00:00:20.410> where

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
glide phase and the transition where

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.489 
glide phase and the transition where
your<00:00:20.710> legs<00:00:20.890> trains<00:00:21.279> from<00:00:21.460> gliding<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.179> kicking

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
your legs trains from gliding to kicking

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.960 
your legs trains from gliding to kicking
I'm<00:00:23.499> going<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.070> explain<00:00:24.279> the<00:00:24.429> glide<00:00:24.640> phase

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
I'm going to explain the glide phase

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.140 
I'm going to explain the glide phase
first<00:00:25.329> and<00:00:25.599> then<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.169> push<00:00:26.349> phase<00:00:26.619> after<00:00:27.519> that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
first and then the push phase after that

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.609 
first and then the push phase after that
I'll<00:00:28.359> explain<00:00:28.570> how<00:00:28.900> you<00:00:28.960> can<00:00:29.140> tie<00:00:29.349> them

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
I'll explain how you can tie them

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.490 
I'll explain how you can tie them
together<00:00:29.800> with<00:00:30.070> a<00:00:30.189> smooth<00:00:30.550> transition

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
together with a smooth transition

out to get your body weight over the ski

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.950 
out to get your body weight over the ski
and<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.509> speed

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and you want to speed

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
and you want to speed
pay<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.259> lot<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.440> attention<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.950> keeping<00:01:11.369> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pay a lot of attention to keeping your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
pay a lot of attention to keeping your
knee<00:01:12.060> pushed<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.509> as<00:01:12.630> well<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.800> common

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
knee pushed out as well a very common

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
knee pushed out as well a very common
mistake<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.550> lot<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.789> people<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> have

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
mistake a lot of people make is to have

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
mistake a lot of people make is to have
their<00:01:15.990> knee<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.159> ski<00:01:17.550> very<00:01:17.729> not

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
their knee in like this and ski very not

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.200 
their knee in like this and ski very not
ain't<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.080> inside<00:01:19.409> edge<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:21.000> makes

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
ain't on the inside edge and that makes

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
ain't on the inside edge and that makes
them<00:01:21.420> never<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.869> their<00:01:22.110> weight<00:01:22.289> over<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> ski

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
them never get their weight over the ski

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.760 
them never get their weight over the ski
and<00:01:23.700> it'll<00:01:24.149> makes<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.630> never<00:01:24.899> glide

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and it'll makes them never glide

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
and it'll makes them never glide
effectively<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.179> you're<00:01:27.300> pushing<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
effectively so if you're pushing the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.480 
effectively so if you're pushing the
knee<00:01:28.289> out<00:01:28.319> you're<00:01:28.860> gonna<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.159> way<00:01:29.280> better

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
knee out you're gonna get way better

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
knee out you're gonna get way better
glide<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.720> other<00:01:30.869> thing<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.289> about<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
glide the other thing to think about is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.520 
glide the other thing to think about is
flexing<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.640> ankles<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.229> landing<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
flexing the ankles and landing on the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.300 
flexing the ankles and landing on the
outside<00:01:35.009> edge<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.090> ski<00:01:36.440> if<00:01:37.440> you<00:01:38.009> land<00:01:38.190> on

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
outside edge of this ski if you land on

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.789 
outside edge of this ski if you land on
the<00:01:38.399> outside<00:01:38.729> edge<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> ski<00:01:39.799> very

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the outside edge of the ski very

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.789 
the outside edge of the ski very
slightly<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.549> will<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.780> glide<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.409> lot

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
slightly it will make your glide a lot

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.669 
slightly it will make your glide a lot
easier<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.670> balance<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.119> better<00:01:45.679> the

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
easier and your balance a lot better the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.469 
easier and your balance a lot better the
thing<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.009> want<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> notice<00:01:47.580> from<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.209> side

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
thing I want you to notice from the side

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.930 
thing I want you to notice from the side
view<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.929> that<00:01:49.410> my<00:01:49.709> whole<00:01:49.920> body<00:01:50.160> is<00:01:50.399> leaning

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
view is that my whole body is leaning

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.550 
view is that my whole body is leaning
slightly<00:01:51.060> forward<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.140> weight<00:01:52.379> is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
slightly forward and that my weight is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
slightly forward and that my weight is
on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> balls<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.789> feet<00:01:53.819> and<00:01:54.239> that<00:01:54.720> my

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on the balls of my feet and that my

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.930 
on the balls of my feet and that my
ankle<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.440> flexed<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:56.190> deflection<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.789> mean

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
ankle is flexed by deflection I mean

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.600 
ankle is flexed by deflection I mean
this<00:01:57.090> angle<00:01:57.539> here<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.989> less<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:58.950> 90<00:01:59.280> degrees

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
this angle here is less than 90 degrees

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.020 
this angle here is less than 90 degrees
a<00:02:00.539> lot<00:02:00.989> of<00:02:01.170> people<00:02:01.440> ski<00:02:01.709> with<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> 90<00:02:02.759> degree

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
a lot of people ski with a 90 degree

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
a lot of people ski with a 90 degree
angle<00:02:03.390> which<00:02:03.539> keeps<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.020> weight<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.440> their

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
angle which keeps the weight on their

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.460 
angle which keeps the weight on their
heels<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:06.509> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.840> keeps<00:02:06.959> them<00:02:07.200> sitting

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
heels and it kind of keeps them sitting

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.009 
heels and it kind of keeps them sitting
back<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:07.950> leg<00:02:08.420> squat<00:02:09.420> position<00:02:09.629> like

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
back in this leg squat position like

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.690 
back in this leg squat position like
that<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.160> effective<00:02:11.340> way

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that which is not a very effective way

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.420 
that which is not a very effective way
to<00:02:11.910> ski<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.260> flex<00:02:13.530> your<00:02:13.590> ankle<00:02:14.040> it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
to ski so if you flex your ankle it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.600 
to ski so if you flex your ankle it
brings<00:02:14.640> your<00:02:14.730> hips<00:02:14.970> forward<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:17.400> keeps

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
brings your hips forward and it keeps

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.690 
brings your hips forward and it keeps
you<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.940> forward<00:02:18.330> down<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> track<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you going forward down the track the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
you going forward down the track the
other<00:02:20.790> thing<00:02:21.000> people<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.629> always<00:02:22.530> stay

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
other thing people do is always stay

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.390 
other thing people do is always stay
down<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.540> position<00:02:24.989> here<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.410> during

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
down in this position here and during

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.970 
down in this position here and during
the<00:02:26.489> glide<00:02:26.670> phase<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.030> actually<00:02:27.330> want<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.510> be

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
the glide phase you actually want to be

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.089 
the glide phase you actually want to be
relatively<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.390> straight<00:02:30.390> leg<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.069> a

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
relatively on a straight leg just with a

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.339 
relatively on a straight leg just with a
slight<00:02:32.459> flexion<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.900> easier<00:02:34.290> to

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
slight flexion so that it's easier to

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.860 
slight flexion so that it's easier to
glide<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.860> you're<00:02:35.340> not<00:02:35.489> gliding<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.599> this

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
glide and you're not gliding like this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.479 
glide and you're not gliding like this
all<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.200> time<00:02:37.230> which<00:02:37.680> would<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:37.950> very<00:02:38.190> taxing

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
all the time which would be very taxing

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.210 
all the time which would be very taxing
as<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.900> glide<00:02:40.140> ski<00:02:40.409> starts<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.890> slow<00:02:41.069> down

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
as your glide ski starts to slow down

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.880 
as your glide ski starts to slow down
you're<00:02:41.459> gonna<00:02:41.610> want<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.849> start<00:02:42.030> your<00:02:42.180> push<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
you're gonna want to start your push to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.350 
you're gonna want to start your push to
start<00:02:43.890> your<00:02:44.010> push<00:02:44.190> you're<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.120> lower

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
start your push you're going to lower

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.290 
start your push you're going to lower
your<00:02:45.510> body<00:02:45.750> weight<00:02:46.019> by<00:02:46.230> flexing<00:02:46.650> your<00:02:46.680> ankle

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
your body weight by flexing your ankle

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.330 
your body weight by flexing your ankle
you're<00:02:48.300> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.569> roll<00:02:48.870> or<00:02:49.230> put<00:02:49.770> your<00:02:49.920> knee<00:02:50.100> in

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
you're going to roll or put your knee in

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.080 
you're going to roll or put your knee in
rolling<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.210> ski<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> inside<00:02:52.950> edge

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
rolling the ski on to the inside edge

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.949 
rolling the ski on to the inside edge
it's<00:02:54.090> very<00:02:54.270> important<00:02:54.569> to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
it's very important to

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.899 
it's very important to
when<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.379> this<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:56.040> maintain<00:02:56.189> ankle

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
when you do this to maintain ankle

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.349 
when you do this to maintain ankle
flexion<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.450> feel<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.230> pressure<00:02:59.359> pushing

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
flexion and feel the pressure pushing

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.929 
flexion and feel the pressure pushing
through<00:03:00.599> this<00:03:00.930> part<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.650> your<00:03:01.890> foot<00:03:02.099> onto<00:03:02.579> the

through this part of your foot onto the
outside<00:03:03.269> edge<00:03:03.450> once<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.409> get<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.680> edge<00:03:04.920> into

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
outside edge once you get that edge into

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.800 
outside edge once you get that edge into
the<00:03:05.280> snow<00:03:05.549> you're<00:03:06.120> gonna<00:03:06.269> want<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.510> start<00:03:06.659> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
the snow you're gonna want to start a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.520 
the snow you're gonna want to start a
push<00:03:07.049> off<00:03:07.319> onto<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.700> other<00:03:08.730> ski<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.290> put

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
push off onto your other ski so to put

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.809 
push off onto your other ski so to put
this<00:03:10.590> all<00:03:10.739> together<00:03:10.859> from<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.250> glide<00:03:11.549> phase

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
this all together from the glide phase

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.119 
this all together from the glide phase
you're<00:03:12.719> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.930> be<00:03:13.019> standing<00:03:13.439> up<00:03:13.620> nice<00:03:14.069> and

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
you're going to be standing up nice and

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.000 
you're going to be standing up nice and
tall<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.700> almost<00:03:15.329> straight<00:03:15.719> ski<00:03:16.049> you're

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
tall on the almost straight ski you're

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.000 
tall on the almost straight ski you're
gonna<00:03:17.159> sink<00:03:17.459> down<00:03:17.689> push<00:03:18.689> it<00:03:18.719> out<00:03:19.019> across<00:03:19.349> onto

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
gonna sink down push it out across onto

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.229 
gonna sink down push it out across onto
this<00:03:20.189> ski<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.639> standing<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:21.659> again<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:23.239> then

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
this ski and standing up again and then

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.240 
this ski and standing up again and then
you're<00:03:24.569> gonna<00:03:24.659> come<00:03:24.870> back<00:03:24.900> down<00:03:25.290> onto<00:03:25.859> this

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you're gonna come back down onto this

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.640 
you're gonna come back down onto this
ski<00:03:26.489> when<00:03:26.849> you<00:03:26.970> step<00:03:27.180> onto<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.599> ski<00:03:27.870> it's

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
ski when you step onto this ski it's

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.369 
ski when you step onto this ski it's
very<00:03:28.919> important<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.579> your<00:03:30.329> hips<00:03:30.659> and<00:03:30.959> upper

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
very important that your hips and upper

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.000 
very important that your hips and upper
body<00:03:31.620> are<00:03:31.919> already<00:03:32.340> over<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:33.359> ski<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:34.010> you

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
body are already over the ski and you

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.339 
body are already over the ski and you
don't<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.760> drag<00:03:36.419> your<00:03:36.689> upper<00:03:36.930> body<00:03:37.139> over

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
don't have to drag your upper body over

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.970 
don't have to drag your upper body over
like<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:39.109> okay<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.169> I've<00:03:40.409> given<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.799> lot

show you guys how to get a powerful push

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.199 
show you guys how to get a powerful push
when<00:03:53.159> skate<00:03:53.489> skiing<00:03:53.760> as<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:55.260> start<00:03:55.530> my<00:03:55.560> push<00:03:55.950> I

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
when skate skiing as I start my push I

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.909 
when skate skiing as I start my push I
flex<00:03:57.209> my<00:03:57.359> ankle<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.049> knee<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.500> lower<00:03:58.680> myself

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
flex my ankle and knee to lower myself

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.559 
flex my ankle and knee to lower myself
onto<00:03:59.370> my<00:03:59.489> ski<00:04:00.650> rotate<00:04:01.650> my<00:04:02.129> ski<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.479> the

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
onto my ski rotate my ski so that the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.020 
onto my ski rotate my ski so that the
inside<00:04:03.989> inside<00:04:04.620> edge<00:04:04.859> digs<00:04:05.280> into<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.790> snow

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
inside inside edge digs into the snow

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.069 
inside inside edge digs into the snow
and<00:04:06.299> then<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.379> give<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> short<00:04:08.239> powerful<00:04:09.239> snappy

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
and then I give a short powerful snappy

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.179 
and then I give a short powerful snappy
kick<00:04:10.319> off<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.909> then<00:04:11.909> step<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:13.139> to<00:04:13.919> my<00:04:14.040> other

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
kick off and then step on to my other

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:21.360 
kick off and then step on to my other
ski

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.490 

in<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.270> video<00:04:22.600> I'm<00:04:22.840> really<00:04:22.870> trying<00:04:23.410> to

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
in this video I'm really trying to

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.040 
in this video I'm really trying to
emphasize<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:24.160> glide<00:04:24.450> you'll<00:04:25.450> notice<00:04:25.840> that

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
emphasize the glide you'll notice that

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.520 
emphasize the glide you'll notice that
my<00:04:26.260> lake<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.950> virtually<00:04:27.880> straight<00:04:28.320> during<00:04:29.320> the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
my lake is virtually straight during the

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.220 
my lake is virtually straight during the
glide<00:04:29.710> phase<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:31.690> I'm<00:04:31.990> actually

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
glide phase and that I'm actually

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.700 
glide phase and that I'm actually
gliding<00:04:32.950> for<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.190> really<00:04:33.430> long<00:04:33.610> time<00:04:33.880> I<00:04:34.810> can<00:04:35.560> do

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
gliding for a really long time I can do

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.500 
gliding for a really long time I can do
this<00:04:35.919> because<00:04:36.160> I'm<00:04:36.550> in<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.730> very<00:04:36.760> comfortable

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
this because I'm in a very comfortable

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.959
