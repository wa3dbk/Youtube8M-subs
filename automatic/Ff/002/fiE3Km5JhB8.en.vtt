00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello and welcome to the video 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.960
 from me i am to the star us today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.000
 the review on this casey for the ipad 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.400
 mini the whole comes from the house 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.099
 politics and this is now 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.780
 around the model called atmosphere and that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.060
 is currently one of my favorite 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.279
 cases where i often go to an ipad 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.109
 mini drum as always catch now 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.480
 first with the construction on so far for 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.310
 Great look where I personally am very good 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 like 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 Just bring the amount of ipad 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 turn it on and look like the whole then 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.930
 in use looks like always 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.210
 Now the right side 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.590
 attach with the buttons the left 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 page there now as a kind 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.770
 let that be a snap on cases now 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.360
 and then it's pretty much ready for action 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.950
 if there are no animals to look at from behind 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.260
 Can we see that the apple logo 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.329
 now easy to see through here and here 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 below the ipad logo I find that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.000
 every case really cool 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.320
 Personally , I like these teas on 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.870
 best where to get the apple logo yet 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.210
 can recognize 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.989
 Let 's take a look 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 to control elements 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.220
 So here on the right side comes 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.970
 Of course I can easily get a page 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.950
 switch on 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.470
 he is extra so an opening is very 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.760
 Well done is the volume control 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.409
 are now here by such a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.310
 rubberized I find on every 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.990
 also really cool 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.820
 the on the bottom everything is open 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 So you come here easily one 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.150
 easy cable ran and could also be music 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 over the speakers on the head 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.780
 Of course, it also comes without problems 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.250
 button on it and the jack plug 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.950
 as well as a very nice feature 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.590
 from this cases that the whole one 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.750
 Label design therefore owns that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.000
 that now something about the display 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.200
 look over it and do the whole thing 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.240
 then just if we have the ipad now 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.930
 mini here with the display ahead on the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.290
 place a table 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.570
 it is not scratched but that 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 the case first touches the table here 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.530
 I think in any case , right 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.720
 cool it was also pretty hot 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.060
 I have the slide right now too 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
 from felix on my ipad mini and the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.280
 It's not going to go through the pace anyway 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.899
 pressed high so you can normal 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.430
 here is a display slide on your ipad 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.040
 have mini and still the passports 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.340
 used the only drawback one 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.860
 whole is easy 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.239
 if you are a fan of the smart cover 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 unfortunately you can not do that now 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.500
 use with this combination 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.230
 but I do not have a smart cover up anyway 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.660
 and I personally do not like it that much 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.580
 that does not bother me and yes 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.890
 as I said at the moment one of my 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360
 favorite cases 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.590
 I use it very often in case you are too 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.730
 just have a look 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.860
 down in the video description there 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.420
 find the link to it 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.340
 and matching this case I have too 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.410
 still here the model for the iphone 5 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.150
 a detailed wants to become like this 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.780
 also come that currently mine 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.130
 favorite case and yes as I said if 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.209
 you liked the video last night 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.519
 definitely the thumbs up there you are 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.260
 I really help subscribed to this 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.849
 channel to no longer fit videos 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.170
 following on twitter until the next 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.170
 sometimes you see my friends
