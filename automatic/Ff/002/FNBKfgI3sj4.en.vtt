 trees wear bright clothes better 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.170
 total with reflective elements 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.350
 always remember which side of the world 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.610
 you entered the forest and where at this moment 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 keep to proven routes in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.570
 unfamiliar forest walk along the paths 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.270
 be sure to leave traces behind you 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.809
 nicks or chalk marks on the trunks 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.870
 of trees 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.620
 broken branches of a piece of clothing if 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.930
 got lost 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.530
 put your ear to the ground and listen 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.530
 noise of cars knocking an ax shots of barking dogs 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.770
 voices all these sounds can lead you 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.650
 to people as well as power lines 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.470
 secondly try and get to the water 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 hold on to rivers or streams, walk along 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 them downstream 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 there are more chances to find a path 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.049
 leading to a settlement 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 nature itself will tell you where to go 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 tree bark in the north side as 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.170
 the rule is rougher 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.659
 and the trunks and stones and stumps are more abundant 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.049
 covered with lichen moss and mushrooms 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.740
 darkness 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.829
 collect dry branches and build one 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 shelter like a hut and litter from 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.340
 scrap materials 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 sheet of paper tucked under the clothes 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.799
 reduce the heat transfer together the same 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.100
 effect gives and foliage stuffed under clothes 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.630

 hang a handkerchief on a bush and cap 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.299
 or a piece of paper break off these branches to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.340
