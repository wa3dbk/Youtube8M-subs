landing page that's the one you probably
have<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> change<00:01:28.110> I'll<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.770> close<00:01:29.220> down

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
have to change I'll just close down

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.190

league legends since this one you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.880 
league legends since this one you
probably<00:01:34.500> shouldn't<00:01:35.040> change<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> i'll<00:01:37.860> just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
probably shouldn't change so i'll just

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.440 
probably shouldn't change so i'll just
delete<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.799> drag<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.400> there

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
delete that one drag this one in there

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.450 
delete that one drag this one in there
and<00:01:43.750> then<00:01:45.090> I'll<00:01:46.090> try<00:01:46.810> opening<00:01:47.439> league<00:01:48.340> of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
and then I'll try opening league of

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.230 
and then I'll try opening league of
legends<00:01:49.439> I'll<00:01:50.439> just<00:01:50.619> pause<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:50.950> video<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
legends I'll just pause the video and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
legends I'll just pause the video and
tell<00:01:55.240> now<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.579> ribbon<00:01:57.969> skin<00:01:58.299> works<00:01:58.740> fine<00:02:00.450> as

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
tell now the ribbon skin works fine as

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.440 
tell now the ribbon skin works fine as
you<00:02:03.250> see<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.780> guess<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.170> problem<00:02:09.569> was<00:02:10.569> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
you see so I guess the problem was that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.699 
you see so I guess the problem was that
you<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.940> probably<00:02:16.510> delete<00:02:16.870> both<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.530> these

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
you that probably delete both of these

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.930 
you that probably delete both of these
and<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.709> see<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.130> file<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.700> only

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
and as you see in this file it only

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.380 
and as you see in this file it only
comes<00:02:22.239> with<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.599> landing<00:02:22.959> page<00:02:23.200> assets<00:02:24.390> so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
comes with the landing page assets so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.900 
comes with the landing page assets so
you<00:02:25.930> should<00:02:26.319> only<00:02:26.560> remove<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.220> landing<00:02:27.640> page

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
you should only remove the landing page

you should only remove the landing page
assets<00:02:28.510> from<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.900> file<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:31.349> if<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.530> can't
