know with my bathing suit or anything
like<00:05:34.270> that<00:05:34.390> so<00:05:34.900> this<00:05:35.080> shirt<00:05:35.320> wasn't<00:05:35.650> on<00:05:35.950> sale

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
like that so this shirt wasn't on sale

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.750 
like that so this shirt wasn't on sale
but<00:05:36.640> I<00:05:36.700> did<00:05:37.090> like<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.480> fact<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:38.140> was

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.760 
but I did like the fact that it was
reversible<00:05:39.760> so<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.120> can<00:05:40.419> wear<00:05:40.690> it<00:05:40.840> as<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:41.729> black

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
reversible so you can wear it as a black

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.820 
reversible so you can wear it as a black
shirt<00:05:44.770> or<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:46.030> can<00:05:46.330> change<00:05:46.930> it<00:05:47.140> inside<00:05:47.590> out

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
shirt or you can change it inside out

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.610 
shirt or you can change it inside out
and<00:05:47.890> then<00:05:48.310> wear<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.669> as<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.450> gray<00:05:50.110> shirt<00:05:50.140> so<00:05:50.590> it's

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
and then wear it as a gray shirt so it's

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.920 
and then wear it as a gray shirt so it's
kind<00:05:50.950> of<00:05:51.010> like<00:05:51.190> this<00:05:51.430> two<00:05:51.729> and<00:05:51.970> one<00:05:52.000> like
