farther<00:01:06.119> away<00:01:06.270> arranged<00:01:06.770> has<00:01:07.770> our<00:01:08.010> good

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
farther away arranged has our good

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.230 
farther away arranged has our good
rolling<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.799> good<00:01:10.799> mount<00:01:10.950> damage<00:01:11.430> only<00:01:11.880> four

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
rolling in a good mount damage only four

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.460 
rolling in a good mount damage only four
shots<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.710> 12<00:01:14.150> shots<00:01:15.150> outside<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
shots and I think of 12 shots outside of

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.120 
shots and I think of 12 shots outside of
the<00:01:17.030> ball<00:01:18.030> pops<00:01:18.299> out<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.659> solder<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.619> ones<00:01:20.009> in

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the ball pops out of solder the ones in

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
the ball pops out of solder the ones in
chambers<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> 16<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.180> total<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:22.409> that's<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
chambers to 16 in total I think that's a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.830 
chambers to 16 in total I think that's a
little<00:01:22.860> low<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> try<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
little low if you're going to try to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.780 
little low if you're going to try to
rack<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> big<00:01:25.920> kill<00:01:26.189> streak<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
rack up like a big kill streak like I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.429 
rack up like a big kill streak like I
did<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.570> game<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.540> mean<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.110> still

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
did in this game but I mean it still

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.200 
did in this game but I mean it still
does<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:32.250> still<00:01:32.520> works<00:01:32.729> pretty<00:01:32.880> well<00:01:33.000> because

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
does it still works pretty well because

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
does it still works pretty well because
of<00:01:33.390> class<00:01:33.689> you're<00:01:33.930> running<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.670> pretty

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
of class you're running can be pretty

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.469 
of class you're running can be pretty
versatile<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.450> most<00:01:36.689> guns<00:01:38.479> especially

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
versatile with most guns especially

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.999 
versatile with most guns especially
after<00:01:40.049> you've<00:01:40.259> gotten<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.590> kill<00:01:40.770> streaks

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
after you've gotten your kill streaks

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.020 
after you've gotten your kill streaks
and<00:01:41.159> things<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> spaz<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:44.030> pretty

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and things like that the spaz is pretty

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.600 
and things like that the spaz is pretty
good<00:01:45.180> gun<00:01:45.390> its<00:01:45.590> semi-automatic<00:01:46.590> has<00:01:47.340> eight

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
all bounces out like two to three shot

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
all bounces out like two to three shot
pro<00:01:58.440> ratio<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.920> wrong<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.490> very<00:01:59.820> close<00:02:00.060> range

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
pro ratio is wrong at very close range

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.020 
pro ratio is wrong at very close range
and<00:02:01.080> that's<00:02:01.440> that's<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.100> good<00:02:02.130> gun<00:02:02.400> no

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and that's that's a very good gun no

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
and that's that's a very good gun no
attachment<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.170> sound<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.680> only

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
attachment for that is sound so the only

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
attachment for that is sound so the only
time<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.190> can<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.350> stake<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
time you can have for the stake out a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
time you can have for the stake out a
script<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.190> i<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.550> very<00:02:08.670> attached

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
script which i think is very attached

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
script which i think is very attached
and<00:02:09.330> coordinate<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.350> have<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and coordinate at we can have for the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.580 
and coordinate at we can have for the
classified<00:02:11.340> shotgun<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.780> looks<00:02:12.959> call<00:02:13.380> right

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
classified shotgun it looks call right

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.330 
classified shotgun it looks call right
now<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> dual<00:02:14.910> wield<00:02:15.320> um<00:02:16.320> two<00:02:16.740> faggots<00:02:17.130> not

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
now is a dual wield um two faggots not

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.000 
now is a dual wield um two faggots not
to<00:02:17.550> use<00:02:17.730> archive<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> tragedies<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.739> one

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
to use archive on the tragedies in one

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.580 
to use archive on the tragedies in one
game<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.540> did<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.200> all<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
game I just did not like it all the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.110 
game I just did not like it all the
range<00:02:22.800> was<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.190> very<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:23.550> i<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.700> was<00:02:24.000> like

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
range was not very good i think was like

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940 
range was not very good i think was like
semi-automatic<00:02:24.930> with<00:02:25.080> four<00:02:25.380> rounds<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
semi-automatic with four rounds in the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.530 
semi-automatic with four rounds in the
clip<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.600> did<00:02:27.959> not<00:02:27.989> work<00:02:28.200> well<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:29.540> just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
clip it just did not work well I just

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.490 
clip it just did not work well I just
didn't<00:02:30.780> find<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.140> did<00:02:31.260> enough<00:02:31.470> damage

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
didn't find like it did enough damage

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.920 
didn't find like it did enough damage
and<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.280> guess<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:32.970> kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.239> meant<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.780> be

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and I guess it's kind of meant to be

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.199 
and I guess it's kind of meant to be
dual<00:02:34.170> wielded<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.790> you're<00:02:35.940> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> be

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
dual wielded but if you're going to be

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.979 
dual wielded but if you're going to be
using<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.450> shotgun<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.050> game<00:02:38.780> then<00:02:39.780> you're

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
using a shotgun in this game then you're

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.360 
using a shotgun in this game then you're
in<00:02:40.110> need<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.440> slide<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> hand<00:02:40.950> because<00:02:41.220> you're

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
in need to slide a hand because you're

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.770 
in need to slide a hand because you're
going<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.580> need<00:02:41.730> need<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.239> reloading

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
going to need need to be reloading

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.590 
going to need need to be reloading

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
really especially with dual wielding and
