00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
probably doesn't work very well in this
position<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> look<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> because

position if we have a look at it because

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.249

maybe<00:01:20.280> black<00:01:20.640> plays<00:01:20.880> s6<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.729> white

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
maybe black plays s6 and white

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
maybe black plays s6 and white
uncomfortably<00:01:25.259> having<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> take<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.100> d5<00:01:26.460> what

that<00:02:06.180> bishop<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.630> e7<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.290> now<00:02:08.009> he<00:02:08.069> plays

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that bishop on e7 and now he plays

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.390 
that bishop on e7 and now he plays
Knight<00:02:08.670> d2<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
Knight d2 so that you know that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640 
Knight d2 so that you know that
potential<00:02:11.849> weakness<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.300> out<00:02:12.480> there

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
potential weakness is out there

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.640 
potential weakness is out there
b5<00:02:15.030> now<00:02:16.030> alkaline<00:02:16.330> take<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.080> he<00:02:17.140> gives<00:02:17.350> up<00:02:17.500> his

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
b5 now alkaline take so he gives up his

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.480 
b5 now alkaline take so he gives up his
bishop<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:18.730> he<00:02:19.000> realizes<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:21.340> know

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
bishop because he realizes that you know

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.790 
bishop because he realizes that you know
this<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:21.850> night<00:02:22.390> will<00:02:22.570> be<00:02:22.690> too<00:02:22.840> strong<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.320> d5

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
this this night will be too strong on d5

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.790 
this this night will be too strong on d5
pc-like<00:02:24.340> retreated<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.230> why<00:02:26.380> leave<00:02:26.590> it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
pc-like retreated it so why leave it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.280 
pc-like retreated it so why leave it
there<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.370> he's<00:02:27.550> got<00:02:27.760> now<00:02:28.360> positional<00:02:28.930> cards

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
there when he's got now positional cards

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.410 
there when he's got now positional cards
to<00:02:29.410> play<00:02:29.560> with<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.700> we've<00:02:30.790> got<00:02:30.940> these<00:02:31.120> two

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
to play with so we've got these two

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.240 
to play with so we've got these two
squares<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.020> now<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> does<00:02:32.410> make<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.710> root<00:02:33.040> for

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
squares and now it does make a root for

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.760 
squares and now it does make a root for
his<00:02:33.370> night<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.790> go<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.000> c5<00:02:34.630> notice<00:02:35.590> that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
his night to go to c5 notice that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.440 
his night to go to c5 notice that
without<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.220> dark<00:02:36.430> squared<00:02:36.760> bishop<00:02:37.090> black<00:02:37.300> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
without the dark squared bishop black is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.180 
without the dark squared bishop black is
more<00:02:37.690> vulnerable<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.260> these<00:02:38.410> squares<00:02:38.770> and

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
more vulnerable on these squares and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.130 
more vulnerable on these squares and
that's<00:02:39.550> why<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.790> game<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.420> instructive

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
that's why this game is so instructive

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.390 
that's why this game is so instructive

know should you take with a porn on a
piece<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.180> highly<00:02:52.390> instructive

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
piece and this is highly instructive

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.310 
piece and this is highly instructive
really<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.830> position<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:55.420> book<00:02:55.930> argued

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
really in this position the book argued

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.060 
really in this position the book argued
that<00:02:56.440> taken<00:02:56.830> with<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.250> piece<00:02:57.490> is<00:02:57.820> is<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.510> most

that taken with the piece is is the most

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.740 
that taken with the piece is is the most
effective<00:03:00.070> plan<00:03:00.670> because<00:03:01.210> you're<00:03:01.360> keeping

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
effective plan because you're keeping

not<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.340> could<00:03:06.460> be<00:03:06.490> easily<00:03:06.760> blockade<00:03:07.360> it's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
not if it could be easily blockade it's

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.330 
not if it could be easily blockade it's
not<00:03:07.750> going<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.930> be<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.020> major<00:03:08.200> threat<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.160> black

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
not going to be a major threat and black

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.340 
not going to be a major threat and black
can<00:03:09.520> also<00:03:09.670> then<00:03:09.970> play<00:03:10.210> a<00:03:10.450> five<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.960> see<00:03:11.170> like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
can also then play a five and see like

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.730 
can also then play a five and see like
this<00:03:11.530> fi<00:03:12.010> winners<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:13.180> by<00:03:13.930> capturing<00:03:14.560> the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
this fi winners so by capturing the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.460 
this fi winners so by capturing the
Queen<00:03:15.100> white<00:03:15.520> is<00:03:15.670> secure<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.240> control<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.720> c5

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
Queen white is secure in control of c5

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.940 
Queen white is secure in control of c5
and<00:03:17.500> e5<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.870> Queen<00:03:20.110> exchange<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.650> really

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
and e5 and the Queen exchange is really

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.710 
and e5 and the Queen exchange is really
don't<00:03:21.130> help<00:03:21.430> black<00:03:21.700> in<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.090> more<00:03:22.300> simplified

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
don't help black in this more simplified

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.230 
don't help black in this more simplified
position<00:03:23.110> so<00:03:23.260> White's<00:03:23.530> now<00:03:23.800> got<00:03:24.010> access<00:03:24.460> full

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
position so White's now got access full

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.750 
position so White's now got access full
control<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.810> sea<00:03:26.020> fowl<00:03:26.430> control<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.610> these

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
control of the sea fowl control of these

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.580 
control of the sea fowl control of these
two<00:03:28.030> squares<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.870> nights<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.530> be

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
two squares and this nights going to be

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.740 
two squares and this nights going to be
better<00:03:29.740> than<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.040> bishop<00:03:30.520> so<00:03:31.360> there's<00:03:31.570> a<00:03:31.630> lot

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
better than this bishop so there's a lot

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.700 
better than this bishop so there's a lot
of<00:03:31.810> strategic<00:03:32.440> themes<00:03:32.680> now<00:03:33.010> going<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.490> here<00:03:34.710> so

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
of strategic themes now going on here so

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.880 
of strategic themes now going on here so
this<00:03:36.190> f3<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:36.940> very<00:03:37.330> beautiful<00:03:38.050> little<00:03:38.530> move

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
this f3 is a very beautiful little move

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.890 
this f3 is a very beautiful little move
to<00:03:39.340> try<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:39.670> get<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.910> king<00:03:40.180> aggressively

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
to try and get the king aggressively

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.420 
to try and get the king aggressively
into<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.200> game<00:03:41.410> as<00:03:41.590> well<00:03:41.740> see<00:03:41.980> now<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.370> a

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
into the game as well see now in a

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.780 
into the game as well see now in a
stunning<00:03:42.730> fashion<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:45.070> seal<00:03:45.400> off<00:03:45.520> black

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.360 
stunning fashion and seal off black
scales<00:03:46.150> play<00:03:46.390> now<00:03:46.600> with<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.990> three<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:48.130> blacks

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
scales play now with a three so blacks

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.130 
scales play now with a three so blacks
not<00:03:48.610> really<00:03:48.880> able<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.210> do<00:03:49.450> much<00:03:49.690> here<00:03:49.930> because
