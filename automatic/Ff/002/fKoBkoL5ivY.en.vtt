00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.390 
pan it'll just help loosen all of this
stuff<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.900> bit<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.890> find<00:01:32.250> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
stuff a little bit you can find that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
stuff a little bit you can find that
sometimes<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> maple<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.439> can

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
sometimes with the maple in there it can

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.550 
sometimes with the maple in there it can
get<00:01:34.799> quite<00:01:35.040> thick<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.369> almost<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.350> can

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
get quite thick and almost so now we can

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.770 
get quite thick and almost so now we can
start<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.329> just<00:01:39.329> gently<00:01:39.920> toss<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.130> around

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
start to just gently toss these around

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.330 
start to just gently toss these around

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
now I'm gonna bash up these walnuts that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.090 
now I'm gonna bash up these walnuts that
I've<00:01:54.360> lightly<00:01:54.869> toasted<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.439> oven<00:01:55.500> nice

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
I've lightly toasted in the oven nice

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.980 
I've lightly toasted in the oven nice
so<00:01:57.430> as<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.640> can<00:01:57.790> see<00:01:58.060> now<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.540> lot<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.930> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
so as you can see now a lot of the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.960 
so as you can see now a lot of the
butter<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.950> maple<00:02:00.130> has<00:02:00.430> started<00:02:00.820> to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
butter and the maple has started to

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.430 
butter and the maple has started to
really<00:02:01.330> melt<00:02:01.510> down<00:02:01.720> that's<00:02:01.930> being<00:02:02.140> absorbed

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
really melt down that's being absorbed

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.260 
really melt down that's being absorbed
into<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.950> carrots<00:02:03.370> and<00:02:03.670> what<00:02:03.790> I'm<00:02:03.909> looking

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
into the carrots and what I'm looking

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.180 
into the carrots and what I'm looking
for<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.840> outer<00:02:05.170> skin<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.710> carrots<00:02:06.040> to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
for is the outer skin of the carrots to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.219 
for is the outer skin of the carrots to
really<00:02:06.400> start<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.760> blister<00:02:07.120> from<00:02:07.540> this<00:02:07.750> but<00:02:08.140> I

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
really start to blister from this but I

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.050 
really start to blister from this but I
want<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> inside<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.280> carrots<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.940> be

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
want the inside of the carrots to be

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.640 
want the inside of the carrots to be
really<00:02:10.360> crunchy<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.780> our<00:02:10.929> dentists<00:02:11.380> tell

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
really crunchy and our dentists tell

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.380 
really crunchy and our dentists tell
which<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.040> why<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:12.550> really<00:02:12.580> important<00:02:13.330> to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
which is why it's really important to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.730 
which is why it's really important to
almost<00:02:13.630> undercook<00:02:14.200> them<00:02:14.350> in<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.530> water

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
almost undercook them in the water

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.740 
almost undercook them in the water
because<00:02:14.920> we're<00:02:15.160> twice<00:02:15.370> cooking<00:02:15.880> here<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.630> how

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
because we're twice cooking here so how

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.410 
because we're twice cooking here so how
those<00:02:16.900> walnuts<00:02:17.260> look<00:02:17.470> they<00:02:17.740> look<00:02:18.100> fabulous<00:02:18.790> so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
those walnuts look they look fabulous so

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.360 
those walnuts look they look fabulous so
just<00:02:19.780> pop<00:02:19.930> them<00:02:20.110> straight<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.280> think

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
just pop them straight in and I think

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.350 
just pop them straight in and I think
it's<00:02:21.580> really<00:02:21.820> nice<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.150> get<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.300> different

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's really nice to get a different

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.420 
it's really nice to get a different
course<00:02:22.959> texture<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:23.890> get<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> lot<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.370> that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
course texture we get a lot of that

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.000 
course texture we get a lot of that
really<00:02:24.850> fine<00:02:25.180> powdery<00:02:25.900> walnut<00:02:26.320> coating<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
really fine powdery walnut coating the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.610 
really fine powdery walnut coating the
carrots<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.180> almost<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.720> corsa<00:02:29.410> bits

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
carrots but we almost get the corsa bits

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.340 
carrots but we almost get the corsa bits
of<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.830> walnut<00:02:30.220> actually<00:02:30.959> frying<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.140> little

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
of the walnut actually frying a little

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.020 
of the walnut actually frying a little
bit<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:32.650> pattern<00:02:32.890> I'm<00:02:33.489> giving<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.940> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
bit in that pattern I'm giving it that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.940 
bit in that pattern I'm giving it that
beautiful<00:02:34.480> crunch<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.410> last<00:02:35.590> thing<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.830> want
