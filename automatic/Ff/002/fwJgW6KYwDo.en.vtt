00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.240
 refers to the impact of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.930
 hurricanes that have hit in this region 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.520
 and they have been devastating in 1903 impacted 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.410
 to a great cyclone that destroyed the clock 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.840
 from the cathedral tearing a large roof 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.200
 that was the winery precisely from the 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.960
 customs later this we had other 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.119
 cyclones of 1933 good that started the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.460
 roof of what was precisely the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.560
 old kiosk of the presidency 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.470
 municipal to make a remembrance 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.659
 about this type of phenomena said that the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.819
 last impact of a hurricane on this 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:42.359
 region occurred in 1966 with hurricanes and 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:43.949
 after this to that date this 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.449
 we had the possibility that the gilberto 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.739
 it will impact us but a 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.320
 trajectory very similar to the one 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.360
 we have now and well you will remember that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.030
 with what we already had many pounds 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 prior to this now little or that is 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 say that here near high tampico 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.360
 another cyclone happened in which neither 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 we feel no rain reports that of 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.580
 there has emerged an urban legend that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.830
 there is a base of UFOs off the coast 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 from the south of Tamaulipas so each 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.869
 time is more present in the new 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 generations this has generated a 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.030
 legend recorded an explanation to this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.890
 phenomenon in which undoubtedly good 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.840
 that tradition was brought by an engineer from 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 orders equa that spoke that he had 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.220
 contact with some extraterrestrials and you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.080
 he said they were going to place a base 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.320
 exactly where they meet in the sea 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.479
 this the vertex points of the body of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.280
 tampico and the port of altamira and that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.960
 there are some caverns follow those 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.729
 caves they inhabited the same and that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.160
 they were going to then not protect us 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.899
 but protect their bases and then 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.640
 always speculation if these sites 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.860
 come to standards and protect us 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.289
 famous Martians and citizenship not 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.899
 doubt that this could be true 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.710
 version something so close to the threat of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.680
 a hurricane 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.180
 and suddenly these phenomena take 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.290
 other address 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.290
 who knows is in doubt 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.980
 many people have seen it and many 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.980
 consider citizens 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.730
 we have all loved each other and men 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.300
 they had rid of this truth 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.940
 with city 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.490
 and give him djembe but we are trying to 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.520
 that thanks to God truth first 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.110
 God that has arrived has left us 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.860
 get a storm of these as 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.380
 they have always oriented us 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.310
 The cyclones are really good 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.930
 this benefits us and although 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.630
 the municipal authorities 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.220
 they kept monitoring at all times 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.340
 the displacement of the hurricane 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.850
 ingrid are also surprised 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.820
 thank you goodbye 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.580
 we did not touch the hill here in the city and 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.590
 that you have to thank him because 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.860
 definitively there definitely had to be 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.600
 had 500 of 100 with 120 kilometers 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.980
 I think if we had many more 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.980
 problems in the city 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.450
 and the legend that there is a 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.950
 advance of martians there that the cycle 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.710
 he was threatening us because then he 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.750
 they had gone to Mexico to do a work 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.510
 but that fortunately returned to 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.270
 time and here we are healthy is something 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.160
 meanwhile the historian said that 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.650
 of what maybe they can not protect us 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.030
 the Martians is from the floods 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.460
 as happened in 1955 with the phenomenon 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.590
 meteorological inda but good what 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.480
 we must think is always in the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.460
 protection always bet on the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.770
 civil protection is better they say 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.600
 you know it was a scare but we have 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.550
 this possibility the hurricane 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.010
 Ingrid follows a very strong trajectory 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.380
 similar to Hurricane Gilberto as 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.080
 phenomenon after being located in front 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.480
 to the south of Tamaulipas it turned towards the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.210
 north and that is why it becomes more 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.880
 present the belief that there is a 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.390
 base of aliens in front of the beach 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.160
 miramar although they continue to prevail 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.410
