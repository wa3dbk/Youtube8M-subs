00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969

first thing you need is some organic
rolled<00:00:33.420> oats<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> buy<00:00:34.950> them<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.280> bulk

rolled oats I like to buy them in bulk

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.889 
rolled oats I like to buy them in bulk
because<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.820> find<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.180> they're<00:00:36.360> cheaper<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
because I find that they're cheaper that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.270 
because I find that they're cheaper that
way<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.160> large

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
way and then I just put them in a large

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.150 
way and then I just put them in a large
ziplock<00:00:38.820> bag<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.559> half<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
ziplock bag so we're going to put half a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790 
ziplock bag so we're going to put half a
cup<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.670> rolled<00:00:41.969> oats<00:00:42.180> into<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.559> food

cup of rolled oats into the food

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
cup of rolled oats into the food
processor<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.469> we're<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.010> process<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
processor and we're going to process it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
processor and we're going to process it
until<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> fine<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.020> want

sort of more of a textured gritty
pancake<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.000> process<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.840> as

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960

taste<00:04:11.460> on<00:04:11.790> their<00:04:11.940> pancakes<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:13.440> we<00:04:13.740> are<00:04:13.830> not

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
taste on their pancakes and we are not

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.400 
taste on their pancakes and we are not
afraid<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.700> use<00:04:14.850> organic<00:04:15.390> butter<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.290> I'm

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
afraid to use organic butter so I'm

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.080 
afraid to use organic butter so I'm
going<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.680> melt<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.489> here

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
going to melt that in here

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.710 
going to melt that in here
first<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.160> want<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.520> make<00:04:20.640> sure<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.299> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
first so you want to make sure that the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.840 
first so you want to make sure that the
pan<00:04:22.170> is<00:04:22.380> completely<00:04:23.010> covered<00:04:23.430> with<00:04:23.460> butter

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
pan is completely covered with butter

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.280 
pan is completely covered with butter
and<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:25.020> almost<00:04:25.490> done<00:04:26.490> melting<00:04:27.030> no<00:04:27.630> need<00:04:27.990> to

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
and it's almost done melting no need to

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.380 
and it's almost done melting no need to
rush<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.770> what<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.310> don't<00:04:29.610> want<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.060> don't

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
rush it what you don't want is you don't

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.050 
rush it what you don't want is you don't
want<00:04:30.600> your<00:04:30.780> butter<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.260> turn<00:04:31.500> brown<00:04:32.060> that

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
want your butter to turn brown that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.170 
want your butter to turn brown that
really<00:04:33.390> won't<00:04:33.780> give<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.260> very<00:04:34.500> good<00:04:34.770> flavor

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
really won't give you a very good flavor

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.760 
really won't give you a very good flavor
with<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.330> pancake<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:37.110> just<00:04:37.410> take<00:04:37.560> your<00:04:37.590> time

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
with the pancake so just take your time

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.880 
with the pancake so just take your time
as<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:39.000> know<00:04:39.120> keep<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.480> on<00:04:39.570> medium<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.410> let

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
as it you know keep it on medium and let

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.680 
as it you know keep it on medium and let
it<00:04:41.010> melt<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.610> then<00:04:41.730> this<00:04:41.880> way<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.210> won't<00:04:42.360> Brown

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
it melt and then this way it won't Brown

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.310 
it melt and then this way it won't Brown
so<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:44.340> recipe<00:04:44.940> makes<00:04:45.210> about<00:04:45.390> two<00:04:45.840> large

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
so this recipe makes about two large

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.450 
so this recipe makes about two large
pancakes

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
pancakes

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.220 
pancakes
so<00:04:48.300> let's<00:04:48.630> make<00:04:48.900> our<00:04:49.110> first<00:04:49.140> one

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.800 

all<00:04:55.410> right<00:04:57.170> that<00:04:58.170> looks<00:04:58.410> great<00:04:59.450> and<00:05:00.450> what<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.690> do

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
all right that looks great and what I do

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.570 
all right that looks great and what I do
is<00:05:01.140> I<00:05:01.260> cover<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:02.780> cover<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.990> pan<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.680> again<00:05:05.550> I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
is I cover I cover the pan and again I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.060 
is I cover I cover the pan and again I
take<00:05:06.030> my<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.480> take<00:05:06.810> my<00:05:06.930> time<00:05:07.170> with<00:05:07.230> it<00:05:07.620> because

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
take my I take my time with it because

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.300 
take my I take my time with it because
if<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:09.150> try<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.840> put<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.170> on<00:05:10.320> high<00:05:10.530> then<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.070> end

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
if I try and put it on high then I end

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.120 
if I try and put it on high then I end
up<00:05:11.490> with<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.640> burnt<00:05:11.940> pancake<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.830> really

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
up with a burnt pancake and you really

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.580 
up with a burnt pancake and you really
just<00:05:14.340> have<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.580> have<00:05:14.820> some<00:05:15.270> patience<00:05:15.930> if<00:05:16.140> you

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
just have to have some patience if you

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.110 
just have to have some patience if you
want<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.920> make<00:05:17.070> two<00:05:17.340> at<00:05:17.490> once<00:05:17.700> if<00:05:17.910> you're

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
want to make two at once if you're

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.490 
want to make two at once if you're
doubling<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.660> recipe<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:19.140> want<00:05:19.320> to<00:05:19.380> make

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
doubling the recipe you want to make

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.140 
doubling the recipe you want to make
four<00:05:19.770> at<00:05:19.830> once<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.160> can<00:05:20.340> do<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.790> larger

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
four at once you can do it in a larger

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.530 
four at once you can do it in a larger
pan<00:05:21.360> but<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:21.960> do<00:05:22.080> find<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.590> this<00:05:23.190> this<00:05:23.970> method

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
pan but I do find that this this method

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.230 
pan but I do find that this this method
really<00:05:25.320> is<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.800> tastier<00:05:26.490> method<00:05:26.880> even<00:05:27.150> if

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
really is the tastier method even if

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.020 
really is the tastier method even if
it's<00:05:27.390> not<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.900> fastest<00:05:28.560> method<00:05:28.920> and<00:05:29.130> once<00:05:29.850> I

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
it's not the fastest method and once I

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.390 
it's not the fastest method and once I
see<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.930> edges<00:05:31.140> are<00:05:31.590> starting<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.160> crisp

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
see that the edges are starting to crisp

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.290 
see that the edges are starting to crisp
up<00:05:32.700> then<00:05:33.360> that's<00:05:33.870> when<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.910> that's<00:05:35.910> when<00:05:36.180> I'll

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
up then that's when I that's when I'll

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.420 
up then that's when I that's when I'll
flip<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:36.690> over<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:37.200> cook<00:05:37.920> it<00:05:38.070> on<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.310> other

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
flip it over and cook it on the other

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.730 
flip it over and cook it on the other
side<00:05:38.690> because<00:05:39.690> we<00:05:39.900> are<00:05:39.930> letting<00:05:40.260> this<00:05:40.500> pancake

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
side because we are letting this pancake

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.860 
side because we are letting this pancake
take<00:05:41.190> time<00:05:41.490> I'm<00:05:42.210> going<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:42.420> show<00:05:42.600> you<00:05:42.660> the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
finished product and this is what your

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.230 
finished product and this is what your
pancakes<00:05:46.650> should<00:05:46.830> look<00:05:47.040> like<00:05:47.070> like<00:05:47.580> as<00:05:47.760> you

it's a nice golden brown color that's

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.100 
it's a nice golden brown color that's
because<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.180> butter<00:05:54.390> and<00:05:54.660> again<00:05:54.750> because
