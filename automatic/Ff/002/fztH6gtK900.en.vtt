I'll be doing a review of the whole this
is<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.610> multi<00:00:12.240> fuel<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:13.380> stay<00:00:15.320> first<00:00:16.320> off<00:00:16.500> that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
is a multi fuel on stay first off that

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:40.000 
is a multi fuel on stay first off that
works<00:00:16.890> really<00:00:17.279> well<00:00:17.400> actually<00:00:18.150> I'm<00:00:18.590> boiling

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.010 

snap<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.220> low<00:00:41.490> and<00:00:41.970> then<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.180> water<00:00:42.390> pretty

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
snap that low and then the water pretty

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.890 
snap that low and then the water pretty
much<00:00:43.260> stops<00:00:43.620> blowing<00:00:44.330> then<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.510> men<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
much stops blowing then the men and I

00:00:45.900 --> 00:01:13.289 
much stops blowing then the men and I
kick<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> over<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> high

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.069 

and<00:01:13.600> considering<00:01:14.109> how<00:01:14.170> long<00:01:14.560> strong<00:01:14.979> verbs

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
and considering how long strong verbs

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.810 
and considering how long strong verbs
that's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.990 
that's
they<00:01:18.800> say<00:01:19.800> anywhere<00:01:20.130> between<00:01:20.340> four<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.820> five

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
they say anywhere between four and five

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:36.320 
they say anywhere between four and five
minutes<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.050> room

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.710 

flame<00:01:37.330> controlled<00:01:39.150> burning<00:01:40.150> actually

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
flame controlled burning actually

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.050 
flame controlled burning actually
unleaded<00:01:41.110> gasoline<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.170> never<00:01:44.410> feel<00:01:45.060> shame

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
unleaded gasoline and I never feel shame

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.730 
unleaded gasoline and I never feel shame
you

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.940 

-<00:01:49.540> which<00:01:50.540> is<00:01:50.869> working<00:01:51.409> very<00:01:52.369> well<00:01:52.520> aware

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
- which is working very well aware

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.950 

write<00:01:55.520> down<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.850> winds<00:01:56.150> blowing<00:01:56.479> actually

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
write down the winds blowing actually

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:06.030 
write down the winds blowing actually
pretty<00:01:57.260> good<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:59.420> not<00:02:01.090> very<00:02:02.090> very<00:02:04.990> I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
pretty good and it's not very very I

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.090 
pretty good and it's not very very I
think<00:02:07.040> it'd<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.369> more<00:02:07.790> like<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:08.240> the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
think it'd be more like on the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.120 
think it'd be more like on the
backpacking<00:02:10.390> stove<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:11.690> cuz<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.100> a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
backpacking stove just cuz it it is a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.570 
backpacking stove just cuz it it is a
bit<00:02:13.430> bigger<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:15.050> be<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.770> bit<00:02:15.980> big<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.370> be<00:02:16.550> a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
bit bigger to be it is a bit big to be a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.050 
bit bigger to be it is a bit big to be a
backpacking<00:02:17.270> stove<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:19.730> isn't

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
backpacking stove but it is it isn't

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.990 
backpacking stove but it is it isn't
extremely<00:02:20.450> heavy<00:02:21.050> either

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
extremely heavy either

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.330 
extremely heavy either
so<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.630> guess<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.170> guess<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.710> don't<00:02:24.770> know<00:02:24.920> what<00:02:25.160> to

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so I guess I guess I don't know what to

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.590 
so I guess I guess I don't know what to
classify<00:02:25.940> us

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
classify us

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.850 
classify us
I<00:02:27.070> usually<00:02:28.070> when<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:28.490> car<00:02:28.730> camping<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.650> I

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
I usually when I go car camping and if I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220 
I usually when I go car camping and if I
do<00:02:30.920> go<00:02:31.370> backpacking<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:32.180> usually<00:02:32.780> bring<00:02:32.990> this

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
do go backpacking I usually bring this

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.060 
do go backpacking I usually bring this
bag<00:02:34.100> or<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.760> sterno<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.980> kind<00:02:36.980> of

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
bag or a can of sterno but kind of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.010 
bag or a can of sterno but kind of
startup<00:02:37.990> boys

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.570 

so<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.590> guess<00:02:41.770> if<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.010> hate<00:02:42.310> someone

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
so I guess if you I hate someone

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.150 
so I guess if you I hate someone
apparently

um

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.010 
um
this<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.910> just<00:02:53.090> not

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.460 

this<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> really<00:02:57.310> good

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
this is a really good

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.650 
this is a really good
just<00:02:59.920> for<00:03:00.280> everything<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.180> could<00:03:01.330> do<00:03:01.450> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
just for everything this you could do a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.660 
just for everything this you could do a
lot<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.900> cooking

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
lot of cooking

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.230 
lot of cooking
come<00:03:04.330> it's<00:03:04.870> about<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.319> this<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.240> Coleman

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
come it's about it this is the Coleman

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.979 
come it's about it this is the Coleman
exponent<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:09.280> ways<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:10.000> think<00:03:10.239> about<00:03:10.450> it

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
exponent and the ways I think about it

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.790 
exponent and the ways I think about it
was<00:03:11.170> about<00:03:11.410> thirteen<00:03:11.950> ounces<00:03:13.800> thirty

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
was about thirteen ounces thirty

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.650 
was about thirteen ounces thirty
thirty-two<00:03:15.190> ounces

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.140 

it's<00:03:20.170> got<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.320> really<00:03:20.860> dumb<00:03:21.070> high<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.340> burn<00:03:21.850> for

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
it's got a really dumb high to burn for

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.580 
it's got a really dumb high to burn for
an<00:03:22.300> hour<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.750> 38<00:03:23.110> minutes<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.240> box<00:03:25.590> so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
an hour and 38 minutes on the box so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.179 
an hour and 38 minutes on the box so
it's<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.920> nice<00:03:27.040> little<00:03:27.430> unit

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.490 

that's<00:03:35.189> that<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.329> change<00:03:36.689> it<00:03:36.840> out<00:03:36.989> it's

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
that's that you can change it out it's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.059 
that's that you can change it out it's
called<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.829> kerosene<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.549> united<00:03:39.060> and

called the kerosene is united and
worried<00:03:41.069> about<00:03:41.250> another<00:03:41.730> bad<00:03:42.060> thing<00:03:42.090> about

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
worried about another bad thing about

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.649 
worried about another bad thing about
the<00:03:42.629> stir<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.019> when<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.349> cold<00:03:44.599> sort<00:03:45.599> of

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
the stir this when it's cold sort of

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.569 
the stir this when it's cold sort of
gotta<00:03:45.780> fold<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.110> brain<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.040> bollocks<00:03:47.400> to

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
gotta fold the brain to that bollocks to

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.759 
gotta fold the brain to that bollocks to
get<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.090> going<00:03:48.269> because<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.290> guess<00:03:49.470> whenever

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
get it going because I guess whenever

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.380 
get it going because I guess whenever
this<00:03:50.129> eat<00:03:50.459> something<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.879> creates<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.269> a

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
this eat something it creates like a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.440 
this eat something it creates like a
vapor<00:03:51.659> and<00:03:51.870> then<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.260> converts<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:53.239> fuel<00:03:54.239> in

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
vapor and then it converts the fuel in
