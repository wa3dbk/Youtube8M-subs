00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
been doing for a little while but I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.580 
been doing for a little while but I
wanted<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:18.090> give<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> look<00:00:19.140> see<00:00:19.320> how<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
wanted to just give you a look see how I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.980 
wanted to just give you a look see how I
do<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.950> so<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.030> is<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> project<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.900> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
do it so this is the project it's a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.430 
do it so this is the project it's a
mixed<00:00:22.440> media<00:00:22.620> tag<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:24.050> I'm<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.320> excited

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
mixed media tag and I'm really excited

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.820 
mixed media tag and I'm really excited
the<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.550> turned<00:00:26.940> out<00:00:27.590> it's<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the way it turned out it's not what I

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.490 
the way it turned out it's not what I
expected<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.520> it<00:00:29.940> was<00:00:30.030> a<00:00:30.060> pleasant<00:00:30.270> surprise

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
expected but it was a pleasant surprise

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.119 
expected but it was a pleasant surprise
so<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.710> go

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.120 

just<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:35.910> bit<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> process

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
just a little bit of the process

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.360 
just a little bit of the process
starting<00:00:38.130> with<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.400> base<00:00:38.580> sheet<00:00:40.370> it's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
starting with the base sheet it's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.010 
starting with the base sheet it's
actually<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> wrapping<00:00:42.150> paper<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> found

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
actually a wrapping paper that I found

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.560 
actually a wrapping paper that I found
at<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.170> dollar<00:00:43.380> store<00:00:43.560> with<00:00:44.310> the<00:00:44.610> newspapers

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
at the dollar store with the newspapers

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
at the dollar store with the newspapers
print<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.400> and<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> technique<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
print on it and so the technique that I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.780 
print on it and so the technique that I
was<00:00:50.070> talking<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:51.020> using<00:00:52.020> tool<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:53.610> give

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
was talking about is using tool to give

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.050 
was talking about is using tool to give
some<00:00:54.180> more<00:00:54.750> texture<00:00:55.200> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.070> base<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> tag

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
some more texture to the base of the tag

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.790 
some more texture to the base of the tag
and<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.530> you'll<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.950> that<00:00:59.250> I<00:01:00.590> adhere<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and so here you'll see that I adhere a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.719 
and so here you'll see that I adhere a
layer<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.610> tulle<00:01:02.970> while<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.199> modge<00:01:05.070> podge<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
layer of tulle while the modge podge is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.260 
layer of tulle while the modge podge is
still<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.869> wet<00:01:07.079> and<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:11.060> really<00:01:12.060> like

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
still a little wet and I really like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.529 
still a little wet and I really like
what<00:01:12.869> happens<00:01:13.259> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.499> edges<00:01:13.859> when<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> heat<00:01:14.819> it

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
what happens to the edges when I heat it

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.129 
what happens to the edges when I heat it
starts<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.259> melt<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.429> kind<00:01:17.609> of<00:01:17.670> melts<00:01:18.569> into

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:19.139 
starts to melt and it kind of melts into

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:24.499 
starts to melt and it kind of melts into
the<00:01:20.069> tag<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:22.350> adheres<00:01:23.039> really<00:01:23.969> well<00:01:24.209> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the tag and it adheres really well I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.050 
the tag and it adheres really well I
decided<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.560> needed<00:01:25.590> another<00:01:26.219> layer<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:29.060> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
decided it needed another layer and so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.870 
decided it needed another layer and so
again<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:31.350> requiring<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.159> whole<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.609> more

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
again not requiring a whole lot more

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.179 
again not requiring a whole lot more
glue<00:01:34.039> it<00:01:35.039> does<00:01:35.609> a<00:01:35.639> really<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:36.119> job<00:01:36.299> of

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
glue it does a really good job of

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.149 
glue it does a really good job of
adhering<00:01:38.689> for<00:01:39.689> some<00:01:39.840> reason<00:01:40.170> once<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.829> starts

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
adhering for some reason once it starts

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
adhering for some reason once it starts
to<00:01:41.249> kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> melt<00:01:41.789> into<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.590> tag<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:45.619> used<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
to kind of melt into the tag I used a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.609 
to kind of melt into the tag I used a
little<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.099> of<00:01:47.249> Mod<00:01:47.819> Podge<00:01:48.179> on<00:01:48.749> the<00:01:48.990> edges<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
little bit of Mod Podge on the edges to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.339 
little bit of Mod Podge on the edges to
kind<00:01:49.859> of<00:01:49.950> seal<00:01:50.219> it<00:01:50.429> down<00:01:50.639> I<00:01:51.139> don't<00:01:52.139> want<00:01:52.289> the

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
kind of seal it down I don't want the

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.449 
kind of seal it down I don't want the
edges<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.679> fray<00:01:54.529> and<00:01:55.529> I'm<00:01:56.009> gonna<00:01:56.219> use<00:01:56.429> some

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
edges to fray and I'm gonna use some

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.529 
edges to fray and I'm gonna use some
Linde<00:01:57.119> stamp<00:01:57.539> hang<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.700> Ghostly<00:01:59.700> gargoyle

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
Linde stamp hang that's Ghostly gargoyle

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.949 
Linde stamp hang that's Ghostly gargoyle
white<00:02:01.609> just<00:02:02.609> to<00:02:02.759> brighten<00:02:03.179> up<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.509> tag<00:02:04.039> and

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
white just to brighten up the tag and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.570 
white just to brighten up the tag and
this<00:02:06.959> is<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.229> new<00:02:07.409> product<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.160> hadn't

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
this is the new product that I hadn't

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.080 
this is the new product that I hadn't
tried<00:02:08.819> before<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.440> dream<00:02:11.090> weavers

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
tried before it's from dream weavers

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.679 
tried before it's from dream weavers
stencils<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:13.950> an<00:02:14.129> embossing<00:02:14.519> paste<00:02:15.209> and

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
stencils and it's an embossing paste and

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.180 
stencils and it's an embossing paste and
it's<00:02:16.129> pearlescent

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
it's pearlescent

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.270 
it's pearlescent
so<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.390> look<00:02:18.660> you'll<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:18.900> how<00:02:19.620> glossy<00:02:19.920> it

Sheen and gloss it has those areas in
between<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.840> gaps<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.560> feel<00:03:38.250> need<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.610> little

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
between the gaps I feel need a little

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.170 
between the gaps I feel need a little
sheen<00:03:40.350> as<00:03:40.500> well<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.520> I'm<00:03:41.610> using<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
sheen as well and so I'm using the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.470

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.429 

another<00:04:39.879> reason<00:04:40.119> I<00:04:40.449> like<00:04:40.719> working<00:04:40.989> with<00:04:41.169> the

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
another reason I like working with the

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.359 
another reason I like working with the
tool<00:04:41.649> is<00:04:42.399> that<00:04:42.459> I<00:04:42.669> feel<00:04:43.089> it<00:04:43.469> grips<00:04:44.469> the<00:04:44.860> Micah

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:45.369 
tool is that I feel it grips the Micah

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:48.799 
tool is that I feel it grips the Micah
and<00:04:46.139> holds<00:04:47.139> it<00:04:47.229> down<00:04:47.259> in<00:04:47.619> one<00:04:47.860> place

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:48.809 
and holds it down in one place

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:53.309 
and holds it down in one place
therefore<00:04:49.809> intensifying<00:04:50.619> the<00:04:50.919> color<00:04:51.189> I<00:04:52.319> think

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
therefore intensifying the color I think

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.820 
therefore intensifying the color I think
that's<00:04:53.469> pretty<00:04:53.649> cool<00:04:54.029> and<00:04:55.259> I<00:04:56.259> think<00:04:56.619> that's

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
that's pretty cool and I think that's

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.869 
that's pretty cool and I think that's
what's<00:04:57.039> happening<00:04:57.429> I'm<00:04:57.669> not<00:04:57.909> sure<00:04:59.759> but<00:05:00.759> it

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
what's happening I'm not sure but it

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:09.239 
what's happening I'm not sure but it
looks<00:05:01.029> like<00:05:01.239> it<00:05:01.389> is

of<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.330> iridescent<00:06:12.870> medium<00:06:13.440> to<00:06:13.620> this<00:06:13.770> flower

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
of the iridescent medium to this flower

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.420 
of the iridescent medium to this flower
as<00:06:14.370> well<00:06:16.640> so<00:06:17.640> pretty<00:06:18.890> next<00:06:19.890> I'm<00:06:20.070> going<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.250> show

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
as well so pretty next I'm going to show

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.250 
as well so pretty next I'm going to show
you<00:06:20.460> how<00:06:20.730> I'm<00:06:20.910> preparing<00:06:21.540> some<00:06:21.750> of<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:21.930> metals

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
you how I'm preparing some of the metals

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.870 
you how I'm preparing some of the metals
that<00:06:22.410> I'm<00:06:22.530> going<00:06:22.650> to<00:06:22.680> use<00:06:22.740> on<00:06:23.040> the<00:06:23.130> project<00:06:23.580> I'm

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
that I'm going to use on the project I'm

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.930 
that I'm going to use on the project I'm
going<00:06:24.420> to<00:06:24.510> coat<00:06:24.780> the<00:06:25.050> metals<00:06:25.380> with<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:26.190> layer<00:06:26.910> of

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
going to coat the metals with a layer of

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.050 
going to coat the metals with a layer of
the<00:06:27.420> embossing<00:06:27.720> paste<00:06:28.200> and<00:06:28.650> then<00:06:29.430> I'm<00:06:29.700> going

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
the embossing paste and then I'm going

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.270 
the embossing paste and then I'm going
to<00:06:30.180> then<00:06:30.540> I'm<00:06:30.630> going<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.840> use<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.320> same

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
to then I'm going to use the same

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.190 
to then I'm going to use the same
Lindy's<00:06:33.590> to<00:06:34.590> paint<00:06:35.130> them<00:06:35.280> and<00:06:35.810> I<00:06:36.810> like<00:06:37.020> doing

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
Lindy's to paint them and I like doing

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.500 
Lindy's to paint them and I like doing
this<00:06:37.620> as<00:06:37.890> opposed<00:06:38.220> to<00:06:38.310> just<00:06:38.490> spraying<00:06:39.000> the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
this as opposed to just spraying the

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.930 
this as opposed to just spraying the
metal<00:06:39.900> straight<00:06:40.400> because<00:06:41.400> the<00:06:41.610> embossing

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
metal straight because the embossing

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.990 
metal straight because the embossing
powder<00:06:42.180> does<00:06:43.280> grip<00:06:44.280> on<00:06:44.460> like<00:06:44.640> I<00:06:44.700> said<00:06:44.880> before

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
powder does grip on like I said before

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.670 
powder does grip on like I said before
it<00:06:45.210> just<00:06:45.360> really<00:06:45.570> grips<00:06:45.870> onto<00:06:46.110> that<00:06:46.350> mica

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
it just really grips onto that mica

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.680 
it just really grips onto that mica
really<00:06:47.100> well<00:06:47.280> giving<00:06:48.090> you<00:06:48.180> a<00:06:48.210> nice<00:06:48.420> clean

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
really well giving you a nice clean

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.130 
really well giving you a nice clean
color<00:06:50.090> the<00:06:51.090> second<00:06:51.600> butterfly<00:06:51.900> that<00:06:52.080> I

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
color the second butterfly that I

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.650 
color the second butterfly that I
prepared<00:06:52.680> I<00:06:53.040> think<00:06:53.460> I<00:06:53.550> may<00:06:53.700> have<00:06:53.820> used<00:06:54.150> too

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
prepared I think I may have used too

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.380 
prepared I think I may have used too
much<00:06:54.900> of<00:06:55.110> the<00:06:55.200> embossing<00:06:55.530> paste<00:06:56.040> and<00:06:56.550> you'll

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
much of the embossing paste and you'll

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.690 
much of the embossing paste and you'll
see<00:06:57.720> the<00:06:57.990> final<00:06:58.350> result<00:06:58.680> it<00:06:58.920> looks<00:06:59.160> a<00:06:59.280> lot<00:06:59.460> more

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
see the final result it looks a lot more

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.180 
see the final result it looks a lot more
of<00:06:59.820> the<00:06:59.970> pearlescent<00:07:00.420> color<00:07:01.020> as<00:07:01.410> opposed<00:07:01.950> to

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
of the pearlescent color as opposed to

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.020 
of the pearlescent color as opposed to
the<00:07:03.410> color<00:07:04.410> of<00:07:04.530> the<00:07:04.620> mica<00:07:04.830> I'll<00:07:05.580> show<00:07:05.850> you<00:07:05.910> a

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
the color of the mica I'll show you a

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.420 
the color of the mica I'll show you a
quick<00:07:06.300> side<00:07:06.420> by<00:07:06.900> side<00:07:07.170> comparison<00:07:07.200> so<00:07:08.190> you<00:07:08.280> can

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
quick side by side comparison so you can

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.930 
quick side by side comparison so you can
see<00:07:08.580> what<00:07:08.730> I<00:07:08.760> mean
