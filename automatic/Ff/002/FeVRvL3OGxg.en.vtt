00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
this is just a quick video of my call

this is just a quick video of my call
called<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.530> tank<00:00:07.830> version<00:00:08.219> two<00:00:10.730> as<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.790> can<00:00:12.000> see

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
called a tank version two as you can see

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.169

them I think it's called on to are a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.980 
them I think it's called on to are a

silicon joiner

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.140 
silicon joiner
you<00:00:47.100> could<00:00:47.250> use<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.400> rubber<00:00:47.550> Jonah<00:00:47.850> doesn't

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
you could use a rubber Jonah doesn't

you could use a rubber Jonah doesn't
really<00:00:48.270> matter<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.750> opposite<00:00:49.080> me<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> Bob

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
really matter the opposite me to Bob

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
really matter the opposite me to Bob
oh<00:00:50.750> yeah<00:00:51.750> back<00:00:52.380> to<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.670> when<00:00:53.670> connecting<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
oh yeah back to this when connecting the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
oh yeah back to this when connecting the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
stop sensor adapter to the piping you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.210 
stop sensor adapter to the piping you
must<00:00:59.910> use<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.450> rubber<00:01:00.739> join<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
must use the rubber join because the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
must use the rubber join because the
silicone<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:03.829> stretch<00:01:04.829> over<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:06.020> fiber

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
silicone would stretch over a fiber

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.709 
silicone would stretch over a fiber
rubber<00:01:07.579> and<00:01:08.579> it<00:01:08.759> goes<00:01:08.909> from<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.299> silicon

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
rubber and it goes from this silicon

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:17.989 
rubber and it goes from this silicon
hose<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> 90<00:01:11.909> degree<00:01:12.179> Bend<00:01:13.880> down<00:01:15.439> until<00:01:16.999> the

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
hose to a 90 degree Bend down until the

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:22.279 
hose to a 90 degree Bend down until the
potshelter<00:01:18.509> light<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:20.899> originally<00:01:21.899> it

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
potshelter light there originally it

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.270 
potshelter light there originally it
used<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:23.389> straight<00:01:24.389> pipe<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:25.280> but

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
used to have a straight pipe here but

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.899 
used to have a straight pipe here but
the<00:01:27.030> bend<00:01:27.299> wasn't<00:01:27.719> like<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.460> proper<00:01:29.460> been<00:01:29.639> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the bend wasn't like a proper been so

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.489 
the bend wasn't like a proper been so
cause<00:01:30.179> turbulence<00:01:30.749> during<00:01:31.139> the<00:01:31.319> rev<00:01:31.469> range

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
cause turbulence during the rev range

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.480 
cause turbulence during the rev range
and<00:01:33.259> before<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.920> been<00:01:35.069> announced<00:01:35.280> for

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and before that has been announced for

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.959 
and before that has been announced for
it<00:01:35.670> before<00:01:36.079> but<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.289> just<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.819> created<00:01:38.819> an

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
it before but now I just like created an

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.219 
it before but now I just like created an
amount<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.950> made<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.039> stable<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.639> a<00:01:42.229> series

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
amount or made it stable with a series

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
amount or made it stable with a series
of<00:01:45.499> going<00:01:46.499> to<00:01:46.649> say<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.130> table<00:01:48.119> dies<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
of going to say it but table dies and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.620 
of going to say it but table dies and
then<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> could<00:01:50.189> join<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.729> five<00:01:50.969> six<00:01:51.179> cable<00:01:51.509> ties

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
then I could join up five six cable ties

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.859 
then I could join up five six cable ties
to<00:01:51.810> make<00:01:51.959> a<00:01:51.990> harness<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.709> so<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:54.359> you<00:01:54.630> can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
to make a harness for it so as you can

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.320 
to make a harness for it so as you can
see

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
see

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.720 
see
it's<00:01:57.230> not<00:01:57.590> gonna<00:01:57.740> go<00:01:57.890> anywhere<00:01:58.130> sites<00:01:58.520> it's

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
it's not gonna go anywhere sites it's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.230 
it's not gonna go anywhere sites it's
pretty<00:01:58.940> nice<00:02:01.540> altogether<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.720> intake<00:02:03.200> costs

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
pretty nice altogether this intake costs

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.870 
pretty nice altogether this intake costs
let's<00:02:05.240> see<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:07.430> piece<00:02:07.670> here<00:02:07.970> this<00:02:08.750> cost<00:02:09.020> $13

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
let's see this piece here this cost $13

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.310 
let's see this piece here this cost $13
this<00:02:10.880> cost<00:02:11.240> $20<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.400> cost<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.970> think<00:02:14.870> was

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
this cost $20 this one cost I think was

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.460 
this cost $20 this one cost I think was
$20<00:02:15.830> too<00:02:16.100> expensive<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.930> did<00:02:18.110> better<00:02:18.260> with

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
$20 too expensive so I did better with

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
$20 too expensive so I did better with
Robert<00:02:18.800> on<00:02:18.980> same<00:02:19.220> job<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.900> cost<00:02:22.870> this

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
Robert on same job and this cost this

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.210 
Robert on same job and this cost this
one<00:02:24.020> costs<00:02:24.260> two<00:02:24.350> semesters<00:02:24.800> one<00:02:24.950> because<00:02:25.130> this

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
one costs two semesters one because this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.420 
one costs two semesters one because this
is<00:02:25.340> polished<00:02:25.640> aluminium<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.960> it's<00:02:27.110> almost<00:02:27.430> $35

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
is polished aluminium so it's almost $35

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.990 
is polished aluminium so it's almost $35
a<00:02:28.520> day<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.870> pot<00:02:30.050> itself<00:02:30.350> was<00:02:30.620> $40<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.970> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.670 
high-end atop an increase of power due
to<00:02:57.440> less<00:02:57.770> restriction<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.140> the<00:03:00.140> torque<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.650> a

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
to less restriction and the torque is a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.610 
to less restriction and the torque is a
lot<00:03:00.860> more<00:03:01.100> noticeable<00:03:01.610> from<00:03:02.500> three<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.530> a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
lot more noticeable from three and a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.940 
lot more noticeable from three and a
half<00:03:03.770> grand<00:03:03.800> up<00:03:04.459> until<00:03:04.760> redline<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.770> note

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
half grand up until redline and the note

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.820 
half grand up until redline and the note
is<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:07.340> superb<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:09.620> yeah

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.970 

there<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:13.890> go

there you go
hope<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.160> enjoyed<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.550> it
