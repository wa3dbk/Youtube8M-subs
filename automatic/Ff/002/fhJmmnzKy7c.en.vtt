00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
this is a very interesting picture one

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.820 
this is a very interesting picture one
of<00:00:03.389> my<00:00:03.480> favorites<00:00:04.310> and<00:00:06.290> we're<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.529> apply

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
of my favorites and we're going to apply

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.900 
of my favorites and we're going to apply
the<00:00:07.919> white<00:00:08.189> again<00:00:08.490> as<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.570> did<00:00:09.719> before<00:00:10.910> cited

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the white again as we did before cited

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.629 
the white again as we did before cited
from<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.210> time<00:00:13.190> I'm<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.519> putting

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
from this time I'm going to be putting

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.359 
from this time I'm going to be putting
clouds<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.210> sky<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.830> white<00:00:16.830> needs<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.220> be

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
clouds in the sky that white needs to be

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.790 
clouds in the sky that white needs to be
in<00:00:17.550> really<00:00:18.510> solidly<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:22.140> I'm<00:00:22.320> making<00:00:22.769> sure

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
in really solidly and I'm making sure

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.990 
in really solidly and I'm making sure
with<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> double<00:00:23.609> healthy<00:00:24.590> that's<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.939> now<00:00:26.939> we

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
with a double healthy that's it now we

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.570 
with a double healthy that's it now we
are<00:00:27.300> adding<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.260> clouds<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.189> usual<00:00:29.369> way

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
are adding the clouds in the usual way

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.490 
are adding the clouds in the usual way
obviously<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> white<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.599> already<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
obviously the white is already on the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.260 
obviously the white is already on the
ball<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.189> need<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> add<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.700> blue<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
ball so now we need to add the blue and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.569 
ball so now we need to add the blue and
as<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:33.750> drawing<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:34.350> where<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> think

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
as you see I'm drawing out where I think

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
as you see I'm drawing out where I think
the<00:00:35.880> cloud<00:00:36.149> should<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.600> what's<00:00:37.230> change<00:00:37.500> her

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the cloud should be what's change her

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.200 
the cloud should be what's change her
mind<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.160> i'll<00:00:38.219> show<00:00:38.399> how<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.030> do

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
mind on that and i'll show how you do

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
mind on that and i'll show how you do
that<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> moment<00:00:39.770> that's<00:00:40.770> rubbed<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.309> well

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that in a moment that's rubbed in well

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000 
that in a moment that's rubbed in well
see<00:00:41.820> how<00:00:41.940> well<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> travels<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.829> does

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
see how well this travels it really does

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
see how well this travels it really does
work<00:00:44.660> but<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> haven't<00:00:46.079> got<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.230> white<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
work but you haven't got the white and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
work but you haven't got the white and
it's<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.670> strong<00:00:47.879> enough<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.450> won't<00:00:48.660> work<00:00:48.750> in

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it's not strong enough it won't work in

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.340 
it's not strong enough it won't work in
the<00:00:49.200> same<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:52.789> they<00:00:53.789> even<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.270> add<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.050> white

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the same way they even now add the white

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.270 
the same way they even now add the white
edges<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.399> make<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> clouds<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.239> realistic

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
edges to make the clouds more realistic

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
edges to make the clouds more realistic
but<00:00:59.280> what<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> point<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.809> where<00:01:01.079> I'd<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
but what a point here where I'd like to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.429 
but what a point here where I'd like to
put<00:01:02.190> some<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.019> area<00:01:04.260> I'm

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
put some you know that area I'm

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
put some you know that area I'm
indicating<00:01:05.010> I'd<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:05.909> more

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
indicating I'd like to put some more

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
indicating I'd like to put some more
cloud<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.320> i'm<00:01:07.439> doing<00:01:07.770> i'm<00:01:07.890> using<00:01:08.159> my

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
cloud in so what i'm doing i'm using my

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
cloud in so what i'm doing i'm using my
faber<00:01:08.670> castell<00:01:09.000> magic<00:01:09.330> rubber<00:01:09.540> again<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
faber castell magic rubber again and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.670 
faber castell magic rubber again and
taking<00:01:11.130> off<00:01:11.689> that<00:01:12.689> allows<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.650> some

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
taking off that allows me to put some

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.090 
taking off that allows me to put some
strong<00:01:14.159> white<00:01:14.400> back<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.330> look<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:15.900> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
strong white back in and look at that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.690 
strong white back in and look at that
isn't<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> magic<00:01:18.830> now<00:01:19.830> i'm<00:01:20.009> only<00:01:20.159> doing<00:01:20.340> small

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
isn't a magic now i'm only doing small

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
isn't a magic now i'm only doing small
sections<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.479> particular<00:01:21.960> version<00:01:22.049> if

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
sections of this particular version if

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.570 
sections of this particular version if
you<00:01:22.320> magnify<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:23.009> across<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> whole

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you magnify that across the whole

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.960 
you magnify that across the whole
picture<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> difference<00:01:26.520> between<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
picture we see a difference between the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
picture we see a difference between the
two<00:01:29.180> now<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.659> include<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.250> little

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
two now here we can include a little

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.020 
two now here we can include a little
tower<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.770> i<00:01:34.799> cleverly<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
tower and you see i cleverly put the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.109 
tower and you see i cleverly put the
bloom<00:01:36.240> behind<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.070> when<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.850> put

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
bloom behind it so that we when we put

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.060 
bloom behind it so that we when we put
the<00:01:39.210> white<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> show<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.530> if

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the white on it's going to show up if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
the white on it's going to show up if
I'd<00:01:41.280> had<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> white<00:01:41.759> cloud<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.420> wouldn't

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I'd had a white cloud there wouldn't

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.380 
I'd had a white cloud there wouldn't
have<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.259> effect<00:01:45.649> darkening<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
have the same effect darkening the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.600 
have the same effect darkening the
shadow<00:01:48.390> side

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.300 

but<00:01:53.240> no<00:01:53.360> little<00:01:53.660> bit<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:54.070> detail<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.100> there

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.870 

adding<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> darker<00:02:00.479> color<00:02:00.720> for<00:02:01.079> more<00:02:01.320> detail

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
adding a darker color for more detail

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.780 
adding a darker color for more detail
and<00:02:02.880> definition<00:02:04.070> now<00:02:05.070> i'm<00:02:05.220> using<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.610> wipe

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and definition now i'm using the wipe

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.719 
and definition now i'm using the wipe
over<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> top<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.290> darker<00:02:07.680> color<00:02:07.920> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
over the top of the darker color that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.070 
over the top of the darker color that
gives<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.979> more<00:02:10.979> attractive<00:02:11.690> less<00:02:12.690> hard

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
gives you a more attractive less hard

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.470 
gives you a more attractive less hard
shadow<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.760> again<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.209> repeat

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
shadow and you can again you can repeat

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.809 
shadow and you can again you can repeat
that<00:02:15.630> several<00:02:15.989> times<00:02:16.019> if<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.440> want<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:19.819> and

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
that several times if you want to and
