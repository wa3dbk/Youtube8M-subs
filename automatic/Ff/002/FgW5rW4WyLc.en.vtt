00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.280
 there are more layoffs 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.140
 that there are people I hope is very well 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.030
 greetings friends right good 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.410
 I'm here in the menu and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.210
 let's find what is a game 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.400
 quick good that this is going to be treated 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.810
 that I'm going to talk to you to begin 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 good people, I have to tell you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.280
 the gift the gift that left us 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.010
 for epic games for December 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.680
 that disabled us most of the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.360
 dedicated servers since I mean 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.390
 when they are dedicated servers that were 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.730
 this more than computers do not 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.910
 the software that served the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.550
 players in go 3 so there would not be 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.120
 both the and keep the games 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.500
 fast and equal 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.860
 and so much 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.430
 in Mexico USA as in any country 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.729
 tone is not but what happens people 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.850
 coincidentally casually abandons us 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.220
 epic games and well that of that 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.280
 I'm talking to you, check out there, nothing 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.130
 more they verified that I have a the one that the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 true I had never had this now 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.630
 well when you hit the walls by 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.690
 generally found to be that this 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.660
 video or that length is what the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.720
 it's really castrating or annoying because 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.149
 I kill myself ssl w address out there I know 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.040
 that has a greeting to the team ssl w by 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.130
 there but also some of them good 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.649
 this and this problem the truth is 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.570
 affecting it announced the truth what 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:47.540
 public of his facebook this case west 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.520
 of piper that is Ã¡lex fran reads the truth 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.890
 thanks to him who published it also 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.420
 I was aware of the truth of this I did not 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.950
 I had wanted to mention this and the truth 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.260
 because I thought that many were going to give 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.700
 accounts but good really I reasons 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.240
 for the comment he made on his 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.759
 facebook about what epic games had 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.090
 deactivated what were the servers 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.580
 dedicated in go 3 and well worth the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.320
 braying or the tone is that if the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.660
 I deactivate I just noticed 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.330
 I just gave a good account and well 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.130
 now we are adrift 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350
 done this video I 'm going to put tap ar 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.140
 3 adrift because we practically 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.630
 they arrived in a sea alone with our 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.060
 game and practically to us that 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.670
 we love so much go 3 or in my case to me that 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.070
 I love so much go 3 believe me that if it's a 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.270
 quite considerable blow good 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.910
 the truth I do not usually do 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.070
 gameplays and this kind of thing but then 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.650
 well they are always beautiful they are beautiful 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.080
 and as people I have nothing left but 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.720
 You can thank everyone for their 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.330
 attention they give me and the truth that 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.830
 always supporting the channel trust me is the 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.080
 I thank infinitely 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.240
 good without more or more I want people who 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.340
 because this would come to be everything I do not have left 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.700
 nothing more than the kids that ask 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.370
 they are and they are not in the school that therefore 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.170
 we have to give it to the whole school 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.240
 as we give it to all the xbox not people 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.240
 you go
