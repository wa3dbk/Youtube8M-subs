it<00:02:19.549> all<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.000> max<00:02:20.500> for<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.650> I'm<00:02:21.859> usage<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
it all to the max for the I'm usage and

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.550 
it all to the max for the I'm usage and
I<00:02:23.239> must<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:23.810> closed<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.109> off<00:02:24.260> using

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I must have closed it off using

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.380 
I must have closed it off using
something<00:02:25.099> called<00:02:25.310> task<00:02:25.670> killer<00:02:25.940> from<00:02:26.239> go

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
something called task killer from go

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.240 
something called task killer from go
watch<00:02:26.569> sure<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.680> kills<00:02:27.950> everything

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
watch sure that kills everything

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.130 
watch sure that kills everything
basically<00:02:29.120> except<00:02:29.480> for<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.690> main<00:02:29.840> running

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140

processors<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.640> guys<00:02:31.760> see<00:02:31.970> how<00:02:32.060> much<00:02:32.239> it

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
processors and you guys see how much it

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.800 
processors and you guys see how much it
changes<00:02:32.629> in<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.049> a<00:02:33.109> second<00:02:34.630> takes<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.690> few

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
changes in just a second takes a few

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.289 
changes in just a second takes a few
taps<00:02:38.889> and<00:02:39.889> give<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.549> a<00:02:40.639> second<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.180> it's

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
taps and give it a second it and it's

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.500 
taps and give it a second it and it's
going<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.510> change<00:02:41.720> up<00:02:42.230> everything<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:44.359> see

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
going to change up everything as you see

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.610 
going to change up everything as you see
now<00:02:44.599> everything<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:44.930> balanced<00:02:45.349> against

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
now everything is balanced against

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.770 
now everything is balanced against
nothing's<00:02:46.099> going<00:02:46.430> almost<00:02:46.910> not<00:02:47.299> flowing<00:02:47.569> too

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
nothing's going almost not flowing too

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:57.750 
nothing's going almost not flowing too
hard<00:02:47.959> now

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.979 

aside<00:02:58.760> from<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:59.000> keyboard<00:02:59.209> being<00:02:59.599> way<00:02:59.959> too
