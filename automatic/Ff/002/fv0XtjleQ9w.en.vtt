00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.070
Hello! I am glad to welcome you at my kitchen!

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.900
I don't know how for you, but my time flies very fast.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.730
We have not had time to finish eating frozen strawberries, and has already come a season of fresh strawberries.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.020
Thereby I have a surprise for you!

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.070
I prepared a series of strawberry recipes!

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.179
Follow the news!

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.829
My first recipe is a strawberry-banana smoothie.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.140
For this recipe we need:

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.000
250 g fresh strawberries, 1 medium banana,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.930
half a lemon or orange,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.280
1 cup yogurt, fermented baked milk or vanilla soymilk,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.240
1-2 tbsp of honey to sweeten our smoothies.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.520
Wash strawberries and place them in a cup or food processor.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.200
You can reserve 1-2 strawberries for garnish.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:12.800
Cut banana into chunks and add to strawberries.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.580
Done.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.210
Take a lemon.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.300
You can use lemon, lime or orange.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.540
Press a little bit.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.310
To make it more juicy.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.870
Cut widthwise in half.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.320
Immediately remove seeds.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.460
We don't need seeds in smoothies.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.510
Otherwise, it will be difficult to remove them.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.000
Squeeze out the juice.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.669
Add the honey.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.059
About 1-2 tbsp.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.169
The last ingredient is fermented baked milk.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:23.839
You can use yogurt or vanilla soymilk.

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.589
Take a blender.

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.199
I use the multifunctional blade.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:35.500
Blend on high speed about 1-2 minutes or until smooth.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.249
Done!

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:51.149
Set aside the blender.

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:59.889
Pour into glasses.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:17.000
Leave a little place for garnish.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.149
Take strawberry. Cut it a little bit, but not completely.

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:21.789
A little bit.

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:27.809
Garnish with whole strawberries.

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.989
Second.

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.899
You can garnish with a sprig of mint.

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:39.129
Place it on top.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.800
The smoothie is ready!

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.100
Now my chief taster will assess the smoothie!

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.120
- Choose a glass!

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.019
I'll take a smoothie with mint.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.739
With a whole strawberry I leave for our operator.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.519
Taste!

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.839
- Well, how?

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.139
- Delicious!

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.259
- What is it?

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.739
- Strawberries and banana.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.199
- Are you certain? Well done!

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.580
Bon appetit!

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.000
