00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:05.934
 This video tutorial will show you how to install or replace a shower pump. 

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:10.104
 For the purposes of this video we install the Niagara GrandDOS 1.5 Bar 

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:14.064
 Shower pump. The 1.5 bar connects to the output pressure pumped by the pump. 

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:18.504
 When you receive a pump it often comes with flexible hoses provided. This makes 

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:22.784
 Much easier installation. These are rubber washers, used for water delivery. 

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:26.574
 They are so important that you do not lose them. If we look closely we can see 

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:29.375
 Water supply entrance and rubber feet. This disperse 

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:33.345
 No vibration caused by the pump in operation. On the outlet of the pump there are two types 

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:35.155
 Pressure sensors. When 

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:38.735
 Low pressure due to showering sensors are activated pump activated. 

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:42.945
 Before doing any work to ensure that the insulated electric pump is pumped by switching it 

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:47.105
 Of pull and fuse. Remove the electric box cover and remove wire 

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:54.105
 Once you have ensured they are not living using a volt meter. 

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.215
 Turn off the hot and cold water supply to the pump. 

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.585
 Remove connections and pump water, make note of those that are inlet and 

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:12.695
 The socket. 

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:16.525
 Sometimes the water is still in the pipe so that the bucket or towel is handy to pick up any drip. 

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:21.785
 Remove the old pump. 

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.255
 Fortunately the new pump is the same model so not much change in 

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:27.295
 Pipe required. 

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:31.015
 Use a rubber washer available to make waterproof ring. Washing machine with gauze filter guarantee 

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:33.055
 On the entrance. 

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:36.295
 This protects the pump from any debris in the water. 

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:43.295
 Tighten all joints down running water supply. Check for a leak. 

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:48.695
 Now remove the electric cover of the new pump. 

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:52.545
 Thread your wire through the rubber washer nut, and cover before connecting the wires. 

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:57.175
 Determine which wires go in and use the small terminal 

00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:59.074
 Screwdriver 

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:00.894
 Tighten them in place. 

00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:03.005
 Now replace your electric cover. 

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.005
 It is often the time to try to cleanse your system and air before you run the pump. 

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:09.685
 Do this by opening your shower valve. 

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:15.084
 Turn on the electricity and test the process pump using the bathroom. 

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:16.865
