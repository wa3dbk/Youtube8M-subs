almond milk yeah that was important part

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.660

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
milk for this you could use soy if you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.820 
milk for this you could use soy if you
wanted<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.000> would<00:03:12.300> not<00:03:12.660> use<00:03:13.019> coconut<00:03:13.500> because

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
then you get the coconut flavor in it

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.500 
then you get the coconut flavor in it
even<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.350> it's<00:03:16.500> unsweetened<00:03:17.209> sunsweet<00:03:18.209> its

even if it's unsweetened sunsweet its

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:27.640 
even if it's unsweetened sunsweet its
dominance

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.350 

so<00:03:28.650> there's<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.040> consistency<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.910> now

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
so there's the consistency of it now

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.570 
so there's the consistency of it now
looks<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.800> now<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:31.950> looks<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.220> little<00:03:32.370> like

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
looks like now it looks a little like
