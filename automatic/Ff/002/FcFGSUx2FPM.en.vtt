00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:18.680
 viola says plastic under spinnaker and does 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.449
 approximately 260 miles from Cape Verde 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:27.000
 wallonia all a rent and big girls 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.220
 and shoots the beautiful sun in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.109
 life gav is everyone is showing 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 not the same enthusiasm as the skipper 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.219
 Italian, a thousand miles further south 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.370
 the leading group has just gone through hell 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.170
 the pot-au-noir and the height of the sold globe 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 five competitors found themselves at sight 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.870
 regatting in a handkerchief from to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 hardly 1 me 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 g 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:07.400
 train boats like that never happened 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.490
 last night was leading with 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.050
 aggravating in every way I start 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.700
 to see the end of the tunnel 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.369
 then in the spring something that 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.720
 could look like dally dally soon 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.040
 first competitors went through a 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.750
 pot-au-noir very wide and 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.180
 particularly virulent this year 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.869
 but with over 26,000 ahead of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.570
 his pursuers 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:35.060
 Armel Le ClÃ©ac'h was the first to get 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:41.920
 extract and reality of the south is so for 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.920
 the best he proposed 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.480
 the way is now free for the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.120
 leader of the sold globe that should 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.820
 cross in the lead Wednesday morning the line 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.150
 symbolic of the equator between the two 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.150
 hemispheres
