00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.580
Hello everyone!

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.460
Jaystepher with Orangutan's Banana Tree by Lego Friends.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.880
Set number 41045.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.080
Contains 37 pieces.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.360
Recommended building ages are 5 through 12.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.740
So it looks like we get an awesome orangutan.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.740
He is hanging off his banana tree.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.460
The set is packaged in a polybag.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.940
This is Series 5.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.140
Let's take a look inside the package.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.020
There is one bag of elements

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.860
and one folded instruction manual.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.740
Let's have a closer look.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.460
The first thing we're going to notice is the orangutan.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.620
His facial features are printed on.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.160
He does have a bow attached to his back.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.120
That can be removed.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.100
I'm not sure why he has a bow on his back.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.900
He is sitting on part of the tree.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.700
Nice bright green leaf elements.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.400
Have some stud-flowers on the ground.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.740
Here we have a little banana.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.700
The orangutan can be removed.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.020
He can even hang from the vine.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.680
It is one nice finished off polybag set.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.620
There are a few extra pieces.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.840
One stud,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.500
one stud-flower,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500
an extra bow,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.260
and a green whip that is used for another vine.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.300
These pieces may come in handy for other Lego creations.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.660
This concludes the review for Orangutan's Banana Tree

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.320
