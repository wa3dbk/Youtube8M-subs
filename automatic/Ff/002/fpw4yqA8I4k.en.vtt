00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.280
 those who care about jailbreak 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 untethered by ios 7 i advise you not 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.920
 update as you see in this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.489
 case i the 5 seeds iphone 5 s not it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.080
 update for now I keep it ios 7.0.3 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.750
 which is a secure firmware for the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
 jailbreak I will update my iphone 5 that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.460
 so much if then we should find out that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.920
 this new 7.0 point 4 is a further 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 obstacle to the jailbreak at least I will have the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.930
 5 which will be at 7.0.3 then recapping 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.150
 not updated unless I myself 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
 say that this firmware is safe for the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.369
 jailbreak how am I going to find out why 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.860
 musk a hacker who is a member of 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.049
 others as well as the most famous team of the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.390
 jailbreak and the world is analyzing 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.670
 this new firmware within a few hours 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.630
 will tell you if it is safe to update 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.490
 or not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.110
 so if you are a fan of the jailbreak e 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.729
 so you don't want to miss the chance to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.090
 untethered ios jailbreak 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.880
 7 which will happen in a few months is a question 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.890
 a month for now not updated 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.780
 subscribe to my follow me channel 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.969
 because a few hours after this video 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.909
 I will load another in which precisely of rho 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.399
 the fates if this new firmware blocks 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.290
 the jailbreak or not anyway if not 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.360
 you are interested in the jailbreak even if this 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.489
 firmware then will not have proved a 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.560
 danger for jailbreak continue with 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.000
 update then press on 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.890
 download and install 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 accepted the terms and conditions of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.940
 license and the download will start 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.670
 really very fast as it weighs the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.330
 upgrade package weighs only 17 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.160
 about megabytes so expect the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.870
 download and finish course I did 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.250
 cuts have speeded up the part is 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.430
 obvious that it also depends on yours 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 connection 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.060
 and once finished you will have to accept again 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.220
 the terms and conditions for 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.990
 install it so there will be a quick 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.600
 update verification process 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.190
 same and once the latter is finished 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.440
 process your device 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.970
 it will restart automatically of course 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.340
 has actually speeded up the part there 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.710
 will put a little more and few 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.540
 seconds later appear that this 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.120
 apple logo with the black bar of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.010
 loading will be really very fast 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.780
 to fill up anyway even here I did 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.190
 different cuts 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.140
 once the black coffin will be 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.870
 completely filled your iphone 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.300
 ipod touch and ipad will restart again 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.490
 once the logo will appear again 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.680
 apple with still this black bar of 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.360
 loading but it will be very much 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.940
 faster than the first one will load 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.160
 almost instantly and you will arrive 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.290
 in less than no time to tell the lock screen 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.660
 and you will have done the update indeed 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.750
 by going to general settings 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:35.580
 info as you can see we are on the new one 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.020
 version of ios 7.0 point 4 11 b 554 a 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.480
 you guys repeat that if you hold on to 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.920
 jailbreak not updated immediately to ios 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.200
 7.0 point 4 but wait for the judgment of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.960
 musclenerd if friday should say 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.970
 that this 7.0 point 4 does not interfere 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.880
 in no way and does not mean a 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.460
 jailbreak obstacle updated if 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.870
 instead you don't care about the jailbreak 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.940
 you can update immediately and 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.550
 quietly if instead musclenerd 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.950
 should notify that this firmware 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.450
 interferes creates problems with the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.820
 jailbreak that you see if they are 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.290
