00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.500
 hello you love there again and I have 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.360
 today I have a banana pie and 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.429
 for that you need this creme here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.830
 he can see there and of course one 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.289
 You need soil and cream for the cream 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.609
 whipped cream and two such vanilla 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.350
 yoghurt cup was going on 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.240
 easiest if it's going very fast 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.189
 should take here simply his blow 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 the tax makes one with the pudding 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.340
 and then you have your cream then 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.230
 you just need a coup 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 either buy him and he makes them 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.030
 myself I already have a lot of videos 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.170
 where i need the cleaners so i need 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.219
 do not show it again 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 but of course we can do it too 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.239
 buy it if it is really quite 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
 go fast 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.820
 if I only have the in-laws 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.789
 have quickly registered for coffee 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:58.739
 or or you can call him ahaus 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.280
 Just bake that always makes a lot 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.350
 better my impression lasts too 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.360
 countries so now you just have to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.979
 Distribute cream on the floor and I 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.600
 should have a bigger spoon live 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:20.810
 as so it takes a long time but well 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:25.200
 we do have all the time as simple as 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.540
 Distribute on it is very important 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.810
 that she is beautiful at the cream 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.490
 Stiff but not rolled over that 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.490
 Looks like a boat smells like that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.790
 but I believe that everyone 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.890
 that's somehow done 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.420
 it just has to increase 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.420
 to him and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.799
 so I'm done just everywhere 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:14.220
 because that does not feel good when the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:19.670
 cream is not everywhere so much 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.840
 scrape the outside of the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.570
 from a measuring cup I do 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.930
 something always equal to a measuring cup is there 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.540
 very lazy something like that understood my once 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:38.989
 you can read it 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.989
 equal in there do so in the corners 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.220
 finished so now it's time to prove and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.310
 Although with banner on the name says you 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.060
 already as easy as the banana slices 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.060
 drauflegen 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.700
 So I would if I am the bananas 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.370
 have cut equal to quickly 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.290
 put on it and then big with pies 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.870
 pull over so they do not start 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.830
 somehow getting brown because that looks 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.830
 then not bad 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.540
 so I 'm doing this fast now 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.540
 finished 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.360
 Yes 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.370
 So you can bananas so synonymous 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.439
 long ago cut those are the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.819
 pieces larger there goes the whole lot 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:06.599
 faster but I wanted to do so 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.599
 Do you already take it ? 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.990
 really the smallest of the 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.830
 smallest pieces therefore undertook it 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.390
 really if you like that a bit 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.590
 oblique cuts as for example 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.090
 is cutting or being 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.630
 naturally larger in length 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.630
 then goes on quickly 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.570
 you can of course also 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.550
 once here other fruits and 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.520
 Make fruit with ryan 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.710
 that livens up the whole a bit though 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.720
 I wanted the big one now 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.720
 make variant of the band-hurts 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.720
 now I'm missing something was now fast times 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.720
 what to cut 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.250
 Now I can finally get you ready 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:39.130
 finished now I 'm just so up 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.330
 the packaging is always just the one 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.340
 Only take it the best 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.070
 not to cook for the 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.039
 kettle then just with sugar 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.900
 So why stand on it to touch 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.780
 cook and then quickly 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:04.360
 distribute on your cake before firmly so 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:06.070
 that you can take care now fast 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.530
 when cooking that he does not clump but 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.599
 that actually happens at the 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.169
 cooking a little so it happens 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.669
 actually only with the water cook 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:19.479
 I believe but only if you have it 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:21.210
 no exercise but before the trouble 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:26.770
 cake 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:32.889
 Well, what do I cook or cook? 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:34.240
 I prefer to distribute the topos everywhere 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.740
 and see that I do not blister 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.740
 they'll make you look pretty, too 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:48.039
 Also nice in the corners so if you want that 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.050
 keep it up very quickly 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:52.180
 bananas really nice yellow color and 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.800
 I start to get brown which one yes 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.409
 I think I want to avoid that too 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.130
 looks nice if you are the one 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:59.130
 the pie is 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.300
 It would be great if you were great 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.310
 wants to let 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.650
 but since I still have some of the cream 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.190
 I 'm just doing it that way 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:16.210
 spotted on it because it saves then afterwards 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.210
 the tooth 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.530
 So if the cream is with you 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.170
 has for bottom and thick on it 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.610
 then you can still do 

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.230
 put cream on the table 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:46.520
 then everyone can feel free 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:49.670
 do it on it does that now 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.450
 quickly finished and that was my banana 

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:55.730
 I hope it was very nice again 

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.890
 informative and helpful and you have 

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:02.330
 then a lot of fun baking 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:06.790
 hopefully bake and yes we see 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.790
 bye next time bye
