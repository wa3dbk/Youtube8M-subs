variety of characters and sledding
apurate<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> problem<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.630> most<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
apurate but the problem is that most of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
apurate but the problem is that most of
this<00:01:25.140> stuff<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> locked<00:01:25.920> from<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> onset<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this stuff is locked from the onset you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
this stuff is locked from the onset you
have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> play<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> single-player<00:01:28.380> mode<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
have to play the single-player mode to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
have to play the single-player mode to
open<00:01:29.189> things<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.610> multiplayer<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
open things up for multiplayer and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.380 
open things up for multiplayer and
that's<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.530> less<00:01:31.710> enjoyable<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.729> course

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that's a lot less enjoyable of course

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.719 
that's a lot less enjoyable of course
the<00:01:33.630> reason<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.250> game<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the reason for that is the game just

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.919 
the reason for that is the game just
isn't<00:01:35.939> good

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.569 

they're<00:01:42.929> only<00:01:43.049> 11<00:01:43.560> courses<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> entire

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
they're only 11 courses in the entire

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.039 
they're only 11 courses in the entire

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
game and the single-player mode

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.319 
game and the single-player mode
essentially<00:01:46.590> has<00:01:46.859> you<00:01:47.009> replay<00:01:47.520> them<00:01:47.759> over<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
essentially has you replay them over and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.719 
essentially has you replay them over and
over<00:01:48.450> even<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> racing<00:01:50.069> were<00:01:50.189> phenomenal

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
having so few levels to play doesn't

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.700 
having so few levels to play doesn't
make<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.579> very<00:01:53.789> enticing<00:01:54.240> add<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.350> fact<00:01:55.619> that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
make it very enticing add the fact that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.459 
make it very enticing add the fact that
they<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.069> feel<00:01:56.310> similar<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.119> well<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.319> game

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
they all feel similar and well the game

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.340 
they all feel similar and well the game
ends<00:01:58.679> up<00:01:58.890> being<00:01:59.069> more<00:01:59.450> painstaking<00:02:00.450> than<00:02:00.810> sled

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
ends up being more painstaking than sled

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.520 
ends up being more painstaking than sled
