00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.759 

there<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.820> no<00:00:43.269> hard<00:00:44.140> evidence<00:00:44.379> that

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
there is no hard evidence that

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.729 
there is no hard evidence that
stretching<00:00:45.399> before<00:00:45.789> your<00:00:45.969> workout<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.739> going

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
stretching before your workout is going

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.880 
stretching before your workout is going
to<00:00:47.890> prevent<00:00:48.129> any<00:00:48.339> injuries<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.800> a

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
to prevent any injuries and it's a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.560 
to prevent any injuries and it's a
really<00:00:51.100> good<00:00:51.249> idea<00:00:51.339> to<00:00:51.609> stretch<00:00:51.879> after<00:00:52.089> you're

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
really good idea to stretch after you're

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.049 
really good idea to stretch after you're
running<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.739> I<00:00:53.769> like<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.249> idea<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.609> doing<00:00:54.969> your

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
running so I like the idea of doing your

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.849 
running so I like the idea of doing your
yoga<00:00:55.210> after<00:00:55.899> your<00:00:56.079> running<00:00:56.409> because<00:00:56.620> you'll

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
yoga after your running because you'll

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:57.989 
yoga after your running because you'll
be<00:00:56.890> able<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.159> stretch<00:00:57.370> out<00:00:57.519> all<00:00:57.670> your<00:00:57.789> muscles

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
be able to stretch out all your muscles

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.779 
be able to stretch out all your muscles
after<00:00:58.629> your<00:00:58.780> run<00:00:59.129> and<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.280> really<00:01:00.550> don't<00:01:00.670> think

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
after your run and I really don't think

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.360 
after your run and I really don't think
there's<00:01:01.089> any<00:01:01.479> reason<00:01:02.079> why<00:01:02.260> you<00:01:02.319> can't<00:01:02.499> do<00:01:02.949> your

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
there's any reason why you can't do your

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.730 
there's any reason why you can't do your
yoga<00:01:03.579> on<00:01:03.999> the<00:01:04.780> same<00:01:05.019> day<00:01:05.260> as<00:01:05.409> you're<00:01:05.590> running

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
yoga on the same day as you're running

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.430 
yoga on the same day as you're running
unless<00:01:06.430> you've<00:01:06.670> completely<00:01:07.570> exhausted

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
unless you've completely exhausted

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.880 
unless you've completely exhausted
yourself<00:01:08.890> from<00:01:09.130> your<00:01:09.250> run<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.960> case<00:01:11.290> you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
yourself from your run in which case you

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.010 
yourself from your run in which case you
know<00:01:12.010> it<00:01:12.280> might<00:01:12.490> be<00:01:12.700> too<00:01:12.940> much<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:13.510> do<00:01:13.810> your

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
know it might be too much to do your

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.920 
know it might be too much to do your
yoga<00:01:14.170> as<00:01:14.500> well<00:01:14.800> although<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.540> need<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.810> do

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
yoga as well although you need to do

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.900 
yoga as well although you need to do
some<00:01:17.200> kind<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.500> stretching<00:01:18.040> after<00:01:18.430> you're

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
some kind of stretching after you're

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.500 
some kind of stretching after you're
running<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.290> would<00:01:21.040> think<00:01:21.070> that<00:01:21.510> you're

running so I would think that you're

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.780

gonna<00:01:22.630> need<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.900> do<00:01:23.200> some<00:01:24.100> yoga<00:01:24.250> or<00:01:24.460> some

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
gonna need to do some yoga or some

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.530
