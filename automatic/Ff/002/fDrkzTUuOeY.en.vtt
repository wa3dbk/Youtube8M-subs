00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.388
Wash: Alright, Doc. I want to ask you a few questions.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.400
Doc: Where'd the Red guys go?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.000
Did they get away?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.840
Wash: Quite! I'm asking you the questions.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.960
You're not asking me.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.000
Doc: What kind of questions?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.840
Washington: Hey, I just said no questions!

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.000
Doc: Can I ask questions later?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Wash: DOC!!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.720
Doc: What?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.470
Oh that's a question, sorry.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.970
Go ahead.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.514
Wash: You know what.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.000
Get him out of there,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.050
I can't talk to him like this.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.060
Meta: *Growls*

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.500
Doc: What are you-

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Stop it!

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Wash: What?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.280
Well, try pulling harder then.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Grab lower near the center of gravity.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.620
Try the codpiece. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.900
Meta: *Angry growl*

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.740
Wash: Oh...We're all adults here!

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.100
Meta: *Growls*

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.000
Wash: No, I don't want to try!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Doc: Don't repress your feelings.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.050
Wash: I can't interrogate him like this, it's ridiculous!

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.239
I can't believe I have to deal with this!

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.000
What are we gonna do?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.500
*Metallic clang*

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.800
*Metal rope uncoils*

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.000
*Crash*

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.629
Wash: Hmm...That might work.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.040
Sarge: Seems like all the kicking and blowing up put some life back in the little guy!

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.360
That's adorable.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.900
Grif: Why are all of his blue parts green?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.000
Caboose: I don't know.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.000
Delta: Caboose? Is that you?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.800
Caboose: Delta?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.920
Delta: Caboose, I need you to listen. My time is brief.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.660
Epsilon is not in control right now.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.500
But he will be again and shortly.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.000
Caboose: Great!

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.100
Delta: Perhaps not.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.600
The encounter with, Agent Washington has charred loose many of his memory's.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.841
Epsilon has not, historically. Coped with these memories well.

00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:31.300
Grif: What does that mean?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.780
Delta: We fear he may pursue certain memories in particular.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.499
Grif: Who's we?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.320
Delta: Myself and the other memories of the Alpha Fragments.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.000
Grif: What the fuck is that?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.135
Who the fuck are you?

00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:41.811
And what the fuck is happening?

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.189
Delta: Epsilon may not yet be aware of our presence.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.259
But eventually he will be. We cannot hide forever. It is likely at this point,

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.640
he will begin the cycle again. That must not happen

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.519
Caboose: What cycle?

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.019
*Gasp*

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.840
A motorcycle?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.280
A Secret motorcycle?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.659
It's and ok you can tell me.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.009
Delta: He's begun to search memories now. He's clearly looking for something.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.100
Well, you always did say "memory is the key".

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.820
Delta: Memory is the key Caboose.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.889
But not everything that is locked is meant to be unlocked.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.960
He is coming back now.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.060
I must leave before he discovers me.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.980
Caboose: But if he beats you in there then you could be friends.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.210
Well not best freinds.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.249
But you know cause that job's taken.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.900
But you know...maybe acquaintances.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.670
Delta: If only I were the memory that he's looking for.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.858
Church: What?

00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:27.490
Uh....oh?

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.600
Hey.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.279
I must have uh...

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.620
Must have passed out.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.927
Sorry about that.

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:35.120
Caboose: Church! You're back!

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.309
Church: Yeah, I am

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.500
Hey, Caboose. Come over here would you? I need to talk to about something.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500
Caboose: Okay?

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.290
Where are we going?

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.020
Simmons: Hey guys do you ever notice blue team has like, a lot more stuff going on than us?

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.660
Sarge: Yeah, boring stuff.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.640
Grif: Nerdy stuff.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.400
Simmons: Yeah, but I mean all we ever talk about is food and guns.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.959
Grif: That reminds me.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:53.759
I'm hungry.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.100
Sarge: Stop complaining or i'll shoot you in the head!

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.220
Simmons: *Sigh*

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.660
Good times.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.300
Tucker: Stay away! Don't touch me!

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.070
Church: Hey...uh Caboose? You were the one who moved me from the Epsilon unit to this new body, right?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.340
Caboose: Oh, yeah.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.717
I'm really good at ergonomics.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.400
Chruch: Uh...?

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.080
Do you mean...

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.395
Electronics?

00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:13.460
Caboose: Yeah, probably

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.880
Church: Okay good. Then I need you to come with me

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.100
I just remembered something. Something that could help me.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.600
Caboose: Sure!

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.480
You don't...

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.400
Wanna know the details?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.100
Caboose: Nope

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.400
Church: Could be dangerous.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.200
Caboose: Yeah...

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.180
I Have armor..

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.000
It's blue.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Church: All right. Well. Let's go then.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.260
I actually thought it would take longer to convince you.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.760
C'mon

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.000
I want to get to the facility before nightfall.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.700
Caboose: Uh, you want to bring the Epsilon unit?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.140
Chruch: Is it necessary to...

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.104
Do your thing?

00:03:37.104 --> 00:03:37.604
Caboose: Don't think so.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.100
Chruch: Then who cares?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.200
Leave it.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.700
Where we're going...

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.600
We won't need it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.600
Doc: Um?....Are you sure this is a good idea!?

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.160
Wash: Alright, give it a crank!

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.600
*Boot up noise*

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.200
Wash: More Power!

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.900
C'mon, Give it some gas!

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.400
Almost there!

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.100
Just a little more!

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.924
*Thud*

00:04:05.924 --> 00:04:06.424
Doc: Ow!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.769
Wash: Well...That's just great.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:20.380
