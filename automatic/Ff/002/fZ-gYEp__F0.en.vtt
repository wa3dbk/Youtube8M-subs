different<00:03:21.760> than<00:03:22.000> my<00:03:22.180> t3<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:23.139> feels<00:03:23.410> really

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
different than my t3 this feels really

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.190 
different than my t3 this feels really
really<00:03:24.549> better<00:03:24.880> in<00:03:25.030> my<00:03:25.120> hands<00:03:25.480> just<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:25.750> this

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
really better in my hands just for this

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.660 
really better in my hands just for this
first<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.709> know<00:03:26.829> you<00:03:26.889> holding<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.489> for

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
first you know you holding this for

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.970 
first you know you holding this for
about<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:27.940> few<00:03:28.540> seconds<00:03:29.019> this<00:03:29.470> feels<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.920> much

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
about a few seconds this feels so much

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.250 
about a few seconds this feels so much
better<00:03:30.280> than<00:03:30.459> holding<00:03:30.700> my<00:03:30.880> t3<00:03:31.329> but<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.810> mean<00:03:32.230> I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
better than holding my t3 but I mean I

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.690 
better than holding my t3 but I mean I
guess<00:03:32.410> that's<00:03:32.560> expected<00:03:33.130> because<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:33.670> a

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
guess that's expected because this is a

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.819 
guess that's expected because this is a
kind<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.150> expensive<00:03:34.599> camera<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.620> more

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
kind of expensive camera it is more

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.920 
kind of expensive camera it is more
higher-end<00:03:36.340> but<00:03:36.670> go<00:03:37.450> ahead<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.660> wrap<00:03:37.900> this

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
higher-end but go ahead and wrap this

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.330 
higher-end but go ahead and wrap this
