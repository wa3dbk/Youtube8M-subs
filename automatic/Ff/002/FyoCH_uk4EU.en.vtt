00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
how do I spray my Peachtree is the

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.019 
how do I spray my Peachtree is the
question<00:00:04.740> that<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.009> lot<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.220> people<00:00:05.609> asked<00:00:06.000> me

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
question that a lot of people asked me

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.210 
question that a lot of people asked me
this<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:07.020> Richard<00:00:07.379> Skinner<00:00:07.620> at<00:00:07.799> Hawkins

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
this is Richard Skinner at Hawkins

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.790 
this is Richard Skinner at Hawkins
corner<00:00:08.460> nursery<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:09.480> Plant<00:00:09.690> City<00:00:10.050> Florida<00:00:10.200> and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
corner nursery in Plant City Florida and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.980 
corner nursery in Plant City Florida and
yes<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:11.969> fruit<00:00:12.300> peach<00:00:12.900> trees<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.500> Florida

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
yes we have fruit peach trees in Florida

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.660 
yes we have fruit peach trees in Florida
how<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.230> spray<00:00:16.500> them<00:00:16.740> well<00:00:17.039> first<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.640> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
how do we spray them well first of all I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.429 
how do we spray them well first of all I
have<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> say<00:00:18.029> why<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.690> spray<00:00:18.990> them<00:00:19.199> when

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
have to say why do you spray them when

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.920 
have to say why do you spray them when
you<00:00:19.500> spray<00:00:19.770> them<00:00:19.830> for<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.130> reasons<00:00:20.580> one<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
you spray them for two reasons one the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.050 
you spray them for two reasons one the
obvious<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.560> insects<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.609> other<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.029> that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
obvious is insects the other one that

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.480 
obvious is insects the other one that
people<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
people like don't think about it all and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.330 
people like don't think about it all and
that<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.150> spraying<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.779> fungi<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.529> so

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
that is spraying for fungi and so

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.550 
that is spraying for fungi and so
there's<00:00:29.699> two<00:00:29.910> different<00:00:30.300> types<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.109> spray

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
there's two different types of spray

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.490 
there's two different types of spray
let's<00:00:32.369> cover<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> insect<00:00:33.149> first<00:00:33.510> insects

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
let's cover the insect first insects

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920 
let's cover the insect first insects
generally<00:00:35.190> speaking<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.660> bugs

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
generally speaking are the little bugs

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.090 
generally speaking are the little bugs
who<00:00:37.320> come<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.219> lay<00:00:38.370> eggs<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> bloom

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
who come and lay eggs in the bloom

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
who come and lay eggs in the bloom
sometimes<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.340> penetrate<00:00:41.940> you'll<00:00:42.480> have

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
sometimes they penetrate you'll have

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.389 
sometimes they penetrate you'll have
another<00:00:43.020> type<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.590> insect<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.129> will

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
another type of an insect that will

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.150 
another type of an insect that will
penetrate<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.239> limb<00:00:45.510> itself<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.860> want<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
penetrate the limb itself so we want to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.540 
penetrate the limb itself so we want to
use<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> pesticide<00:00:48.530> if<00:00:49.530> we're<00:00:49.770> spraying<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
use a pesticide if we're spraying in the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.260 
use a pesticide if we're spraying in the
bloom<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.539> keep<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.610> insect<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:53.760> laying<00:00:54.000> his

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
bloom to keep the insect from laying his

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.779 
bloom to keep the insect from laying his
eggs<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.289> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> use<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> pesticidal

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
eggs there we want to use a pesticidal

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.400 
eggs there we want to use a pesticidal
soap<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.719> perhaps<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.410> very<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:58.949> mild

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
soap or perhaps a very very mild

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.090 
soap or perhaps a very very mild
concentration<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:02.180> malathion<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.660> water<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
concentration of malathion and water and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
concentration of malathion and water and
spray<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.939> over<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.450> bloom<00:01:06.720> that'll

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
spray it all over your bloom that'll

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.000 
spray it all over your bloom that'll
usually<00:01:07.740> keep<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.340> away<00:01:09.140> spraying<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
usually keep that away spraying for the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.719 
usually keep that away spraying for the
insects<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.790> would<00:01:12.049> penetrate<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.470> bark<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
insects that would penetrate the bark it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
insects that would penetrate the bark it
has<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> little<00:01:15.689> stronger<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> do

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
has to be a little stronger and you do

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
has to be a little stronger and you do
that<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.280> different<00:01:17.640> time<00:01:17.909> if

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that at a little different time if

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.249 
that at a little different time if
you're<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.229> having<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> problem<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.580> bark

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
you're not having that problem with bark

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
you're not having that problem with bark
losing<00:01:22.259> sap<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.430> chance<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> pretty

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
losing sap out then chance is pretty

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.340 
losing sap out then chance is pretty
good<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.720> any<00:01:24.900> insects

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
good you don't have any insects

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
good you don't have any insects
penetrating<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.100> bark<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> don't<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
penetrating your bark so I don't have to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
penetrating your bark so I don't have to
worry<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.140> other<00:01:28.290> thing<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
worry about it the other thing is is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.649 
worry about it the other thing is is
that<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:31.110> aware<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.740> fungus

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
that we want to be aware that fungus

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
that we want to be aware that fungus
comes<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.840> many<00:01:33.990> different<00:01:34.229> categories<00:01:35.100> but

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
comes in many different categories but

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.929 
comes in many different categories but
there's<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.299> couple<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.400> fungicidal<00:01:38.400> sprays

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
there's a couple of fungicidal sprays

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.450 
there's a couple of fungicidal sprays
that<00:01:39.270> work<00:01:39.540> real<00:01:39.930> real<00:01:40.140> good<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.650> peach<00:01:41.070> trees

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that work real real good on peach trees

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.560 
that work real real good on peach trees
one<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.420> liquid<00:01:43.140> copper<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:44.240> dry<00:01:45.240> flowable

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
one is liquid copper or dry flowable

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.940 
one is liquid copper or dry flowable
copper<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:48.000> diet<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:49.020> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
copper the other one is a diet thing you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
copper the other one is a diet thing you
can<00:01:50.130> even<00:01:50.310> use<00:01:50.610> those<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.090> combination<00:01:51.360> other

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
can even use those in combination other

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.660 
can even use those in combination other
words<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> mix<00:01:52.590> them<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.220> spray

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
words you can mix them in the same spray

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
words you can mix them in the same spray
if<00:01:53.880> you've<00:01:54.030> got<00:01:54.270> two<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.600> three<00:01:54.799> fungicidal

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
if you've got two or three fungicidal

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.789 
if you've got two or three fungicidal
problems<00:01:56.659> fungicidal<00:01:57.659> problems<00:01:58.259> would<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.619> in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
problems fungicidal problems would be in

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.160 
problems fungicidal problems would be in
your<00:01:58.979> root<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> root<00:01:59.579> rot<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.719> other<00:02:00.899> would

your root and root rot the other would

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.620 
your root and root rot the other would
be<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.430> forming<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> your<00:02:03.180> leaves<00:02:03.420> you
