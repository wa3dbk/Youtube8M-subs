00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
perfect brake job you know as complex as

perfect brake job you know as complex as
cars<00:00:09.090> seem<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.750> these<00:00:09.929> days<00:00:10.200> they're

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
cars seem to be these days they're

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.950 
cars seem to be these days they're
actually<00:00:11.099> pretty<00:00:11.250> simple<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:12.269> all<00:00:12.450> boils<00:00:12.870> down

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
actually pretty simple it all boils down

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.740 
actually pretty simple it all boils down
to<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.799> pedal<00:00:14.160> makes<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.490> go<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.210> other<00:00:15.420> pedal

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
to one pedal makes it go the other pedal

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.840 
to one pedal makes it go the other pedal
makes<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.230> stop<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> they're<00:00:16.890> both<00:00:17.160> equally

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
makes it stop and they're both equally

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.970 
makes it stop and they're both equally
important<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.840> problem<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.590> seems<00:00:19.619> like

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
important the problem is it seems like

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.740 
important the problem is it seems like
more<00:00:20.189> people<00:00:20.580> know<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.910> make<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> go

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
more people know how to make it go

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.890 
more people know how to make it go
faster<00:00:22.199> than<00:00:22.920> stop<00:00:23.340> faster<00:00:23.880> that's<00:00:24.539> what

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
faster than stop faster that's what

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.830 
faster than stop faster that's what
we're<00:00:25.019> gonna<00:00:25.109> change<00:00:25.580> now<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.970> lot<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.660> know

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
we're gonna change now a lot of you know

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.109 
we're gonna change now a lot of you know
that<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.130> change<00:00:29.400> your<00:00:29.580> fluid<00:00:29.970> from

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that you have to change your fluid from

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
that you have to change your fluid from
time<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.420> time<00:00:30.449> purge<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.199> system<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
time to time purge the system the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.100 
time to time purge the system the
question<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
question is when do you do it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.720 
question is when do you do it
this<00:00:34.680> isn't<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.160> something<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> look<00:00:35.610> at

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
this isn't just something you to look at

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.979 
this isn't just something you to look at
the<00:00:35.790> fluid<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> say<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.390> dirty<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.840> time

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the fluid and say it's dirty it's time

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.830 
the fluid and say it's dirty it's time
to<00:00:37.079> change<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.700> where<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:39.450> brake

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to change it that is where these brake

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
to change it that is where these brake
strips<00:00:40.230> come<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.309> these<00:00:41.489> measure<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
strips come in because these measure the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.420 
strips come in because these measure the
amount<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> copper<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.379> fluid<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
amount of copper in the fluid and the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.970 
amount of copper in the fluid and the
copper<00:00:44.850> level<00:00:45.120> goes<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:46.350> corrosion

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
copper level goes up as your corrosion

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
copper level goes up as your corrosion
increases<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> high<00:00:48.329> levels<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.780> copper<00:00:48.989> can

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
increases and high levels of copper can

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
increases and high levels of copper can
damage<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.950> expensive<00:00:50.430> ABS<00:00:50.850> systems<00:00:51.329> in

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
damage your expensive ABS systems in

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.080 
damage your expensive ABS systems in
your<00:00:51.629> newer<00:00:51.809> vehicles<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.710> copper<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
your newer vehicles so copper is not a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
your newer vehicles so copper is not a
good<00:00:54.329> thing<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:55.440> test<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
good thing to test all you have to do is

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
good thing to test all you have to do is
dip<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> strip<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> fluid<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> wait

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
dip the strip into the fluid and wait

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.670 
dip the strip into the fluid and wait
for<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> change<00:00:59.460> color<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:01.050> darker<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
for it to change color the darker the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680 
for it to change color the darker the
purple<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> gets<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:02.940> copper<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> got

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
purple it gets the more copper you got

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.320 
purple it gets the more copper you got
in<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.840> fluid<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.970> time

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
in your fluid as you can see it's time

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
in your fluid as you can see it's time
to<00:01:06.479> flush<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.020> system<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:07.950> new

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to flush this system and put in some new

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.609 
to flush this system and put in some new
fluid

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
fluid

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.399

now<00:01:10.429> I<00:01:10.460> know<00:01:10.759> some<00:01:11.179> of<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.359> are<00:01:11.390> thinking<00:01:11.659> wait

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
now I know some of you are thinking wait

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.410 
now I know some of you are thinking wait
a<00:01:12.500> minute<00:01:12.920> since<00:01:13.429> when<00:01:13.729> do<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:13.939> have<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.210> change

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
a minute since when do I have to change

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.240 
a minute since when do I have to change
my<00:01:14.600> brake<00:01:14.869> fluid<00:01:15.229> all<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.439> time<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:16.009> what's

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
my brake fluid all the time and what's

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.649 
my brake fluid all the time and what's
all<00:01:16.399> this<00:01:16.490> about<00:01:16.549> copper<00:01:17.149> I've<00:01:17.270> never<00:01:17.420> heard

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
all this about copper I've never heard

well unfortunately a lot of people don't

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.240 
well unfortunately a lot of people don't
realize<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.109> the<00:01:21.439> brake<00:01:21.679> fluid<00:01:22.039> in<00:01:22.130> your
