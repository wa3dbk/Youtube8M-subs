00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello friends of font this from youtube here 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.160
 once again I bring you another video 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.660
 tutorial and well the day of them 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.700
 I bring a new touch until I have the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.710
 gum completely free on the network 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.990
 power big box in which what we 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.420
 allows this tweet is to disable what 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 is the notifications that are not sent by 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.830
 users or friends to our 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.590
 device if you remember makes a couple of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.650
 days the letter is a story in which 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.779
 we believe that it is going to launch 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.109
 in the next update of the six 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 to a new button in the settings in the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.430
 which will allow us to activate for 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 to not receive any kind of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.390
 notifications to the device 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.760
 well, a lazy developer 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 has done what is this tweet and good 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 Well here I bring it to you for 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.239
 let them see how it works once you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.090
 have it activated we were just 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.050
 we are going to go to what is to the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.870
 settings 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.090
 and below the airplane they will be able to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.129
 find a new button available that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.250
 it's called do not disturb if we 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.409
 we activate this option and send us a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.690
 text message as proof we will not 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.790
 I just sent it to me but I did not 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.180
 no type of notification appears 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.460
 what is on the device and this this 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 happens because I have activated the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.210
 option not to disturb so that nobody 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610
 bother at home I was sleeping then 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.369
 I have a work conference 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.560
 Etc. anything with this application 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.270
 active we will not get any kind of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.039
 notifications and for which it is not going to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.979
 bother now well if we 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.360
 we deactivate this option and send us 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.070
 again another little message 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.160
 let's try we'll be able to see what 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.390
 we will come out with banners in 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.390
 the part where the clock is 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.620
 and well let's see what comes to us 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.290
 message 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.600
 Well, there it is, yes we activate 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.100
 the option will not come back to us 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.860
 which is the banner as always has not 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.200
 come out and well then if we go to what 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.240
 is the text message application 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.580
 we can appreciate to see the messages that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.200
 they have come from friends or from me 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.030

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.710
