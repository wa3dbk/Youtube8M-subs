00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.040 
down the stick is where that pivots
going<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.460> be<00:01:49.580> your<00:01:50.270> other<00:01:50.390> fingers<00:01:50.810> wrap

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
going to be your other fingers wrap

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.660 
going to be your other fingers wrap
around<00:01:51.410> and<00:01:51.530> they<00:01:51.620> become<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.010> muscle<00:01:52.340> behind

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
around and they become the muscle behind

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.450 
around and they become the muscle behind
that<00:01:52.820> movement<00:01:53.300> okay<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:54.500> if<00:01:54.710> your<00:01:54.860> forefinger

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
that movement okay so if your forefinger

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.640 
that movement okay so if your forefinger
and<00:01:55.490> your<00:01:55.640> thumb<00:01:55.729> are<00:01:56.180> merely<00:01:56.930> your<00:01:57.229> pivot

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
and your thumb are merely your pivot

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.740 
and your thumb are merely your pivot

learn is the buzz stroke the buzz stroke
is<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.580> foundation<00:04:55.360> for<00:04:55.539> all<00:04:55.599> the<00:04:55.900> roles<00:04:56.169> that

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
is the foundation for all the roles that

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.619 
is the foundation for all the roles that
you<00:04:56.530> hear<00:04:56.979> in<00:04:57.129> Scottish<00:04:57.580> drumming<00:04:57.970> sometimes

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
you hear in Scottish drumming sometimes

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.629 
you hear in Scottish drumming sometimes
in<00:04:58.870> American<00:04:59.710> drumming<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:00.129> other<00:05:00.250> drumming

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
in American drumming and other drumming

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.790 
in American drumming and other drumming
you're<00:05:01.030> going<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.240> hear<00:05:01.509> a<00:05:01.539> lot<00:05:01.810> of<00:05:01.960> open<00:05:02.530> rolls

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
you're going to hear a lot of open rolls

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.610 
you're going to hear a lot of open rolls
which<00:05:02.979> means<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.370> can<00:05:03.520> usually<00:05:03.639> hear

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
which means that you can usually hear

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.010 
which means that you can usually hear
the<00:05:05.620> individual<00:05:06.280> notes<00:05:06.699> when<00:05:07.690> they're<00:05:07.840> doing

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
the individual notes when they're doing

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.080 
the individual notes when they're doing
the<00:05:08.199> roll<00:05:08.909> okay

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
the roll okay

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.080 
the roll okay
in<00:05:10.150> Scottish<00:05:11.110> drumming<00:05:11.740> they're<00:05:12.430> all<00:05:12.610> buzz

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
in Scottish drumming they're all buzz

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.490 
in Scottish drumming they're all buzz
rolls<00:05:13.539> which<00:05:13.870> means<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.229> they're<00:05:14.349> not

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
rolls which means that they're not

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.890 
rolls which means that they're not
letting<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.009> stick<00:05:15.310> bounce<00:05:15.610> like<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.240> we're

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
letting the stick bounce like that we're

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.409 
letting the stick bounce like that we're
more<00:05:17.199> kind<00:05:17.500> of<00:05:17.669> keeping<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.729> at<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.090> surface

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
more kind of keeping it at the surface

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.080 
more kind of keeping it at the surface
so<00:05:20.880> sounds<00:05:21.880> more<00:05:22.000> like<00:05:22.030> a<00:05:22.180> buzz<00:05:22.539> than<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.500> bounce

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
so sounds more like a buzz than a bounce

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:31.170 
so sounds more like a buzz than a bounce
buzz<00:05:25.090> buzz<00:05:25.569> buzz<00:05:26.259> buzz<00:05:28.319> now<00:05:29.319> you<00:05:29.380> do<00:05:29.590> that<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:30.180> do

buzz buzz buzz buzz now you do that I do

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.020 
buzz buzz buzz buzz now you do that I do
it<00:05:31.539> by<00:05:31.740> gripping<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.979> stick<00:05:33.220> just<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.550> little

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
it by gripping the stick just a little

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.300 
it by gripping the stick just a little
more<00:05:34.389> gently<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.199> putting<00:05:35.770> a<00:05:35.830> little<00:05:35.979> bit<00:05:36.190> of

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
more gently and putting a little bit of

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.700 
more gently and putting a little bit of
back<00:05:36.520> pressure<00:05:36.880> on<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.479> stick<00:05:37.780> that<00:05:38.440> way<00:05:38.590> it's

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
back pressure on the stick that way it's

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.279 
back pressure on the stick that way it's
not<00:05:38.830> bouncing<00:05:39.340> up<00:05:39.460> freely<00:05:40.030> but<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.020> put<00:05:41.259> a

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
not bouncing up freely but I put a

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.439 
not bouncing up freely but I put a
little<00:05:41.440> bit<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:41.710> back<00:05:41.889> pressure<00:05:42.060> so<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.210> stays

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
little bit of back pressure so it stays

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.529 
little bit of back pressure so it stays
near<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.900> head<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:45.190> bounces<00:05:45.849> very<00:05:46.120> quickly

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
near the head and bounces very quickly

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.330 
near the head and bounces very quickly
honestly<00:05:47.199> you<00:05:47.319> can't<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:48.039> can't<00:05:48.250> you
