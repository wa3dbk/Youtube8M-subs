00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.759
 television more also more than ever 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 a frequent cause of visit to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.429
 dermatologist are dilated pores or 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.349
 the open pores we can see more a lot 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.030
 more in the face of the face for example 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.289
 the forehead to the nose the cheeks that in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.449
 other parts but what are the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.029
 factors that cause it what is the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 treatment here is our 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.150
 dearest doctor who is an expert the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.920
 another one from mathó logo javier welcome very 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.960
 glad to be here with you and as 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.420
 well you mention it is one of the 10 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 most frequent causes of consultation given 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.050
 that 80 percent of Mexicans 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 by genetic predisposition 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 we have the pole open then many 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.079
 Sometimes it is not due to lack of hygiene that the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 most people start to wash the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.739
 face 34 times a day to see if you're 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 they close the leathers and that is a mistake 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.969
 because by skin defense mechanism 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.489
 begins to produce more 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.530
 tallow and opens more per güey then what 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.750
 maximum that should be washed is in the morning 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 and at night nothing more old exception 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 is all pores open or not if 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.290
 they also give him anticipating not yes because to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.080
 children from almost everyone 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.090
 he has them closed from the side 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.920
 with the development of the characters 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.300
 secondary sexes the appearance of 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.970
 acne and the development of the gland 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.650
 sebaceous begins to dilate the pore already 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.900
 from this stage if we do not take care of it 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.430
 because with the course of life he leaves 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.370
 expanding further and that's why there are people 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.550
 that at 35 or 40 years it looks almost like 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.650
 if they were open scars or that 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.050
 they live very open and they are dilating 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.970
 too much the poor one is forming as 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.620
 a scar on all the walls and 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.780
 then what even from a distance 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.220
 they come to see where it is most frequent as 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.770
 well I mentioned it is what is the routine 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.110
 correct to look for a formula so that 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.010
 open in a moment at night breathe 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.160
 your skin and wrinkles are closed again 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.380
 at the time it clears let's say 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.390
 it can be with a hot steam with 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.400
 certain exfoliants if they dilate 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.080
 slightly the pore at that time but 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.160
 it's a matter of seconds and then it 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.190
 closes again to make it more 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.290
 closed that at the beginning the substances 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.200
 what we use most is glycolic acid 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.160
 salicylic acid 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.260
 mainly and after some 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.210
 alpha hydroxy acids that can be made in 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.100
 superficial peeling or how are we 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.990
 seeing in the images these forums 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.180
 open impurities also accumulate 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.520
 you get to see the black dots inside 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.630
 of open chlorine and obviously this 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.610
 what is doing that is dilating 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.560
 more than you can advise at the level 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.660
 domestic for the ladies that are us 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.940
 seeing in their house the lords do not know 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.770
 the people who can spend little for 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.930
 to be able to have a formula and take care of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.970
 skin and that the pores are closed 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.170
 the best would be as I mentioned it is going 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.570
 to see his face in the morning and the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.120
 night can occupy an exfoliating a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.910
 light brush containing acid 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.430
 glycolic or salicylic acid because the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.900
 neutral soap not because here the soap 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.160
 neutral is for when they do not have any 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.410
 nothing more problem for cleaning 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.240
 but if you want to correct some 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.640
 effect then already in the pharmacy 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.560
 there are many brands that have acid 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.290
 salicylic that has nothing to do with 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.680
 with aspirin because there are people 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.680
 what do you want 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.989
 what do you do falls does not have anything 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.060
 see this is acetylsalicylic acid 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.280
 this is salicylic acid only 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.859
 then the formulas already contain it 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.420
 some gels and some soaps are 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.930
 can do with that their cleaning in the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.430
 night and with this is going to help them to 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.650
 no moisturizing cream nothing if not 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.359
 you have very open hair generally 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.010
 it's because they have more oily skin than 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.170
 normal so if they have more fat 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.030
 you have to use gels solutions in 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.099
 place of creams because the creams have 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.290
 fat waste that can go 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.909
 accumulating in the program and doing this 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.299
 with the long that is opening more 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:44.000
 Hey, how are you now these wipes 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.579
 wet ones that have already taken all 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.829
 marks to cleanse the face some 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.470
 they even put you as they have included 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.510
 there the anti-aging agent so that what 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.430
 maquillas well as you know your 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.650
 skin and I do not know what is good for you, they do not work or not 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.760
 completely not served has been a good 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.680
 tool because many of the 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.000
 people did not wash their faces in the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.200
 night in all good and at least 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 wipe it with the wipe 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.129
 make-up remover the pp that some 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.770
 percentage some active principle is a 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.870
 good alternative yes no 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.600
 and have skin too fat because it 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.000
 ideal is to clean it with the towel 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.890
 make-up remover and wash face 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.080
 and then put on some of the 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.990
 gels that we were talking about not 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.250
 use doctor who do not use creams do not use 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.680
 a merchant is because most 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.790
 people in this city think that by being 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.830
 a dry environment despite being the skin 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.410
 greasy they get even more cream 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.750
 then you should not use more creams 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.790
 moisturizing lotions or gels and from time to time 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.440
 when once every six months 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.480
 the sunscreen is also not true 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.540
 put on every day, not if the 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.920
 sunscreen in the morning should be 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.020
 applied daily however there 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.750
 low-fat solar screens that 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.000
 they have to have are matificantes 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.730
 including that they take away part of the brightness 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.740
 and they help you protect your skin and not 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.000
 the dust is opened some mask 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.600
 homemade of those that we like so much 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.160
 doctor really help and help us 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.260
 as to extract removing the excess 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.730
 of fat but does not really close the forum 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.530
 If we already want to close the town in your 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.580
 belly are also office that 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.340
 thank you very much with once every six 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.350
 months once a year is enough to 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.389
 to do with some other machine like see 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.550
 more roller or some procedures that 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.740
 they help as it is a scar variant 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.900
 that this scar will react and 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.090
 go closing then if they are like 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.979
 as treatments with peelings but in 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.660
 the office that with another mission or with 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.949
 once a year many times it is 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.960
 Enough to extract 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.760
 we return that the face is the main 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.110
 place where this pores note 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.120
 open there is another place in the body 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.520
 where someone also reaches you 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.800
 consult with problems of whether you can 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.229
 to be dilated especially in arms like this 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.450
 bubbles and around the knees without 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.130
 But it is much less common and the 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.020
 leading in the face by the kind of 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.720
 gland that as I mentioned 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.800
 we inherit in this anatomical area and it 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.930
 they are mainly distributed 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.240
 at all times and as saying the 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.280
 processing of the pumps equal and 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.530
 then the exact face with peels with 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.510
 some special presidents with laser 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.250
 for example that is already an exfoliation a 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.110
 little bit more rough link is passed in all 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.610
 the skin is very red that day at 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.860
 next day he puts the dark coffee 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.870
 bold and goes climbing during a 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.490
 week that is causing it to regenerate 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.010
 the skin is great 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.080
 especially the pee and not explain that 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.550
 procedure yes 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.620
 currently not that it has also 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.689
 been like computers like everything has 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.520
 gone evolving was much more expensive 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.409
 it could be ten years ago that in the 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.699
 now then if it's worth it 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.949
 come with your specialist 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.250
 great thank you doctor what a pleasure to see you
