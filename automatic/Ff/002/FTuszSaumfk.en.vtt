00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello everyone welcome again today 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.730
 let's talk about the baby shower and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.590
 I'm going to give you some ideas so that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 improve your baby shower party and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.730
 They know that you can organize our 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.200
 best friend our mother or if we want 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.930
 doing it ourselves can also be done 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.900
 so first of all let's talk about 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.720
 the mass and our little table we are going to 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.030
 decorate with a white tablecloth over 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.020
 tablecloth for the cake and let the cake 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.059
 to send our group with the 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.100
 colors of yes we already know if it's child or 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.850
 girl with the colors we want and the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.730
 theme that we are going to choose 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:58.309
 you must also have a relative sleep 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.309
 at the time of maximum 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.760
 I know what the 2002 around are 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.310
 from the card 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.380
 that those can be hedges that we 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 we are going to buy solids and we are going to 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.060
 fill with a few taps until the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.520
 half let's make the monkeys all 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.560
 the credits and also the bears for 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.360
 alternate credit landmarks 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.710
 also more sweet settlers and in their 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.710
 I count under your monitor 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.980
 the teaspoons of normal plastics and 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.560
 the design we go in a leaf that does not 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:09.270
 the design that we want that 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.270
 it may be the reason 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.820
 this 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.200
 and we're going after we have the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.200
 design we make several 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.239
 repeat of the design we hope chosen not 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.569
 we're going to go on cardboard and we 're going to 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.079
 cut all these balls that we're going 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.079
 to paste 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.220
 and personality can also be done 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.690
 in forks and knives in what 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 let's use and according to what 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.570
 let's offer it in food or in desserts 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.570

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.890
