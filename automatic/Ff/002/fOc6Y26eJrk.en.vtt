going to be using this dry because this

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.860 
going to be using this dry because this

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
is going to be in the crease and since

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.229 
is going to be in the crease and since
this<00:04:14.020> isn't<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.440> flat<00:04:14.680> brush<00:04:14.950> this<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.370> my<00:04:15.490> 217

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
this isn't a flat brush this is my 217

this isn't a flat brush this is my 217
just<00:04:16.900> be<00:04:17.049> swirling<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.830> it<00:04:17.920> is<00:04:17.950> already

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
still wet on my lid so it will still

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.270 
still wet on my lid so it will still
pick<00:04:21.310> up<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.580> lot<00:04:21.730> of<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:21.970> intensity<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:23.950> I<00:04:23.980> go

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
pick up a lot of that intensity so I go

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.420 
pick up a lot of that intensity so I go
like<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.790> I<00:04:25.750> bless<00:04:26.020> them<00:04:26.230> off<00:04:26.430> we're

like that and I bless them off we're

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.770 
like that and I bless them off we're
just<00:04:27.490> going<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.700> work<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.090> into<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.480> crease

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
just going to work this into the crease

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.900 
just going to work this into the crease
like<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.170> would<00:04:29.350> with<00:04:29.530> any<00:04:29.710> other<00:04:29.830> shadow<00:04:30.310> I'm

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
like you would with any other shadow I'm

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.460 
like you would with any other shadow I'm
going<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.180> go<00:04:31.270> all<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.540> way<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:35.080> like

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
going to go all the way and just like

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.950 
going to go all the way and just like
that<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.730> smoke<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.210> out<00:04:37.300> as<00:04:37.510> much<00:04:37.660> as<00:04:37.870> you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
that you can smoke it out as much as you

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
that you can smoke it out as much as you
want

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.720 

just<00:04:46.580> kind<00:04:46.760> of<00:04:46.820> touch<00:04:47.030> up<00:04:47.270> with<00:04:47.450> your<00:04:47.600> finger

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
just kind of touch up with your finger

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.280 
just kind of touch up with your finger
and<00:04:51.850> just<00:04:52.850> like<00:04:53.060> that<00:04:53.090> it's<00:04:53.750> really<00:04:53.930> easy<00:04:54.170> to

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
and just like that it's really easy to

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.840 
and just like that it's really easy to
create<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.620> shape<00:04:54.860> if<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.220> have<00:04:55.400> a<00:04:55.430> crease

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
create a shape if you have a crease

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.700 
create a shape if you have a crease
brush<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.240> just<00:04:56.390> go<00:04:56.510> boo<00:04:56.690> boo<00:04:56.720> boo<00:04:57.080> boo<00:04:57.110> and

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
brush you just go boo boo boo boo and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.270 
brush you just go boo boo boo boo and
you<00:04:57.980> don't<00:04:58.100> even<00:04:58.280> need<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.640> water<00:04:58.820> or<00:04:59.090> anything

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
you don't even need to water or anything

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.950 
you don't even need to water or anything
so<00:05:01.280> there's<00:05:01.610> really<00:05:01.820> not<00:05:02.060> much<00:05:02.330> skill

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
so there's really not much skill

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.060 
so there's really not much skill
involved<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:05.720> looks<00:05:05.870> like<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.230> I'm<00:05:06.770> not

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
involved so it looks like that I'm not

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.380 
involved so it looks like that I'm not
going<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.280> be<00:05:07.340> applying<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.730> highlight<00:05:08.120> but<00:05:08.270> you

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
going to be applying a highlight but you

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.330 
going to be applying a highlight but you
can<00:05:08.630> apply<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.930> highlight<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.680> would<00:05:10.070> recommend

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
can apply a highlight I would recommend

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.280 
can apply a highlight I would recommend
a<00:05:10.760> matte<00:05:11.060> highlight<00:05:11.450> because<00:05:11.630> this<00:05:11.930> is<00:05:12.080> kind

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290

dramatic or night or smokey look but I

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.690 
dramatic or night or smokey look but I
really<00:05:45.500> like<00:05:45.650> the<00:05:45.740> way<00:05:45.770> that<00:05:45.980> this<00:05:46.100> looks<00:05:46.400> and

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
really like the way that this looks and

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.670 
really like the way that this looks and
I'm<00:05:46.790> just<00:05:46.910> going<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.090> take<00:05:47.240> it<00:05:47.300> underneath<00:05:47.780> the

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.800 

first<00:05:51.680> half<00:05:53.350> of<00:05:54.350> your<00:05:54.410> under<00:05:54.860> eye<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:56.690> it's

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
first half of your under eye and it's

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.240 
first half of your under eye and it's
great<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.050> apply<00:05:57.350> this<00:05:57.410> wet<00:05:57.830> because<00:05:58.100> it

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
great to apply this wet because it

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.670 
great to apply this wet because it
really<00:05:58.460> gives<00:05:58.640> you<00:05:58.760> a<00:05:58.850> nice<00:05:59.470> straight<00:06:00.470> line

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
really gives you a nice straight line

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.470 
really gives you a nice straight line
you<00:06:00.920> can<00:06:01.130> use<00:06:01.310> a<00:06:01.340> liner<00:06:01.610> brush<00:06:01.880> for<00:06:02.150> this<00:06:02.210> but

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
you can use a liner brush for this but

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.000 
you can use a liner brush for this but
since<00:06:02.600> this<00:06:02.780> was<00:06:02.990> already<00:06:03.320> dirty<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.710> just

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
since this was already dirty I just

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.340 
since this was already dirty I just
figured<00:06:04.310> I'd<00:06:04.400> use<00:06:04.430> it<00:06:04.610> again<00:06:05.000> then<00:06:05.930> after<00:06:06.200> we

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
figured I'd use it again then after we

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.560 
figured I'd use it again then after we
