00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.730
 hey i'm the martin the motorcycle 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.340
 again second generation has finally 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.019
 Found again and we will be happy 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.740
 whole first in a short 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.969
 first impression a little closer so 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 if you get that, that is 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.189
 a package quite normal a few 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 Information like I have the 80 gb 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.880
 variant as said the smartphone is 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 this year has come out , so to speak 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.590
 the successor of the motor also fits the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 199 euros and at the specification has 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.410
 Not much done but only look 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.950
 Let's see what happens differently here 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.469
 to mix with film and like the motorola 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.770
 usual for the price is no charger 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.110
 only instructions and information 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.989
 to guarantee what already one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 Pack I can do this once here 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.649
 pretty if I can do it up here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 place 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.770
 and there the smartphone is normal with 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.949
 a slide comes a little bit better 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.219
 So the mission looks like so 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.080
 For the first time, the device will be on the 4.5 inch display 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 get now a five inch big 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.869
 display continues to be a 720p resolution 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.040
 inside is still a snapdragon 400 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.130
 and as far as I know it's a gigabyte 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.659
 Memory has been design-technical 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.939
 Do not have a lot of money like you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.909
 you see on the back we have an led 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.439
 a camera that dissolves now better than 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.640
 The foil camera is more suitable 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.119
 is now 8 megapixel front camera 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.579
 with 2 megapixels and what's new 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.100
 are the two speakers then has 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.409
 you can hear wonderful stereoklangs as well 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.820
 in the first impression already very well over 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.930
 came up here you have that again 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.390
 second microphone for noise reduction 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.250
 and the 35 millimeter jack connection 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.140
 one side normal here the two 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.590
 once an off switch and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.070
 Volume down louder and down here 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.439
 is the micro micro-usb so many times 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.240
 then I had one too 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.860
 little something done in the inner life 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.500
 so to speak, support it now 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.270
 two sim cards two micro sim cards 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.619
 also the german version has just that 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.569
 possibility of two sim cards umag 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190
 Suppliers say I want to talk about the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.240
 an inter 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.670
 have connections and over the other 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.920
 phone or sms write and what 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.920
 is still brand new is one 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.040
 micro sd card connection that is so 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.100
 you can get your micro sd card 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.950
 wrap up what the previous version 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.740
 did not work so we have to 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.180
 and make us look like it looks 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.380
 I've had it on before that is 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.730
 there are also ex premier on it 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.810
 but now in the reason you have seen 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.980
 not much was done 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.020
 also not the screen resolution 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.680
 720p after so far in very good 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.210
 impression the display too and we will 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.320
 us now that gets the day again 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.460
 look a little closer and then 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.520
 see again a test of us but 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.150
 first so far the first impression just 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.800
 from the second generation motogp 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.930
 if you still have questions about the motogp 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.250
 like that in the comments 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.700

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.410
