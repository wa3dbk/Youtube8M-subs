00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 hello to all of you guys and here we are at 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.269
 explanation first of all of the mixture 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.750
 the American also said the rhythm 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.539
 shuffle is practically begins 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.729
 precisely and with the maximum service per 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.589
 keep the cards squared then 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.869
 allow a better success of the 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.690
 mixture subsequently won the 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.350
 bunch with medium ring finger e 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.079
 pinkie 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.269
 in this way on the upper part e 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.280
 one inch on the bottom 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.320
 then what needs to be done 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.929
 you have to go for a light exercise 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.720
 pressure through the index and leave 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.330
 drop a portion of cards 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.539
 as you see on the opposite hand always 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.729
 precisely between medium cancel and little finger 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.740
 later you have to go with 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.100
 little finger in this way to take 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.049
 so the cards in this way and 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.429
 always apply light pressure 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.250
 with the index then we repeat we have the 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.630
 thumb sliding cards thanks 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.610
 precisely at the pressure of the index 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.100
 while the mouse above is stapled with these 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.140
 three fingers and precisely later 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.820
 when we slide cards they must 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 fall precisely on the other side of the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.380
 hand in the same position 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.049
 at this point we have reached this point 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.130
 apply slight pressure with 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.509
 the index of both hands and yes 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.950
 in this way they drop the cards 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.320
 one after the other 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.909
 I prefer to do it just by doing them 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.799
 fall off the edge and then put them 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.959
 straight because it is more comfortable for me 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.789
 let them fall while for example 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.630
 someone also does it by dropping it 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.000
 the cards from the center 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.690
 but I prefer the other way 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.130
 as predicted and a shrewdness when yes 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.050
 they have the cards so it may be that not 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.640
 they are well squared and therefore for 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.160
 the note on squares can be given 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.630
 of such taps while 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 then let them leave 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.860
 fall into simple accounts because one 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.600
 once the cards are this way 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.240
 one above the other just right 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.080
 repression on the sides of the cards and it 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.880
 precisely that they will go from one to the other 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.420
 here is the boy tutorial instead 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.230
 of the swing kant a cap that this much 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.710
 simple that can be done precisely with 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 easiness 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.150
 to do this you must always start with the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.490
 deck in the service position in this 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.110
 so then taken by all the cards in 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.460
 so as to square the movement 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.260
 therefore allow the best result 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.520
 of the cut as well as for the mixture 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.780
 American 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.020
 then you have to go to 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.270
 take the deck in the same way as 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.860
 just as it was necessary to take it for 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.540
 run the American only that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.720
 this time the index instead of executing 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.150
 a certain pressure on March there 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720
 it will help to break a portion 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.470
 mass in this way you see here 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.350
 remastered in this way with 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.030
 the index that will go just to unplug 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.830
 with a slight pressure laterally 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.140
 a part of humanity that will come precisely 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.600
 taken this way in the other hand 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.440
 then we repeat then we have the deck 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.120
 and in this position 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.130
 taken in this position with enchantment 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.620
 which will occupy not doing this 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.700
 operation must exercise a certain 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.560
 pressure here and then to disconnect the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.410
 bunch that will then be taken 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.330
 in the other hand obviously the swing act 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.760
 it can be either of this type but also 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.680
 a little longer like this detaching 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.390
 just more and more little bucks e 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.160
 the operation is rather simple therefore 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.470
 because you just have to deliver a certain one 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.090
 pressure at the beginning you will see that maybe 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.190
 this happens to me among the non-cards 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.280
 they will be more squared but with a bit of 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.870
 training and it will be quite simple 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.260
 make a cut of this type that is 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.260
 a basic cut indeed
