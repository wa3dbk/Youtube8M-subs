get used to I did the hang of it and
probably<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.619> main<00:01:15.860> reason<00:01:15.890> I<00:01:16.280> did<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.550> was

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
probably the main reason I did it was

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.790 
probably the main reason I did it was
because<00:01:16.960> when<00:01:17.960> my<00:01:18.080> brother<00:01:18.289> was<00:01:18.320> nice<00:01:18.500> cause<00:01:18.740> I

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
because when my brother was nice cause I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.380 
because when my brother was nice cause I
was<00:01:18.890> in<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.100> seventh<00:01:19.610> grade<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:20.030> go<00:01:20.179> to<00:01:20.210> his

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
was in the seventh grade and I go to his

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.999 
was in the seventh grade and I go to his
knees<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:20.599> see<00:01:20.899> like<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.410> he<00:01:21.679> was<00:01:21.770> having<00:01:21.979> a

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.800 
knees and see like that he was having a
good<00:01:22.160> time<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:22.910> think<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.450> would<00:01:23.539> be<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.660> lot

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810
