origami<00:00:16.510> so<00:00:16.930> let's<00:00:17.860> begin<00:00:18.460> I'm<00:00:19.000> using<00:00:19.270> a

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
origami so let's begin I'm using a

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.350 
origami so let's begin I'm using a
square<00:00:19.720> sheet<00:00:19.960> of<00:00:20.080> paper<00:00:20.260> as<00:00:20.890> you<00:00:21.100> can<00:00:21.220> see<00:00:21.400> one

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
square sheet of paper as you can see one

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.080 
square sheet of paper as you can see one
sides<00:00:22.600> white<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.920> side<00:00:24.100> is<00:00:24.220> green<00:00:24.369> this<00:00:24.940> is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
sides white one side is green this is

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.470 
sides white one side is green this is
origami<00:00:25.360> paper<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:26.470> I<00:00:26.800> got<00:00:27.789> with<00:00:28.060> some<00:00:28.240> book

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
origami paper that I got with some book

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.890 
origami paper that I got with some book
so<00:00:29.289> anyways<00:00:30.270> flip<00:00:31.270> it<00:00:31.360> over<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.720> white

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
so anyways flip it over to the white

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.799 
so anyways flip it over to the white
side<00:00:32.110> so<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.800> arrow<00:00:32.980> will<00:00:33.129> be<00:00:33.250> colored<00:00:33.809> you're

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
side so the arrow will be colored you're

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.120 
side so the arrow will be colored you're
going<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:34.989> fold<00:00:35.199> it<00:00:35.350> in<00:00:35.440> half<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.920> then<00:00:41.950> you're

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
going to fold it in half and then you're

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.690 
going to fold it in half and then you're
gonna<00:00:42.220> unfold<00:00:42.610> it<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:44.250> fold<00:00:45.250> it<00:00:45.520> in<00:00:45.640> half

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
gonna unfold it and fold it in half

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.140 
gonna unfold it and fold it in half
again<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.239> other<00:00:46.390> way

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.840 

then<00:00:52.750> unfold<00:00:53.200> that<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:54.130> far<00:00:54.490> you<00:00:54.580> should<00:00:54.610> have

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
then unfold that so far you should have

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.410 
then unfold that so far you should have
this<00:00:55.080> and<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.460> can<00:00:57.580> do<00:00:57.700> is<00:00:57.790> get<00:00:58.000> one<00:00:58.330> at

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
this and what you can do is get one at

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.330 
this and what you can do is get one at
this<00:00:58.600> corner<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.680> you're<00:00:59.800> gonna<00:00:59.890> fold<00:01:00.070> it<00:01:00.250> to

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
this corner and you're gonna fold it to

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.640 
this corner and you're gonna fold it to
the<00:01:00.430> middle<00:01:00.670> crease<00:01:00.900> right<00:01:01.900> here<00:01:01.960> doesn't

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
the middle crease right here doesn't

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.810 
the middle crease right here doesn't
matter<00:01:02.770> which<00:01:02.920> corner<00:01:03.100> your<00:01:03.310> folds<00:01:03.580> but<00:01:03.760> as

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
matter which corner your folds but as

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.230 
matter which corner your folds but as
long<00:01:03.970> as<00:01:04.000> it's<00:01:04.240> a<00:01:04.540> corner<00:01:05.730> you<00:01:06.730> just<00:01:07.030> followed

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
long as it's a corner you just followed

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.260 
long as it's a corner you just followed
that<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.210> unfold<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:13.060> you<00:01:13.150> can

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
that then you unfold it and then you can

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.110 
that then you unfold it and then you can
get<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:13.570> corner<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.950> this<00:01:15.250> corner<00:01:15.520> any<00:01:16.000> of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
get this corner or this corner any of

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.060 
get this corner or this corner any of
these<00:01:16.210> two<00:01:16.360> corners<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:17.740> get<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.950> one

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
these two corners don't get the one

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.910 
these two corners don't get the one
opposite<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.730> has<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.030> be<00:01:19.120> next<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:19.930> and

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
opposite it has to be next to it and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.980 
opposite it has to be next to it and
you're<00:01:21.040> going<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.250> fold<00:01:21.400> it<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.210> other

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
you're going to fold it to the other

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.580 
you're going to fold it to the other
middle<00:01:23.260> crease<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.890> then<00:01:27.460> unfold<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:28.590> all

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
middle crease and then unfold it all

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.260 
middle crease and then unfold it all
right<00:01:29.710> now<00:01:29.740> once<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.100> get<00:01:30.190> this<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:30.910> can<00:01:31.060> get

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
right now once you get this you can get

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
right now once you get this you can get
this<00:01:32.050> edge<00:01:32.320> here<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.290> fold<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.130> middle

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.610 

and<00:01:44.550> then<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.730> get<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.000> other<00:01:45.120> edge<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:46.350> fold

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
and then you get the other edge and fold

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.200 
and then you get the other edge and fold
it<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> middle<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.160> well

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.120 

I<00:01:53.299> there<00:01:54.049> from<00:01:54.170> there<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.440> can<00:01:54.560> get<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:54.890> top

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
I there from there you can get this top

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.890 
I there from there you can get this top
edge<00:01:55.340> where<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.119> should<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.540> diamond

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
edge where I should have the diamond

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.300 
edge where I should have the diamond
shape<00:01:57.080> or<00:01:57.350> square<00:01:57.619> whatever<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.130> want<00:01:58.250> to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
shape or square whatever you want to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.789 
shape or square whatever you want to
call<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.960> you're<00:02:00.080> going<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.290> fold<00:02:00.470> this

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
call it and you're going to fold this

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:08.949 
call it and you're going to fold this
edge<00:02:01.010> down<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:02.060> middle<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:08.000> far<00:02:08.270> you

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
edge down to the middle so far you

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.490 
edge down to the middle so far you
should<00:02:09.110> look<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.259> this

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
should look like this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.900 
should look like this
so<00:02:12.500> all<00:02:12.739> we<00:02:12.860> do<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.069> just<00:02:13.100> fold<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.430> edge<00:02:13.640> out

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
so all we do is just fold this edge out

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.000 
so all we do is just fold this edge out
to<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> middle<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:18.290> from<00:02:18.530> there<00:02:18.709> you're

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
to the middle and from there you're

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.699 
to the middle and from there you're
gonna<00:02:19.190> grab<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:19.790> little<00:02:20.290> flap<00:02:21.290> down<00:02:21.500> here

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
gonna grab this little flap down here

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.550 
gonna grab this little flap down here
and<00:02:22.550> pull<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.910> out

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and pull it out

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.970 
and pull it out
so<00:02:24.560> she<00:02:24.680> end<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.680> let<00:02:27.800> me<00:02:27.860> show

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
so she end up like that so let me show

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.600 
so she end up like that so let me show
you<00:02:28.010> again<00:02:28.190> with<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.400> other<00:02:28.489> side<00:02:28.840> pull<00:02:29.840> this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
you again with the other side pull this

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.800 
you again with the other side pull this
just<00:02:31.610> pull<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.000> out<00:02:32.120> while<00:02:32.330> holding<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.780> down

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
just pull it out while holding this down

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.580 
just pull it out while holding this down
then<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:35.959> let<00:02:36.320> anything<00:02:36.530> out<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.410> turns

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
then just let anything out so it turns

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.730 
then just let anything out so it turns
out<00:02:39.680> like<00:02:39.800> that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.780 

from<00:02:45.740> there<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.430> going<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.580> end<00:02:46.730> up

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
from there you're going to end up

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.660 
from there you're going to end up
folding<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.480> corner<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:49.070> whole<00:02:49.340> area

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
folding this corner like this whole area

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.620 
folding this corner like this whole area
right<00:02:49.850> here<00:02:49.880> backwards<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.340> should<00:02:53.270> end<00:02:53.480> up

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
right here backwards so should end up

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.350 
right here backwards so should end up
like<00:02:56.860> well<00:02:57.860> you're<00:02:58.640> probably<00:02:58.730> easy<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.180> just

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
like well you're probably easy to just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.250 
like well you're probably easy to just
flip<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.600> around<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.130> see<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.370> X<00:03:02.260> and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
flip it around so you see this X and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.220 
flip it around so you see this X and
then<00:03:03.610> make<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.760> corner<00:03:05.090> go<00:03:05.780> down<00:03:05.960> to<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
then make this corner go down to the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.010 
then make this corner go down to the
middle<00:03:06.440> crease<00:03:07.330> well<00:03:08.330> that's<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.690> little<00:03:08.900> bit

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
middle crease well that's a little bit

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.670 
middle crease well that's a little bit
edge<00:03:09.230> arrow<00:03:09.680> here<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.540> let's<00:03:11.540> say<00:03:11.660> ended<00:03:14.680> like

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
edge arrow here so let's say ended like

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.000 
edge arrow here so let's say ended like
this

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.070 

and<00:03:18.550> then<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.730> repeat<00:03:18.940> on<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> other<00:03:19.209> side

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.900 

so<00:03:25.680> far<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.040> should<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.460> this<00:03:28.640> all<00:03:29.640> we<00:03:29.760> did

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
so far you should have this all we did

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.450 
so far you should have this all we did
was<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.030> get<00:03:30.300> this<00:03:30.500> corner<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.070> fold<00:03:32.130> it

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
was just get this corner and fold it

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.820 
was just get this corner and fold it
down<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.620> then<00:03:35.400> from<00:03:36.210> there<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:37.350> flip<00:03:37.710> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
down and then from there you flip the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.640 
down and then from there you flip the
deck<00:03:37.950> over<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:41.340> you're<00:03:41.760> gonna<00:03:41.820> somewhat<00:03:42.650> lift

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
deck over and you're gonna somewhat lift

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.330 
deck over and you're gonna somewhat lift
it<00:03:43.770> open

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.830 

to<00:03:51.340> where<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.700> area<00:03:54.700> there's<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.569> layer

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
to where this is area there's this layer

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.589 
to where this is area there's this layer
this<00:03:56.590> layer<00:03:56.650> then<00:03:57.129> is<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.549> third<00:03:57.970> layer<00:03:58.180> here

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
this layer then is the third layer here

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.869 
this layer then is the third layer here
I'm<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.829> fold<00:04:00.099> it<00:04:00.280> inward<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.849> a

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
I'm going to fold it inward this is a

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.930 
I'm going to fold it inward this is a
bit<00:04:04.090> harder<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.390> show<00:04:05.879> so<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:09.579> shouldn't<00:04:09.819> end

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
bit harder to show so it shouldn't end

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.229 
bit harder to show so it shouldn't end
up<00:04:10.060> like<00:04:10.239> that<00:04:10.480> because<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.260> folded<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:12.239> folds

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
up like that because you folded it folds

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.449 
up like that because you folded it folds
in<00:04:13.599> half

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
in half

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.490 
in half
as<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.610> can<00:04:15.700> see<00:04:15.879> right<00:04:15.970> here<00:04:17.190> folded<00:04:19.500> so

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
as you can see right here folded so

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.279 
as you can see right here folded so
here's<00:04:21.039> that<00:04:21.190> one<00:04:21.459> there<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:21.850> two<00:04:22.030> layer<00:04:22.300> you

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
here's that one there the two layer you

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.390 
here's that one there the two layer you
should<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:23.650> make<00:04:23.800> this<00:04:23.919> little<00:04:24.070> triangle

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
should you can make this little triangle

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.189 
should you can make this little triangle
right<00:04:24.760> here<00:04:24.789> in<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.539> inside

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
right here in the inside

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.700 
right here in the inside
whenever<00:04:26.979> you<00:04:27.039> fold<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:28.560> basically<00:04:29.560> just

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
whenever you fold it so basically just

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.270 
whenever you fold it so basically just
getting<00:04:29.979> this<00:04:30.160> edge<00:04:31.120> here<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.860> folding<00:04:33.190> that

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
getting this edge here and folding that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.890 
getting this edge here and folding that
in<00:04:33.430> half

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.910 

so<00:04:42.500> should<00:04:43.130> have<00:04:43.310> this<00:04:43.430> arrow<00:04:43.700> now<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:45.770> can

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
so should have this arrow now you can

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.570 
so should have this arrow now you can
see<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.220> two<00:04:46.550> triangles<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:47.240> inside<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:49.070> now

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
see the two triangles now inside and now

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.580 
see the two triangles now inside and now
you<00:04:49.640> have<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:49.760> narrow<00:04:53.230> depend<00:04:54.230> on<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.410> color

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
you have a narrow depend on the color

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.900 
you have a narrow depend on the color
you<00:04:54.710> use<00:04:54.800> depends<00:04:55.070> on<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.190> color<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.760> the

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
you use depends on the color of the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.700 
you use depends on the color of the
arrow<00:04:56.030> in<00:04:56.930> this<00:04:57.080> case<00:04:57.290> have<00:04:57.440> green<00:04:57.680> arrow

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
arrow in this case have green arrow

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.680 
arrow in this case have green arrow
