out my tutorial on how to do it I'll put

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.270 
out my tutorial on how to do it I'll put
a<00:00:12.300> link<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.019> description<00:00:13.190> but<00:00:14.190> if

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
a link to that in the description but if

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.220 
a link to that in the description but if
you<00:00:14.370> know<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.639> solve<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> 3x3<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:16.080> can

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you know how to solve the 3x3 you can

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.599 
you know how to solve the 3x3 you can
start<00:00:16.500> learning<00:00:16.650> how<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:16.980> solve<00:00:17.250> before

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
start learning how to solve before

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.390 
start learning how to solve before
before<00:00:18.380> okay<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.220> I've

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
before okay so as you can see I've

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
before okay so as you can see I've
scrambled<00:00:20.789> my<00:00:21.090> 4x4<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.680> first<00:00:22.890> thing

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
scrambled my 4x4 and the first thing

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.310 
scrambled my 4x4 and the first thing
that<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.279> need<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:25.080> these

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that you need to do is get all of these

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.089 
that you need to do is get all of these
inner<00:00:25.949> centers<00:00:26.730> made<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> four<00:00:27.539> pieces<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
inner centers made of four pieces and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.950 
inner centers made of four pieces and
the<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.310> basically<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.359> make<00:00:30.660> 2

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the way you basically do that is make 2

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.170 
the way you basically do that is make 2
a1<00:00:31.109> bars<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> first<00:00:32.669> Center<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.059> I'm

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
a1 bars so the first Center that I'm

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.790 
a1 bars so the first Center that I'm
going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> solve<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> white<00:00:34.230> Center

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
going to solve is the white Center

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.389 
going to solve is the white Center
so<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.660> look<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.050> two<00:00:37.399> white

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
so to do that just look for two white

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.660 
so to do that just look for two white
pieces<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.309> see

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pieces and here they are and you can see

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
pieces and here they are and you can see
that<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.510> easily<00:00:42.719> join<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.440> like

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
that I can just easily join them like

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.240 
that I can just easily join them like
this<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.100> form<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> tool<00:00:44.640> a1<00:00:44.910> bar<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:47.100> just

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this to form a tool a1 bar and you just

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.090 
this to form a tool a1 bar and you just
do<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> other<00:00:47.879> two<00:00:48.300> pieces<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.840> well

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
do that for the other two pieces as well

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
do that for the other two pieces as well
so<00:00:50.100> here's<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> here's<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.539> other<00:00:51.629> one

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so here's one and here's the other one

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.830 
so here's one and here's the other one
and<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:53.100> also<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.629> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and you can also see that I can just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.549 
and you can also see that I can just
join<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.770> easily<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.410> now<00:00:58.410> in

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
join them easily like this now in

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
join them easily like this now in
solving<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> second<00:00:59.399> 2x1<00:00:59.699> bar<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
solving the second 2x1 bar you have to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
solving the second 2x1 bar you have to
be<00:01:00.870> careful<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> first<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.940> example

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
be careful of the first one for example

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.100 
be careful of the first one for example
if<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.350> bar<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.530> horizontal<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.110> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
if the bar is horizontal like this and I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
if the bar is horizontal like this and I
make<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.680> second<00:01:08.040> bar<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.909> see<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
make the second bar you can see that the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.950 
make the second bar you can see that the
first<00:01:09.540> bar<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.920> correct<00:01:11.280> anymore

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
first bar is not correct anymore

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
first bar is not correct anymore
so<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> make<00:01:13.560> sure<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.250> first

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so you want to make sure that your first

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.140 
so you want to make sure that your first
bar<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> vertical<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.580> before<00:01:17.580> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
bar is vertical like this before you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
bar is vertical like this before you
make<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.960> second<00:01:19.380> 2x1<00:01:19.619> bar<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> can

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
make your second 2x1 bar so as you can

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
make your second 2x1 bar so as you can
see<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.210> first<00:01:21.450> bar<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.689> still<00:01:21.990> fine<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
see the first bar is still fine and I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
see the first bar is still fine and I
can<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.369> easily<00:01:23.610> join<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
can just easily join them like this and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.340 
can just easily join them like this and
that's<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> white<00:01:26.610> Center<00:01:27.350> once

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that's how you get the white Center once

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
that's how you get the white Center once
you<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> white<00:01:28.920> Center<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
you have the white Center you need to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
you have the white Center you need to
get<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> center<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:30.750> opposite<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
get the center that's opposite to it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
get the center that's opposite to it
which<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> yellow<00:01:32.189> Center<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.659> that's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
which is the yellow Center and that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
which is the yellow Center and that's
pretty<00:01:34.049> simple<00:01:34.259> -<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.340> make<00:01:35.520> 2<00:01:35.700> a1<00:01:35.850> bars

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
pretty simple - you just make 2 a1 bars

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.350 
pretty simple - you just make 2 a1 bars
again<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.070> see<00:01:38.130> here's<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.119> piece

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
again so as you can see here's one piece

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.410 
again so as you can see here's one piece
and<00:01:39.600> here's<00:01:39.780> another<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.369> I<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.729> join

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and here's another and I can just join

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.850 
and here's another and I can just join
them<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.860> then

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
them like this just like that and then

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.910 
them like this just like that and then
to<00:01:47.159> get<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.430> yellow<00:01:47.490> 2x1<00:01:48.180> bar<00:01:48.560> over<00:01:49.560> here

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
to get this yellow 2x1 bar over here

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.639 
to get this yellow 2x1 bar over here
near<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> yellow<00:01:51.030> Center<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.530> have

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
near to the yellow Center all you have

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
near to the yellow Center all you have
to<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.759> grab<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.969> 2x1

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to do is go up like this grab the 2x1

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.709 
to do is go up like this grab the 2x1
bar<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.310> bring<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.390> will<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
bar and bring it down and it will be in

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.550 
bar and bring it down and it will be in
the<00:02:00.810> current<00:02:01.079> spot<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.149> as<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the current spot and as you can see the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
the current spot and as you can see the
same<00:02:04.799> thing<00:02:04.829> works<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.490> these<00:02:05.939> two<00:02:06.210> yellow

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
same thing works for these two yellow

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.930 
same thing works for these two yellow
pieces<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.619> join<00:02:08.129> these<00:02:08.340> together<00:02:08.520> like

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
pieces I can join these together like

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.690 
pieces I can join these together like
this<00:02:09.300> again<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.280> need<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.550> make

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
this again and then now you need to make

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
this again and then now you need to make
sure<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.000> these<00:02:12.209> two<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.810> bars<00:02:13.050> are

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
sure that these two one bars are

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
sure that these two one bars are
parallel<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.099> each<00:02:14.220> other<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.209> same

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
parallel to each other and on the same

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.509 
parallel to each other and on the same
layer<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:16.950> they're<00:02:17.129> parallel

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
layer so as you can see they're parallel

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.369 
layer so as you can see they're parallel
and<00:02:17.760> they're<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.530> layer<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.900> once<00:02:22.260> you

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
and they're on this layer so once you

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.589 
and they're on this layer so once you
have<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.769> down<00:02:23.069> all<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.849> need<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.239> once

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
have that down all you need to do once

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.800 
have that down all you need to do once
again<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.760> grab<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.879> 2x1<00:02:27.209> bar<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
again is go up grab the 2x1 bar and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.440 
again is go up grab the 2x1 bar and
bring<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> down<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.730> yellow<00:02:29.940> Center<00:02:30.360> is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
bring it down and the yellow Center is

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.000 
bring it down and the yellow Center is
solved

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
solved

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.460 
solved
now<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.159> this<00:02:32.340> case<00:02:32.610> my<00:02:33.390> remaining<00:02:33.780> two<00:02:34.019> pieces

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
now in this case my remaining two pieces

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.460 
now in this case my remaining two pieces
one<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.190> them<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.610> already<00:02:35.790> solved<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.599> one<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
one of them is already solved and one is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.190 
one of them is already solved and one is
not<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.879> can<00:02:39.000> still<00:02:39.269> make<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.629> 2x1<00:02:40.019> bar

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
not but you can still make a 2x1 bar

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.949 
not but you can still make a 2x1 bar
with<00:02:40.590> these<00:02:40.769> pieces<00:02:41.099> all<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.299> need<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.569> do<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
with these pieces all you need to do is

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.039 
with these pieces all you need to do is
make<00:02:43.799> sure<00:02:43.829> that<00:02:44.250> when<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:44.640> go<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:45.000> it'll<00:02:45.930> make

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
make sure that when you go up it'll make

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.369 
make sure that when you go up it'll make
a<00:02:46.079> 2x1<00:02:46.440> bar<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.910> as<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.359> can<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
a 2x1 bar so as you can see that's the

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.339 
a 2x1 bar so as you can see that's the
case<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:49.829> so<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.099> can<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.609> up<00:02:50.640> again

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
case here so I can just go up again

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.150 
case here so I can just go up again
grab<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.530> 2x1<00:02:52.829> bar<00:02:53.010> once<00:02:53.489> again<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:55.040> bring<00:02:56.040> it

down<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.609> solve<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.060> yellow<00:02:57.209> Center<00:02:58.459> okay<00:02:59.459> so

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
down to solve the yellow Center okay so

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.729 
down to solve the yellow Center okay so
after<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.150> solve<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.569> yellow<00:03:00.780> Center<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.409> just

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
after you solve the yellow Center I just

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.849 
after you solve the yellow Center I just
like<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:01.980> solve<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.370> blue<00:03:02.549> Center<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.739> you

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
like to solve the blue Center so but you

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.559 
like to solve the blue Center so but you
can<00:03:05.010> solve<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.489> Green<00:03:05.700> Center<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.450> red

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
can solve the Green Center the red

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.360 
can solve the Green Center the red
centre<00:03:06.959> or<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.319> orange<00:03:07.590> Center<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.099> I'm<00:03:08.220> just

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
centre or the orange Center but I'm just

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.280 
centre or the orange Center but I'm just
going<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.609> solve<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> blue<00:03:09.090> Center<00:03:09.390> as<00:03:09.599> you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
going to solve the blue Center as you

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.559 
going to solve the blue Center as you
can<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.799> I<00:03:10.829> already<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.519> 2x1<00:03:11.879> bar<00:03:12.060> right

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
can see I already have a 2x1 bar right

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.640 
can see I already have a 2x1 bar right
here<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.159> I<00:03:14.159> can<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.640> make<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.239> 2x1<00:03:15.569> bar<00:03:15.720> using

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
here and I can just make a 2x1 bar using

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
here and I can just make a 2x1 bar using
these<00:03:16.829> pieces<00:03:17.269> once<00:03:18.269> again<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.780> need<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.079> make

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
these pieces once again you need to make

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.409 
these pieces once again you need to make
sure<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:20.069> your<00:03:20.519> bar<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.970> vertical<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.209> once

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
sure that your bar is vertical so once

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.360 
sure that your bar is vertical so once
you<00:03:24.510> have<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.930> two<00:03:25.139> Waylon<00:03:25.440> bars<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:26.220> can

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you have the two Waylon bars you can

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.159 
you have the two Waylon bars you can
join<00:03:26.579> them<00:03:26.790> together<00:03:26.940> again<00:03:27.419> to<00:03:27.780> make<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
join them together again to make the

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.500 
join them together again to make the
blue<00:03:28.349> Center<00:03:28.910> okay<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:29.970> now<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.480> have

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
blue Center okay so now that you have

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 
blue Center okay so now that you have
the<00:03:30.750> blue<00:03:30.930> Center<00:03:31.319> you<00:03:31.769> need<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
the blue Center you need to get the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.860 
the blue Center you need to get the
centre<00:03:32.579> that's<00:03:32.700> opposite<00:03:33.209> blue<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.629> green

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
centre that's opposite blue the green

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.710 
centre that's opposite blue the green
Center<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:35.280> works<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.609> same<00:03:35.700> way<00:03:36.060> as<00:03:36.269> you

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
Center and it works the same way as you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.960 
Center and it works the same way as you
can<00:03:36.840> see<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.049> can<00:03:37.319> use<00:03:37.349> these<00:03:37.739> two<00:03:37.950> pieces<00:03:38.160> by

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
can see I can use these two pieces by

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.080 
can see I can use these two pieces by
going<00:03:39.329> up<00:03:39.510> which<00:03:39.900> makes<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.290> 2x1<00:03:40.590> bar<00:03:40.910> grab<00:03:41.910> it

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
going up which makes the 2x1 bar grab it

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.890 
going up which makes the 2x1 bar grab it
and<00:03:42.239> bring<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:43.079> down<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:45.690> works

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
and bring it down like that and it works

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.349 
and bring it down like that and it works
the<00:03:46.049> same<00:03:46.079> for<00:03:46.500> these<00:03:46.799> other<00:03:47.069> two<00:03:47.310> pieces<00:03:47.459> even

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
the same for these other two pieces even

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.640 
the same for these other two pieces even
though<00:03:48.389> they're<00:03:48.660> diagonal<00:03:49.169> from<00:03:49.319> each<00:03:49.470> other

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
though they're diagonal from each other

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.400 
though they're diagonal from each other
I<00:03:49.859> can<00:03:50.370> still<00:03:50.609> go<00:03:50.790> up<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.180> grab<00:03:51.840> one<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.199> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
I can still go up and grab one of the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.819 
I can still go up and grab one of the
pieces<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:53.069> this<00:03:53.510> then<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.870> can<00:03:55.049> position<00:03:55.709> two

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
pieces like this then I can position two

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.220 
pieces like this then I can position two
pieces<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.819> when<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.150> grow<00:03:57.419> go<00:03:57.780> up<00:03:57.959> I'll

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
pieces so that when I grow go up I'll

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.180 
pieces so that when I grow go up I'll
grab<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.400> 2x1<00:03:59.730> bar<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.680> bring<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.799> down<00:04:01.980> like

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
grab the 2x1 bar and bring it down like

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.640 
grab the 2x1 bar and bring it down like
that<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.849> that's<00:04:03.810> how<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.019> get<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.379> first

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
that and that's how you get the first

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.369 
that and that's how you get the first
four<00:04:04.919> centers<00:04:05.569> now<00:04:06.569> getting<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> last<00:04:07.139> two

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
four centers now getting the last two

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.349 
four centers now getting the last two
centers<00:04:07.739> can<00:04:07.949> be<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.099> bit<00:04:08.340> tricky<00:04:08.730> because<00:04:09.120> you

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
centers can be a bit tricky because you

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.550 
centers can be a bit tricky because you
need<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.629> make<00:04:09.810> sure<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.019> they're<00:04:10.349> in<00:04:10.379> the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
need to make sure that they're in the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.890 
need to make sure that they're in the
correct<00:04:10.739> spot<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.879> way<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.060> like<00:04:12.389> to<00:04:12.419> make<00:04:12.690> sure

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
correct spot the way I like to make sure

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.500 
correct spot the way I like to make sure
is<00:04:13.109> by<00:04:13.410> looking<00:04:13.560> at<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:14.160> other<00:04:14.310> centers<00:04:14.819> so<00:04:15.449> I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
is by looking at the other centers so I

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.150 
is by looking at the other centers so I
can<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.840> when<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.199> white<00:04:16.500> Center<00:04:17.039> is

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
can see that when the white Center is

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.250 
can see that when the white Center is
facing<00:04:17.609> me<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.299> blue<00:04:18.479> centers<00:04:18.900> on<00:04:19.019> top

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
facing me and the blue centers on top

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.740 
facing me and the blue centers on top
the<00:04:19.919> red<00:04:20.190> centre<00:04:20.639> needs<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.299> on<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.539> right

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the red centre needs to be on the right

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.050 
the red centre needs to be on the right
when<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.079> alt<00:04:22.349> so<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.310> can<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.640> that<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.849> need

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
when it's alt so I can see that I need

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.969 
when it's alt so I can see that I need
to<00:04:24.150> get<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> red<00:04:24.570> centre<00:04:24.900> here<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.320> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
to get the red centre here and the

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.720 
to get the red centre here and the
orange<00:04:26.340> centre<00:04:26.700> here

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
orange centre here

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.840 
orange centre here
but<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:28.850> can<00:04:28.970> still<00:04:29.270> make<00:04:29.510> 201<00:04:29.960> bars<00:04:30.170> normally

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
but you can still make 201 bars normally

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.220 
but you can still make 201 bars normally
so<00:04:31.850> as<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.030> can<00:04:32.120> see<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.480> this<00:04:32.630> piece<00:04:32.900> and

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
so as you can see I have this piece and

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.700 
so as you can see I have this piece and
this<00:04:34.070> piece<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.360> can<00:04:35.570> easily<00:04:35.990> just<00:04:36.200> go<00:04:36.530> up

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
this piece so I can easily just go up

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.050 
this piece so I can easily just go up
like<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:38.080> grab<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.350> piece<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.950> bring<00:04:40.880> it

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
like that grab that piece and bring it

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.060 
like that grab that piece and bring it
down<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:42.050> will<00:04:42.110> have<00:04:42.350> made<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> two<00:04:42.920> layer

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
down and I will have made a two layer

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.690 
down and I will have made a two layer
one<00:04:43.220> bar<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:45.590> works<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.920> same<00:04:46.160> for<00:04:46.220> here

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
one bar and it works the same for here

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.670 
one bar and it works the same for here
as<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.120> can<00:04:47.270> see<00:04:47.420> I<00:04:47.450> already<00:04:47.720> have<00:04:47.870> this<00:04:48.320> 2x1

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
as you can see I already have this 2x1

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.600 
as you can see I already have this 2x1
bar<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.090> can<00:04:50.300> still<00:04:50.660> go<00:04:50.900> up<00:04:51.160> grab<00:04:52.160> that<00:04:52.370> bar

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
bar so I can still go up grab that bar

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.330 
bar so I can still go up grab that bar
and<00:04:52.940> bring<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.600> down<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:53.960> that's<00:04:54.920> how<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.160> get

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
and bring it down and that's how you get

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.370 
and bring it down and that's how you get
the<00:04:55.490> centers<00:04:55.880> join<00:04:56.510> me<00:04:56.630> next<00:04:56.780> time<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.230> in

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
the centers join me next time and in

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.920 
the centers join me next time and in
part<00:04:57.650> two<00:04:57.830> we'll<00:04:58.430> solve<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:59.030> edges<00:04:59.420> and<00:04:59.600> the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
part two we'll solve the edges and the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.710 
part two we'll solve the edges and the
entire<00:05:00.260> cube
