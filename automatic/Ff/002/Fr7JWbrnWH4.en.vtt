which<00:01:34.190> just<00:01:34.520> adds<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.850> little<00:01:34.940> crunch<00:01:35.210> when<00:01:35.600> you

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
which just adds a little crunch when you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.280 
which just adds a little crunch when you
grill<00:01:35.930> it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
grill it

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.320

brilliant long side I'd say a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.580 
brilliant long side I'd say a
medium-rare<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.940> medium<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.900> pretty<00:02:15.200> much<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
medium-rare to medium is pretty much the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.610 
medium-rare to medium is pretty much the
best<00:02:15.709> bet<00:02:16.069> just<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.880> make<00:02:17.060> sure<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.690> all<00:02:17.989> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
best bet just to make sure that all the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.130 
best bet just to make sure that all the
inter<00:02:19.010> muscular<00:02:19.160> fat<00:02:19.730> gets<00:02:20.060> melted<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.959> that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
inter muscular fat gets melted and that

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.320 
inter muscular fat gets melted and that
the<00:02:21.440> outside<00:02:21.920> gets<00:02:22.280> sort<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.550> crispy<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the outside gets sort of crispy and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.830 
the outside gets sort of crispy and
caramelized<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:25.610> thing<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:26.000> do<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.600> to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
caramelized so one thing I do just to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
caramelized so one thing I do just to
remind<00:02:27.620> myself<00:02:27.769> of<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:29.510> doneness<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.500> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860
