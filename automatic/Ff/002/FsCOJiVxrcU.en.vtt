there to that pulley on the back end of

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.150 
there to that pulley on the back end of
that<00:00:23.760> transformation<00:00:24.720> actually<00:00:25.680> that'd<00:00:26.010> be

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
that transformation actually that'd be

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.220 
that transformation actually that'd be
the<00:00:26.250> front<00:00:26.460> end<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> transmission<00:00:27.359> yeah

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the front end of that transmission yeah

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
the front end of that transmission yeah
I<00:00:28.260> got<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> truck<00:00:28.830> transmission<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:29.670> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
I got a truck transmission on there I

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
the rest of the year it sits here and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.090 
the rest of the year it sits here and
collects<00:03:51.180> dust<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.870> things<00:03:52.680> start<00:03:52.980> getting

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
collects dust and things start getting

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.240 
collects dust and things start getting
piled<00:03:53.400> up<00:03:53.609> on<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.420> comes<00:03:55.170> with<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:56.040> a

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
piled up on it it comes with a lot of a

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.550 
piled up on it it comes with a lot of a
lot<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:56.940> tooling<00:03:57.359> that<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.720> know<00:03:57.900> nothing<00:03:58.440> about

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
lot of tooling that I know nothing about

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.199 
lot of tooling that I know nothing about
all<00:03:59.359> kinds<00:04:00.359> of<00:04:00.389> goodies<00:04:01.340> it's<00:04:02.340> complete<00:04:03.180> and

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
all kinds of goodies it's complete and

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.460 
all kinds of goodies it's complete and
it<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:05.250> know<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.519> works

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it you know it works

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.080 
it you know it works
and<00:04:08.470> here's<00:04:08.710> a<00:04:08.800> low<00:04:08.980> start<00:04:09.370> windings<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:09.940> that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
and here's a low start windings in that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.810 
and here's a low start windings in that
motor<00:04:10.800> but<00:04:11.800> anyway<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:14.620> noise<00:04:14.890> here<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.550> that

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
motor but anyway the noise here is that

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.870 
motor but anyway the noise here is that
pulley<00:04:16.450> back<00:04:16.660> there<00:04:17.020> not<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.650> big<00:04:17.830> deal<00:04:18.300> but

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
pulley back there not a big deal but

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.050 
pulley back there not a big deal but
everything's<00:04:21.510> true<00:04:21.960> on<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:23.340> can

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
everything's true on it you can

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.980 
everything's true on it you can
throw<00:04:25.570> it<00:04:25.720> into<00:04:25.900> gear

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
throw it into gear

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.490 
throw it into gear
and<00:04:28.289> then<00:04:28.440> it's<00:04:28.620> got<00:04:28.860> lemon<00:04:29.240> settings<00:04:30.350> which<00:04:31.350> I

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
and then it's got lemon settings which I

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.040 
and then it's got lemon settings which I
believe<00:04:31.770> are<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.009> speed<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.210> year<00:04:33.660> and

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
believe are the speed of this year and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.840 
believe are the speed of this year and
then<00:04:34.199> of<00:04:34.440> course<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:34.889> got<00:04:35.100> your

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
then of course you got your

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.740 
then of course you got your
got<00:04:37.390> your<00:04:37.570> live<00:04:37.780> feed<00:04:38.580> forward<00:04:39.580> reverse

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.029 

those

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.650 

and<00:04:45.129> as<00:04:45.699> I<00:04:45.849> said<00:04:46.059> you<00:04:46.270> can<00:04:46.449> adjust<00:04:46.809> speed<00:04:47.259> on

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.290 

here<00:04:50.500> in<00:04:50.830> April<00:04:51.010> and<00:04:51.820> March<00:04:52.060> in<00:04:52.390> Reverse

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300
