it's really important to have good
garden<00:00:54.270> cutters<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> cut<00:00:55.829> the

if you have the stem on that's actually

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
if you have the tomato where the scar is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.600 
if you have the tomato where the scar is
evident<00:01:10.320> where<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.650> top<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.189> been<00:01:11.220> pulled

evident where that top has been pulled

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
evident where that top has been pulled
off<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> lot

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
off you're really going to see a lot

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
off you're really going to see a lot
quicker<00:01:13.470> ripening<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.549> big<00:01:14.729> deal

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
quicker ripening and that's a big deal

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
quicker ripening and that's a big deal
when<00:01:15.450> you're<00:01:15.570> trying<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.930> store<00:01:16.170> them<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
when you're trying to store them the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.820 
when you're trying to store them the
next<00:01:17.670> step<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.420> key<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.020> washing<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
next step is really key is washing the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
next step is really key is washing the
tomatoes<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.060> wash<00:01:21.390> them<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:21.930> away<00:01:22.110> or

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
tomatoes if you wash them right away or

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.810 
tomatoes if you wash them right away or
well<00:01:22.770> before<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> eat<00:01:23.460> them

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
well before you eat them

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.030 
well before you eat them
that's<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> help<00:01:24.869> deteriorate<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that's going to help deteriorate the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
that's going to help deteriorate the
tomato<00:01:26.520> itself<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.869> important

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
tomato itself so it's really important

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
tomato itself so it's really important
just<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.770> wash<00:01:28.920> them<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.430> before<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.909> eat

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
just to wash them right before you eat

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.160 
just to wash them right before you eat
them<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.960> key<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> third<00:01:32.310> thing<00:01:32.340> is

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
them really key now the third thing is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.830 
them really key now the third thing is
refrigeration<00:01:34.170> big<00:01:34.860> deal<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:36.000> don't<00:01:36.360> want<00:01:36.720> to

not<00:02:54.760> completely<00:02:55.270> right<00:02:55.600> that's<00:02:56.110> gonna<00:02:56.260> allow

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
not completely right that's gonna allow

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.320 
not completely right that's gonna allow
them<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.890> ripen<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.370> little<00:02:57.610> bit<00:02:57.730> further<00:02:58.000> so

them to ripen a little bit further so

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.510 
them to ripen a little bit further so
both<00:02:58.570> methods<00:02:59.080> are<00:02:59.200> really<00:02:59.440> good<00:02:59.680> if<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
both methods are really good if the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.210 
both methods are really good if the
tomato<00:03:00.820> has<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.420> stem<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.200> can<00:03:02.470> store
