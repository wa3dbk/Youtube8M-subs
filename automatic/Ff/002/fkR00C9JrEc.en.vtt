00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.519
 it was a toy but frankly we are 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.350
 we all know that everything is too much 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.630
 a lot of associations that is there 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.279
 to organize a good day on 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.900
 had a kind of old skate park in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.850
 trash all rotten they took it away 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.550
 moved to the mountain what seems 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.320
 so waiting for that one there is 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.180
 finished i wore to saint pierre on 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.630
 saint-pierre white ravine she was doing 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.149
 the road 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 it's a problem but now 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.410
 with a park like that it will make me 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 save the essence of cool no 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.129
 practitioners in my eyes is the best 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.160
 of Lille for the moment there is also who 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.719
 comes on possession in a year or so 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.460
 two years we 'll see what happens but 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.260
 for now is the one who has in mind 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.050
 it is this one by a field of flowers 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.370
 it's new proportions this is the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.690
 double even the trip of what we had 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.620
 before 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.199
 it's always the same space that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.059
 exploited but the more we'll say it's 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.350
 more fulfilled he kills himself in the green in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.750
 did there were there were some 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.880
 little anton modules but that's it 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.979
 really it's concrete it's all 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 skate park is passable know the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.320
 countdown we're going to go go 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.110
 to an extreme reminder rigor if they are 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.119
 the only ones at the meeting to do that they 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.189
 are fighting now I 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.530
 speak to me a little if there are elected and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.509
 all here this is directly message 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.420
 for the direction that are in the process of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.549

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.079
