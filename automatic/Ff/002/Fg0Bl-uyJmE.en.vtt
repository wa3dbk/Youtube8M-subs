into<00:02:05.909> each<00:02:06.119> other<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.500> however<00:02:07.649> I'm

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
into each other I do think however I'm

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.559 
into each other I do think however I'm
going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> skip<00:02:08.580> worrying<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.330> tongue

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
going to skip worrying about the tongue

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.289 
going to skip worrying about the tongue
of<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> sneaker

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
of the sneaker

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.030 
of the sneaker
because<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.109> lot<00:02:13.140> probably<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.829> going

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
because I think a lot probably is going

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.539 
because I think a lot probably is going
to<00:02:14.159> bleed<00:02:14.370> through<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:16.409> be<00:02:16.560> you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
very sparing with the bleach because it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.280 
very sparing with the bleach because it
kind<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.190> comes<00:03:39.430> out<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.840> know<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:40.989> takes<00:03:41.170> a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
kind of comes out you know it takes a

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.400 
kind of comes out you know it takes a
little<00:03:41.380> while<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.680> really<00:03:42.130> do<00:03:42.310> its<00:03:42.459> thing<00:03:43.410> so

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
little while to really do its thing so

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.930 
little while to really do its thing so
we're<00:03:44.560> going<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.769> let<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:44.950> work<00:03:45.310> for<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> few

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
to sink in and look Spacey and cool you

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.370 
to sink in and look Spacey and cool you
have<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.410> trust<00:04:17.620> me<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.160> then<00:04:18.850> our<00:04:19.269> final<00:04:19.690> step

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
have to trust me and then our final step

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.969 
have to trust me and then our final step
is<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:21.640> dot<00:04:22.450> on<00:04:22.690> some<00:04:23.650> little<00:04:23.950> stars<00:04:24.390> with<00:04:25.390> our

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
is to dot on some little stars with our

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.529 
is to dot on some little stars with our
dimensional<00:04:26.979> fabric<00:04:27.190> paint<00:04:27.580> this<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.360> just

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
dimensional fabric paint this is just

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.140 
dimensional fabric paint this is just
what<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.690> had<00:04:28.960> on<00:04:29.260> hand<00:04:29.320> but<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.520> think<00:04:31.000> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
what I had on hand but I think the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.760 
what I had on hand but I think the
dimensional<00:04:31.600> fabric<00:04:31.780> paint<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.289> actually<00:04:32.650> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
dimensional fabric paint is actually the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.909 
dimensional fabric paint is actually the
way<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:32.919> go<00:04:33.130> because<00:04:33.910> one<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.690> really<00:04:35.380> love<00:04:35.590> this

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
way to go because one I really love this

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.940 
way to go because one I really love this
fine<00:04:36.700> tip<00:04:37.210> for<00:04:37.690> making<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.140> little<00:04:38.260> stars<00:04:38.650> and

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
fine tip for making the little stars and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.390 
fine tip for making the little stars and
two<00:04:39.639> because<00:04:40.510> this<00:04:40.690> canvas<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.169> obviously<00:04:42.070> so

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
two because this canvas is obviously so

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.870 
two because this canvas is obviously so
porous<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.300> really<00:04:44.080> sucks<00:04:44.620> up<00:04:44.919> you<00:04:45.220> know<00:04:45.370> the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
porous and really sucks up you know the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.640 
porous and really sucks up you know the
alcohol<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.630> bleach<00:04:46.840> or<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.200> sharpie

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
alcohol and the bleach or the sharpie

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.560 
alcohol and the bleach or the sharpie
and<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.919> paint<00:04:48.190> I<00:04:48.460> wanted<00:04:49.210> something<00:04:49.419> that

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
and the paint I wanted something that

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.950 
and the paint I wanted something that
will<00:04:49.750> definitely<00:04:49.930> stand<00:04:50.889> up<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:52.389> not<00:04:52.479> soak

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
will definitely stand up and not soak

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.409 
will definitely stand up and not soak
into<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.260> paint<00:04:53.590> so<00:04:54.100> take<00:04:54.789> your<00:04:54.940> dimensional

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
into the paint so take your dimensional

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.690 
into the paint so take your dimensional
fabric<00:04:55.750> paint<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.229> just<00:04:56.320> make<00:04:57.250> some<00:04:57.520> little

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
fabric paint and just make some little

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.180 
fabric paint and just make some little
stars<00:04:58.389> you<00:04:58.750> can<00:04:58.900> kind<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.139> have<00:04:59.260> some<00:04:59.979> bigger

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
stars you can kind of have some bigger

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.000 
stars you can kind of have some bigger
ones<00:05:01.350> some<00:05:02.350> little<00:05:02.620> ones<00:05:02.970> don't<00:05:03.970> overthink<00:05:04.419> it

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
ones some little ones don't overthink it

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.490 
ones some little ones don't overthink it
if<00:05:06.010> you're<00:05:06.190> using<00:05:06.780> regular<00:05:07.780> fabric<00:05:08.050> paint

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
if you're using regular fabric paint

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.620 
if you're using regular fabric paint
that<00:05:08.919> doesn't<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:09.370> this<00:05:09.520> fine<00:05:09.760> tip<00:05:10.000> you

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
that doesn't have this fine tip you

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.110 
that doesn't have this fine tip you
could<00:05:10.780> use<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> toothpick<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.530> do<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:12.120> all

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
could use a toothpick to do this all

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.379 
could use a toothpick to do this all
right

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
right

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.990 
right
I'm<00:05:13.570> just<00:05:13.840> going<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.020> let<00:05:14.139> these<00:05:14.320> dry<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.789> then

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
I'm just going to let these dry and then

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.999 
I'm just going to let these dry and then
look<00:05:16.120> at<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.330> laicism

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.249 

we<00:05:20.009> have<00:05:20.129> our<00:05:20.220> two<00:05:20.430> shoes<00:05:20.729> they're<00:05:21.539> dried<00:05:21.840> all

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
we have our two shoes they're dried all

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.219 
we have our two shoes they're dried all
that's<00:05:22.680> left<00:05:22.949> is<00:05:23.189> to<00:05:23.280> add<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.909> laces<00:05:24.300> now<00:05:25.139> you

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
that's left is to add the laces now you

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.920 
that's left is to add the laces now you
could<00:05:25.680> die<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:27.090> know<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.419> laces<00:05:27.719> that<00:05:27.810> it

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
could die the you know the laces that it

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.020 
could die the you know the laces that it
comes<00:05:28.110> with<00:05:28.199> but<00:05:28.919> I'm<00:05:29.069> going<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.460> use<00:05:29.610> some<00:05:29.909> of

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
comes with but I'm going to use some of

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.089 
comes with but I'm going to use some of
this<00:05:30.270> mint<00:05:31.080> green<00:05:31.199> leather<00:05:32.069> cord<00:05:32.819> instead<00:05:33.479> I

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
this mint green leather cord instead I

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.659 
this mint green leather cord instead I
recommend<00:05:35.210> using<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.840> old<00:05:37.439> laces<00:05:37.979> so<00:05:38.610> you

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
recommend using the old laces so you

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.790 
recommend using the old laces so you
know<00:05:38.849> how<00:05:39.180> long<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.840> make<00:05:39.990> your<00:05:40.169> new<00:05:40.259> ones

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.149 

alright

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
alright

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.659 
alright
I<00:05:44.270> think<00:05:45.270> these<00:05:45.419> bad<00:05:45.719> boys<00:05:45.960> are<00:05:46.530> ready<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.520> go

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
I think these bad boys are ready to go

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.179 
I think these bad boys are ready to go
on<00:05:47.879> my<00:05:48.060> feet<00:05:48.330> I'm<00:05:49.050> going<00:05:49.259> to<00:05:49.319> put<00:05:49.439> these<00:05:49.560> on<00:05:49.710> and

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 
on my feet I'm going to put these on and

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.240 
on my feet I'm going to put these on and
I'll<00:05:50.280> see<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.520> guys<00:05:50.550> next<00:05:50.940> week
