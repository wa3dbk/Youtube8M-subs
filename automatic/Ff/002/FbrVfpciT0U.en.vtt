interesting about those ones that are a

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.260 
interesting about those ones that are a
little<00:04:51.410> bit<00:04:51.530> more<00:04:51.680> difficult<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.460> find<00:04:52.820> is

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
little bit more difficult to find is

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.840
