00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello everyone, as always on the eve of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:10.070
 review I do overclocking video 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:15.030
 cards this is zotac gtx 980ti extreme 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.820
 the fattest the biggest the strongest 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.189
 overclocked map of the plant that is it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.699
 the fastest map in general 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.029
 Now available 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.369
 available here and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.840
 I must also say that all that I say in 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.630
 this video is literally personally in my experience 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.410
 obtained from this one instance I 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.660
 can't speak and summarize all the maps 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.600
 but no matter what happened, I 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.110
 did when got this card i wrote 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.629
 in zotac first in the usual service 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.410
 asked them for information about what 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.170
 improvements 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.809
 they did that there are mosfet and from 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 used at all they put there 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 mosfet and or not water prophase nutrition 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 asked and so forth 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.920
 improvements were generally made they 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.250
 transferred this topic to another department 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.119
 I wrote to another department and they all 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.180
 banished ignored completely me 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.520
 that is, but before that they wrote 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.220
 the public is usually not disclosed 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.210
 information that is, I understand that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.619
 they just don't want to share with us 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.070
 information about what exactly they are there 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.259
 have made any improvements which parts 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 replaced what is generally done is 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.130
 some great 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.869
 the great secret of technology is not know when 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.430
 you can still unleash it all and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.759
 I certainly won't see it 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.030
 do because this card is not mine and I 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.430
 gotta get her back here nonetheless 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.100
 this is one of the most capricious video cards 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:06.020
 which I had to overclock from 980ti 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:09.390
 and it seems to me that what they changed there 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.560
 has something to do with it 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.020
 just a hunch 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.130
 I have no evidence but neither 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.530
 less tell you what happened that is 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.489
 in fact if you don't want and 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.980
 overclock just want to buy it and 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.989
 enjoy it is probably one of 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.940
 the best cards if you want exactly 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.650
 overclocked card because boost 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 rises to 1400 5 megahertz without 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.900
 all overclock of and tvikov 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.940
 that is, just crazy beads the very 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.769
 fast map which I have seen so far 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.049
 and nevertheless nevertheless what 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.489
 problems were with overclocking that is 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.860
 I dispersed her 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.930
 using all sorts of different options 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.840
 tried and millivolt and added 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.239
 maximum did 87 millivolt this is not 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.630
 it helps absolutely, that is, I noticed it 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.620
 already m-200 chip that so many of what 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.540
 200 precisely accelerated in air 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.090
 there is no such usual coolers 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.810
 love in general volts increase the increase 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.870
 absolutely do not like the voltage but 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.609
 no less dispersed the core to 1500 3 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.680
 megahertz this is actually a breakthrough and my 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.769
 personal best 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.540
 because i'm jim 200 none else i have 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.000
 there was no one else who could 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.209
 accelerate from above that is overcome 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.819
 this barrier at 1500 megahertz it though on 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.410
 3 megahertz she overcame that is 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.569
 pretty interesting but how do you see 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.590
 memory is not overclocked and why you ask 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.299
 because what happened is that every time 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.130
 when 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:57.269
 increased memory speed then frequency 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.060
 cores dumped I donâ€™t know exactly what 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.920
 happened but every time 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.200
 followed that is, after increasing 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.389
 memory speed followed by a drop at the core 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.510
 no matter million millivolts add not 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:15.959
 add useless absolutely absolutely 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.420
 because it seems to me that something 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:23.360
 it refers exactly 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.500
 how the card itself distributes 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.470
 distributes power between components 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.330
 because even the power limit was raised 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:37.670
 but a little bit above 100 percent is very 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:41.820
 rarely was rising load it 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:46.740
 Yes, and very strange horse racing 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.460
 it was precisely the cores I observed because 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:55.740
 you see 1503 it is stable it goes 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:58.790
 But here we are when I used 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.850
 millivolt and to a maximum or less and 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:07.140
 added another core frequency then observed 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.910
 such a strange thing as suddenly big 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.560
 leap 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.630
 megahertz that is it rose literally 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:19.230
 before 1538 and just immediately thefts 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.980
 was happening that is something wrong with 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.430
 boost 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.830
 it was that is because of boost in 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.780
 principle can not be further dispersed 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.480
 and this is very strange because in other 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.440
 980ti everything was pretty plan then 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.080
 there is increasing the core then it is slowly 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.500
 increases from here as if I do not know 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.890
 that they used there exactly some kind of 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:48.750
 trick flow that just some such 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:52.410
 a jump above the roof took place here means 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.570
 such things here but that is my table 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.690
 leaderboard this card ranks first 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.780
 among 1 chip performance from 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.680
 boxes press your finger up if you 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.530
 liked click review he already hope 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.700
 will be ready tomorrow I'm working on it in 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.450
 full force and of course the following 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.420
 the card will be 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.420
 from and mass to new meetings yet
