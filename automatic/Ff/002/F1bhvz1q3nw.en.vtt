00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.259 
that one right there just 95 pace what
even<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:05.950> ridiculous<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.670> that

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
even is that that is ridiculous so that

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.270 
even is that that is ridiculous so that
card<00:03:07.569> will<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:07.930> an<00:03:08.080> ultimately<00:03:08.620> good<00:03:08.830> one<00:03:09.010> to

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
card will be an ultimately good one to

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.309 
card will be an ultimately good one to
invest<00:03:09.550> in<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.450> next<00:03:10.900> card<00:03:11.080> thought<00:03:11.230> I'd

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
invest in so the next card thought I'd

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.350 
invest in so the next card thought I'd
recommend<00:03:11.650> investing<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.519> also<00:03:13.120> another

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
recommend investing in is also another

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.059 
recommend investing in is also another
change<00:03:13.720> card<00:03:14.019> now<00:03:14.200> he<00:03:14.260> was<00:03:14.530> previously<00:03:14.800> a

since i've started fifa 13 and it is

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.060 
since i've started fifa 13 and it is
indeed<00:03:21.459> Marvel<00:03:22.120> win<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.680> didn't<00:03:23.950> really

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
indeed Marvel win so I didn't really

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.979 
indeed Marvel win so I didn't really
know<00:03:24.250> what<00:03:24.430> team<00:03:24.579> he<00:03:24.670> play<00:03:24.820> for<00:03:24.880> but<00:03:25.690> now<00:03:25.959> I

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
know what team he play for but now I

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.780 
know what team he play for but now I
figured<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.380> out<00:03:26.470> he<00:03:26.799> does<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.160> fact<00:03:27.190> playful

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
figured it out he does in fact playful

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.580 
figured it out he does in fact playful
is<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.090> san<00:03:28.329> jose<00:03:28.630> earthquakes<00:03:28.780> science<00:03:29.500> the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
is it san jose earthquakes science the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.530 
is it san jose earthquakes science the
one<00:03:29.739> he<00:03:29.950> used<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.190> be<00:03:30.280> at<00:03:30.370> colorado<00:03:30.820> rapids<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
one he used to be at colorado rapids and

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.180 
one he used to be at colorado rapids and
his<00:03:31.989> previous<00:03:32.200> car<00:03:32.500> was<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.799> send<00:03:32.980> him<00:03:33.100> back

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
his previous car was to send him back

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.430 
his previous car was to send him back
but<00:03:33.760> now<00:03:34.000> some<00:03:34.239> reason<00:03:34.570> they<00:03:34.750> put<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.260> right

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
but now some reason they put the right

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.530 
but now some reason they put the right
back<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:35.950> he's<00:03:36.130> absolutely<00:03:36.579> Opie's<00:03:37.120> accenting

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
back so he's absolutely Opie's accenting

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.150 
back so he's absolutely Opie's accenting
back<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.930> can<00:03:38.079> imagine<00:03:38.200> he's<00:03:38.440> right<00:03:38.920> back

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
back and I can imagine he's right back

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.699 
back and I can imagine he's right back
as<00:03:39.310> well<00:03:39.549> 93<00:03:40.420> pays<00:03:40.630> for<00:03:41.049> sending<00:03:41.290> back<00:03:41.410> he<00:03:41.530> did

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
as well 93 pays for sending back he did

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.220 
as well 93 pays for sending back he did
have<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.459> now<00:03:43.060> he's<00:03:43.209> right<00:03:43.480> back<00:03:43.510> so

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
have that and now he's right back so

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.140 
have that and now he's right back so
he's<00:03:44.470> worth<00:03:44.650> about<00:03:44.799> fifteen<00:03:45.459> thousand<00:03:46.000> coins

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
he's worth about fifteen thousand coins

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.930 
he's worth about fifteen thousand coins
but<00:03:46.750> his<00:03:46.930> price<00:03:47.200> will<00:03:47.590> go<00:03:47.620> up<00:03:47.940> dramatically

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
but his price will go up dramatically

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.699 
but his price will go up dramatically
whenever<00:03:49.660> team<00:03:49.930> team<00:03:50.079> comes<00:03:50.320> out<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.650> will

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
whenever team team comes out it will

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.530 
whenever team team comes out it will
triple<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.190> price<00:03:51.220> probably<00:03:51.850> again<00:03:52.090> same<00:03:52.390> as<00:03:52.480> a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
triple in price probably again same as a

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.930 
triple in price probably again same as a
duru<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.530> he'll<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.680> worth<00:03:53.920> about<00:03:54.070> 40<00:03:54.519> thousand

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
duru so he'll be worth about 40 thousand

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.520 
duru so he'll be worth about 40 thousand
