00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 after defeating Paraguay 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.410

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.240
 the height of the weather is bad 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.950
 player per player 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.820
 we improve in the second time 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.960
