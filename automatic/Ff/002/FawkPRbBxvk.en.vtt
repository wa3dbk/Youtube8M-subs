00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.970
 let's start 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.160
 without making the corrals 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.770
 we're just going to tangle both stamens at the same time 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 by all the hair poles to the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.610
 if it has to be a bit tight 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 then if you want they can 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 pushing the yarn down 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.120
 with your finger for what 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.350
 they are not made 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.700
 of the posts 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 so they will continue 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 munro giving everything until they reach the end of the fabrics 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.430
 this is why 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.990
 also the beginning of the scarf was as tight as the end 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.040
 because they hurt that noval initiative as well as 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.550
 with this we have left 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.410
 when I got to the final they return as if they were knitting 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 normal 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 already at the end 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.479
 already when they return is around the band mills 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.979
 turns with the yarn on this side 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.799
 that is step 1 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.419
 We're just going to do this 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.170
 in this spin of the fabric 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.199
 they take out everything 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.939
 out of it 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.549
 post hence there 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.229
 and they pass it in 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.909
 they take out the second point 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.559
 but hopefully stronger 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.319
 and so on, each point gets bigger 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.430
 this is because about 6 or the slipknot at the beginning for what the start 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.869
 of your tissue 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.509
 equal 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.379
 firm 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.739
 that the end 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.239
 if you want you can help by pushing the fabric down with your finger so you do not 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.319
 cease 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.859
 suddenly they reach the end of this side 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.699
 at the last point there should be a 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.499
 it weighs me pretty big 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.459
 Be very careful that you do not make the tenth point because with him 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.809
 burned 6 or the knot 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.809
 if you want to keep both hands 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.559
 they want kidney tambre 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.559
 of the laps that were given at the end of fabrics 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.129
 then k untangle the yarn 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.089
 the end of the world 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.709
 there will be enough Cuban respect 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.259
 this is only done in this round 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.259
 and that is the step 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.729
 from the second round only entangle 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.839
 both stamens at the same time around each post 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.889
 no and as it came we have to take out the points 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.859
 they only pass them outside the pole 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.859
 well the center of your web 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.379
 nesi batea of ​​tissue 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.729
 and so they are turning 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.240
 according to the argo of the scarf that you want 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.669
 remember 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.870
 what is the end when they reach the end of each round there is always a post with 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.909
 just one 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.909
 the post this exit 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.779
 they already passed the scarf taking out the 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.069
 a whole outside the post and pass it to the second post 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.120
 and they take out 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.120
 the bottom point inside 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.050
 from above that they do pass 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.050
 they will still pass the point to the third post 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:04.830
 the point below 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.069
 they take it out 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.069
 but inside 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.050
 and so on they pass 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.620
 punctuation 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.339
 next post 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:16.699
 and they take out 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.599
 point below 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.729
 it's strange 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.870
 messiah but in the end 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.870
 since we come to the end 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.059
 the last point 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.830
 preferably 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.050
 I do not know who 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.850
 adamo 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.850
 larger 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:44.150
 because good 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.400
 read the text 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.539
 ejido 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.539
 unravel 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.280
 if they have much left they are proposed in the scissors and turkey in the cut 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.839
 in the last milestone 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.569
 they pass he is so brief 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.020
 out there in the whole world 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.020
 the tip of the east 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.150
 micky if it's something very similar to nunu 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.180
 but good is that his last last point then since not 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.009
 all paris and c's 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.569
 here can be the scissors 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.110
 They cut what was left in evry tea 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.729
 not very long 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.729
 and the number 5 hook to fire 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.099
 so they do not go away 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.379
 they pass the hook by 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:44.039
 points 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.939
 you take the thread 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.939
 suntrust quillo min 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.189
 they take out 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.499
 the hermitage of the 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.899
 of the standards 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.389
 and again 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.389
 until this is no longer in the fridge 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:16.179
 If you are ready and there is a scarf mottled
