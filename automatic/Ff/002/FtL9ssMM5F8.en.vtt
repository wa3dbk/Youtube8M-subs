00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.950
 In this course, with the author's permission, I will explain what is included . 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.150
 Then we start making lecture of New Year's card illustration of guest 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:30.660
 The software used is photoshop cc 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.660
 Seems to use imac 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:46.300
 First of all I will write my fault. This time the whole process was digitally cleaned . 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:53.230
 At first we will change roughly using + tool 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:57.449
 I will adjust the shape while being aware of the color while observing the whole 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.449
 We will decide distorted with it 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.110
 Hmm 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.729
 2 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.560
 Relieved 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:26.610
 I made a rough, so I will go on a PC 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.790
 This time, it took the way to proceed to write while we take the surface of the color without having to create a line drawing 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.820
 Hmm 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:36.190
 Because the parts of the face are fine parts 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 I take a line drawing tightly, but Kameda and others write a command first 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.290
 Was the sex in Gakkomu so later 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.570
 p 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:56.220
 Since the modeling of the face is a particularly prominent part of the meeting , it is only sweetened while reflecting left and right 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.220
 I will change 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.200
 I have written a line drawing of the parts of the face If you draft is finished 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.890
 Ah ah ah 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 Hmm 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.120
 Hmm 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.620
 Hmm 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:25.000
 I will add the texture by layering the gochu excher in layers 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.660
 As you add textures and layers will increase 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.680
 I care about layer management 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:37.890
 You can expand the variation by changing the color of X-chan 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.400
 Color correction from the image of the menu bar 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.400
 Adjust the color balance with level correction 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.900
 ban 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.410
 Next will write paper 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.410
 This time, we will write separately to every three parts 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.360
 Relieved 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.269
 I will write as it flows while looking at the whole 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.319
 I will write the leaves one by one 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.939
 Copy and transform the layer that wrote the leaf 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.660
 Hmm 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:05.150
 As the whole stalk rice, I will change the color of each part 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.150
 I also use the clipping mask and brush tools to change colors partially 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.150
 I will stick the loser to the kimono collar as well as skin and hair . 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.920
 Hmm 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.229
 Put a redness on the cheek 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
 Hmm 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.410
 I will change my eyes 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.410
 Cormorants Uu 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.630

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.300
 me 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.810
 We will add 3 strong lines such as paper and tighten the meeting 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.810
 am 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900
 Hmm 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.939
 I will write this no . I will write carefully to be symmetrical 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.620
 Hmm 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.910

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.420
 Hmm 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:10.419
 Integrate the character layers and adjust the overall color 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:10.419
 We write small articles on the way We write using visit after the year we made separately 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.550
 Hmm 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.950
