00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:13.039
 Here is a robot system for laparoscopic surgery 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.930
 It is from the master who is operated by the majestic large doctor and the slave who moves on the patient river 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:20.360
 And I got off 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:24.560
 The robot on the slave side is moving in the air. 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:30.860
 Most of the traditional robot exhibitions were electric 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.050
 By moving it by air pressure, it absorbs the force of contact with something softly 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.920
 Can do something like 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 Marlow and the house hanging on the center 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:45.330
 Estimated from the pressure information of it is the color air 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 I sent the information to the master version of the doctor and feedback in the hands of Hokokosha 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:52.770
 it can 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:58.210
 Or very light as the size of the entire robot in the compact large force is put out 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:03.699
 There is a merit that it is possible to make very It is the compact 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:08.830
 It is than even now let alone We investigation actually that master gar 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:14.630
 For example, when you pull the rubber, it will expand the reaction force 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:21.860
 You have a demo experience like you feel 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:26.270
 Of course I remove camera shake, and then change the ratio of movement or after that from home 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:32.000
 Because you can also change the feedback factor freely 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.620
 Depending on the task and situation of the surgery, I changed such parameters and 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.280
 The operability that was in 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:45.900
 It is something that can be offered 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 Well aim to make that a much Standing easy popular from Well one-third compared to now Well Da Vinci 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.170
 And it's also I 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.040
 Yes even so kind of cost more that 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 I think that I can make it well now 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.930
 Thank you for the cooperation of the surgeon's teacher 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.250
 You are actually using it, but I am working on improving it with various feedback 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.350
 Even though I 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.010
 Thank you for the support of that now monmon 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.569
 Oh dear 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.040
 Now four years with the aim of practical application of enough No. 5 years 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.040
 We are developing
