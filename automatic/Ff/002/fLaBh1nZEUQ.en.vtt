00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
one of the top two among this group but

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.410 
one of the top two among this group but
just<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> come<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> these<00:01:26.939> canyons

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
just when you come out of these canyons

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.460 
just when you come out of these canyons
and<00:01:27.659> you're<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.990> fast

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and you're going fast

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.929 
and you're going fast
it<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.220> doesn't<00:01:29.430> inspire<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.790> lot<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it really doesn't inspire a lot of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.700 
it really doesn't inspire a lot of
confidence<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.409> car<00:01:31.590> really

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
confidence now what this car really

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
confidence now what this car really
needs<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> sport<00:01:33.420> mode<00:01:33.570> set<00:01:33.840> up

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
needs is to have a sport mode set up

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
needs is to have a sport mode set up
kind<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> Audi<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.920> tightens<00:01:35.490> up

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
kind of like the Audi that tightens up

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.310 
kind of like the Audi that tightens up
the<00:01:35.610> steering<00:01:36.000> response<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:37.110> really

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the steering response and that really

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020 
the steering response and that really
gives<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> some

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
gives it some

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
gives it some

similar<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> mercedes<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.880> just

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
similar to the mercedes is that just

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.300 
similar to the mercedes is that just
when<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:27.540> were<00:02:27.600> out<00:02:27.690> driving<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.410> car<00:02:28.680> really

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
when we were out driving this car really

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.130 
when we were out driving this car really
hard<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.880> here<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> canyons<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.900> didn't

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
hard up here in the canyons it didn't

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.320 
hard up here in the canyons it didn't
return<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.070> same<00:02:32.280> level<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.640> involvement<00:02:33.030> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
return the same level of involvement it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.050 
return the same level of involvement it
wasn't<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.720> very<00:02:33.989> compelling<00:02:34.550> drive<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.880> has

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
wasn't a very compelling drive it has

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.330 
wasn't a very compelling drive it has
sort<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.870> numb<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.319> vague<00:02:37.530> steering<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
sort of numb and vague steering and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.479 
sort of numb and vague steering and
tends<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.269> float<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.870> wallow<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> corners

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
tends to float and wallow in the corners

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.060 
tends to float and wallow in the corners
again<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> very<00:02:42.269> soft<00:02:42.660> ride<00:02:43.049> I'm<00:02:43.769> very

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
again it's a very soft ride I'm very

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.949 
again it's a very soft ride I'm very
smooth<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:45.090> really<00:02:45.360> not<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.690> our

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
smooth but just really not what our

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.660 
smooth but just really not what our
judges<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.290> looking<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.799> in<00:02:46.980> terms<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.459> a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.259 
higher than third okay so we're now only
Volvo<00:03:27.540> xc60<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.709> we're<00:03:28.890> on<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> final<00:03:30.150> two

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
Volvo xc60 and we're on to the final two

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.640 
Volvo xc60 and we're on to the final two
vehicles<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.109> is<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.440> when<00:03:31.560> you

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
vehicles and this is really when you

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.500 
vehicles and this is really when you
start<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.980> see<00:03:32.130> them<00:03:32.280> separate<00:03:32.820> themselves<00:03:33.000> in

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
start to see them separate themselves in

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.710 
start to see them separate themselves in
this<00:03:33.750> case<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.680> Volvo<00:03:34.980> here<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.459> probably<00:03:36.390> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
this case the Volvo here is probably the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.690 
this case the Volvo here is probably the
most<00:03:36.870> off-road<00:03:37.290> capable<00:03:37.769> given<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.670> has

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
most off-road capable given that it has

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.030 
most off-road capable given that it has
the<00:03:39.120> highest<00:03:39.510> ground<00:03:39.690> clearance<00:03:39.989> nine<00:03:40.680> inches

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
the highest ground clearance nine inches

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.460 
the highest ground clearance nine inches
and<00:03:41.310> yet<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.850> also<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.540> very<00:03:42.900> nice<00:03:43.079> driving

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and yet it is also a very nice driving

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.020 
and yet it is also a very nice driving
vehicle<00:03:43.829> on<00:03:44.100> these<00:03:44.370> twisty<00:03:44.730> Canyon<00:03:45.030> Road

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
vehicle on these twisty Canyon Road

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.970 
vehicle on these twisty Canyon Road
despite<00:03:46.540> being<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.050> high<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.560> thing<00:03:47.620> has

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
despite being so high this thing has

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.250 
despite being so high this thing has
quite<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.640> lot<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.210> steering<00:03:49.750> feel<00:03:50.050> and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
quite a lot of steering feel and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.680 
quite a lot of steering feel and
although<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.280> rolls<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:52.120> doesn't<00:03:52.360> roll<00:03:52.480> quite

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
although it rolls it doesn't roll quite

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.390 
although it rolls it doesn't roll quite
as<00:03:52.840> much<00:03:52.990> as<00:03:53.140> either<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.680> Lexus<00:03:54.160> or<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
as much as either the Lexus or the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.490 
as much as either the Lexus or the
Mercedes<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.570> can<00:03:55.750> really<00:03:55.870> carve

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
Mercedes and so you can really carve

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.200 
Mercedes and so you can really carve
some<00:03:56.740> of<00:03:56.830> these<00:03:56.890> corners<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.490> have<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.000> good

some of these corners and have a good

some of these corners and have a good
time<00:03:58.390> while<00:03:58.540> doing<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.990> one<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.130> reasons

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
time while doing it one of the reasons

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.510 
time while doing it one of the reasons
is<00:04:00.610> that<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:00.970> car<00:04:01.210> has<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:02.350> most<00:04:02.560> torque<00:04:02.920> the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
is that this car has the most torque the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.040 
is that this car has the most torque the
most<00:04:03.730> horsepower<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.840> best
