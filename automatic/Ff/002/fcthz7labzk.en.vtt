00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
they have a lot of money and so they

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.830 
they have a lot of money and so they
don't<00:03:16.489> know<00:03:16.700> who<00:03:16.850> their<00:03:17.000> real<00:03:17.180> friends<00:03:17.480> are

it's<00:03:21.950> very<00:03:22.130> difficult<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.300> it's

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
it's very difficult and so it's

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.690 
it's very difficult and so it's
