um I noticed that they had some portals
to<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.310> never<00:04:47.700> niles<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.840> why<00:04:49.020> do<00:04:49.080> they<00:04:49.230> have

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
to the never niles like why do they have

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.530 
to the never niles like why do they have
portals<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:49.950> never<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.520> these<00:04:50.700> places<00:04:51.030> i

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
portals to the never in these places i

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.030 
portals to the never in these places i
also<00:04:52.080> have<00:04:52.290> to<00:04:52.380> go<00:04:52.470> make<00:04:52.650> sure<00:04:52.680> they<00:04:53.010> don't

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
also have to go make sure they don't

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.370 
also have to go make sure they don't
have<00:04:53.220> any<00:04:53.490> crazy<00:04:53.910> cities<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.720> never<00:04:54.960> they

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
have any crazy cities and the never they

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.730 
have any crazy cities and the never they
added<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:56.760> all's<00:04:56.850> ok<00:04:56.970> let's<00:04:57.870> go<00:04:57.990> down<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.380> never

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
added so all's ok let's go down to never

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.770 
added so all's ok let's go down to never
and<00:04:58.919> check<00:04:59.100> it<00:04:59.220> out<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.580> that's<00:05:00.330> where<00:05:00.750> we

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
and check it out and that's where we

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.980 
and check it out and that's where we
move<00:05:01.080> on<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.410> part<00:05:01.890> two<00:05:02.390> so<00:05:03.390> I<00:05:03.419> skip<00:05:03.870> ahead

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
move on to part two so I skip ahead

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.050 
move on to part two so I skip ahead
because<00:05:04.260> never<00:05:04.500> takes<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.830> min<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.070> load<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.520> we

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
because never takes a min to load and we

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.150 
because never takes a min to load and we
go<00:05:06.180> into<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.510> never<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.650> what<00:05:07.950> do<00:05:08.040> you<00:05:08.070> know

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
go into the never and what do you know

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.159 
go into the never and what do you know
there's<00:05:08.700> freaking<00:05:09.180> countries<00:05:09.690> in<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.930> never

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
there's freaking countries in the never

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.880 
there's freaking countries in the never
too<00:05:10.669> now<00:05:11.669> the<00:05:12.210> thing<00:05:12.419> about<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.229> my

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
too now the thing about it is in my

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.120 
too now the thing about it is in my
opinion<00:05:14.150> they're<00:05:15.150> even<00:05:15.540> bigger<00:05:15.840> in<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.890> never

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
opinion they're even bigger in the never

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.310 
opinion they're even bigger in the never
I<00:05:17.430> come<00:05:18.240> down<00:05:18.390> here<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.720> there's<00:05:18.900> just<00:05:19.110> tons

and tons of hick spawners I thought it'd

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.060

be<00:05:21.510> cool<00:05:21.600> if<00:05:21.870> they<00:05:22.080> respondents<00:05:22.680> for<00:05:22.830> all<00:05:22.950> the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
be cool if they respondents for all the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.620

from<00:06:02.229> cities<00:06:02.560> from<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.889> middle<00:06:03.250> so<00:06:04.150> we<00:06:04.270> come

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
from cities from the middle so we come

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:05.730 
from cities from the middle so we come
up<00:06:04.600> and<00:06:04.750> we<00:06:04.810> see<00:06:04.990> those<00:06:05.139> are<00:06:05.289> the<00:06:05.380> cities<00:06:05.620> in

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
for miles and miles like to explore that

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.810 
for miles and miles like to explore that
would<00:06:19.960> be<00:06:20.139> crazy<00:06:20.620> that's<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.250> portal<00:06:21.520> we<00:06:21.610> came

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
would be crazy that's the portal we came

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.370 
would be crazy that's the portal we came
in<00:06:21.970> it<00:06:22.090> we<00:06:22.210> start<00:06:22.449> at<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.660> top<00:06:22.840> and<00:06:22.900> we<00:06:23.169> made

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
in it we start at the top and we made

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.100 
in it we start at the top and we made
our<00:06:23.500> way<00:06:23.530> down<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:24.070> bottom<00:06:24.310> but<00:06:25.300> just<00:06:25.600> wow

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
our way down to the bottom but just wow

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.140 
our way down to the bottom but just wow
when<00:06:26.410> I<00:06:26.500> win<00:06:26.650> this<00:06:26.800> never<00:06:27.130> I<00:06:27.250> was<00:06:27.550> even<00:06:27.849> more

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
when I win this never I was even more

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.140 
when I win this never I was even more
impressed<00:06:28.380> like<00:06:29.380> these<00:06:29.560> cities<00:06:29.949> are<00:06:30.150> insane

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
impressed like these cities are insane

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.510 
impressed like these cities are insane
so<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:31.930> eventually<00:06:32.229> made<00:06:32.560> my<00:06:32.680> way<00:06:32.860> back<00:06:32.889> to<00:06:33.370> the

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
so I eventually made my way back to the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.370 
so I eventually made my way back to the
very<00:06:33.550> beginning<00:06:34.539> of<00:06:34.630> the<00:06:34.720> city<00:06:34.990> where<00:06:35.229> it

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
very beginning of the city where it

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.290 
very beginning of the city where it
starts<00:06:35.800> off<00:06:35.979> at<00:06:36.250> it<00:06:36.400> kind<00:06:36.610> of<00:06:36.639> leads<00:06:36.880> to<00:06:37.210> the

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
starts off at it kind of leads to the

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.790 
starts off at it kind of leads to the
beginning<00:06:37.599> like<00:06:37.630> we<00:06:37.870> did<00:06:38.080> when<00:06:38.650> we<00:06:38.710> first

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
beginning like we did when we first

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.430 
beginning like we did when we first
started<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.370> video<00:06:39.960> but<00:06:40.960> I<00:06:40.990> just<00:06:41.229> thought

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
started the video but I just thought

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.890 
started the video but I just thought
this<00:06:41.620> mod<00:06:41.919> was<00:06:42.190> insane<00:06:42.849> and<00:06:43.419> i<00:06:43.539> think<00:06:43.780> it<00:06:43.870> just

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
this mod was insane and i think it just

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.260 
this mod was insane and i think it just
came<00:06:44.260> out<00:06:44.320> it<00:06:44.740> just<00:06:44.770> got<00:06:45.220> posted<00:06:45.460> on<00:06:45.760> my<00:06:45.849> mob
