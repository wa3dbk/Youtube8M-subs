00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:09.930
 Subtitle: Motorsportal.hu 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.930
 You drive? 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.330
 Yes, I have to drive. 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.330
 Can you drive and ask at the same time? 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.330
 I will do all I can to do this. 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.330
 This is the great stuff that preventsâ€¦ 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.330
 ... the wind blows. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.330
 Yes. 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.330
 Michael, my first question, - wait a while, here's the button, 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.330
 for this wind thing, you know. There is an advertisement in which a dog's ears float. 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.330
 I'd like to try this ear thing, but since I have no ears, I don't notice anything. 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 Do you feel something in your ears? 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.930
 I have no ears for sailing, so I don't feel too much. 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.030
 I don't feel anything. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.030
 Sure it will be felt soon as we reach the highway. 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.730
 Okay, then we'll try it later. 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.730
 I have heard today and I have to protest with hand-foot protests that some idiots say 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.730
 You have built the car according to your liking so now you are doing well while the other guy is not. 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.730
 I told you that this is an insane stupidity, but you may be able to explain it better. 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.730
 Listen, I can only explain this to you, no matter where 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.730
 and when or in which team I competed, the car was never built specifically for me. 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.730
 Nico and I are reporting the same problems. 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.730
 So we face the same difficulties and have the same ideas on how to develop. 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.730
 This also helps the team a lot. 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.730
 For the team, yes, because you can go in one direction. 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.730
 In this respect, I think that Nico and I are well aligned with each other, and that is what makes the team ahead. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.730
 I would be very interested in the question of when you retired from Ferrari, what was the reason why 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.730
 you said it was enough and what was behind it or what motivated you when 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.730
 have you stated that you no longer want to do this? 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.730
 Yes, motivation was the reason, more precisely the lack of motivation to continue. 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.730
 There was nothing I could have achieved, and I didn't really enjoy it. 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.730
 I was constantly surrounded by a big fuss, which I got tired of for years and picked up a little. 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.730
 What happened in the environment. 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.730
 Outside the track? 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.730
 That's exactly what this is about. Not only the press, but also a lot of testing, traveling, and many more. 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.730
 The press is, of course, and sometimes even uncomfortable. 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.730
 You can get tired of this. 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.730
 In this case, you ask yourself why I do this? 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.730
 There are so many things I want to enjoy. 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.730
 That's exactly what I did in the last three years, and that was my pleasure. 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.730
 This is now much more noticeable, and that is why I thought it was 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.730
 "why can't I do something serious again?" 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.730
 I've been trying out a lot of toys in the last three years and I feel pretty young. 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.730
 That was also the summer that I realized that 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.730
 I don't need much to re-activate my sensor. 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.730
 and I felt it could be half-way. 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.730
 I thought I'd try it again, and on top of it the Ross-Mercedes combination was exciting. 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.730
 The basics were right so you could feel at home right away 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.730
 and you could say that there is a great opportunity here to go. 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.730
 Exactly. I have good pointers because I know where I am, and I feel that it makes sense, 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.730
 because I would never have gone to any new team or McLaren 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.730
 wherever I don't know where I stand. 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.730
 I have always said that a seven-time champion is on a different level and you would not be a seven-time champion 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.730
 if you weren't seven times better than all the other pilots. Now, of course, I'm a little overwhelmed as many others. 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:25.730
 How much did you get to do with this, to bring the fight with these young boys now? 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.730
 Certainly there are not many people who can fight at age 41 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.730
 with these guys and even competitive. 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.730
 I think I can still tell you about this. 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.730
 Now, specifically, Red Bull is dictating a huge pace, 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.730
 and surpass everyone. If you are now behind them ... 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.930
 This has not been successful yet. 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.730
 What's your opinion: What do you think is faster than your car? 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.730
 Maybe the whole package? 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.730
 Yes, we are always talking about the whole package, and usually not one thing 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.730
 but it is aerodynamics that works great at Red Bull. 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.730
 During the comparisons of fast and moderately fast bends 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.730
 are also very strong. Of course Mark and Sebastian are getting out of the car, 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.730
 this should be left. Not only is the car good, the guys are doing well. 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.730
 But to get back to it, I'll tell you that this thing is great here. Though you went slow enough.
