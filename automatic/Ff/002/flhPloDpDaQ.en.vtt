00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
they recently did a video on the yoga

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.350 
they recently did a video on the yoga
limpets<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.379> think<00:00:07.379> was<00:00:07.500> episode<00:00:07.859> one<00:00:08.360> they

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
limpets and think was episode one they

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.879 
limpets and think was episode one they
have<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.570> minigame<00:00:09.840> called<00:00:10.260> dodge<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.710> now

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
have this minigame called dodge it now

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.850 
have this minigame called dodge it now
I've<00:00:11.759> recreated<00:00:12.599> my<00:00:12.870> own<00:00:13.170> version<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.710> this

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
I've recreated my own version of this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.550 
I've recreated my own version of this
minigame<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.599> I<00:00:15.599> believe<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.990> sits<00:00:16.410> slightly

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
minigame and I believe it sits slightly

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
minigame and I believe it sits slightly
better<00:00:17.010> than<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.609> they<00:00:17.640> featured

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
better than the one that they featured

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:28.429 
better than the one that they featured
as<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.949> fire<00:00:23.150> you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.330> fire<00:00:24.600> off<00:00:27.410> one<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
as you can fire you can fire off one of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.950 
as you can fire you can fire off one of
these<00:00:28.650> lanes<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.570> press<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> other

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
these lanes and the press on the other

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.580 
these lanes and the press on the other
side<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:32.009> fire<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.910> well<00:00:33.140> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> same

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
side can fire one as well on the same

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
side can fire one as well on the same
Lane<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.100> they'll<00:00:35.610> pass<00:00:35.880> right<00:00:36.149> through<00:00:36.210> each

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
Lane and they'll pass right through each

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.680 
Lane and they'll pass right through each
other<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> they<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:38.730> block<00:00:39.120> or<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> doesn't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
other so they don't block or it doesn't

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.069 
other so they don't block or it doesn't
jam<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.230> anything<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.540> why<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.570> game<00:00:42.840> works

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
jam or anything and why the game works

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
jam or anything and why the game works
is<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.500> simply<00:00:43.910> stand<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:46.100> try<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
is you simply stand here and you try and

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.920 

fortunately<00:00:59.080> I<00:00:59.110> can't<00:00:59.350> really<00:00:59.560> demonstrate

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
fortunately I can't really demonstrate

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:11.490 
fortunately I can't really demonstrate
the<00:01:01.930> pass-through<00:01:02.230> ability<00:01:09.840> no<00:01:10.840> not<00:01:11.260> gonna<00:01:11.440> be

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
the pass-through ability no not gonna be

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.160 
the pass-through ability no not gonna be
able<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.680> get<00:01:11.800> there<00:01:11.920> fast<00:01:12.100> enough<00:01:13.170> basically

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
able to get there fast enough basically

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.780 
able to get there fast enough basically
have<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:14.620> on<00:01:14.740> multiplayer<00:01:15.100> server<00:01:15.490> play

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
have this on multiplayer server play

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.110 
have this on multiplayer server play
with<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.000> couple<00:01:16.330> people<00:01:17.760> when<00:01:18.760> you<00:01:18.850> hit<00:01:19.000> that

button<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.450> other<00:01:19.600> player<00:01:19.810> hits<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.110> other

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
button the other player hits the other

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.290 
button the other player hits the other
one<00:01:20.440> if<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.160> both<00:01:21.400> happen<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.820> stand<00:01:22.150> here

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
one if you both happen to stand here

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.990 
one if you both happen to stand here
you'll<00:01:22.540> both<00:01:22.720> get<00:01:22.900> knocked<00:01:23.140> off<00:01:23.290> so<00:01:24.000> it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
you'll both get knocked off so it's

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.270 
you'll both get knocked off so it's
that's<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.420> pass-through<00:01:25.630> method<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.410> this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
that's the pass-through method and this

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.770 
that's the pass-through method and this
is<00:01:27.369> just<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.640> Redstone<00:01:28.270> behind<00:01:28.660> it<00:01:28.869> I<00:01:30.780> could

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
is just the Redstone behind it I could

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.050 
is just the Redstone behind it I could
optimize<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.440> bit<00:01:32.590> but<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:33.190> couldn't<00:01:34.000> be

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
optimize it a bit but I couldn't be

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.249 
optimize it a bit but I couldn't be
bothered<00:01:34.240> really<00:01:34.690> I've<00:01:35.130> sort<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.210> manually

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
bothered really I've sort of manually

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.950 
bothered really I've sort of manually
timed<00:01:38.259> everything<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:42.119> some<00:01:43.119> layers<00:01:43.420> had<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
timed everything as some layers had a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.260 
timed everything as some layers had a
little<00:01:44.140> quirks<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.740> them<00:01:44.950> don't<00:01:45.369> know<00:01:45.520> why<00:01:45.850> but

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
little quirks to them don't know why but

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.430 
little quirks to them don't know why but
yes<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.350> sort<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.590> just<00:01:48.420> optimized<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.660> so<00:01:49.900> each

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
yes I sort of just optimized it so each

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.270 
yes I sort of just optimized it so each
button<00:01:50.950> would<00:01:51.130> fire<00:01:51.460> off<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:53.100> sort<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.160> the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
button would fire off the sort of the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.980 
button would fire off the sort of the
pulse<00:01:54.550> at<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.360> same<00:01:55.630> rate<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.569> how<00:01:58.840> I'm

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
pulse at the same rate this is how I'm

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.290 
pulse at the same rate this is how I'm
controlling<00:01:59.410> each<00:01:59.679> of<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.950> Pistons<00:02:00.940> that<00:02:01.119> pop

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
controlling each of the Pistons that pop

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.440 
controlling each of the Pistons that pop
up<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:02.670> you'll<00:02:03.670> notice<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:03.970> there's<00:02:04.119> two

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
up and you'll notice that there's two

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.650 
up and you'll notice that there's two
layers<00:02:05.429> we<00:02:06.429> go<00:02:06.580> back<00:02:06.729> here<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:08.350> layers<00:02:08.619> for

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
layers we go back here one layers for

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380 
layers we go back here one layers for
one<00:02:10.660> direction<00:02:11.080> going<00:02:11.910> left<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.000> right<00:02:13.090> any

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
one direction going left to right any

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.160 
one direction going left to right any
other<00:02:13.480> one<00:02:13.690> going<00:02:13.930> right<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.560> left<00:02:14.740> and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
other one going right to the left and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.960 
other one going right to the left and
that<00:02:17.170> basically<00:02:17.440> covers<00:02:17.710> this<00:02:18.340> dodge<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.819> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
that basically covers this dodge it and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.390 
that basically covers this dodge it and
i'll<00:02:19.780> put<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.230> link<00:02:20.260> up<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.740> description<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
i'll put a link up in the description of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.360 
i'll put a link up in the description of
