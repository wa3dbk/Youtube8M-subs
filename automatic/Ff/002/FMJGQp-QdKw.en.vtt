00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.570
 so its faq 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.180
 and today i will show how to install 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 shaders on 1.6.2 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.970
 so I found f3 and more precisely in the upper left 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.550
 In the corner, you see that I have version 1.6.2 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.910
 still works of course not stable so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.870
 as this is another 2 only release shaders on 1 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 6 2 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.740
 many with shadows and so on but also spend 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.130
 You can already look like this 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:49.960
 + faq shaders ie many shaders 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:53.080
 here to say a big controversy collection here's how 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.590
 we see the horse but all the shaders and shadows and 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:01.780
 all but how I repeat work 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.920
 still not very good as apparently there 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.150
 lighting bugs but they also like 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.570
 when we are even now still flies to him 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.920
 not recovered well, it's nothing at all 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.619
 does not mean 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.930
 still saying that this is another 2 only release 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.580
 shaders i.e. they still work 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.390
 unstable here can not be installed 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.990
 optifine that is, have to play with 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.259
 lags 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.130
 but I do not have these lags now 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:42.399
 40 fps somewhere is here now see 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:46.510
 even at 3741 but also when recording happens 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.370
 frames crouch so much 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.740
 define is not installed at all 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.870
 that is, if we put optifine you 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.720
 together with the shaders there simply 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:00.190
 will fly out ie we are a game well and so let's 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.820
 let's begin how to install so to us 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.250
 need for minekravt forch which we 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.700
 we can download the link that will be in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.090
 description we need the latest version then 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.910
 There is this recommended for 1 6 2 then 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.350
 there is a click we need exactly the installer 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.930
 i.e. installer 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.510
 and would click here or click it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.670
 us on a star on a star we 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.020
 push 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.230
 do not support the manufacturer 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.590
 better click on the words installer there you are 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.060
 go through consider the topics 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.040
 most support and developers so i 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.690
 already downloaded it later all show 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.670
 now we need exactly the shader that is 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.220
 shader mod, that is, it shaders themselves 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.920
 modification to install shaders 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.640
 the link will also be in the description click 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.620
 just talent download it now to us 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.650
 need 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.769
 shaderpack then there are a lot of shaders i 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.410
 showed earlier that link will also be in 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.610
 description 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.610
 so proceed to the next step and so 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.970
 here we see these files of ours 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.020
 downloaded so the first thing open 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.380
 minecraft forge 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.690
 that is, just click on it twice 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.100
 This is how this one opens 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.040
 say installer installer in my lane 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.220
 craft is not on this path that is 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.630
 not according to the standard me is in 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:45.320
 another place here I chose now just 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:48.260
 click ok and forge is installed successfully 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.170
 informs everything click ok 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.140
 the next step is to install with 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.740
 shaders of fashion that is taking on 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.740
 we copy 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.340
 first in minecraft mods that is here 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.960
 we insert here we have 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.340
 now prepare it immediately 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.569
 shader pack that is, we extract it then 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.989
 there is 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.570
 here it is this folder 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.220
 it is a shader pack without copying 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.610
 too but i cut it out because i'm here 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.330
 need and paste just here in this folder 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.660
 where are we 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.270
 files themselves minecraft photos on Vitim 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.820
 shaderpack he always copied 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.770
 now you only need so 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:47.160
 run the launcher let's run 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:51.620
 our launcher, that is, we are launching it 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.360
 wait and so here we go out to the launcher and 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.970
 we choose we need to choose a profile then 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.520
 have we choose the profile forge but 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.580
 if suddenly for some reason he has not 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.639
 established then create a new profile without 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.419
 differences with which name we choose here 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:13.500
 release 162 defacement that is, he himself does not 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.940
 will forget and all click site profile i 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.430
 I will not do this as I have 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.780
 the profile is saved here it is more accurate 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.030
 was created 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.220
 I think many will also be created there 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.860
 that problems will not arise 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.780
 here and I choose it I click play 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.000
 between water our minecraft started 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.750
 as we see mikrofonchik he 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.320
 installs well and 4 4 mods 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:43.560
 I installed for no mods us 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.860
 only one interests here we open 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.919
 map shaders as we see leaders of you 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.120
 work that is and came back on too 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:56.020
 the very place where I was, but I say it again 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.880
 what 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:04.970
 it is still not stable and also here 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.390
 a bunch of shaders that is, we see very 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:14.270
 A lot of them are different from every taste and color as 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:15.050
 it says here but as we see here here 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.540
 such lines 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.500
 what and said that bugs are still very 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.270
 a lot that's all sure to like 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.750
 and tell your friends to all 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.860
 stop the shaders be sure to write 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.630
 comments like you tutorial that is 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.330
 did the tutorial help you install 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.760
 shader but what if any 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.170
 questions then write in the comments I 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.210
 I will try to answer them that's all 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:49.690
 instruction 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.690
 adhoc like subscribe bye
