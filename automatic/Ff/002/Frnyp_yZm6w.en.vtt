00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.690
 Good this video here, quickie, it's just for 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.840
 you see the quality of the southern screen and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.429
 which is a sensational screen I had an LG 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.970
 optimus g with clan ips clans and I dedicate to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.189
 screen 12 which is much more beautiful 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.260
 more vivid colors much better 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 defined than the elect even try 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 or ips 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.029
 detail the viewing angle really 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 loses there g 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.780
 but between us at what time you use 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 your phone so the populace to be honest 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.160
 People use their cell phones and look at them . 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 come on anyway, come on then 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 see only if the viewing angle is also 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 As terrible as they talk about it. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.590
 so I'll play now on the video you guys 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.379
 will see more the doctor is that the quality 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.059
 him from the side for you guys to have 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.059
 notion of the angle of vision as there 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.559
 I think it's a tremendous lack of things to do. 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:13.030
 these articles talking about angle of view 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:16.570
 On cell phone, for God's sake, let's go there. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.390
 There is so terrible there is no division 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.759
 sony to make such a product. 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.939
 so bad with the top phone with a 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.659
 bad screen really think sony will 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.659
 do such a business 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:59.200
 kansai loses definition of course 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.509
 loses but it's not horrible like Pharaoh 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.509
 as if he saw practically nothing 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.580
 This for me only has one name missing from it. 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.640
 do 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.550
 did not think they criticized the device 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.070
 that the appliance is very good and I will not go there 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.840
 criticizing the viewing angle is not 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.480
 finally I think this is a tremendous nonsense but 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.050
 So the video proves to you that the angle 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.630
 of vision is not so horrible as well 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.080
 It's an angle of vision, it's not good. 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.590
 like the ips screen but then you do not use the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.050
 cell phone you use it in front of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.330
 a wonderful full hd screen in 5 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.520
 inch has only one definition setting 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.620
 amazing and looking forward is very 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.400
 more beautiful because the screen ips of the optimal 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.739
 g 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.550
 I assure you, I swear by whom. 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.070
 You wanted me to have a great way. 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.400
 that this screen that even not being the ps 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.400
 win 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.910
 the soccer 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:38.360
 where I do not want anyone to suffer evil there 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.360
 so I think Maria 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:49.180
 anyone who quits just needs to take turns 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.379
 in hero 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.630
 aha 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.350
 ae 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.380
 is 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.900
 so it's there for you my xperia z 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.789
 great camera with a camera 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.629
 amazing and a screen is also amazing 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:50.719
 stop with this little story aimee mann is 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.300
 amoed minimum fps you even think that 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:56.599
 sony to do some personal crap until 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.080
 it's wonderful looking forward looking 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.280
 aside actually it loses some 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.169
 lost so much by technology 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.030
 used as per the movie that sony 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.979
 install the devices if you do not know 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.849
 about your film I see in another video 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.699
 it is not said there made this myth that the 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.529
 zac screen is bad and broken this myth 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.469
 also that the viewing angle is 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:21.560
 horrible horrible and worthless too 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.939
 does not get to that point here so this is it 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.849
 I hope you have enjoyed it and a 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:28.400
 video is neither produced nor is it 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.620
 finger marks on mp the screen to do 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.990
 so it worked for the better. 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.990
 I wanted a hug, thanks
