00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.750 
up because I'm making the expresso I
take<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.780> whole<00:00:57.989> thing<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> cup

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
take this whole thing out to put a cup

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.400 
take this whole thing out to put a cup
underneath<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> uh<00:01:03.049> there's<00:01:04.049> mine

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
underneath there and uh there's mine

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.430 
underneath there and uh there's mine
espresso

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.780 

so<00:01:10.040> what<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.490> does<00:01:10.700> here<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.950> if<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:13.460> see

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
so what it does here is if you can see

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.030 
so what it does here is if you can see
in<00:01:13.940> here<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.480> is<00:01:14.660> a<00:01:14.690> little<00:01:14.930> different<00:01:15.040> but

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
in here this is a little different but

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.590 
in here this is a little different but
it<00:01:16.190> brews<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.790> coffee<00:01:17.120> inside<00:01:18.550> here<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:20.210> it

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
it brews the coffee inside here so it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.660 
it brews the coffee inside here so it
makes<00:01:20.780> two<00:01:21.110> puncture<00:01:21.470> marks<00:01:21.860> on<00:01:21.980> the<00:01:22.070> opposite

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
makes two puncture marks on the opposite

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.330 
makes two puncture marks on the opposite
side<00:01:22.850> on<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:23.120> side<00:01:23.800> one<00:01:24.800> here<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.160> one<00:01:25.250> here

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
side on this side one here and one here

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.360 
side on this side one here and one here
so<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.420> brews<00:01:26.990> inside<00:01:27.560> which<00:01:28.010> is<00:01:28.190> really

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
so that it brews inside which is really

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.250 
so that it brews inside which is really
cool<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.000> when<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:29.990> want<00:01:30.260> to<00:01:30.350> switch<00:01:30.620> I<00:01:32.260> can

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
cool so when I want to switch I can

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.590 
cool so when I want to switch I can
switch<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.720> that's<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.970> it's<00:01:37.970> done<00:01:38.090> now<00:01:38.420> it's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
switch and that's it it's done now it's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.790 
switch and that's it it's done now it's
going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.780> happen<00:01:38.930> is<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:39.350> going<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.530> go

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
going to happen is it's going to go

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.820 
going to happen is it's going to go
green<00:01:40.760> over<00:01:41.090> here<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:42.260> have<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.740> option<00:01:43.220> of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
green over here and I have the option of

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.680 
green over here and I have the option of
extending<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.550> brew<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.150> if<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.330> want<00:01:47.570> a

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
extending the brew so if I want a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.150 
extending the brew so if I want a
slightly<00:01:48.650> lighter<00:01:49.960> coffee<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.290> could<00:01:51.980> do<00:01:52.130> that

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
slightly lighter coffee I could do that

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.700 
slightly lighter coffee I could do that
so<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.550> can<00:01:52.760> hold<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.210> for<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.600> little<00:01:53.720> bit<00:01:53.900> you

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
so I can hold this for a little bit you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.790 
so I can hold this for a little bit you
know<00:01:54.830> like<00:01:54.979> 10<00:01:55.370> seconds<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.450> will<00:01:56.540> add

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
know like 10 seconds and it will add

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.520 
know like 10 seconds and it will add
more<00:01:57.800> water<00:01:58.130> into<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.700> mix<00:01:58.910> or<00:01:59.120> whatever<00:01:59.530> so

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
more water into the mix or whatever so

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.200 
more water into the mix or whatever so
be<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.710> lighter<00:02:00.890> brute<00:02:01.130> but<00:02:01.520> that's<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.940> it's

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
be a lighter brute but that's it it's

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.030 
be a lighter brute but that's it it's
done<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:02.930> stays<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.410> here<00:02:03.620> for<00:02:03.770> 20

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
done so this stays on here for 20

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.580 
done so this stays on here for 20
seconds<00:02:04.370> more<00:02:04.640> gives<00:02:05.420> me<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.600> option<00:02:05.870> but

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
seconds more gives me the option but

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.170 
seconds more gives me the option but
that's<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.670> vinit<00:02:08.390> turn<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> off<00:02:09.320> I'm<00:02:10.130> done<00:02:10.460> so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
that's it vinit turn it off I'm done so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.180 
that's it vinit turn it off I'm done so
on<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:12.800> also<00:02:12.980> has<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.989> has<00:02:18.500> an<00:02:18.709> indicator

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
on it also has here it has an indicator

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.030 
on it also has here it has an indicator
for<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:22.330> what<00:02:23.330> some<00:02:23.450> call<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.930> water<00:02:24.140> for

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
for the what some call for the water for

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.140 
for the what some call for the water for
the<00:02:25.130> filter<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.959> won't<00:02:27.290> let<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.150> make

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
the filter and it won't let you make

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.479 
the filter and it won't let you make
coffee<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.120> filter<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.300> bad<00:02:33.220> let's<00:02:34.220> lift

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
coffee if the filter is bad let's lift

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.740 
coffee if the filter is bad let's lift
this<00:02:34.580> up<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.060> has<00:02:35.209> something<00:02:35.600> back

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
this up because it has something back

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.570 
this up because it has something back
here<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.570> tea<00:02:39.440> disk<00:02:39.769> they<00:02:40.220> call<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.550> a

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
here this is a tea disk they call it a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.160 
here this is a tea disk they call it a
cleaner<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:43.459> goes<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:43.940> by<00:02:44.120> itself<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.900> it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
cleaner so this goes in by itself and it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.070 
cleaner so this goes in by itself and it
goes<00:02:45.380> through<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.739> cleaning<00:02:46.220> cycle<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:47.540> just

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
goes through a cleaning cycle to just

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.650 
goes through a cleaning cycle to just
you<00:02:48.230> know<00:02:48.350> do<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> regular<00:02:48.769> clean<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:49.670> every<00:02:50.180> I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
you know do a regular clean but every I

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.110 
you know do a regular clean but every I
don't<00:02:51.140> know<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.500> don't<00:02:52.489> know<00:02:52.610> what<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.910> amount

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
don't know I don't know what the amount

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.360
