00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.970 

which<00:00:29.119> was<00:00:29.300> manufactured<00:00:29.960> by<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.439> income

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
which was manufactured by the income

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.910 
which was manufactured by the income
corporation<00:00:32.260> which<00:00:33.260> also<00:00:33.470> produced<00:00:33.830> the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
corporation which also produced the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.900

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.970 

this<00:00:43.480> like<00:00:43.780> most<00:00:44.020> action<00:00:44.410> fleets<00:00:44.650> came<00:00:44.860> with

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
this like most action fleets came with

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.210 
this like most action fleets came with
two<00:00:45.190> figures<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.440> they<00:00:47.590> are<00:00:47.710> big<00:00:47.980> star

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
two figures and they are big star

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:56.779 
two figures and they are big star
collider<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.700> Luke<00:00:49.060> Skywalker

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.180 

not<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.719> many<00:00:57.839> features<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.589> so<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
not that many features on this so I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.619 
not that many features on this so I
think<00:00:59.309> about<00:00:59.699> three<00:01:00.620> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> pull<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.039> down

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
think about three if you pull this down

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.170 
think about three if you pull this down
this<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.870> rotate<00:01:04.019> 360<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.970> push<00:01:09.149> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
this can rotate 360 and you can push it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.160 
this can rotate 360 and you can push it
back<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:11.149> there's<00:01:12.149> also<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.869> button<00:01:13.140> on

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
back up there's also a little button on

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.139 
back up there's also a little button on
this<00:01:13.380> side<00:01:13.649> right<00:01:14.659> here<00:01:15.890> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.130> press<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
this side right here if you press it the

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.600 
this side right here if you press it the
missile<00:01:18.450> fires<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.659> red<00:01:21.780> missile

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
missile fires just a little red missile

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:32.059 
missile fires just a little red missile
and<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.789> goes<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.149> in<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> lastly

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
here the cockpit it's big enough for the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.169 
here the cockpit it's big enough for the
two<00:01:45.270> figures<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:46.369> put<00:01:47.369> them<00:01:47.460> both<00:01:47.580> in<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
two figures I put them both in so I

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:58.039 
two figures I put them both in so I
don't<00:01:48.360> lose<00:01:48.479> them<00:01:56.000> but<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.179> do<00:01:57.240> jumble

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
don't lose them but they do jumble

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.149 
don't lose them but they do jumble
around<00:01:58.289> in<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> little<00:01:58.740> bit

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.460 

I<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.930> like<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.200> ship<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:10.569> kind<00:02:11.380> of

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
I really like this ship it's kind of

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.800 
I really like this ship it's kind of
rare<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:13.120> not<00:02:13.239> really<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.630> tight

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
rare but it's not really like the tight

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.559 
rare but it's not really like the tight
offender<00:02:14.200> by<00:02:14.470> all<00:02:14.620> means<00:02:14.970> thing<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.090> eBay<00:02:16.390> this

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
offender by all means thing on eBay this

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.589 
offender by all means thing on eBay this
might<00:02:16.780> go<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.110> about<00:02:17.260> tops<00:02:18.099> 20<00:02:18.519> bucks<00:02:21.599> but

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
might go for about tops 20 bucks but

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.089 
might go for about tops 20 bucks but
again<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:22.930> really<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.560> ship

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
again I do really like this ship

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.940 
again I do really like this ship
I<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> little<00:02:25.870> designs<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.709> here

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
I like the little designs on here

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.620 
I like the little designs on here
they're<00:02:27.849> on<00:02:27.940> both<00:02:28.090> sides<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> overall

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
they're on both sides so overall

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.900 
they're on both sides so overall
probably<00:02:34.900> go<00:02:34.989> that's<00:02:35.170> about<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.709> seven<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.849> a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
probably go that's about a seven and a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:45.150 
probably go that's about a seven and a
half<00:02:41.370> that's<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.519> t16<00:02:43.060> skyhopper<00:02:44.040> hope<00:02:45.040> you
