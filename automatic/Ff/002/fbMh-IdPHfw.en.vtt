 therefore can be 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.660
 we have to think that over 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.420
 the contact person 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.030

 just like that here 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 Do not put up with it 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040

 after 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.729
 from the first one 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.159

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.139
 Chains laid 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139

 Photo Lohrmann 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.739
 it should not look that way 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.499
 and 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:45.169

 second call 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.009
 and then it just exists 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.359
 Pastor Jan DDR cursor keys so we can choose here 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.499
 which SIM card we want to call 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.209
 I try it with the first sympathetic 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.209

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.110
 around there we would just have to press the enter key 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.059
 and we have learned access to the usual features 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.460
 the mrs 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.689
 what do we still have 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.520
 these the cursor keys 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.449
 Ke here we go to the right 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.759
 we go to the left 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.370

 yes I think that was what you got so far 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.909
 Percent I think the whole functions can then stop 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.520
 Cologne the ball during 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.759
