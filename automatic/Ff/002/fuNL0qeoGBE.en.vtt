00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.780
 george and today I 'm going to show you 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.770
 the rom 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.260
 12 with android lollipop for samsung 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.140
 galaxy s 4 we will verify 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:38.350
 quickly and I'll show you that my 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.970
 version of that 4 is one and 337 m what 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.070
 I acquired with the cell's companion as 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.330
 you already know and loans to the version of 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.330
 android 5.0 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.860
 there is 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.329
 they were made it looks good we can 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.420
 observe that the menus changed 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.530
 pretty cool the green color with 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.969
 white and gray is pretty good 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.969
 let's quickly verify 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.410
 that in messaging we can see the keyboard 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.610
 and it looks pretty good it 's pretty nice 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.610
 and very different from what was gentle 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.760
 let's start it 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.530
 let's go to the dance 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.920
 we are going to observe here how the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.590
 contacts and in fact 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.460
 we can just make the call with the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.460
 numeric keyboard 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.130
 let's see a little more 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.960
 us and quickly we are going to forgive 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.390
 eat a little 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.229
 let's try what it would be 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.229
 the camera 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.409
 list 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.080
 I can be change to video 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.590
 we can perform part of the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.590
 configurations 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.420
 we can not access the photos that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.420
 we take previously 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.709
 OK 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.819
 let's see the applications of 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.819
 calculator for example 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.850
 with colors 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.810
 pretty guys 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.810
 calendar 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.960
 I 'm not very impressive but very 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.320
 different from what we were 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.530
 used and well let's see the 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.569
 part of the notification bar 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.980
 it looks pretty good I like the style 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.170
 quite the color combination 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.750
 he also helped him a lot 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.220
 let's look at this option which is the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.330
 option to transmit screen in this 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.520
 case you can do some device 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.410
 as comcast 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.700
 that is available or by 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.140
 example, what am I doing with 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.140
 sprint to remember 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.450
 Besides users can add 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.790
 users add a guest user nothing 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.480
 more in this case I am the only user of 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.480
 this terminal 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.230
 quickly 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.090
 and an option here is the button 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.370
 if we activate it we can see in the bar 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.860
 lower 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.510
 how the buttons are activated but 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.489
 automatically that makes it 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.500
 deactivate the two buttons in semi 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.110
 physicists who are next to the hang button 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.660
 on the front of the phone 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.450
 we do want to simply have the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.010
 virtual part or the virtual buttons do not 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.010
 we want it, we can turn it off 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.640
 OK 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.630
 otherwise I change it a lot in this 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.010
 case I have the nova launcher installed 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.330
 but normally it comes with the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.330
 jianlong launcher in mod 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.970
 I also like this more 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.410
 let's access 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.410
 music music player 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.080
 but little 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.020
 ready music limited 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.620
 90 days free and after is an income 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.389
 of 99 pesos makes me pretty enough 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.770
 good for all those who like it 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.770
 listen to clear music is 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.250
 the google application google now 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.830
 also with the right colors 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.900
 I can not show you the others are 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.639
 applications that I have downloaded 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.430
 system applications 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.039
 we owe the phone and we saw the rest 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.480

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.810
