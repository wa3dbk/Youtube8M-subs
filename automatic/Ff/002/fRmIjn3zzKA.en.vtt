00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
useful it's not but that Apple said well

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.400 
useful it's not but that Apple said well
it's<00:03:14.640> still<00:03:14.730> too<00:03:14.970> thin<00:03:15.239> right<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:16.049> mean<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.260> was

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
it's still too thin right I mean I was

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.740 
it's still too thin right I mean I was
actually<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.739> session<00:03:17.070> make<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.310> thicker<00:03:17.750> gap

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
actually a session make it thicker gap

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.060 
actually a session make it thicker gap
rocks<00:03:19.049> are<00:03:19.230> known<00:03:19.350> for<00:03:19.500> being<00:03:19.560> really<00:03:19.709> thin

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
rocks are known for being really thin

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.470 
rocks are known for being really thin
and<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.820> if<00:03:20.880> you're<00:03:21.000> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> make<00:03:21.329> it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
and so if you're going to make it

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.610 
and so if you're going to make it
thicker<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.019> don't<00:03:22.170> want<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:22.470> go

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
thicker you don't want to just go

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.830 
thicker you don't want to just go
halfway<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.790> want<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.060> really<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.600> want<00:03:24.780> to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
halfway you want to really you want to

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.630 
halfway you want to really you want to
push<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.260> want<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.530> know<00:03:25.680> you've<00:03:26.100> got<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
push it you want to know you've got the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.970 
push it you want to know you've got the
power<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:27.209> android<00:03:27.420> behind<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:28.829> went

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
power of android behind you so we went

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.410 
power of android behind you so we went
all<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.340> way<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:32.459> far<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:32.850> we<00:03:33.000> could

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
all the way this as far as we could

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.510 
all the way this as far as we could
and<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.510> think<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:36.010> this<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.220> place<00:03:37.490> where

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
and I think that this is a place where

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.760 
and I think that this is a place where
if<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.240> had<00:03:38.420> eighty<00:03:38.930> percent<00:03:39.200> vision<00:03:39.680> you

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
if you had eighty percent vision you

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.090 
if you had eighty percent vision you
would<00:03:39.890> stop<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.790> would<00:03:40.880> say<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.890> fine<00:03:42.890> we

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
would stop you would say this is fine we

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.950 
would stop you would say this is fine we
didn't<00:03:43.400> as<00:03:43.670> more<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.360> this<00:03:44.570> is<00:03:44.750> really

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
didn't as more this is this is really

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.930 
didn't as more this is this is really
good<00:03:45.230> now<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:45.800> a<00:03:45.830> motorola<00:03:46.280> move<00:03:46.520> I<00:03:46.640> yeah
