00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
a couple of days and then normally when

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.290 
a couple of days and then normally when
I<00:02:26.860> really<00:02:27.010> happy<00:02:27.310> when<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.700> use<00:02:27.850> products<00:02:28.269> that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
I really happy when I use products that

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.130 
I really happy when I use products that
define<00:02:28.630> my<00:02:28.810> curls<00:02:30.060> those<00:02:31.060> white<00:02:31.269> chunks<00:02:31.540> are

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.660 
define my curls those white chunks are
gone<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:32.800> soon<00:02:33.010> as<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.280> dry<00:02:33.519> but<00:02:35.550> continue<00:02:36.550> to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
gone as soon as it dry but continue to

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.880 
gone as soon as it dry but continue to
think<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.300> mean<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:37.989> could<00:02:38.140> be<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.500> used<00:02:38.769> a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
think I mean it could be that I used a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.000 
think I mean it could be that I used a
lot<00:02:39.069> that's<00:02:39.310> about<00:02:39.459> trying<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.940> find<00:02:40.150> my<00:02:40.299> curls

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
lot that's about trying to find my curls

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.070 
lot that's about trying to find my curls
but<00:02:42.010> with<00:02:42.250> my<00:02:42.430> hair<00:02:42.760> texture<00:02:43.239> out<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.450> do<00:02:43.780> need<00:02:44.049> a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
but with my hair texture out I do need a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.750 
but with my hair texture out I do need a
lot<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.620> little<00:02:44.860> bit<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.280> not<00:02:45.430> gonna<00:02:45.670> do

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
lot a little bit it's not gonna do

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.960 
lot a little bit it's not gonna do
anything<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.470> did<00:02:47.650> define<00:02:47.920> my<00:02:48.190> curls<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:48.940> I

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
anything but it did define my curls so I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.850 
anything but it did define my curls so I
was<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.690> was<00:02:49.900> shocked<00:02:50.110> about<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.380> because<00:02:50.769> I

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
was I was shocked about that because I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.920 
was I was shocked about that because I
wasn't<00:02:51.040> expecting<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.819> define<00:02:52.660> them<00:02:52.810> at

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
wasn't expecting it to define them at

ever to leave in conditioner but it

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.330 
ever to leave in conditioner but it
makes<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.600> more<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:47.530> effort<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.160> try<00:03:48.310> to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
makes it more more effort to try to

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.250 
makes it more more effort to try to
define<00:03:48.700> my<00:03:48.880> curls<00:03:49.180> with<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:49.660> conditioner

didn't really care for I don't know I

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.979 
didn't really care for I don't know I
think<00:03:56.750> care<00:03:57.049> for<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.349> first<00:03:57.500> day<00:03:57.799> rather<00:03:58.989> so

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
think care for the first day rather so

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.500 
think care for the first day rather so
yeah<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.890> feel<00:04:01.010> like<00:04:01.519> though<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.970> conditioner

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
yeah I feel like though the conditioner

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.240 
yeah I feel like though the conditioner
is<00:04:02.750> just<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.110> leave-in<00:04:03.349> conditioner<00:04:03.890> but<00:04:04.099> not

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
is just a leave-in conditioner but not

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.339 
is just a leave-in conditioner but not
to<00:04:04.489> define<00:04:04.790> my<00:04:04.939> product<00:04:05.360> maybe<00:04:05.930> should<00:04:06.200> have<00:04:06.230> a

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
to define my product maybe should have a

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.500 
to define my product maybe should have a
looser<00:04:06.769> curl<00:04:07.010> pattern<00:04:07.340> if<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.819> work<00:04:08.090> wonders

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
looser curl pattern if I work wonders

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.360 
looser curl pattern if I work wonders
for<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.409> you<00:04:09.470> can<00:04:09.590> ride<00:04:09.739> full<00:04:10.040> up<00:04:10.220> in

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
for you then you can ride full up in

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.830 
for you then you can ride full up in
