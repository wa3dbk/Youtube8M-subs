 Then turn around again and put it in the locale 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:13.480
 Let's get rid of the pencil line and turn the voting rate off . 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:17.109
 In the case of the top of the luer, 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.859
 Inside the control section 9 are pre-guessing width 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.859
 A little inside 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.439
 So get rid of it. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.439
 After you set your flesh 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 la Where the air breaks down into this area 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:44.610
 Corner corresponds to the drawing, so if you have wires that open the yogi 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.640
 What happens when you are not around is when you graduate later 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.659
 There are a lot of grooves in this way. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.610
 So, the first part of the act is science. 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.610
 Yogeo are we exactly jjareureu a top d 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.030
 Do not just draw a bowl next to 45 degrees exactly at the yogi corner 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.679
 Just saw it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.679
 Oh, it 's just different. 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.790
 Oh, it's like saying 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.600
 After you 're here , this is the opposite way . 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:34.550
 Oh, so are you one minute the pain suddenly hotter GB 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:40.400

 Now in the context of the four inside the United States unconditionally here 45 slept wrapped in Yogyakarta 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.580
 Even then, not all cards haneunge pointed to the fact that even in the flowers unconditional cooking 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.290
 I need to know. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:55.550
 So when it's like this 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.940
 In the case of eight on the top, you can do this in a later fashion. 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.020
 Where do I put juneunde put more jjaya this the next time you load compartment that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.430
