i<00:01:40.729> say<00:01:40.909> that<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.719> characters<00:01:41.930> actually

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
i say that the characters actually

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.780 
i say that the characters actually
appeared<00:01:42.770> in<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> bunch<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.189> crossover<00:01:43.700> it's

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
appeared in a bunch of crossover it's

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.310 
appeared in a bunch of crossover it's
like<00:01:43.909> he<00:01:44.030> was<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.329> brave<00:01:44.540> in<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.750> bold<00:01:44.930> comic

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
like he was in a brave in the bold comic

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.440 
like he was in a brave in the bold comic
but<00:01:45.649> typically<00:01:46.100> whenever<00:01:46.340> he<00:01:46.759> appears<00:01:47.210> in

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
but typically whenever he appears in

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.450 
but typically whenever he appears in
other<00:01:47.780> comics<00:01:48.229> he's<00:01:48.619> following<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.130> atom

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
other comics he's following the atom

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.429 
other comics he's following the atom
around<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:49.909> it's<00:01:50.030> like<00:01:50.149> atom<00:01:50.659> crossovers<00:01:51.229> like

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
around so it's like atom crossovers like

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.050 
around so it's like atom crossovers like
The<00:01:51.649> Brave<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> bold<00:01:52.040> title<00:01:52.340> was<00:01:52.610> an<00:01:52.729> atom

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
The Brave and the bold title was an atom

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.209 
The Brave and the bold title was an atom
aquaman<00:01:53.570> crossover<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:54.680> he's<00:01:54.829> more<00:01:55.039> of<00:01:55.130> an

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
aquaman crossover so he's more of an

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.550 
aquaman crossover so he's more of an
atom<00:01:55.520> villain<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.479> if<00:01:56.719> we<00:01:56.869> see<00:01:57.049> Emily<00:01:57.380> Kinney

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
atom villain so if we see Emily Kinney

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.770 
atom villain so if we see Emily Kinney
after<00:01:58.039> this<00:01:58.219> episode<00:01:58.399> it'll<00:01:59.180> probably<00:01:59.420> be

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
after this episode it'll probably be

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.719 
after this episode it'll probably be
when<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.110> atom<00:02:00.439> crosses<00:02:00.860> over<00:02:01.159> with<00:02:01.189> another

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
when the atom crosses over with another

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.130 
when the atom crosses over with another
show<00:02:02.000> like<00:02:02.240> if<00:02:02.329> he<00:02:02.450> crosses<00:02:02.689> over<00:02:02.960> with<00:02:02.990> the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
show like if he crosses over with the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.810 
show like if he crosses over with the
flash<00:02:03.350> again<00:02:03.680> or<00:02:04.100> if<00:02:04.219> he<00:02:04.280> crosses<00:02:04.490> over<00:02:04.789> with

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
flash again or if he crosses over with

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.240 
flash again or if he crosses over with
arrow<00:02:05.180> I'm<00:02:05.750> expecting<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.439> crossovers<00:02:07.039> will

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
arrow I'm expecting that crossovers will

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.949 
arrow I'm expecting that crossovers will
get<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.430> little<00:02:07.700> bit<00:02:07.880> crazier<00:02:08.390> next<00:02:08.720> year<00:02:08.840> just

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
get a little bit crazier next year just

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.509 
get a little bit crazier next year just
because<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.500> spin-off<00:02:09.890> series<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.399> I'll

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
because of the spin-off series but I'll

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.520 
because of the spin-off series but I'll
try<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:10.910> explain<00:02:11.209> that<00:02:11.359> a<00:02:11.420> little<00:02:11.480> bit<00:02:11.720> Stephen

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530

Amell just teased that the way they do

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.490 
Amell just teased that the way they do
the<00:02:14.209> show's<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.570> gonna<00:02:14.750> change<00:02:15.049> in<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.380> next

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
the show's is gonna change in the next

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.020 
the show's is gonna change in the next
season<00:02:15.769> so<00:02:16.070> I'll<00:02:16.340> try<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.549> explain<00:02:16.640> what<00:02:17.000> I

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
season so I'll try to explain what I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.910 
season so I'll try to explain what I
think<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.269> means<00:02:17.540> mostly<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.440> think<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:18.769> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
think that means mostly I think it's the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.590 
think that means mostly I think it's the
way<00:02:19.040> they<00:02:19.220> plot<00:02:19.489> story<00:02:19.850> arcs<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.209> think<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.480> just

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
way they plot story arcs I think is just

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.880 
way they plot story arcs I think is just
gonna<00:02:20.750> make<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.989> easier<00:02:21.320> for<00:02:21.380> them<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.799> do

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
gonna make it easier for them to do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.530 
gonna make it easier for them to do
crossover<00:02:22.430> stories<00:02:22.790> like<00:02:22.970> stories<00:02:23.329> that<00:02:23.420> are

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
crossover stories like stories that are

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.750 
crossover stories like stories that are
much<00:02:23.660> bigger<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.799> crossover<00:02:25.310> series<00:02:25.489> is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
much bigger the crossover series is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.580 
much bigger the crossover series is
gonna<00:02:25.850> be<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.269> midseason<00:02:26.870> show<00:02:27.260> they

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
gonna be like a midseason show they

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.080 
gonna be like a midseason show they

feels like it fits too perfectly if the

more<00:03:58.390> crossover<00:03:58.810> friendly<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.470> just<00:03:59.739> makes

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
more crossover friendly it just makes

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.380 
more crossover friendly it just makes
sense<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.459> they<00:04:00.549> would<00:04:00.670> try<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:00.850> create<00:04:01.180> more

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
sense that they would try to create more

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.330 
sense that they would try to create more
shared<00:04:01.750> villains<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.769> if<00:04:02.829> they<00:04:02.920> turn<00:04:03.100> hive

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
shared villains so if they turn hive

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.940 
shared villains so if they turn hive
into<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.790> more<00:04:04.030> tech<00:04:04.420> based<00:04:04.750> organization<00:04:05.680> and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
into a more tech based organization and

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.780 
into a more tech based organization and
they<00:04:06.010> create<00:04:06.250> some<00:04:06.340> more<00:04:06.459> tech<00:04:06.640> based

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
they create some more tech based

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.280 
they create some more tech based
villains<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.540> just<00:04:07.690> makes<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.930> easier<00:04:08.230> for

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
villains it just makes it easier for

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.479 
villains it just makes it easier for
villains<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.859> bounce<00:04:09.010> back<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.400> forth

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
villains to bounce back and forth

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.460 
villains to bounce back and forth
between<00:04:09.790> both<00:04:10.150> shows<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.630> think<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.320> real

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
between both shows I think the real

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.990 
between both shows I think the real
question<00:04:11.859> is<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.459> would<00:04:12.760> they<00:04:12.880> ever

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
question is is is would they ever

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.420 
question is is is would they ever
entertain<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.540> situation<00:04:14.260> whereby<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.709> big

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
entertain a situation whereby the big

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.729 
entertain a situation whereby the big
bad<00:04:15.609> on<00:04:15.880> arrow<00:04:16.209> also<00:04:16.750> ends<00:04:17.140> up<00:04:17.229> being<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.560> big

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
bad on arrow also ends up being the big

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.560 
bad on arrow also ends up being the big
bad<00:04:17.919> on<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.190> flash<00:04:18.459> as<00:04:18.910> much<00:04:19.150> as<00:04:19.299> they<00:04:19.390> want

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
bad on the flash as much as they want

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.810 
bad on the flash as much as they want
these<00:04:19.720> shows<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:19.989> cross<00:04:20.380> over<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.859> do<00:04:21.310> think

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
these shows to cross over I do think

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.880 
these shows to cross over I do think
that<00:04:21.910> like<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.479> main<00:04:22.720> villain<00:04:23.140> on<00:04:23.320> each<00:04:23.620> show

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
that like the main villain on each show

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.340 
that like the main villain on each show
will<00:04:24.340> still<00:04:24.640> be<00:04:24.789> specific<00:04:25.539> to<00:04:25.570> each<00:04:25.900> group<00:04:26.200> of

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
will still be specific to each group of

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.900

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
things that they could do from the

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.819 
things that they could do from the
comics<00:06:16.269> we<00:06:16.719> could<00:06:16.899> see<00:06:17.079> like<00:06:17.259> more<00:06:17.409> of<00:06:17.439> a<00:06:17.559> flash

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:17.829 
comics we could see like more of a flash

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:19.769 
comics we could see like more of a flash
rebirth<00:06:18.189> type<00:06:18.729> ending<00:06:19.089> or<00:06:19.419> it<00:06:19.599> could<00:06:19.719> be

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779 
rebirth type ending or it could be

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:20.999 
rebirth type ending or it could be
something<00:06:20.079> from<00:06:20.169> way<00:06:20.349> back<00:06:20.499> in<00:06:20.559> the<00:06:20.709> Golden

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
something from way back in the Golden

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.829 
something from way back in the Golden
Age<00:06:21.129> I<00:06:21.399> think<00:06:21.879> the<00:06:21.969> reason<00:06:22.239> everyone<00:06:22.539> thinks

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:22.839 
Age I think the reason everyone thinks

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.239 
Age I think the reason everyone thinks
flashpoint<00:06:23.349> is<00:06:23.529> just<00:06:23.679> because<00:06:23.919> like<00:06:24.069> it's

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:24.249 
flashpoint is just because like it's

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.339 
flashpoint is just because like it's
such<00:06:24.579> a<00:06:24.609> common<00:06:24.909> denominator<00:06:25.209> it<00:06:25.929> was<00:06:26.049> a<00:06:26.079> big

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
such a common denominator it was a big

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:27.959 
such a common denominator it was a big
Justice<00:06:26.769> League<00:06:26.949> animated<00:06:27.189> movie<00:06:27.699> so<00:06:27.819> there's

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
Justice League animated movie so there's

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:29.879 
Justice League animated movie so there's
like<00:06:28.119> really<00:06:28.269> big<00:06:28.479> awareness<00:06:28.929> for<00:06:29.139> it<00:06:29.289> that's

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
like really big awareness for it that's

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.079 
like really big awareness for it that's
actually<00:06:29.979> really<00:06:30.309> good<00:06:30.369> jumping-off<00:06:30.789> point
