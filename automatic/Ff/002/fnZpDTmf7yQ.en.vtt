defense guys look at this wall it's
going<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.050> take<00:03:40.260> ages<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.880> let's<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.210> how<00:03:42.300> my

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
going to take ages so let's see how my

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.020 
going to take ages so let's see how my
archers<00:03:43.110> are<00:03:43.260> doing<00:03:43.470> okay<00:03:43.950> archers<00:03:44.880> are

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
archers are doing okay archers are

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.410 
archers are doing okay archers are
breaking<00:03:45.420> through<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.840> wall<00:03:46.550> now<00:03:47.550> getting

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
breaking through the wall now getting

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.880 
breaking through the wall now getting
that<00:03:48.570> elixir<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:51.170> all<00:03:52.170> right<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.680> Sir

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890

gold okay
halfway<00:03:56.040> breaking<00:03:56.670> through<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:56.970> wall<00:03:57.150> 40

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
halfway breaking through that wall 40

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.900 
halfway breaking through that wall 40
seconds<00:03:58.110> already

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
seconds already

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.960 
seconds already
so<00:03:59.910> we'll<00:04:00.300> probably<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.750> get<00:04:01.290> like<00:04:01.560> 20%<00:04:02.550> or

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
so we'll probably just get like 20% or

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.449 
so we'll probably just get like 20% or
something<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:03.990> stupid<00:04:04.650> giants<00:04:05.100> can<00:04:05.310> do

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
something because stupid giants can do

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.680 
something because stupid giants can do
anything<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.970> know<00:04:09.090> probably<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.510> only

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
anything and you know probably the only

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.910 
anything and you know probably the only
troop<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.350> wizard<00:04:10.770> or<00:04:11.040> at<00:04:11.700> least<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.209> Pekka

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.190 
maybe the valkyrie that can do some
serious<00:04:16.380> damage<00:04:17.299> maybe<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.420> witch<00:04:18.630> because

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
serious damage maybe the witch because

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.300 
serious damage maybe the witch because
they<00:04:19.350> have<00:04:19.500> skeletons<00:04:20.690> but<00:04:21.830> this<00:04:22.830> will<00:04:23.040> be<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
they have skeletons but this will be the

you<00:04:31.710> guys<00:04:31.979> think<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:33.300> barbarian<00:04:33.870> could<00:04:34.110> be

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you guys think the barbarian could be

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.460 
you guys think the barbarian could be
because<00:04:35.730> it<00:04:35.910> has<00:04:36.120> damage<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:36.750> goes<00:04:37.230> for

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
because it has damage it goes for

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.140 
because it has damage it goes for
everything<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:40.100> but<00:04:41.100> will<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.640> be<00:04:41.670> one

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
everything and but will it be one

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.530 
everything and but will it be one
shotted<00:04:42.690> buy<00:04:42.960> or<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.590> shot<00:04:43.920> it<00:04:44.070> because<00:04:45.060> if<00:04:45.270> two

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
shotted buy or to shot it because if two

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.690 
shotted buy or to shot it because if two
shots<00:04:45.870> will<00:04:46.140> take<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.650> out<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:47.040> don't<00:04:47.310> know<00:04:47.520> if
