00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 someone like lost looks at this shirt 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.970
 I had a face that way I say without 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.400
 count the last season in office if I 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.570
 I am the beginning and this program is the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.910
 comic books while I wrote the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
 agenda of today I felt 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 writing a note for dad 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.730
 noel but because today's issues are 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.310
 the comics you catch need 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 Republish urgently I do not know much 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.220
 Good because I'm making this video 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 because I do not have my expectations 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.810
 someone in the panini watch this video 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.910
 and meeting the requests of the galley 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 It's more like an outburst actually. 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 idea for the video and mine is not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.040
 victor campos who is a partner who 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.510
 channel access and even did a search and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.670
 everything else sent the publication dates 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.440
 good 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.690
 I would like to say that I like 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.270
 Panini work in Brazil they launch 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.370
 a lot of things all even a plenty 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 of bound available in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.340
 of course not always mine. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.620
 money in it accompanies this 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.449
 provision of the crash but ultimately only the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.780
 problem is that there's a lot that comes out 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.110
 in Brazil in two or three months gout and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.129
 you never see comics agreement is 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.830
 impressive even let you share with 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.960
 You the other day I saw the day does not make a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.090
 More or less, I saw a photo of one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.119
 cara posted on facebook group where 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 had a bed in his bed was 17 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.610
 bound editions of the deadly joke 17 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 The guy lined the bed with his head. 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 Batman I also heard a story about 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.140
 a guy who was in a comic shop and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.299
 bought 20 number one editions of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.720
 injustice god among us 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.670
 20 the guys basically know right, because they are 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.680
 the comics that are going to run out on the market 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.360
 They buy bundles and then sell them on the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.369
 free market for more money because 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 they do this because they know that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.759
 then it will be difficult for comics to come back 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.920
 for the market will take years to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.170
 back then take it relaunches, 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.570
 certain hqs more frequently 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.939
 This or that it would be difficult to talk 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.560
 decrease row or end once 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.229
 for all and also has the case of 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 missing collections is the damn number 1 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.729
 You know you just need an event. 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.560
 complete but does not think it looks like anything 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.630
 times that the publisher itself does not have 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.759
 interest to sell the product know put 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.140
 I'm here, here's my money, it's just me. 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.209
 give the comic we go to some examples 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.710
 the vitor sent forth first one 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.080
 demolish the man without 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.330
 classic hq fear of writing demolisher 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.730
 frank miller and that inspired the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.920
 netflix tv series that left some 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.840
 months and was a success of the public and 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.310
 criticize that there to sell that neither water 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.960
 I can not say that because I do not 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.970
 I understand about comic book sales or anything. 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.920
 but its price the dream that people 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.480
 are interested in knowing where 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.610
 came that black uniform the last 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.280
 publication of the panini of this arch was 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.200
 2009 my god face with the success of 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.030
 this series I had to go back to the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.130
 shelves know I did not see this and being 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.130
 republished and neither the next demolisher 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.650
 hq land shift that there breaks records of 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.230
 orders on the wrap page click there 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.090
 there are people who can see the image 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.310
 amazing and no wonder it's a date 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.590
 very good is a fantastic analysis of the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.320
 marvelous universe in a gigantic and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.510
 henrique up another point is that is 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.930
 continuations is that the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.660
 paradise x and universe x but nobody goes 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.130
 invest 300 reais because each one of them 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.710
 costs on average 150 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.630
 nobody will invest 300 reais in two 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.460
 continuations of a comic that does not 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.630
 knows if it will be published the last time 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.210
 that we saw earth x in the bookstores 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.310
 was in 2009 we went to the death of the 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.810
 super-man volume another classic of 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.590
 super man we have not seen in the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.930
 stalls 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.330
 It seems that she died along with the super 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.430
 man today the jokes are great on the face 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.860
 and an origional blazer also deserves a 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.350
 republication belt can not find the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.390
 chain that compiles the first 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.920
 constant issues however find 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.470
 others think are about eight 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.630
 bound that forming is the beginning 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.370
 the origin is right but then you never go 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.590
 complete your collection I have none 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.810
 now let's go to the super man between the sickle 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.880
 and the hammer nine years my friends does 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.500
 nine years since the last republication 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.940
 of this story in Brazil and in that 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.560
 time we had the super movie 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.210
 man is the steel man 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.150
 david johnson the designer 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.860
 history has been in the comiccon expo ms where 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.350
 was that he was incarnate to ask 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.510
 autograph for he knows is what he missed 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.190
 For her, there is a film designer missing. 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.100
 what a super man did not appear in the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.049
 land is considered one of the top 5 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.100
 character has an interesting script and 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.600
 creative 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.990
 no this is the kind of thing that can not 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.130
 to be catalog for nine years panini 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.830
 last mention 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.100
 God injustice between us is a hq that 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.780
 dream sucker is a world-class game 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.030
 I've never seen anyone speaking ill of 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.860
 injustice or the most boring readers 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.450
 that I know spoke evil of injustice 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.400
 everyone has fun reading and has a 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.570
 people who can not find it though 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.070
 If I remember correctly, I had a 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.070
 republication, I'm not mistaken 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.000
 finally, people among so many others that the 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.560
 Victor put on the list have those 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.510
 that the superman's classic 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.310
 batman which are the chronicles that 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.380
 marvel historical libraries as well 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.180
 never meet anyone from frank 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.340
 miller had an edition by the graphic work 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.080
 Incarnated but never left by the panini 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.670
 probably they have the right to 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.890
 Good story guys this is one 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.650
 videozinho more unblocks take the screen 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.320
 She has published certain things and is great. 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.450
 in the case of the civil war but has 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.760
 other things that are forgotten by 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.630
 example a long halloween 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.940
 neoclassical batman 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.680
 took years to be republished 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.050
 vinícius but if the guy did not buy it on 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.420
 time it has to be grated even not 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.280
 do not start with that lot of 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.680
 movies and series super heroes we have 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.810
 several readers interested in reading 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.540
 comics the guy goes there and researches 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.130
 10 Greatest Batman Stories in 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.900
 relation to the comic line he goes 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.850
 search the bookstore and find nothing 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.290
 he will find what year one is in 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.910
 dark knight maybe the joke 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.650
 there are things that I do not think 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.540
 I could not leave the catalog either. 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.190
 feasibility is to keep a comic 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.350
 always republishing and these 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.270
 new readers you who are kinda boring 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.430
 Sometimes it bothers me a little, I see the 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.350
 civil war being republished troczas 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.850
 times in an edition by salvatti 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.680
 sometimes it bothers me a little 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.050
 Thinking man, it would be cool if 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.940
 to throw other materials know but this 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.410
 it's good for new readers you know the guy 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.480
 go there and he buys the comic he 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.220
 like it goes after more and how much 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.170
 more people shopping more comics 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.490
 comic agent published other than 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.810
 Happens to me a lot 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.450
 everything is going through a financial squeeze 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.060
 So much for two three months without buying 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.890
 determined that she would ever dick 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.930
 But I think at last it was worth 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.120
 I hope the video has stayed 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.220
 cool and your face what comics you 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.350
 would like to be republished in the 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.990
 even if you have time and 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.729
 patience of the light in the comments of the 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.289
 people down here for us to have 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:41.909
 a notion of which is the most beauty request 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.909
 This gives a kiss to your heart.
