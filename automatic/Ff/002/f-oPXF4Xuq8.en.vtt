00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.230
 Today's video is only a whole 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.700
 short update video where i am 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.440
 Of course, more information 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.069
 regarding the paysafecard tournament 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.349
 will call 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 it is so bad that we are 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.830
 message but also have three good the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.450
 bad at first we can unfortunately 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.080
 for the tournament no longer apply the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.270
 means the number of participants is complete 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 and there comes the mighty good 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.470
 Message did it within 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.119
 the first 24 hours 40 people together 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.359
 to get that means 32 participants 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.800
 and not quite 40 quasi seven people in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.300
 the reserve where I have to say 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 that their own course no people 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.230
 Guarantee did that but she did 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.340
 are there when really you are sick 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.149
 or comes too late or or or or 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.190
 That was the first good news 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.510
 the second good news concerns quasi 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.309
 those I already have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.719
 have written and said did 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.120
 I'm sorry to participate in the tournament 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.620
 and I have the option of helper 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.180
 left open there we do not see yet 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.710
 quite agree how we do that means that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.050
 the organizers meet again 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 and we think together if we still 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.930
 some volunteer helpers or to take 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 which is simply a big advantage 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 has that tournament faster for you 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 that means it will be on everyone 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
 fall waits arise 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.229
 and the more we play at the same time 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.990
 can run less so 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.310
 wait for those easy 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.340
 and the thing is just that, of course 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.390
 certain level of trust must prevail 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.130
 and we are still superior 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.759
 how many helpers to take or again 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.830
 whether we helper quasi from the internet 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.360
 quite easy to pack 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.860
 that was the second good night and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.040
 the third good news is also like that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.119
 a possible thing because we have ourselves 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.860
 thoughtful or a bit around 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.110
 spun and we thought that we 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.479
 maybe make a livestream because 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.670
 it is so that we will the tournament 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.140
 probably to end relatively quickly 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.250
 So that's our hope so 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.100
 it's just a bit flowing 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.079
 running and that are through the participants 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.590
 do not even know we have the others 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.810
 played 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.579
 against whom will play next but it will 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 he just sort of assigned and the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.549
 Tournaments tree is just for us 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.299
 visible or generally for 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.700
 that's a bit like me 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.680
 take over and that is of course relative 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.729
 big and you can play them too 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.990
 not see but of course the games 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.429
 then upload later 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.929
 a few highlight videos or me 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.280
 special plate but the small and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.080
 big final high and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 commented that maybe again 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.120
 look and maybe we will do that 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.980
 said live that means you can we 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.180
 may be looking for a stream and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.650
 there can definitely serves unia 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.810
 why see that was very important to us 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.280
 because you can almost guess ok 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 against whom will play next 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.370
 how did the other team play and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.870
 now comes a very important one 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.610
 thing and that can me down in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.830
 we attribute the comments 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.209
 the following topic is with you 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.620
 we think that we of course the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.050
 bands with reinnehmen which means it can 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.310
 be banned normally and you know 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.170
 Of course not what the other team is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.519
 before we took that though 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.140
 make stream and in the tournament 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.489
 Farmers' associations we have the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.660
 Possibility not only that 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.950
 result to write but also 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.300
 write down with which champion 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.790
 became because resp 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.080
 with which two champions this has 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.640
 several tactical advantages as well 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.200
 disadvantages that is if you know okay 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.670
 The team has previously been with the fashionable 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.300
 again a leg like the two that is 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.920
 Of course it may have been quite nice and 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.720
 That's why I ask you what do you think 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.310
 so you will find it useful if 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.489
 we make a stream and the tournament 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.590
 tree show if we show the pigs 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.560
 or dissolve the champions 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.989
 from the team won and you 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.829
 so the possibility give this nasty 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.660
 champions quali cyprus we are screaming 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.630
 we do not quite agree on that personally 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.730
 think it's okay if you do not know that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.989
 because you're just like normal 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.459
 frame anyway not sure what 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.829
 By contrast, one likes to bank 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.019
 mostly the chip in the ball I like 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.230
 the plague 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.579
 and that's exactly how I think 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.109
 You can decide that 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.400
 long live democracy I think so 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.920
 It was definitely going to be one more time 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.910
 update video come where we have the tournament 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.410
 show it again and we will 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.560
 a few things regarding the 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.030
 streams or and / or the helper say 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.600
 that does help me finally 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.010
 major advantage 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.079
 but as I said a little 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.180
 trust thing god why i now 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.290
 here the countries you get disappears 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.290
 and see you next 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.290
 teams
