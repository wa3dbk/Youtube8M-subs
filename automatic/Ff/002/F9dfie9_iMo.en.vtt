00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
feeling of the classical kind you we are

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.149 
feeling of the classical kind you we are
keeping<00:02:04.850> them<00:02:05.060> mostly<00:02:05.539> two-legged<00:02:06.500> not

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
humanoid but sort of a silhouette that

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.440

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
every week we would do an American Idol

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.229 
every week we would do an American Idol
once<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.349> like<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.920> kaiju<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.519> we<00:02:16.670> logged

once we like the kaiju and we logged

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.600 
once we like the kaiju and we logged
into<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:18.080> would<00:02:18.230> eliminate

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
into it and we would eliminate

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.600 
into it and we would eliminate
silhouettes

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.460 

the<00:02:24.610> first<00:02:24.880> way<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:25.510> do<00:02:25.780> scale<00:02:26.290> is

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
the first way you can do scale is

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.660 
the first way you can do scale is
context<00:02:27.070> within<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.970> Caillou<00:02:28.360> itself<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
context within the Caillou itself the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.810 
context within the Caillou itself the
texture<00:02:31.210> when<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.200> walk<00:02:32.410> close<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:33.190> see<00:02:33.400> what

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
texture when you walk close you see what

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.370 
texture when you walk close you see what
looks<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.270> scale<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.960> then<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.140> go

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
looks like a scale and then you go

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.440 
looks like a scale and then you go
closer<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:35.980> there's<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.220> bunch<00:02:36.460> of<00:02:36.580> bumps<00:02:36.850> and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
closer and there's a bunch of bumps and

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.199 
closer and there's a bunch of bumps and
cracks<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.380> give<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.800> scale<00:02:39.280> if<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.030> do

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
cracks that give you the scale if you do

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.150 
cracks that give you the scale if you do
not<00:02:40.300> close<00:02:40.540> up<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.990> six<00:02:41.290> foot<00:02:41.590> seven<00:02:41.770> foot

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160

not close up in a six foot seven foot
eight<00:02:42.400> foot<00:02:42.700> tall<00:02:42.730> monster<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:44.350> know<00:02:44.530> you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
eight foot tall monster you know you
