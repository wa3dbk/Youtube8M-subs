00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.610
 and what happened to appointment like this is my new 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.320
 greeting good so you do not see what it is 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.139
 with good appointment here in Peru the jargon 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.049
 Peruvian does not cause friend brother yoke 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.699
 whatever then we go here and this time 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.560
 good that I bring myself here I'm good 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.530
 a server not premium ok yes in hama 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.300
 Chinese roe salt that has this 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.430
 modality that perhaps many users 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.560
 they are looking and it is nothing more and nothing 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.360
 unless you defend the way it is 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.900
 defends the life that in this case is in 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.059
 beta state but it works perfectly 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.010
 if the server that the ip I leave in 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.629
 the description of this video is called 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.999
 america ftc already call itself the 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.190
 server and when they enter it is a 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.710
 registered diagonal or register bar 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.870
 space any password 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.739
 space again repeat the same 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.409
 password 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.179
 in theory they would be registered if they were not 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.670
 lets sign up means there's 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.010
 some other person that has to be 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.679
 registered with his nickname not as it is 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.909
 a non-premium server then when 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.190
 be registered 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.140
 they will write again bar login 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.420
 space and the same password that they have 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.400
 yours and the fucking troll rooster 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.170
 but good in login bar and the same 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.170
 password -between them they would be logueados 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.600
 Once this is done, you could already 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.830
 move and like that and we have two compasses 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.350
 in the inventory we are going to give 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.670
 any right click and all of these 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.830
 modalities because there are many 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.930
 game modes is east of here 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.610
 emerald of the end of the village beta we give 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.490
 click and down tells us to wait three 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.539
 seconds ok that he is not transported and already 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.390
 we are here and good here as they are 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.680
 right now at 8 40 in the morning 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.259
 I imagine what effort there are many people 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.460
 and I imagine trying to fill up that 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.100
 there's another one ready the program passes me 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.960
 Now then let's go in here no 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.460
 that there are more people we click on 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.280
 right I think it works with click 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.899
 right yes and here we were and we are in 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.360
 the typical lobby and everyone 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.069
 know not the typical east lobby where there is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.220
 here an almost huge one that you load up the 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.430
 tip since it looks much better like this 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.380
 there it is then you come here 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.259
 and here are the posters ok 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.670
 good in those that are so says 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.959
 full sand means you can not 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.590
 enter since there is in the chat is 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.720
 sand is already started 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.550
 those who say click are going to enter good 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.220
 here you can enter without such a case you enter 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.290
 one not if you enter and if that and I was wrong 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.319
 this is not what you are going to write is what 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.470
 next diagonal or bar you ave and you 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.720
 will take it back here ok then it 's 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.090
 book here I also show you 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.640
 maps in this desert where you can not 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.989
 enter then here if you get red in the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.450
 name that I made the one that you can not enter 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.360
 those who are in green yes ok then to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.660
 seem frozen here because this map 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.200
 there are two people and here in viking there 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.180
 one so nothing like I showed you how 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.989
 join a game because I will join 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.910
 frozen I do not say yo and nothing so 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.160
 we're going to have to wait until this 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.230
 start not and I'm going to do one that I 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.970
 I cut and when it 's about to start then 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.700
 he came back 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.170
 although we are already here and you will say because 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.150
 I am on this map or good because 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.520
 in the other one it did not fill up and well here 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.110
 We are only three people 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.720
 then on this server it is that 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.060
 begins with a personal limit 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.120
 necessary that they continue in all not as in 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.770
 the premium and truth is to follow this book 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.060
 from here I forgot to tell you that you can 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.830
 choose killer is that there is right and 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.990
 you choose these here are vip and 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.400
 those above do not in this case tank and 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.410
 in the chat says does he choose the kit 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.790
 correctly then what I tell you 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.740
 is that not being several premium have to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.810
 fill up all the top players that 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.459
 they ask in depends on the map instead here 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.980
 not so that already starts at 10 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.560
 seconds entered one more and we will see 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.120
 how is this one here I played a couple of 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.459
 times and the truth that I found a 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.510
 bit strange or that we already got this 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.630
 we put it on long and nothing we will see 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.430
 where are the zombies that do not 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.280
 they also did not respond but the villagers 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.200
 LOL 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.569
 that's what he wants to say is that here 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.080
 it's a bit weird this is honestly a 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.080
 little weird 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.349
 that there is the I do not have the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.380
 ayayay a zombie ok this is a bit weird 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.289
 to see that time I played what I hit 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.110
 the zombies and they never followed me and sometimes 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.560
 Gems do not fall but you already recognize it or 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.560
 something like that 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:37.030
 and sometimes to me like he does not attack me there 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.889
 it's like I do not attack but 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.569
 good thing is that if you're looking 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.800
 an 'end of the road that is not premium 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.099
 because I think that itself is fine and 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.069
 we save average image I have 45 that I do not 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.569
 I know what I can buy with this and nothing 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.960
 let's continue to see until when 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.960
 we last 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.070
 when 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.070
 ok service I wonder why you commit suicide 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.770
 because I had a heart and I do not think that 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.780
 we're going to last longer and that's how it works 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.310
 well this thing here on this server 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.650
 which is not premium I consider that 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.530
 It is also not bad and the good what 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.330
 I like it is that here you do not fight for 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.520
 the gems because in the premium you kill 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.410
 or a mod and they all come and if not 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.290
 you can take it another one instead 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.820
 here is not like that here here we are 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.860
 they fight for the gems but if you 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.410
 you kill smoke the gem goes directly towards 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.570
 you that's the good thing and nothing I hope you 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.150
 like this server if it was so 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.970
 then give a like a comment a 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.380
 subscribe your will that I can not 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.370
 go out 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:22.229
 have 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:25.080
 now yes and see you until the next uy 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:27.090
 I almost put my password tiba and we 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.760
 we see until the next best I put it 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:34.310
 but he will be censored 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.310
 and we look greeting chao
