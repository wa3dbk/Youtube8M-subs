00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
right conditions and that's the most

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.799 
right conditions and that's the most
important<00:00:36.979> thing<00:00:37.220> of<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:38.000> entire<00:00:38.479> video

itself<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.840> key<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.800> let's<00:02:29.370> jump

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
itself this is the key so let's jump

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
itself this is the key so let's jump
over<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.239> alternative<00:02:31.140> or<00:02:31.290> natural<00:02:31.709> medicine

exhibiting<00:02:35.280> these<00:02:35.430> symptoms<00:02:35.489> well<00:02:36.270> let's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
exhibiting these symptoms well let's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.479 
exhibiting these symptoms well let's
figure<00:02:36.690> out<00:02:36.810> what<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.410> body<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.800> doing<00:02:38.100> or<00:02:38.459> not

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
figure out what the body is doing or not

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.699 
figure out what the body is doing or not
doing<00:02:38.670> or<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.150> doing<00:02:39.270> correctly<00:02:40.110> that's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
doing or not doing correctly that's

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.190 
doing or not doing correctly that's
causing<00:02:41.400> these<00:02:41.550> symptoms<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.300> manifest<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
causing these symptoms to manifest and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.920 
causing these symptoms to manifest and
then<00:02:43.800> once<00:02:44.700> we've<00:02:44.970> figured<00:02:45.239> out<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.569> these

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
then once we've figured out what these

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.340 
then once we've figured out what these
different<00:02:46.470> root<00:02:47.190> causes<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:48.300> those<00:02:48.930> symptoms

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
different root causes of those symptoms

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.680 
different root causes of those symptoms
are<00:02:49.680> we're<00:02:50.459> going<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.819> give<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> body<00:02:51.269> what<00:02:51.420> it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
are we're going to give the body what it

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.920 
are we're going to give the body what it
needs<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.370> better<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.970> this

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
needs so it can get better and this

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.800 
needs so it can get better and this
happens<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.500> time<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.420> don't<00:02:57.569> hear

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
happens all the time you just don't hear

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.630 
happens all the time you just don't hear
about<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.799> don't<00:02:58.920> hear<00:02:59.190> about<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.549> because

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
about it you don't hear about it because

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.759 
about it you don't hear about it because
the<00:02:59.910> pharmaceutical<00:03:00.600> industry<00:03:01.080> pretty<00:03:01.560> much

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
the pharmaceutical industry pretty much

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.130 
the pharmaceutical industry pretty much
advertises<00:03:02.580> in<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.120> entire<00:03:03.480> mainstream

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
advertises in the entire mainstream

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.650 
advertises in the entire mainstream
media<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.459> mainstream<00:03:06.000> media<00:03:06.299> makes<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
media and so mainstream media makes a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.120 
media and so mainstream media makes a
lot<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.840> money<00:03:07.080> from<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.470> pharmaceutical

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
lot of money from the pharmaceutical

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.699 
lot of money from the pharmaceutical
industry<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.730> no<00:03:09.720> one<00:03:09.870> wants<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.140> upset<00:03:10.500> that

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
industry and no one wants to upset that

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.740 
industry and no one wants to upset that
applecart<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.790> you're<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.600> hear
