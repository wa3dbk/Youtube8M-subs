 that is how it sounds 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.029
 enough time for the Avus 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.779
 Israel probably does not have us

 I do not know if there are solutions 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.029
 I can not speak of Christian Rost 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.059
 So let's talk about 1 5 015 well 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.419
 why should I open then 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.649
 it goes up 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649

 Munich of the votes 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.439
 I am 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.439
 but if I do it 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.229
 two you still thought 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.889
 I only hope that will speak 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 while the debt stop restrained 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.569
 Stutensee you live 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.830
 That is not how it works 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.830
 do not constantly make public later 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.249
 Bora Bora Bora Bora Bora that is and it is becoming scarce 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.400
 one likes to 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.870
 the mammoth project 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.389
 oil is already 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.009
 caused by 20 del-play big damage 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.129
 they must be for title number

 1 UWG 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.479
 by Stephan Roth 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.400
 Anybody in the way somehow 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.319
 to procure 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.409
 I would have to sit like her, too 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.409
 before I reassured my way it was 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.170
 to take a bit of food 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.189
 unusual 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.189
 this beautiful course 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.509
 have fun 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.680
 happy end 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.389
 I need 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.360
 the museums allow it to be found in this book 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.499
 to be heated 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:50.499
 Nevertheless, the face lives 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.779
 I thank Chile Heartbeat among doctors 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.969
 visited where not 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:00.750
 although 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.240
 could be finished 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.339
 the tingling mon 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.559
 lucky and 14 have the means to do it where 9 30 euros 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.830
 Chances have to have nice votes 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.830
 the 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:19.490
 through that such a problem around 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.279
 "I do not actually play 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.129
 aimed at 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.129
 that should store Kriftel company 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.599
 best high tours in what way 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.479
 it's easy to find 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.680
 and that for me though 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.159
 just in Vienna instead of entering or 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.360
 then they cost you feel so good 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.729
 Kopper me 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.219
 unscrupulously 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:53.369
 Crawl to falter Crowns can not plan the gates to the 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:56.210
 Make water supply 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.210
 and I need travel to do that 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:03.930
 that, of course, that one 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.930
 and I think so make a smart break 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.710
 why not then 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.879
 then you see yourself almost immediately 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.300
 for the citizens 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.300
 Legal entities take a break 

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:24.059
 so 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.719
 says one 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:29.719
 now children seem 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.569
 to escape 

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:37.589
 all right 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.089
 50 man 

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:43.089
 for water 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.110
 or not but it does 

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:51.919
 Do you know what it is the perfect time 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.199
 5 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.199
 so this good 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.210
 the struggle between schools and elsewhere 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.229
 I mix Marie Schäfer posters and 

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:05.669
 Rome one sees each other still 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:06.580
