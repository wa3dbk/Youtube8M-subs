00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
pro gamer one thing that I know you're a

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.090 
pro gamer one thing that I know you're a
little<00:04:18.460> bit<00:04:18.670> concerned<00:04:18.820> about<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.950> way

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
little bit concerned about is the way

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.590 
little bit concerned about is the way
that<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.400> can<00:04:21.520> see<00:04:21.700> people's<00:04:22.030> build<00:04:22.240> orders

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
that you can see people's build orders

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.050 
that you can see people's build orders
from<00:04:22.840> practice<00:04:23.320> yeah

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
from practice yeah

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.300 
from practice yeah
two<00:04:24.330> huge<00:04:24.750> things<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.380> think<00:04:25.650> just<00:04:25.860> massive

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
two huge things I think just massive

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.909 
two huge things I think just massive
problems<00:04:26.700> when<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:26.880> comes<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.210> competition

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
problems when it comes to competition

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.470 
problems when it comes to competition
the<00:04:28.919> build<00:04:29.160> order<00:04:29.430> one<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:29.970> pretty<00:04:30.330> big

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
the build order one is pretty big

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.180 
the build order one is pretty big
because<00:04:30.690> if<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.960> add<00:04:31.139> one<00:04:31.560> I've<00:04:31.800> been<00:04:32.010> real

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
because if you add one I've been real

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.129 
because if you add one I've been real
idea<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:32.790> yes<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.389> get<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.630> play<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.930> game

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
idea I think yes you get to play a game

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.629 
idea I think yes you get to play a game
with<00:04:34.320> them<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.530> add<00:04:34.680> them<00:04:34.860> afterwards<00:04:35.310> you

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
with them you add them afterwards you

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.000 
with them you add them afterwards you
can<00:04:35.760> go<00:04:35.820> in<00:04:36.090> there<00:04:36.300> for<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.780> while<00:04:36.990> see<00:04:37.560> every

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
can go in there for a while see every

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.920 
can go in there for a while see every
game<00:04:38.160> they<00:04:38.340> play<00:04:38.610> including<00:04:39.060> custom<00:04:39.690> games

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
game they play including custom games

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.810 
game they play including custom games

the<00:05:36.720> other<00:05:36.840> is<00:05:37.770> actually<00:05:38.010> relatively<00:05:38.430> new<00:05:38.820> and

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
the other is actually relatively new and

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.510 
the other is actually relatively new and
I<00:05:39.870> think<00:05:40.050> it's<00:05:40.169> kind<00:05:40.560> of<00:05:40.680> still<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:40.919> rumor<00:05:41.340> that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
I think it's kind of still a rumor that

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.969 
I think it's kind of still a rumor that
the<00:05:42.090> Chinese<00:05:42.479> site<00:05:42.750> that<00:05:42.960> posted<00:05:43.350> about<00:05:43.500> os/2

that<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.200> tell<00:05:55.350> us<00:05:55.410> why<00:05:55.620> that<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:56.039> problem

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
that but tell us why that is a problem

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.500 
that but tell us why that is a problem
in<00:05:56.880> fact

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
in fact

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.300 
in fact
good<00:05:58.660> that<00:05:59.140> they<00:05:59.320> want<00:05:59.530> there<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.710> be<00:05:59.860> planned

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
good that they want there to be planned

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.190 
good that they want there to be planned
planned<00:06:00.670> is<00:06:01.090> obviously<00:06:01.450> the<00:06:01.570> best<00:06:01.750> option<00:06:02.170> for

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
planned is obviously the best option for

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.790 
planned is obviously the best option for
life<00:06:03.030> but<00:06:04.030> if<00:06:04.720> you<00:06:04.810> don't<00:06:05.050> practice<00:06:05.170> on<00:06:05.560> lab

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
life but if you don't practice on lab

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.830 
life but if you don't practice on lab
then<00:06:06.280> you<00:06:06.370> play<00:06:06.580> worse<00:06:06.760> on<00:06:08.670> your<00:06:09.720> reactor<00:06:10.720> at

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
then you play worse on your reactor at

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.720 
then you play worse on your reactor at
the<00:06:10.870> same<00:06:11.140> time<00:06:11.350> so<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:12.400> have<00:06:12.520> everything

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
the same time so you have everything

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.450 
the same time so you have everything
timed<00:06:13.030> out<00:06:13.180> wrong<00:06:13.390> stuff<00:06:14.010> so<00:06:15.010> I<00:06:15.040> mean<00:06:15.310> the

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
timed out wrong stuff so I mean the

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.520 
timed out wrong stuff so I mean the
quality<00:06:15.880> of<00:06:16.150> play<00:06:16.330> suffers<00:06:16.810> or<00:06:16.990> I've<00:06:17.140> heard

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
quality of play suffers or I've heard

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.620 
quality of play suffers or I've heard
that<00:06:18.160> professional<00:06:18.850> competitive<00:06:19.390> players

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
that professional competitive players

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.790 
that professional competitive players
like<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:19.960> pro<00:06:20.110> league<00:06:20.230> players<00:06:20.470> are<00:06:20.650> whatever

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
like the pro league players are whatever

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.520 
like the pro league players are whatever
will<00:06:21.400> be<00:06:21.430> able<00:06:21.640> to<00:06:21.760> access<00:06:21.880> lambda<00:06:22.540> so<00:06:23.320> that

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
will be able to access lambda so that

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.570 
will be able to access lambda so that
obviously<00:06:23.920> that<00:06:24.010> you<00:06:24.190> know<00:06:24.340> they<00:06:24.460> could

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
obviously that you know they could

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.190 
obviously that you know they could
practice<00:06:24.760> they<00:06:25.270> can<00:06:25.360> play<00:06:25.540> their<00:06:25.690> best<00:06:25.720> of<00:06:25.990> lab

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
practice they can play their best of lab

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.560 
practice they can play their best of lab

all<00:08:02.370> of<00:08:02.400> a<00:08:02.490> sudden<00:08:02.820> it's<00:08:03.060> tough<00:08:03.509> for<00:08:03.600> me<00:08:03.720> to

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:03.810 
all of a sudden it's tough for me to

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.080 
all of a sudden it's tough for me to
practice<00:08:03.990> what<00:08:04.470> my<00:08:04.650> opponent<00:08:05.130> can<00:08:05.340> very

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.090 
practice what my opponent can very

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.230 
practice what my opponent can very
easily<00:08:06.300> figure<00:08:06.810> out<00:08:06.930> that<00:08:07.350> I'm<00:08:08.310> practicing

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 
easily figure out that I'm practicing

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.230 
easily figure out that I'm practicing
you<00:08:09.300> know<00:08:09.419> how<00:08:09.889> fast<00:08:10.889> expansion<00:08:11.639> instead<00:08:11.940> of

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 
you know how fast expansion instead of

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.900 
you know how fast expansion instead of
harassment<00:08:12.930> style<00:08:13.139> plays<00:08:13.410> so<00:08:13.759> these<00:08:14.759> are

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:14.910 
harassment style plays so these are

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.300 
harassment style plays so these are
issues
