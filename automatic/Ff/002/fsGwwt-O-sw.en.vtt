00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.200
 2 for every 2 tablespoons of coffee we go to 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.339
 occupy a brown sugar if they do not have 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.790
 brown sugar can use white sugar 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:16.450
 also olive oil the necessary and 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.990
 they also have the option to add honey 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.470
 a container 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.470
 I add 4 tablespoons of coffee I forgot to say 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.259
 what is coffee for coffee is not coffee 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.869
 can buy instant coffee more 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.110
 economic does not have to be the most coffee 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.010
 expensive also added 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.010
 sugar and mix 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:48.220
 this is the consistency that I am 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:50.610
 looking for it to be slightly thick 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.800
 see 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.260
 we want it to be enough 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.879
 we put a little honey to taste the honey 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.920
 is great for the skin is a 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.309
 excellent natural beautifier that helps 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.449
 to conserve moisturizes and softens restores and 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.449
 Feeds our skin 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.010
 very well let's see how I'm going 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.730
 withdraw my ring 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.950
 I'll put 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.080
 We will use this a little bit to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.460
 the body for the hands for what 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.210
 you want 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.210
 so 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.400
 if you want they can moisten a little 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.400
 the hands in the case of xirles 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.840
 and we are going to start today 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.950
 a body 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 in the hands 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.390
 let's zoom in as 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.390
 the towel 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:57.220
 remember that this scrub is for the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.220
 body and the skin is soft 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.110
 soft 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.820
 it will be exaggeratedly red in the camera 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.939
 but I do not know why it looks as if 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.619
 was my skin very red but not 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.869
 in real life , it's a little nothing 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.080
 rosadita but in the camera it looks like 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.209
 that if we were red but not even 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.730
 even my hands burn my skin nothing 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.890
 of that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.890
 and I'm going to put a little 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.480
 I'm going to put a little cream 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.150
 to connect my hands although this way 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.959
 they feel very mentioned they feel very 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.819
 mentioned because we have the oil of 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.390
 olive a little apart from the honey we 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.050
 helps to moisturize also 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.050
 to soften 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.030
 I only put what is cream 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.760
 Y 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.130
 there are some good hands a skin more than 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.130
 nothing is very beautiful skin 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.490
 very very pretty 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.560
 do it I recommend it after this 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.740
 exfoliating you will not want to buy 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.630
 more exfoliants for the body because 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.630
