00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
batteries and I came up with this theory

that<00:04:09.049> it<00:04:09.319> wouldn't<00:04:09.620> work<00:04:09.739> in<00:04:10.040> best<00:04:10.430> buy<00:04:10.519> but

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
that it wouldn't work in best buy but

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.240 
that it wouldn't work in best buy but
and<00:04:11.660> target<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.530> might<00:04:12.680> work<00:04:12.709> in<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.130> guys
