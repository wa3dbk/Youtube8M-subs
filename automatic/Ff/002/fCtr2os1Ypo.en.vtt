00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.309 

I<00:00:00.240> think<00:00:00.840> there<00:00:00.930> were<00:00:01.020> some<00:00:01.110> good<00:00:01.260> things

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
I think there were some good things

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
nothing there some things that we can

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.490 
nothing there some things that we can
work<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.390> we<00:00:06.390> definitely<00:00:06.600> need<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.020> be<00:00:07.080> more

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
work on we definitely need to be more

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.150 
work on we definitely need to be more
accurate<00:00:07.680> at<00:00:08.069> times<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:09.330> players<00:00:10.160> intentions

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
accurate at times the players intentions

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
accurate at times the players intentions
I<00:00:11.370> thought<00:00:11.730> were<00:00:11.849> good<00:00:12.170> during<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.259> game<00:00:13.349> but

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
I thought were good during this game but

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.650 
I thought were good during this game but

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
we we let Island her very good team

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.679 
we we let Island her very good team
score<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.289> couple<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.859> tries<00:00:20.039> perhaps<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
score a couple of tries perhaps a a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.810 
score a couple of tries perhaps a a
little<00:00:22.380> bit<00:00:22.500> too<00:00:22.619> easily<00:00:24.740> we<00:00:25.740> had<00:00:25.980> intentions

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
little bit too easily we had intentions

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630 
little bit too easily we had intentions
to<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.630> shift<00:00:27.900> malls<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.800> line<00:00:28.980> our<00:00:29.160> time<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
to to shift malls that line our time and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.030 
to to shift malls that line our time and
we<00:00:30.000> still<00:00:30.240> haven't<00:00:30.420> quite<00:00:31.140> got<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> we've

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
we still haven't quite got that we've

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.120 
we still haven't quite got that we've
got<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:33.180> were<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.809> bit<00:00:33.989> shorter<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.920> our

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
got we were a little bit shorter and our

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.610 
got we were a little bit shorter and our
support<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:36.840> our<00:00:36.870> ball<00:00:37.140> carriers<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
support to our ball carriers in the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.060 
support to our ball carriers in the
first<00:00:37.829> half<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> half<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:38.969> they

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
first half and half and they they

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.260 
first half and half and they they
quickly<00:00:41.070> showed<00:00:41.399> us<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.760> need<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:41.969> there

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
quickly showed us that we need to there

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
quickly showed us that we need to there
quicker<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> lot<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.440> important<00:00:43.890> things<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
quicker so a lot of important things it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.860 
quicker so a lot of important things it
was<00:00:44.340> good<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> play<00:00:44.760> against<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.390> top

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
was good to play against a top

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.760 
was good to play against a top
opposition<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.680> think<00:00:49.680> it's

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
opposition and I think I think it's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
opposition and I think I think it's
important<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> start<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.480> very<00:00:51.510> good

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
important to start and it's a very good

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.279 
important to start and it's a very good
start<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:53.239> hoping<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.110> fix

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
start and hoping that we can we can fix

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
start and hoping that we can we can fix
those<00:00:55.530> things<00:00:55.579> as<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.940> move<00:00:57.149> through<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.510> next

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
those things as we move through the next

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.530 
those things as we move through the next
three<00:00:57.750> weeks

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
three weeks

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
be things will be looking at it's there

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.719 
be things will be looking at it's there
is<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.220> more<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.490> first

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
is so much more to do I of the first

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.060 
is so much more to do I of the first
water<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:01.080> already

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
water is that because they already

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.850 
water is that because they already
install<00:02:02.940> enough

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.620 

yeah<00:02:06.860> maybe<00:02:07.130> also<00:02:07.400> you<00:02:07.670> came<00:02:07.850> out<00:02:08.030> probably

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
yeah maybe also you came out probably

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.210 
yeah maybe also you came out probably
all<00:02:08.930> that<00:02:09.080> cold<00:02:09.320> we<00:02:09.470> made<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.890> few<00:02:10.040> mistakes

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
all that cold we made a few mistakes

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.650 
all that cold we made a few mistakes
good<00:02:10.580> teams<00:02:10.760> like<00:02:10.940> are<00:02:11.150> only<00:02:11.300> gonna<00:02:11.450> put<00:02:11.600> you

good teams like are only gonna put you
under<00:02:11.780> pressure<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.290> didn't<00:02:12.440> manage<00:02:12.830> to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
under pressure so we didn't manage to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.500 
under pressure so we didn't manage to
hold<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.280> ball<00:02:13.430> probably<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.210> wanted<00:02:14.420> to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
hold the ball probably like we wanted to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.710 
hold the ball probably like we wanted to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
but um as we got into the game anyway

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
be left leg and I'm attached so read a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.360 
be left leg and I'm attached so read a
good<00:04:14.110> place<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.380> just<00:04:14.739> need<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.920> kick<00:04:15.069> on<00:04:15.250> now

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
good place you just need to kick on now

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.490 
good place you just need to kick on now
and<00:04:15.640> keep<00:04:15.819> improving<00:04:16.200> David<00:04:17.200> I<00:04:17.290> thought

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
and keep improving David I thought

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.099 
and keep improving David I thought
carried<00:04:17.829> very<00:04:18.040> well<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:19.329> got<00:04:19.510> his<00:04:19.600> first<00:04:19.780> game

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
carried very well you got his first game

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.479 
carried very well you got his first game
I<00:04:20.320> thought<00:04:20.500> he<00:04:20.560> was<00:04:20.620> very<00:04:20.769> active<00:04:20.979> around<00:04:21.340> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
I thought he was very active around the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.340 
I thought he was very active around the
paddock<00:04:23.100> Blair<00:04:24.100> was<00:04:24.870> offering<00:04:25.870> us<00:04:25.990> carries

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
paddock Blair was offering us carries

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.250 
paddock Blair was offering us carries
and<00:04:26.560> initiatives<00:04:27.280> around<00:04:27.400> rugs<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:28.169> think<00:04:29.169> it's

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
and initiatives around rugs I think it's

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.650 
and initiatives around rugs I think it's
a<00:04:29.320> good<00:04:29.590> start<00:04:29.919> I<00:04:30.190> think<00:04:30.310> we<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:31.360> get<00:04:31.539> better

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
a good start I think we can get better

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.600 
a good start I think we can get better
and<00:04:31.900> must<00:04:32.050> get<00:04:32.169> better<00:04:34.919> John<00:04:35.919> Barclay<00:04:36.250> came<00:04:36.490> to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
and must get better John Barclay came to

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.640 
and must get better John Barclay came to
the<00:04:36.700> game<00:04:36.850> he<00:04:37.060> hasn't<00:04:37.360> played<00:04:37.479> for<00:04:38.350> us<00:04:38.380> for<00:04:38.620> a

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
the game he hasn't played for us for a

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.779 
the game he hasn't played for us for a
while<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:39.039> was<00:04:39.100> good<00:04:39.280> from<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.610> get<00:04:39.760> started

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
while it was good from the get started

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.020 
while it was good from the get started
and<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.930> feeling<00:04:41.169> of<00:04:41.350> how<00:04:41.919> things<00:04:42.160> happen

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
and get a feeling of how things happen

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.200 
and get a feeling of how things happen
and<00:04:43.150> find<00:04:43.780> his<00:04:43.990> place<00:04:44.380> with<00:04:44.740> them<00:04:45.090> than<00:04:46.090> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
and find his place with them than the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.950 
and find his place with them than the
team<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:49.470> I'm<00:04:50.470> happy<00:04:50.770> but<00:04:51.370> I'm<00:04:51.490> not<00:04:51.640> finished

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
team I I'm happy but I'm not finished

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.110 
team I I'm happy but I'm not finished
yeah

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
yeah

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.300 
yeah
I<00:04:53.180> think<00:04:53.690> we<00:04:53.840> can<00:04:54.229> improve<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:55.330> there<00:04:56.330> may<00:04:56.510> be

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
I think we can improve and there may be

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.770 
I think we can improve and there may be
changes<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.850> loose<00:04:59.000> boards<00:04:59.330> next<00:04:59.540> week

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
changes and the loose boards next week

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.080 
changes and the loose boards next week
to<00:05:00.110> see<00:05:00.139> what<00:05:00.560> two<00:05:01.220> other<00:05:01.400> players<00:05:01.669> who<00:05:01.940> are

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
to see what two other players who are

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.500 
to see what two other players who are
working<00:05:02.960> very<00:05:03.139> hard<00:05:03.350> can<00:05:03.800> do<00:05:03.919> as<00:05:04.040> well<00:05:04.510> after

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
working very hard can do as well after

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.570 
working very hard can do as well after
this<00:05:05.600> game<00:05:05.810> we<00:05:06.260> were<00:05:06.530> perhaps<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.490> little

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
this game we were perhaps a little

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.450 
this game we were perhaps a little
nervous<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.240> we<00:05:08.720> let<00:05:08.900> on<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.250> play<00:05:10.250> their

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
nervous and we let on and play their

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.680 
nervous and we let on and play their
game<00:05:10.669> before<00:05:11.030> we<00:05:11.090> go<00:05:11.210> two<00:05:11.270> hands<00:05:11.510> on<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.630> ball

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
game before we go two hands on the ball

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.870 
game before we go two hands on the ball
got<00:05:11.960> confident<00:05:12.440> with<00:05:12.530> our<00:05:12.650> game<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.760> there

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
got confident with our game so there

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.100 
got confident with our game so there
will<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.000> something<00:05:14.240> had<00:05:14.540> how<00:05:14.720> do<00:05:14.780> we<00:05:14.870> start

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
will be something had how do we start

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.600 
will be something had how do we start
get<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.530> hands<00:05:15.740> on<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.919> board<00:05:16.130> early<00:05:16.220> get<00:05:16.490> rid

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
get the hands on the board early get rid

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.420 
get the hands on the board early get rid
of<00:05:16.669> those<00:05:16.790> nerves<00:05:18.040> there's<00:05:19.040> a<00:05:19.070> mixture<00:05:19.340> of

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
of those nerves there's a mixture of

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.969 
of those nerves there's a mixture of
good<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:19.970> better<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.449> thought<00:05:21.169> we<00:05:21.530> turned<00:05:21.740> over

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
good and better I thought we turned over

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.490 
good and better I thought we turned over
to<00:05:22.100> much<00:05:22.370> poor<00:05:23.080> speech<00:05:24.080> too<00:05:24.169> in<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.290> first

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
to much poor speech too in the first

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.460 
to much poor speech too in the first
half<00:05:25.990> I<00:05:27.610> think<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:29.260> scrummaging<00:05:30.260> will

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
half I think the scrummaging will

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.930 
half I think the scrummaging will
definitely<00:05:30.919> be<00:05:31.039> working<00:05:31.460> on<00:05:31.490> was<00:05:31.639> the<00:05:31.699> first

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
definitely be working on was the first

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.700 
definitely be working on was the first
scrums<00:05:32.240> we've<00:05:32.479> had<00:05:32.660> we've<00:05:33.110> only<00:05:33.289> been<00:05:33.440> able<00:05:33.500> to

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
scrums we've had we've only been able to

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.350 
scrums we've had we've only been able to
Train<00:05:33.919> against<00:05:34.220> ourselves<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.669> this<00:05:35.030> was<00:05:35.330> the

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
Train against ourselves so this was the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.090 
Train against ourselves so this was the
first<00:05:35.660> time<00:05:35.840> we<00:05:36.169> played<00:05:36.199> against<00:05:36.830> an

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
first time we played against an

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.520 
first time we played against an
opposition<00:05:37.850> got<00:05:38.510> some<00:05:38.690> real<00:05:38.870> feedback<00:05:39.139> from

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
opposition got some real feedback from

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.960 
opposition got some real feedback from
what<00:05:39.680> we're<00:05:39.800> doing<00:05:40.010> so<00:05:40.160> will<00:05:40.250> analyze<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:40.760> very

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
what we're doing so will analyze it very

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.960 
what we're doing so will analyze it very
closely<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.750> we're<00:05:42.710> just<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.340> main<00:05:43.520> axis<00:05:43.910> of

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
closely and we're just the main axis of

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.790 
closely and we're just the main axis of
our<00:05:44.150> work<00:05:44.330> will<00:05:44.570> be<00:05:44.660> like<00:05:44.840> sure<00:05:45.050> we<00:05:45.169> get<00:05:45.289> we<00:05:45.770> can

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
our work will be like sure we get we can

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.370 
our work will be like sure we get we can
build<00:05:46.039> a<00:05:46.220> game<00:05:46.400> with<00:05:46.610> set<00:05:46.789> phase<00:05:47.030> but<00:05:47.990> when<00:05:48.229> we

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
build a game with set phase but when we

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.870 
build a game with set phase but when we
start<00:05:48.680> playing<00:05:48.889> we<00:05:49.160> can<00:05:49.280> get<00:05:49.400> support<00:05:49.699> to

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
start playing we can get support to

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.460 
start playing we can get support to
people<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.210> are<00:05:50.330> carrying<00:05:50.660> when<00:05:50.960> we<00:05:51.080> defend

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
people that are carrying when we defend

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
we make sure we get a heads up and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.050 
we make sure we get a heads up and

anticipate them when teams change up
