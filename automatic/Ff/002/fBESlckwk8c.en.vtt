00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.960
 we need to make transformations 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.790
 truly 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:15.769
 what I say is true and what is equivalent 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.769
 to another reduction in our society 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 Well, it seems to me that the team needs 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.810
 many of the public universities 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.020
 especially high universities 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.300
 quality I think there must be a lot more 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.430
 investment in that sense and on the other 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.950
 part in terms of opportunities for 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.260
 employment because I think that what there are two 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.600
 other fundamental things with one is 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.210
 create entrepreneurs make young people 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.760
 do not just wait for someone to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.010
 employment or hire someone when 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.829
 leave the university but have 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.530
 the ability to be entrepreneurs by 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.510
 I suggest that there are incubators 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.569
 companies and entrepreneurs in the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.520
 public universities so that we have 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:01.640
 a much greater capacity 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.760
 of generating companies to generate new 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.710
 ideas of products and services and 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.080
 economic growth from the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.030
 major structural reforms or 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.110
 structural revolutions that the country 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.650
 look 5 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.290
 it is fundamental to constitute a new 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.140
 secretary of higher education science 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.950
 and technology again in creating new 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.580
 bureaucracy taking the conacyt taking the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.890
 undersecretary of the current cpe 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.810
 integrating them also giving you the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.280
 capacity of a tripartite government with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.900
 the application of companies and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.990
 universities so you have a government 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.520
 in some collegial way and a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.939
 Secretary 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 where projects of 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.409
 research where the promotion of 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.479
 creation of new centers of 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.189
 research and where the promotion of 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.049
 training of human resources 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.679
 the problem is not only generating 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.409
 have more doctors but have where 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.090
 welcome them to develop the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.819
 skills that they acquired in the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.580
 foreigner then it is fundamental that 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.230
 these create research projects 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.269
 of these new initiations of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.549
 research and at the same time have 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.489
 partnerships with private companies to 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.220
 that applied science can be translated 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.110
 in support of medium - sized enterprises and 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.360
 large companies also in the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.180
 products and new services and that of 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.209
 this way the system is articulated 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.030
 national research and business 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.030
 mexican education education and 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.239
 education the day that the children of the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.519
 poorer neighborhoods can attend a 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.790
 high quality school that day 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.130
 we will be farming with mexico - 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.970
 is equal and of course mexico capable of 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.010
 fight the poor 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.980
 well in quality education we can not 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.450
 advance then even as a policy 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.140
 long-term social education 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.420
 quality is fundamental 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.860
 test or free to transform
