00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
 this is from a new album of him 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.260
 I do not know how you can play under 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.480
 acoustics 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.250
 so that it sounds good well shorter 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.439
 look what I got I picked up 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 this song in the standard order 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 to keep my guitars 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.630
 but almost all chords will be sets 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.630
 look it turned out 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.130
 Oh 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.850
 angle 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.890
 but 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.210
 there 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.479
 but 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.510
 so how to play this song on acoustic 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.420
 the guitar is of course senility well let's 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.900

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.180
 sadism but also put on the second on 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.300
 fourth year bar for 5 by 2 strings at 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.520
 the sixth year 3 4 in the introduction to kakheti 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.620
 still play and that is there on hard 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.370
 sounds i don't know just there chaotically 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.370
 you can just play 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:11.070
 what type is such a couplet couplet 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:13.380
 Can be on diversity and play so the 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.050
 have you hit two times down then 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.810
 just slightly muffle the vaio strings you 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.050
 beat fast one of the top over there 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.880
 Will you be guided by song if 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.270
 there will be small inserts between such 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.820
 a chord that is a chord and that is to say 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.120
 the fifth fret of the bar I'm in the sixth year 3 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.300
 pulled on 4 5 and then in F sharp minor 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.220
 seventh chord shorter in the second year bar on 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:47.260
 4 5 countries 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:51.030
 and 5 then before the refrain will start 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.030
 such a small bridge on 2 chords 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.590
 spyro cards but on the second fret 2 3 4 and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:06.760
 chord c or even on the second fret of the bar by 4 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.510
 3 4 well and now the chorus and so on 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.510
 play from and sing 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.840
 that is, the first piece that is played 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.610
 two times it's on 4 chords this then 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.810
 here 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.509
 then here that is on the first this third 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.689

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:53.779
 second fret 1 3 1 3 2 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:57.019
 what a fight that is down 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:05:00.739
 who cast down from up down down up 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:03.569

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:08.569
 up down up 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.569
 so 2 times then this piece 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.190
 once that is just blows down 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.040
 apple a5 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.210
 and 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.390
 again the couplet begins hope everything 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.390
 understandably
