00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.980
 a leg 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.630
 but 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 so April 4th, 2012 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.030
 eight o'clock in the morning temperature overboard 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 minus one degree 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.580
 west wind of about 6 meters per second 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.050
 we arrived at the foot of the confluence 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.090
 in the river linda in the morning by the whole team all 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.160
 went together do not burn log 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.740
 searching for a predator balanced 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.220
 udilnika me but a predator itself is not particularly 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.900
 manifested therefore one part of our 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.070
 the team decided to go 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.080
 even lower in search of intractable pikes and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.810
 perch and perch 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.020
 and the other part went back to the mouth 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.550
 Linda about 200 meters higher 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 confluence and and prepositions without seeing 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.530
 I love poklevok at a depth of about 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.380
 two meters began to drill holes closer to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.410
 shore and then we had a surprise 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.750
 more precisely a few surprises first 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.899
 the depth at the place of fishing was only 10 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.750
 up to 30 centimeters from ice thickness therefore 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.830
 had to be holding very carefully 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.430
 vigorous weight 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.780
 one awkward movement and it was possible 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.130
 knives on the bottom at such a depth 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.850
 our loved ones 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.680
 unwrapped 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.370
 where was the overclocking they did not work 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.500
 so I had to catch the moth second 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.200
 the surprise was not just availability on 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.290
 such a depth of fish at its nice size 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.660
 we first caught such a mile and with 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.330
 habits lost in apiaries some 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.460
 the number of mormyshek but gradually 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.000
 adapted to the conditions of fishing and the case 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.020
 gone 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.260
 began to come across a nice roach from 150 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.270
 up to 300 grams the wells worked better 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.860
 which or near which 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.860
 snags were present 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.010
 also worked well and this trick 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.470
 to attract fish one of us 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.570
 guessed down to 1 thin twig and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.950
 move it up a little 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.740
 small cloud of turbidity 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.630
 as a rule immediately after this procedure 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.630
 should pay bite plasma 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.100
 but roach did not stop 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.930
 except did not begin to fall plump 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.980
 hunchy wolf she has a beauty 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.460
 ruddies weight best specimens 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.400
 reached 400 grams so much it was 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.310
 it is nice and unusual to fish such a fish 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.120
 on the one meter stretch of line you can 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.260
 just imagine after the capture 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.980
 several pieces 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.770
 nibble in this place as rules on 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.330
 some time stopped and had to 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.330
 switch to a new lamp 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:59.550
 fishing slowly increased mood 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:05.669
 we improved after dinner began to subside 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:09.110
 the wind slowly came out the sun 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.110
 finally became spring 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.220
 here she is beautiful rudd linda 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.200
 meanwhile, my guide light reached out 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.200
 rows of fishermen 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.569
 they did not look very cheerful and led away 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.569
 you are much more modest knife 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.230
 and this is the catch of one of our colleagues as 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.730
 see perch 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.730
 good plotter and grated pier 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.970
 in the evening our friends returned too 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.800
 blanc heart 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:15.130
 perseverance and work transferred their result 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.130
 in general, everyone was happy 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.020
 after talking to the good 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.240
 mood 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:37.620
 we went to our parking lot 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:41.120
 car benefit to them was just not 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.120
 more than 10 minutes walk 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.510
 but 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.720
 we were a little afraid that the road 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.780
 limp 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:10.350
 but on the SUVs could without problems 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.900
 go to the highway and if you are thinking 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.820
 repeat our route in a passenger car 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.919
 it would be better to leave your car 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.289
 near the highway 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:26.190
 right after the bridge over 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:29.000
 wonderful river dish good to you 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.000
 fishing
