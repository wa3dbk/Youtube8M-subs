 the show that we still can not tell 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.680

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.590
 Thought but we are working 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.050
 enough on line 2 and worked hard 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.550

 this year to disclose all the material 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.340
 It's the marketing of the movie now that goes 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.650
 to start disclosing we still have 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.120
 conditions of the galaxy that develop in the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.810
 The past will also be doing what 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.430
 will make it possible to see the species there 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.370

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.650

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:36.550
 different part is to keep the surprise but 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.400
 is it going to be a different piece 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.570
