00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
orange and Miguel's kind of vibrant

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.140 
orange and Miguel's kind of vibrant
yellow<00:02:27.390> orange<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:29.280> color<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.700> kind<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
yellow orange and the color is kind of

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.020 
yellow orange and the color is kind of
similar<00:02:30.530> because<00:02:31.530> there's<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.790> much

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
similar because there's not that much

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
similar because there's not that much
actually<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.660> same<00:02:36.900> color<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.410> him<00:02:37.650> acai

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
actually of the same color on him acai

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.610 
actually of the same color on him acai
goes<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.970> different<00:02:39.300> colors<00:02:39.600> but<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.290> still

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
goes the different colors but they still

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.130 
goes the different colors but they still
look<00:02:40.740> nice<00:02:40.980> today<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:41.970> them<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:43.080> I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
look nice today I really like them but I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.350 
look nice today I really like them but I
think<00:02:43.470> it'd<00:02:43.590> look<00:02:43.710> better<00:02:44.040> if<00:02:44.220> Miguel<00:02:44.910> had<00:02:45.240> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
think it'd look better if Miguel had the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.350 
think it'd look better if Miguel had the
corrected<00:02:46.200> black<00:02:46.830> spoiler<00:02:47.760> which<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.120> think

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
corrected black spoiler which I think

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.420 
corrected black spoiler which I think
they<00:02:48.510> should<00:02:48.780> come<00:02:48.990> out<00:02:49.110> with<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.430> newer

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
they should come out with a newer

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.860 
they should come out with a newer
version<00:02:51.000> Miguel<00:02:51.570> Camino<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:52.320> they<00:02:52.920> haven't

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870

lot better so let's take a give them a
rotation<00:03:10.230> turn<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.860> here<00:03:11.130> if<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.820> could<00:03:12.030> find<00:03:12.240> my

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
rotation turn on here if I could find my

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.790 
rotation turn on here if I could find my
switch<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.560> yeah<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.770> had<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> game<00:03:17.490> online<00:03:18.800> but
