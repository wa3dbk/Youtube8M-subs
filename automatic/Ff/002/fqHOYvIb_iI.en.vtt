00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.920
 Yes, I very much not me Hello everybody 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:11.250
 Today I would like to introduce you to Relax Signal Ax &amp; Signal Cherry Soa. 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.250
 I'm sorry 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:31.000
 I think this is very very interesting I want to say in the green light by low waiting at a red light 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:35.510
 As Shinnosuke also said during the sentence , it is Mr. Leander 's sense of full open 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.280
 And this is the good part of Masked Rider Drive I 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.699
 I really like it because I think there is and on the other side of the box 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:49.159
 And how to transform into a small Kamen Rider 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:55.530
 How to attack at Tsukuji was described 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:01:01.019
 When the Toka Tsuko' say year Lloyd I have to come up with package recently cup that I think 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:07.409
 I know Kamen Rider Wizard to use the Da' Deluxe Ax caliber, but this time 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:15.619
 The comparison of the size and weight comparison with that Ax Caliber will also be done together 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.619
 Let's take it out Let's take out zaza 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.140
 It is quite big- 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:28.590
 Yes Let's take a closer look at the signal chaser 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:33.810
 First of all, it looks like this 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:40.109
 And here consisting essentially of the case of flare pattern but three places and here 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:46.619
 Already cool even just by looking at the Ka' have entered after back here. 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:48.610
 And it is the color of the body , but this is also a deluxe version so it is not just a black molded color 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.990
 Slightly sparkling 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 It was said that it became a molding color containing something like a bur 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:06.940
 And since the image of the god of death is strong when speaking of small, the parts of this skull are firmly 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.600
 It's finely shaped and it's pretty cool, so let 's see the next ax 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:16.460
 Let's take a closer look 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:24.290
 First of all, it looks like this and the design is a pedestrian signal 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:28.590
 It looks like a pedestrian signal dedicated to Lloyd, and the button on the star button signal is on the handle. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.879
 Please wait while and look good and come with 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.980
 It is written that it seems to light up with LED as well- 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:41.299
 The trigger is not attached to the bottom of the push-button signal 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.610
 It was in an easy-to-grip position when gripped 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:48.500
 And there is a box to put a battery in the part of the handle on the back side and the speaker is pushed 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.080
 Behind the button signal 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.970
 Signal bike and shift face here with power button and here 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.690
 For the time being there is a switch for it 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.870
 But let's check the battery immediately 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.870
 As we assumed battery and put on, let's turn on power supply 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.320
 If you press the trigger in this state let me not shine beautifully Ohfu 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.820
 It is a sound of slashing over here 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.790
 It looks like one kind Next, let's pull the trigger after pressing the push button 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.160
 Pulling the trigger on the way, waiting for press the push button of low-like state 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.890
 I will be waiting for you forever 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.569
 Use then the signal body Come on still 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.200
 Let's beat the cafe 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.200
 Finally people 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.660
 Do you push the push button once in this state? 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.600
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:41.690
 Hold the pie and push the button and wait 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:48.700
 Their I invoke the deathblow by pulling the I'm ne trigger to say, but this street guard 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.700
 If you do not hear happens it is interesting that let's do it in right away 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:20.600
 It is fine and it becomes neat after getting blue 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:26.960
 It flashes like a pedestrian signal and it's back to red 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:33.400
 Masusa I think this is a very interesting Do not have been faithfully reproduced 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:37.150
 And if you compare the size with the ax caliber 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:41.529
 The part of the well is overwhelmingly 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:46.719
 It's big but it's big but it looks like 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:52.689
 It does not change so much The feeling Ax Caliber is only about longer 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:58.089
 It already is the only is the light of art to signal ax 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:06:00.039
 Bucks borrowed bar than for small children too heavy was about a little heavy 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.520
 Isn't it just okay? 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:11.020
 Well then 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:11.020
 Well I think I'd like to play with the driver flame and become a little smaller rider . 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.720
 Prosperity 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.569
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.770
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.770

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.770

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:57.029
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:12.680
 Yes more than that is introduced in the deluxe signal Ax &amp; signal body many of those things 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:18.050
