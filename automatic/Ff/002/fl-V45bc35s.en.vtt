 print the photos and using a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 free edition program called 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.179
 photoscape as you see has many 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 functionalities among them the one of 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.359
 photo retouching and it really is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.909
 pretty good to be totally

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.590
 include 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.150
 to mark more than one image at the same 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.700
 click on the first time while 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.409
 press the uppercase key then without 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.300
 stop pressing the key click on 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.610
 the last of the images like this 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.170
 all selected at one time another 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.090
 option to select more than one 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.550
 image is going puncturing a while 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.050
 you have pressed the control key a 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.759
 Once you have added them, go to the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.530
 column on the right and select the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.009
 size and orientation that you want 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.009
 have I choose a size of 35 x 4 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.630
 centimeters you can also modify the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.390
 separation that you want there to be between 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.340
 each photo the less millimeters 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.179
 choose more photos you can print in a 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.890
 single box 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.020
 I have selected the option of 12 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.820
 millimeters then you can also choose 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.560
 How do you want the photo to appear? 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.780
 chosen to scale to the desk so that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.700
 be provided 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.140
 as you see you can also rotate the photos 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.140
 to print them that way 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.920
 and another option would be to include a title 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.300
 under them you select this will appear 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.100
 the name connect and you have saved the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.170
 picture so if you want something to appear 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.430
 specifically do not forget to change 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.430
 before the name of your photo 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.100
 to print the adjustment photos of 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.050
 print and select your printer on 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.550
 type of paper and so on and then you can 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.870
 give the option to print 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.870
 start printing the photos 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.849
 to make the magnets you will need photos 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.530
 printed in small size and or 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.360
 printed on a normal sheet but you 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.239
 You can use photo paper and 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.920
 will be better as I said before 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.220
 from among mine the largest 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.380
 it has 3.5 x 4 centimeters the rest are 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.940
 smaller to make the magnets 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.459
 you will also need scissors 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.860
 glue on cardboard bar and some magnets 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.630
 as for the cardboard it is better that it is a 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.319
 thin cardboard like for example from a box 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.319
 of utilities 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.459
 once you have printed all the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.989
 photos cut following the edge of 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.280
 the photo leaving a white box 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.510
 around as a price 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.510
 I will do the first 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.870
 when you've cut them out it's time to 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.830
 paste it on the cardboard to stick them on 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.960
 used glue in bar 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.910
 if you do not want the cardboard to stick out 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.710
 around the photos take advantage of the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.740
 space and paste the next photos between 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.120
 yes then you can cut them if 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.680
 you want the cardboard to stick out 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.260
 alternate that the photo pasted with 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.820
 enough distance from each other like 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.500
 I already told you, you can make the frame 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.000
 using the folio if the cardboard is 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.190
 white as it is my case you can take advantage 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.200
 to make a dog frame of all 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.450
 sides of the photograph make marks with 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.340
 help from a rule in this way place 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.860
 the ruler diagonally so 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.890
 that passes through the vertices of the photo and 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.740
 make a point where you want me in 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.330
 this photo I made it at 3 millimeters 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.850
 when you have marked the four points 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.470
 unites them with a pen later 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.060
 You can cut following the line of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.800
 pencil 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.390
 if what you want to do is leave a 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.700
 space in the upper lower part 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.590
 you just have to put the rule like this 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.470
 and mark the distance you want to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.850
 have each of the edges in my case 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.239
 I will make them equal of 5 mm 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.099
 and then one of the lines 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.960
 do the same if you want the flange 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.960
 protrude only from the sides 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.430
 once you have trimmed the photos 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.169
 that you have stuck to the cardboard we are going to 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.620
 protect them with adhesive lining to 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.620
 books 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.940
 for it he cut a piece of lining 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.620
 It has to be something bigger than 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.620
 photo that we want to protect with him 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.520
 then place the mouth city letter 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.520
 up and paste the photo on it 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.080
 Press to make sure 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.670
 then cut the corners to leave 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.670
 a kind of flaps on each side 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.420
 from gauze flaps to the back of the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.420
 paperboard 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.580
 finally we just have to paste the inau 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.350
 with glue I have done it with 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.919
 glue stick but if you want to be 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.330
 Sure you can use another more powerful 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.400
 remember that you should always do it under 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.610
 supervision of an adult 6 minor 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.610
 age 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.380
 and that's all you see is a manualidad 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.050
 very easy and cool in an original way 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.820
 to show off your photos I hope that I have 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.340
 liked if you make a magnet inspired by 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.690
 this tutorial I would love to see you send 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.460
