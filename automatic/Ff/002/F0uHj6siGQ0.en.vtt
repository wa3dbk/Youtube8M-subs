00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.790
 we keep 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.420
 what against and today there is one 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.029
 what I did take a while 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.989
 I believe before we scored again 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.009
 I also want to have to make four and five, but well in the end they go in and out 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.899
 we are happy with that 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.310
 anyway it is per 2 in the right place and then they just 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.009
 to lay down therein 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.289
 be for us as a team 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.779
 in total not in shape was the chance of a unique by contributing 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.049
 with which the case lies out of the wall for more pas a framework its more than an hour 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.910
 hp that 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.740
 the hackers computers and the team keeper 6 that says fisherman 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 it is still blown after enjoying 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.250
 yes, but then you don't just go for the goal 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.840
 and m the fact that the field game was good the clothes again a lot of chances 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.940
 have created the damage for that too only that falls away if the result is there 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.650
 is not 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.710
 after the two previous matches so that 2 3 also shot in 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.799
 what should have been 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.219
 Such great odds get what everyone else he talked about the good game 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.710
 about enjoying 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.140
 but it is ultimately about weighting the books 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.740
 why you insure upper body parties 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 Wrong a lot of chances to find a name yet everything and way case more 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.710
 fits according to them 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 we owe that to after the striker attracting peter from uhm was also before 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.039
 to start a tour there is hardly any room for sports week 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.140
 Tom Jones will be a new marriage to know what they are offering so 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.200
 to offer 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.660
 The neighborhood seems to have lasted so once through a sort I got one 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.720
 the share in 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.930
 also for learning children who continuously tour 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
 the offer that costs an oliebol mark rutte wants precisely this kind of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.330
 but the rates to less substantial there from offer in the the barbeque 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.160
 clothesline oil extraction can disturb citizens 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.510
 the scores sort of a barrier certainly fell by what did you think of today 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.880
 well I think you can see that he still has to take many steps 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.799
 the scary happy that he shoots them because he is there he is 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.870
 indeed to come 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.440
 but I can do much better, I am convinced 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.100
 is the only smack 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.870
 that counter goal 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.460
 yes I am very sick of course of course also starts with unnecessary 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.459
 ball loss 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.480
 then we could have intervened ourselves and as far as I am concerned 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.510
 my bank could judge the captain an easy given penalty kick it was 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.279
 is too cold 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.059
 it was very easy 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.899
 And that is because we do have a canal that has such a work of art 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.359
 the platform boest gives them another one-year-old child 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.579
 I need you of course you want you can it makes sense that your greeting can 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.249
 play football but if the results are not forthcoming 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.919
 you actually don't get along with that 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.069
 and that is why I have extraordinary
