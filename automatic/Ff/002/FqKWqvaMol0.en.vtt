00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:18.690
 as they say hi to all 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.300
 these soldier races and today we are 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.400
 find for a little glitch finally 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.650
 small rather fat precisely on 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.609
 assassin's creed brotherhood 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 I wanted to make that gray only for the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.160
 chain punish iron beating for me 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 really be a string causes of ac 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 Besides I really looked at their 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 videos it helped me a lot but make 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 a lot more call of than anything 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.230
 so I decided to offer them a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 road play he had not given 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 so to make this glitch you have to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.770
 you find on the map you have to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.750
 find here, so I'll zoom in 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.539
 so you see relative to the map 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.989
 it's to the left you see a 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.520
 river like this to give you a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.660
 kind of landmarks retain this form 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.660
 this is c 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.540
 we can dock we can say I can 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.180
 say so remember these seven little ones 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.850
 lines especially in fact compared to by 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.910
 example that allows me to spot me 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.800
 where it is also next to a larousse 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.540
 rice so here we go right away 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.580
 so to make this glitch you should 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.520
 position your boat 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.360
 here so it's an out of my part I 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.490
 want to clarify it 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.620
 you will have to position your mark here 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.880
 then you can not go in normal 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.110
 you can notice because actually 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.600
 in normal times we are not supposed to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.170
 to be able to go there it's normal it's at 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.360
 top map 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.850
 so in fact I'm explaining to you in this 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.400
 game there are a lot of climbing combos 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.900
 of cloth is so I can say and that's 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.090
 precisely what will allow us to 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.340
 to jump is dying then simply 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.290
 you press rer on eric roy and 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.660
 you continue while the amount on the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.520
 wall so here you are out of map 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.260
 I will show you a little bit 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.260
 more after so I'm going to redo 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.670
 good story so you will be you 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.020
 call me air cross to climb on 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.610
 the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.490
 on the agreement finally on the boat 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.740
 here and while orienting your pretty this 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.240
 type of moving to the wall you 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.040
 continue to maintain the kidneys and believes 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.200
 depressed and that's what will you 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.650
 allow one to simply get out of the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.959
 map 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.950
 so as you do not see there I am at 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:37.680
 top my part it's still visible at 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.680
 bush then especially ground 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.270
 I think it's a glitch anyway 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.459
 pretty amazing it plays that sound of 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.530
 mac but it's also a hunter map 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:54.760
 so there you see you are on the other 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:57.850
 side and then to go under the map 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.850
 it's simple you head here 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.980
 so I show you a little bit here on the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.650
 donate what kind of hill you 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.530
 head you continue to corent these 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.540
 dead there are you stuck so you 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.910
 continue elongated and normal when 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.780
 you have a moment go down more 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.970
 deeply 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.269
 you're going to swim so you do not 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.739
 you go by that so the farthest 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.209
 possible outside the mapa do not know 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.239
 not what poses a space that poses a 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.239
 problem 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.050
 and here you are under maps or the map 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.850
 it's true it's not that good not used 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.910
 frankly to much except spotting 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.950
 maybe stuff for example under 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.440
 houses could see what's at 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.320
 the interior eventually these churches 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.510
 I do not really use much but 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.180
 knowing that there is no part of this 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.100
 my skin in multiplayer but that's when 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.200
 even something pretty low of enough 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.590
 Wholesale chug maps on a map as 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.580
 great 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.260
 with a polka dot term I think it's 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.010
 that huh cleach that deserves to be on 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.420
 Google FR 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.340
 Besides, I hope he has the bridge 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.379
 the one in price and a thank you day 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.989
 for you my subscribers I thank you 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.519
 to have kept this glitch I think that 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.920
 you have several to try to do it 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.130
 I hope so it's a bag 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.570
 settled here so on this I tell you 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.190
 hi everyone had an excellent 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.609
 day to the next 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.609
 Hi
