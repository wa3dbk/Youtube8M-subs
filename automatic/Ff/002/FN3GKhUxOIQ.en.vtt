anything I know silver is going to be
worth<00:01:00.360> something<00:01:00.860> I<00:01:01.860> plan<00:01:02.790> on<00:01:02.970> keeping<00:01:03.150> these

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
worth something I plan on keeping these

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.680 
worth something I plan on keeping these
for<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> rest<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> my<00:01:04.229> life<00:01:04.409> unless<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690

for the rest of my life unless we have a
economic<00:01:06.690> collapse<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:09.920> figure<00:01:10.920> 27<00:01:11.580> pieces<00:01:11.940> of

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
economic collapse so figure 27 pieces of

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.670 
economic collapse so figure 27 pieces of
fine<00:01:14.040> silver<00:01:14.460> will<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.780> job<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.230> mean<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
fine silver will do the job I mean I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.460 
fine silver will do the job I mean I
could<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.520> something<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.540> trade

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
could use something like this to trade

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.090 
could use something like this to trade
for<00:01:19.710> water<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.220> could<00:01:20.790> trade<00:01:21.510> for<00:01:21.540> food<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.470> can

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100

for water I could trade for food I can
trade<00:01:23.370> for<00:01:23.400> ammunition<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
trade for ammunition if I have to this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.700 
trade for ammunition if I have to this
is<00:01:25.980> always<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.760> be<00:01:26.910> worth<00:01:27.270> something<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

always<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.580> worth<00:01:35.970> something<00:01:36.410> paper

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
always going to be worth something paper

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.080 
always going to be worth something paper
money<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.130> always<00:01:38.370> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.850> worth

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
money is not always going to be worth

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.130 
money is not always going to be worth
something<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.050> it's<00:01:40.740> always<00:01:40.980> good<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.220> have

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
something so it's always good to have

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.820 
something so it's always good to have
flattered<00:01:43.140> over<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:43.620> guys<00:01:44.000> also<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.150> two

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
flattered over here guys also have two

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.360 
flattered over here guys also have two
old<00:01:46.830> silver<00:01:47.640> chains<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.980> don't<00:01:49.980> know<00:01:50.100> what<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
old silver chains I don't know what the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.070 
old silver chains I don't know what the
weight<00:01:50.550> on<00:01:50.730> those<00:01:50.910> are<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.840> probably

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
weight on those are but they probably

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.580 
weight on those are but they probably
weigh<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.800> more<00:01:52.980> than<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
weigh a little bit more than the the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.430 
weigh a little bit more than the the
corns<00:01:55.980> which<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.460> ounce<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.570> figured

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
corns which is one ounce so I figured

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.010 
corns which is one ounce so I figured
maybe<00:01:58.470> all<00:01:58.860> together<00:01:59.570> probably<00:02:00.570> about<00:02:00.750> have

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
maybe all together probably about have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
maybe all together probably about have
about<00:02:01.640> 30<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.390> 32<00:02:03.750> ounces<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.620> fine<00:02:05.520> silver

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
about 30 to 32 ounces of fine silver

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.029 
about 30 to 32 ounces of fine silver
here<00:02:06.180> guys<00:02:07.369> they<00:02:08.369> got<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.000> something<00:02:10.039> if

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
