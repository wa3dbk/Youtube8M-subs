00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
down so we actually worked a lot off of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
down so we actually worked a lot off of
like<00:01:28.500> things<00:01:29.190> that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.400> used<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.000> we

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
like things that we used to do when we

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.670 
like things that we used to do when we
were<00:01:30.300> younger<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.690> started<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
were younger we started going back to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
were younger we started going back to
things<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.190> using<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.760> anime<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.300> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
comic books and stuff that started our

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.850 
comic books and stuff that started our
pretty<00:01:35.580> much<00:01:35.700> careers<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> drawing<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:37.200> we

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
pretty much careers in the drawing so we

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.859 
pretty much careers in the drawing so we
kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.190> took<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.640> revisited<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
kind of just took that revisited it and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
kind of just took that revisited it and
merged<00:01:40.770> them<00:01:40.979> both<00:01:41.130> together<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
merged them both together and kind of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.310 
merged them both together and kind of
came<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.600> ruthless<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.050> ruthless

you<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.080> think<00:01:49.380> certain<00:01:50.159> designs<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.790 
you know I think certain designs in
general<00:01:51.090> everybody<00:01:52.080> can<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.470> relate<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
general everybody can kind of relate to

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.950 
general everybody can kind of relate to
and<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.280> something<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.729> common<00:01:53.760> with<00:01:54.120> and

and have something in common with and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.090 
and have something in common with and
that's<00:01:55.050> pretty<00:01:55.260> much<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.650> what<00:01:55.830> we're<00:01:55.979> trying

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
we're doing you know we're doing a

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.490 
we're doing you know we're doing a
chosen<00:02:00.659> design<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.080> it's<00:02:01.200> still<00:02:01.320> got<00:02:01.440> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

chosen design but it's still got a
little<00:02:01.710> edge<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.520> something<00:02:02.790> fun

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
little edge to it it's something fun

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.340 
little edge to it it's something fun
little<00:02:03.180> something<00:02:03.510> that<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.990> well<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
little something that is well the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.230 
little something that is well the
parents<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.770> appreciate<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.550> that's<00:02:05.729> pretty

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
much the fine line that we kind of walk

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.940 
much the fine line that we kind of walk
along<00:02:08.039> every<00:02:08.310> day

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.070 

a<00:02:13.040> lot<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.670> times<00:02:13.849> when<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:14.480> drawing<00:02:14.840> at<00:02:14.930> home

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
a lot of times when I'm drawing at home

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.589 
a lot of times when I'm drawing at home

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
sitting next to me and I see what he

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.320 
sitting next to me and I see what he
reacts<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.580> that's<00:02:19.700> what<00:02:19.849> I'll<00:02:19.940> go<00:02:20.090> with<00:02:20.239> a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
reacts so and that's what I'll go with a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.150 
reacts so and that's what I'll go with a
lot<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.510> times<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.019> designing<00:02:21.349> there's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
lot of times in designing there's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.410 
lot of times in designing there's
certain<00:02:22.370> things<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:22.670> appeal<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:22.940> him<00:02:23.209> and

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.580 
take it today so you can put that
feeling<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.330> see<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.050> want<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.290> go<00:02:27.440> with

feeling and see if they want to go with
it<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:27.920> take<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.519> from<00:02:28.580> there<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:29.090> show

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
it and take it from there and to show

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.880 
it and take it from there and to show
them<00:02:29.599> as<00:02:29.780> well<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.410> know<00:02:30.470> they<00:02:30.620> can<00:02:30.680> let

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
the creativity go anywhere in any

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.430 
the creativity go anywhere in any
direction<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.709> that's<00:02:33.800> not<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.040> bad<00:02:34.220> thing
