it<00:00:17.050> can<00:00:17.320> be<00:00:17.470> used<00:00:17.680> as<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:17.920> coolant<00:00:18.280> via<00:00:18.730> sweating

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
it can be used as a coolant via sweating

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.540 
it can be used as a coolant via sweating
or<00:00:19.450> perspiration

heat<00:00:22.510> from<00:00:22.780> the<00:00:22.900> body<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.290> the<00:00:23.470> organism<00:00:24.010> is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
heat from the body of the organism is

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.860 
heat from the body of the organism is
used<00:00:24.520> to<00:00:24.670> turn<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.030> sweat<00:00:25.360> which<00:00:25.660> is

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
used to turn the sweat which is

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.290 
used to turn the sweat which is
primarily<00:00:26.350> composed<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:27.130> water<00:00:27.370> from<00:00:28.210> a

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
primarily composed of water from a

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.359 
primarily composed of water from a
liquid<00:00:28.660> into<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:29.140> gas<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.740> this<00:00:30.070> therefore

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
liquid into a gas and this therefore

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.119 
liquid into a gas and this therefore
lowers<00:00:31.030> the<00:00:31.210> temperature<00:00:31.420> of<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:32.020> organism

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
lowers the temperature of the organism

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.619 
lowers the temperature of the organism
another<00:00:35.129> thermal<00:00:35.550> property<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.450> water

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
another thermal property is that water

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.600 
another thermal property is that water
has<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> high<00:00:37.260> specific<00:00:37.829> heat<00:00:37.860> capacity

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
has a high specific heat capacity

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.479 
has a high specific heat capacity
relative<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.239> other<00:00:39.390> liquids<00:00:40.190> this<00:00:41.190> means

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
relative to other liquids this means

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.040 
relative to other liquids this means
that<00:00:41.670> water<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.329> absorb<00:00:42.449> more<00:00:42.989> energy

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that water can absorb more energy

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
that water can absorb more energy
relative<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> other<00:00:44.280> liquids<00:00:44.730> before

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
relative to other liquids before

changing temperature therefore ocean

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
changing temperature therefore ocean
