just<00:00:06.939> as<00:00:07.089> a<00:00:07.120> note<00:00:07.209> for<00:00:07.629> the<00:00:07.689> next<00:00:07.959> several

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.140 
just as a note for the next several

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.230 
just as a note for the next several
slides<00:00:08.460> most<00:00:09.460> of<00:00:09.580> the<00:00:09.639> slides<00:00:09.849> are<00:00:09.969> going<00:00:10.150> to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
slides most of the slides are going to

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.570 
slides most of the slides are going to
focus<00:00:10.420> on<00:00:10.660> overall<00:00:11.170> or<00:00:11.440> average<00:00:11.860> odds<00:00:12.099> and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
focus on overall or average odds and

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.430 
focus on overall or average odds and
it's<00:00:13.030> important<00:00:13.480> to<00:00:13.599> note<00:00:13.809> that<00:00:13.839> if<00:00:14.080> any<00:00:14.349> of

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
it's important to note that if any of

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.869 
it's important to note that if any of
the<00:00:14.710> methods<00:00:14.860> I'm<00:00:15.219> talking<00:00:15.549> about<00:00:15.610> today

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
the methods I'm talking about today

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.160 
the methods I'm talking about today
we're<00:00:16.120> actually<00:00:16.240> implemented<00:00:16.900> they<00:00:16.990> might

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
we're actually implemented they might

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.040 
we're actually implemented they might
have<00:00:17.350> really<00:00:17.680> different<00:00:17.920> impacts<00:00:18.730> on

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
have really different impacts on

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.080 
have really different impacts on

specific hunts average odds average
everything<00:00:22.480> from<00:00:22.630> a<00:00:22.720> bennett<00:00:23.019> deer<00:00:23.230> hunt<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.920> a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
everything from a bennett deer hunt to a

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.700 
everything from a bennett deer hunt to a
fairly<00:00:24.369> easy<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.730> draw<00:00:25.029> hunt<00:00:25.359> and<00:00:26.080> it'll<00:00:26.560> have

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
fairly easy to draw hunt and it'll have

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.259 
fairly easy to draw hunt and it'll have
different<00:00:27.130> effects<00:00:27.400> on<00:00:27.580> different<00:00:27.609> types<00:00:28.119> of

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
different effects on different types of

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.740 
different effects on different types of
hunts<00:00:28.570> in<00:00:29.400> particular<00:00:30.400> it's<00:00:30.640> much<00:00:30.970> harder<00:00:31.420> to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
hunts in particular it's much harder to

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.570 
hunts in particular it's much harder to
create<00:00:32.080> meaningful<00:00:32.439> change<00:00:32.890> in<00:00:33.130> a<00:00:33.190> really

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
create meaningful change in a really

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.400 
create meaningful change in a really
hard<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.000> draw<00:00:34.180> hunt<00:00:34.480> than<00:00:34.720> it<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.140> some<00:00:35.320> of

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
hard to draw hunt than it is and some of

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.170 
hard to draw hunt than it is and some of
those<00:00:35.470> easier<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:36.010> draw<00:00:36.190> hunts<00:00:36.520> simply

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
those easier to draw hunts simply

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.990 
those easier to draw hunts simply
because<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:38.140> ratio<00:00:38.620> of<00:00:38.680> applicants<00:00:39.580> to<00:00:39.730> tags

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
because the ratio of applicants to tags

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.930 
because the ratio of applicants to tags
is<00:00:40.330> so<00:00:40.540> skewed<00:00:40.930> in<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.260> hunts<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:41.890> we'll<00:00:42.790> see

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
is so skewed in this hunts and we'll see

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.300 
is so skewed in this hunts and we'll see
that<00:00:43.090> a<00:00:43.120> little<00:00:43.360> further<00:00:43.540> alone<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:45.040> first

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
that a little further alone so first

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.560 
that a little further alone so first
we're<00:00:45.520> going<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.670> look<00:00:45.850> at<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.060> concept<00:00:46.480> of

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
we're going to look at the concept of

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.630 
we're going to look at the concept of
applying<00:00:46.930> longer<00:00:47.380> layouts<00:00:47.770> for<00:00:48.040> successful

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
applying longer layouts for successful

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.120 
applying longer layouts for successful

slides<00:00:51.340> is<00:00:51.520> going<00:00:51.700> to<00:00:51.760> go<00:00:51.850> through<00:00:52.060> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
slides is going to go through the

slides is going to go through the
current<00:00:52.510> situation<00:00:53.140> how<00:00:54.100> it<00:00:54.280> might<00:00:54.400> change

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
current situation how it might change

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.730 
current situation how it might change
odds<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.420> then<00:00:55.540> any<00:00:55.690> potential<00:00:56.320> trade-offs

application<00:00:59.830> might<00:01:00.010> actually<00:01:00.190> have<00:01:00.580> so<00:01:01.120> for

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
application might actually have so for

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.940 
application might actually have so for
longer<00:01:01.570> layouts<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.050> current<00:01:02.320> situation<00:01:02.860> in

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
longer layouts the current situation in

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.859 
longer layouts the current situation in
Idaho<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.550> we<00:01:03.610> have<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.850> one-year<00:01:04.479> layout

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
Idaho is that we have a one-year layout

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.530 
Idaho is that we have a one-year layout
for<00:01:05.440> successful<00:01:06.070> antlered<00:01:06.520> only<00:01:06.910> deer<00:01:07.300> and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
for successful antlered only deer and

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.990 
for successful antlered only deer and
elk<00:01:07.660> applicants<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:09.340> does<00:01:09.520> not<00:01:09.550> apply<00:01:09.820> to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
elk applicants this does not apply to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.760 
elk applicants this does not apply to
any<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.360> our<00:01:10.450> either<00:01:10.720> sex<00:01:11.080> hunts<00:01:11.350> in<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.530> state

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
any of our either sex hunts in the state

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.960 
any of our either sex hunts in the state
and<00:01:11.800> because<00:01:12.130> of<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.460> does<00:01:12.550> not<00:01:12.700> apply<00:01:12.910> to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
and because of that it does not apply to

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.820 
and because of that it does not apply to
any<00:01:13.180> pronghorn<00:01:13.780> hunts<00:01:14.020> because<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:14.680> do<00:01:14.800> not

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
any pronghorn hunts because we do not

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.590 
any pronghorn hunts because we do not
have<00:01:15.130> antlered<00:01:15.610> only<00:01:15.850> pronghorn<00:01:16.300> on<00:01:16.390> it's<00:01:16.510> in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
have antlered only pronghorn on it's in

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.320 
have antlered only pronghorn on it's in
Idaho<00:01:16.960> so<00:01:17.800> what<00:01:17.980> we<00:01:18.100> did<00:01:18.310> is<00:01:18.520> we<00:01:18.550> assess<00:01:19.060> what

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
Idaho so what we did is we assess what

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.510 
Idaho so what we did is we assess what
implementing<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:20.020> two<00:01:20.080> or<00:01:20.380> three-year<00:01:21.010> layout

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
implementing a two or three-year layout

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.390 
implementing a two or three-year layout
period<00:01:21.970> for<00:01:22.150> all<00:01:22.300> three<00:01:22.690> species<00:01:22.960> might<00:01:23.590> do<00:01:24.070> to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
period for all three species might do to

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.760 
period for all three species might do to
drawing<00:01:24.640> rods<00:01:24.910> for<00:01:25.150> those<00:01:25.270> species<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.560> what

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
drawing rods for those species so what

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.440 
drawing rods for those species so what
we<00:01:26.890> did<00:01:27.070> is<00:01:27.250> we<00:01:27.280> assess<00:01:27.700> these<00:01:27.940> effects<00:01:28.300> of

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
we did is we assess these effects of

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.780 
we did is we assess these effects of
these<00:01:28.570> longer<00:01:29.020> layouts<00:01:29.320> on<00:01:29.530> overall<00:01:29.950> odds<00:01:30.370> for

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
about four to five percent improvement

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.450 
about four to five percent improvement
in<00:02:16.840> odds<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.350> again<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.830> average<00:02:18.250> odds

would<00:03:24.220> vary<00:03:24.459> anywhere<00:03:24.700> from<00:03:24.940> about<00:03:25.230> 6500

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
would vary anywhere from about 6500

would vary anywhere from about 6500
dollars<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:27.490> would<00:03:27.670> be<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:27.880> adding

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
dollars that would be just adding

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.300 
dollars that would be just adding

dollars that would be the example of

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.690
