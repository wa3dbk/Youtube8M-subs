00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.520 
routes for each map and again this kind
of<00:02:33.329> depends<00:02:33.689> on<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> game<00:02:33.989> type<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.409> you're

story things like that but basically for

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.890 
story things like that but basically for
each<00:02:41.670> map<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:42.060> want<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.299> pick<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.659> or<00:02:42.689> two

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
each map you want to pick one or two

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.420 
each map you want to pick one or two
maybe<00:02:43.200> even<00:02:43.290> three<00:02:43.560> different<00:02:44.069> routes<00:02:44.250> that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
maybe even three different routes that

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.830 
maybe even three different routes that
you<00:02:44.489> feel<00:02:44.670> comfortable<00:02:44.879> with<00:02:45.150> depending<00:02:45.719> on

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
which side you spawn on and basically

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.149

stick<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.569> those<00:02:48.719> it's<00:02:49.349> not<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> bad<00:02:49.769> idea<00:02:49.799> to

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
stick to those it's not a bad idea to

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.800 
stick to those it's not a bad idea to
switch<00:02:50.280> them<00:02:50.549> up<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.939> between<00:02:51.359> rounds<00:02:51.750> of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
switch them up and between rounds of
