00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello youtube friends , well, today 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.009
 I bring you a video tutorial of how 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.759
 change the songs of the concert in 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.220
 led 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.809
 forde good bros well here we are not going to 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.030
 use any modes or anything for the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.910
 style since they can change the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.039
 songs of your liking 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.800
 they will just have to catch 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.529
 four favorite points four songs 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.599
 that we are going to catch are two for tango 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.099
 and two for the concert 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.680
 Well, I've chosen the songs 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.220
 dragon peseta well because it 's a series 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.500
 that marked my childhood 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.469
 well the first thing we have to go to the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 folder of our game 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.400
 in my case I have my place 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.920
 for 22 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.420
 by default 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 we go where they arrive are 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.890
 come on let's go where he says music 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.550
 let's go where it says it's good because they're 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.550
 the tensions of the concert in any 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 side 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.510
 these are the two songs that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.950
 they listen at the concert when 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.950
 we initiate the orders 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.140
 and now what we are going to do 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.610
 the folder where we have our 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.990
 songs 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.850
 what we are going to do in our 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.770
 songs are mp3 in many cases 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.770
 what we are going to do is change water 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.690
 we changed the handsome file 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.420
 we drag the functions well then I 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.070
 I already have them web they are dragged 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.270
 in my case I do it with sugar if I 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.450
 can do with any other 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.430
 converter and decompress water 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.649
 once all that is done we will have 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.110
 our four songs now what 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.080
 let's do is open the songs the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.850
 first two that will be for the concert 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.710
 how well will never be cut to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.780
 do not confuse me 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.060
 and they are not one of these 2000 songs 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.060
 riders and we hit 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.409
 once we have pasted them then 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.319
 now the four songs what 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.640
 we have to do not eliminate this alone 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.400
 what we are going to do is change your 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 first name 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.250
 because if we do not change the name after 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.470
 of the game will not be able to read it like this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.570
 and you can find it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.300
 well we change the name so you can 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.600
 recognize it 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.790
 is changing the name yes 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.210
 good is how we changed the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.210
 we eliminate 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.200
 and we did the same procedure with 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.860
 another we change the name 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.860
 we cut 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.440
 change the name 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.380
 now the one that says the double we eliminate 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.980
 now we have our two songs 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.230
 for the concert only two now 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.300
 We want to put music for so 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.980
 of fight because we do the same 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.819
 process 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.890
 we go new flower 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.660
 we are in let for the block 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.610
 again 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.390
 we go to the sun 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.900
 we go from music 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.510
 and we go where punk says 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.250
 well these two songs the first 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.470
 of the concert 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.550
 the first and the second since these are 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.550
 those of tango attack 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.260
 let's make them welcome our two 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.670
 folders our two external songs 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.670
 in my helmet with some melodies 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.970
 of fight 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.920
 what are we going to do is cut 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.310
 and paste in our measurement folder 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.310
 tang 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.329
 have a good time because they are 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.820
 many functions when we play with a 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.380
 expert or realistic very difficult me 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.799
 they ask why he has a little more 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.799
 long 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.810
 but if you want to create a song 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.879
 although the tank lasts a lot good 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.440
 once passed to pensions also 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.300

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.349
 change the songs 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.349
 rename 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.199
