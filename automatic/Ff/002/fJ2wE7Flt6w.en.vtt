00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.610
 hello my name is baptist herb I 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.390
 be part of this new generation 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.000
 French saxophonist jazzman where I 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.899
 started my studies of saxophonists hic 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.640
 by the classic like a lot and the 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.170
 jazz appeared quite naturally 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.630
 necessarily when we judge this instrument 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.010
 but at first it was really the most 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.350
 the funk grover washington maceo and the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.010
 parker music the talk a little bit 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.930
 less and if here is the canon ball ala of 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.579
 relay happened naturally I 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.460
 would say if he does a little connection between the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.190
 be bop and the music a little funky and 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.570
 just after charlie parker and all 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.280
 other rp scared and many others the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.490
 first time i have i've seen maceo 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.760
 on TV there was one like a 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.760
 feel a bubbling 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.220
 inside a like that like a 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.720
 revelation and I'm already talking about the point of 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.729
 view of the sound more than the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.460
 technique or the music or 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.740
 particular and that's what I like 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.080
 in the viola it's this opening on the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.810
 are pretty open and then the sound that 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.510
 can also modulate and that gets closer 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.369
 a lot of the voice and then a 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.310
 instrument also with which one can 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.760
 do we can do a lot of styles 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.760
 of music 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.549
 what I like in the viola and in the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.439
 most musicians in any case 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.500
 great musicians who have played or who 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.750
 play viola c7 volubility this 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.240
 energy and it's true that I stayed 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.670
 very long addicted to raising the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.110
 chorus of kenny garrett what exactly 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.830
 there is all this energy also has 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.860
 are a little open a little funky c7 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.979
 aesthetic in any case that I would say 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.740
 more from the start and and on which I 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:34.150
 think I continue a little bit no in this 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:36.880
 lineage even though today I discover 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.970
 a little bit another style of play but 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.640
 I find that the viola precisely and 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.350
 conducive to its 7 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:51.850
 this energy to this the rabbit to the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:55.810
 velocity speed also as a bird 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.790
 to soaring lyricism so from the point 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.170
 from the alto saxophone I learned about 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.930
 an eleven year old on a saxophone brand 6 and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.300
 after my parents bought me a series 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.600
 2 so I kept inserting it very long 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.720
 two for after 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.360
 replay on a marc 6 so I played 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.160
 on for five six years and for 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.860
 come back on this instrument so 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.780
 the alto reference since almost three 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.580
 years that I play this instrument but who 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.590
 I like it a lot 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.570
 simply because it's a marc 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.540
 6th I would say in quotation marks better 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.980
 in any case it is an instrument that is 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.960
 practically similar on on the 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.440
 narrowly perhaps the best on the 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.580
 on the sound it's exactly i would say 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.310
 exactly the same when I play 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.010
 concert it happens to me 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.660
 sometimes to play both instruments 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.920
 or even on my disk I played them 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.020
 two instruments hear no 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.760
 difference at the time when in any case I 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.790
 chose a little bit 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.680
 I was trying to discover the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.510
 the appearance of each instrument up to where 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.310
 we could go and so I got 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.450
 realized that these instruments were 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.450
 really like 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.200
 and the reference may perhaps go a 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.670
 little further because they offer a 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.070
 a sonic palette a little wider 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.289
 the serious a little more generous a 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:51.180
 accuracy in the acute more precise and 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:53.789
 we can more fashion lessons and here I am 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.559
 find that absolutely the name are the 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:00.449
 same qualities as a 6 billion mark 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:02.849
 to his warm open very round very 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.849
 powerful in any case in the lead a pike 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.509
 when we play I would say barely audible 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:13.969
 in quotation marks very piano so who who 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.969
 which allows the one who has no limits 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.949
 I find on this instrument that has a 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.069
 harmonic control that has less on 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:46.439
 a marc 6 or on old instruments 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:50.189
 especially on the over-acute which a 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:54.449
 little more than we can achieve with 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:57.509
 very piano nuances and here's who 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.330
 who are not burst anyway 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:03.360
 when we play hard they are who stays 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.879
 on a mobility crane and especially the 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.289
 serious that are quite imposing and I like 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:13.610
 although serious a tone a little more 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.610
 severe harmonic
