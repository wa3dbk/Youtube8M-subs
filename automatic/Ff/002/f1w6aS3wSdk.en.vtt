00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.230
 good afternoon 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.660
 as promised to leave now the node that is 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.730
 flame is to thank and I will teach 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.120
 to you how does he come to this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.970
 result here is a bit difficult and as 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.100
 I already promised that I could do 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.220
 so I'll show you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.869
 step by step how do you do 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 during the video passed some photos 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.540
 step by step and I'm going to teach 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.640
 You, as the video shows in the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 end told you first that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.620
 It's good that you leave this one 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.870
 larger part of the tie of the height of the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.780
 height of your navel 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:57.719
 It's more or less this line plus she 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:01:00.210
 a little more and tie ties the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.149
 the largest part of the recording of the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 better saying tie 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.240
 behind this result 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.820
 photo then take this and most 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.970
 throw in 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.009
 Then you'll throw everything in. 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.380
 will pull it fixed it will stay in that 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 after you do that on that side 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.180
 from the pocket the pocket on this side you give 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.030
 one full turn in front of the tie 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.720
 until it appears this is common kinkle 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.060
 equal 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.060
 you can check after you 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.950
 finished knot you throw from inside to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:52.280
 was left over and finalized the first 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:57.329
 part of the node as shown in the image 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.560
 after you've finished playing and put 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.939
 beside 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.270
 You'll put your finger here like 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.829
 space form gives one cycles and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.690
 with the tip 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.100
 you pass dengue 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.570
 came in and pulls alive making us jean and 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.790
 pull and pull until you form that part 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.860
 it's left you play for 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.200
 inside 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.570
 can also pull to close the first 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.650
 part you can already notice a first 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:36.590
 has been ready now with the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.590
 match that brings you that leftover you come 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.690
 goes over 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:55.620
 The second one on this side you get what 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:03:08.870
 left over and a second after you 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:08.870
 do all this, then pull that tip 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.050
 you will realize that she will stay one 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.590
 so short on its size 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.739
 as we can see you do you 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.900
 secure fixed knot and pulls that larger part 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.440
 to fit up over your neck 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.920
 so when you get to the limit of the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.920
 your neck 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.410
 we can see and that simple tip you 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.739
 he picks it up here on the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:51.300
 Collar will stay here on how you 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:54.750
 pick it up and down on the left side of the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.200
 your shirt collar 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.810
 in the end you will realize that she is going 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.050
 stay a bit mainly like this 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.390
 my fabric is too thin and it's easier 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.080
 do with that type of tie then 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:16.760
 you take off the necktie the iron has 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:21.630
 iron and ironing again 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.920
 this is the end result of the node is the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.610
 gradient 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.350
 as will also show the photos and still 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.890
 plus add this video to give a 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:37.920
 tip will stay will get strange if 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.030
 You wear this 9h of 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.620
 they are striped or plaid by 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.300
 example it is difficult to make a new hd in 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.490
 striped ties first you get 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.260
 confuses a lot and according to this increase 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.570
 the fabric was thick the new will stay 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.380
 very large so I do not indicate black and 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.150
 tie also the gradient noel will not 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.450
 good for ties as well 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.900
 Like this one of polka dots because it also goes 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.600
 confused when it comes to doing the most 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.880
 indicated are you doing in plain ties 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.840
 as these two examples so much more 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.760
 black or else you can do in 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.600
 red tie any of these three 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.490
 examples 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.640
 other examples and tie book too 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.250
 It will be good to always remember 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.860
 Noel is good for you to do in 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.050
 ties on other types of 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.450
 tie will get hard this is the tip 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.090
 today 's new as promised was made 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.550
 I hope you enjoy doing the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.190
 your ties to wear on all your 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.440
 events be the meeting wedding 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.890
 Congress assemblies and destruction of this 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.890
 beauty
