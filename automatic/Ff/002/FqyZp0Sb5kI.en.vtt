00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:02.230
 Automatically translated by the machine. Good morning! 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.900
 Welcome to another version of the morning makeup, I do my makeup and chat with us. 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.900
 Today's look, a little retro. Start the basics as usual. 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.370
 Apply the next big mascara. When I went to James with a lot of country rock 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.480
 I did a lot of my performances. This is quite a lot, let me go and see. 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.100
 The coat covers all the way with a white eye shadow brow. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.519
 This is a very simple matter, as long as you have a liquid eyeliner and a lip liner. 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.620
 Red lipstick, but many people are afraid, once you know how to deal with it, it is not 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 That is terrible. Sparkling dark brown shadows and drawing 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.050
 Wing. Around the eye, so it forms a sharp "C" shaped top to continue 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.050
 s eyes. Just draw a line and leave it blank. 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.310
 This line creates a depth and a higher, you take it deeper and your eyes will look. 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 Just make sure the two sides match. Raise the brush gently 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.030
 all. Don't mix too much because you don't want to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.480
 The complete boundary becomes blurred. I miss the Rockabilly band I want to see, we use 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 It’s time to dance! Liquid eyeliner and wing draw a thick line 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.320
 come out. I think the simplest liquid eyeliner is used when it's 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.480
 A felt tip. You can just embellish instead of drawing 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.969
 It is in place until it forms a line. The line should start with a thin inner corner of the eye 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:19.969
 Get a thick outer side. Is a very useful felt tip 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.810
 Wing too, because you can just press in place to flick. 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.810
 Then just fill in any gaps. Easy to do and much easier to try to control 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.560
 A proper brush. Make sure you can rely on solid things like 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.560
 A table so your hands don't tremble! If you need it, you can also pull the eyelids. 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.030
 The skin is tight and you do it to keep it steady. Taadaa, easy! 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.290
 Add some feathery false eyelashes. My favorite part goes to the country rock show 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.290
 Looking at the old couple dance, so cute! Line up your lips with a bright red lip liner. 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.129
 I am always in the middle of the top and bottom and start working on my way out. 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.329
 Instead of a big line, use a small feather-like brush stroke and take it slowly. 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.549
 We danced almost every weekend. Country rock concerts are great because of dancing 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.549
 Everyone is so friendly! Many people who have participated in the region have been listening 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.150
 Music because they are kids too. Fill in the lip liner. 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.200
 This is the edge that is much easier to do. I think most of the bands we see 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:11.939
 Break now, so sad. I have the best top lip is a smile 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.340
 You apply the inner liner. You can see the shape of the finished product, you go 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.940
 It's easier to use such lips to pull tightly. 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.250
 Apply a thin layer of red lipstick. The lip liner base will be lipstick 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.340
 Last longer. Add a little blush. 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.880
 This is definitely a look you need to wear out to dance! 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.860
 I love, so I added a little lip gloss to the shiny lips. 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.360
 Matte red lips, although this style is very beautiful. 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.510
 Completed. It’s not exactly like this. 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.410
 Match the hair. Link in the description hair tutorial! 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.230
 Definitely would be a little better than my bathrobe, and. 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.380
 I hope this is a useful video. Please blog post link in description 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.880
 More information and tutorials. Thanks so much for watching! 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.350
 Goodbye!
