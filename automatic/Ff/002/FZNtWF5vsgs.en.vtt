kind of wanted to push ourselves to do
something<00:02:42.790> beyond<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.480> it's

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
something beyond that and it's

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.440 
something beyond that and it's
definitely<00:02:44.200> not<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.440> documentary<00:02:45.070> either<00:02:45.460> so

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
definitely not a documentary either so

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.830 
definitely not a documentary either so
it's<00:02:46.630> kind<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.850> kind<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.880> falls<00:02:49.120> somewhere<00:02:49.540> in

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
it's kind of kind of falls somewhere in

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.330 
it's kind of kind of falls somewhere in
there<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.050> wouldn't<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.740> how<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:50.980> really

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
there I wouldn't know how to really

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.000 
there I wouldn't know how to really
categorize<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.210> but<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.050> whole<00:02:53.230> idea<00:02:53.410> was

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
categorize it but the whole idea was

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.940 
categorize it but the whole idea was
really<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.280> kind<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:55.380> give<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.500> feeling

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
what I experienced was inspired by my

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.220 
what I experienced was inspired by my
kind<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.460> wanderings<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.180> spent<00:03:04.480> six<00:03:04.810> months<00:03:04.900> in

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
Indonesia just kind of pushing myself to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.150 
Indonesia just kind of pushing myself to
go<00:03:09.160> beyond<00:03:09.490> what<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.790> normally<00:03:09.880> would<00:03:10.540> do<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:11.620> a

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
me actually that scene that was the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.340 
me actually that scene that was the
first<00:03:44.020> time<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.160> set<00:03:45.400> up<00:03:45.430> my<00:03:45.550> tent<00:03:45.880> and

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that was the first that was like a

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.449 
that was the first that was like a
breaking<00:03:48.790> point<00:03:49.240> for<00:03:49.300> me<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.810> helped<00:03:50.170> me

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
breaking point for me that helped me

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.580 
breaking point for me that helped me
separate<00:03:51.459> myself<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.180> my<00:03:52.270> crew<00:03:52.540> because<00:03:53.470> I

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
camped there and those guys would have

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.680 
camped there and those guys would have

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
and that was a turning point for me in

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.460 
and that was a turning point for me in
the<00:04:13.250> movie<00:04:13.580> once<00:04:14.270> I<00:04:14.420> figured<00:04:14.750> out<00:04:14.840> my<00:04:14.900> tent<00:04:15.380> was

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
the movie once I figured out my tent was

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.340 
the movie once I figured out my tent was
like<00:04:15.770> my<00:04:15.950> little<00:04:16.299> home<00:04:17.299> away<00:04:17.480> from<00:04:17.570> home<00:04:17.780> I

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
like my little home away from home I

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.900 
like my little home away from home I
really<00:04:18.799> could<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.310> crawl<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.700> there<00:04:19.850> and
