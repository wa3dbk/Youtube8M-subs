00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 It continues in the three relegation 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 to the group league the sv burghaun meets 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 in his second game on the sg 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.550
 aulatal trainer uwe hartmann believes 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.770
 the 1 3 against schlÃ¼chtern on firmly 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.180
 the climb and his boys in 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.400
 his team has only one change 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.980
 so real is in the startelf further 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.869
 the fans of brown provide for stadium 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.210
 atmosphere and inspire your team 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.929
 ice really sets in as it did 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 life and death 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.000
 andreas weber play nico garros the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.860
 Allertaler defense interferes with each other 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 Straub misses the lead 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.059
 from aulatal comes to date nothing 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.219
 The attacks are too transparent 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.039
 explains Straub heads with brains 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.949
 Weber aka Blondie moves out 25 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.489
 meters directly from untenable for lepper in 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.129
 box the sg a true dream gate the 1 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.390
 0 weber takes the ball directly and hits 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.390
 you absolutely perfect 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.600
 a little later , captain qi benko had 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.370
 the first chance 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 However, the shot is rather moderate 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.390
 dangerous instead of doing that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.370
 homeowners continue steam the bear strong 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.170
 Weber sits down by laying down 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.729
 straub again just over and also 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.070
 in the next scene stands burghaus 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.440
 Number 14 in the center weber is withdrawing 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.180
 lepper makes the ball bounce insecure 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.180
 Straub fails at close range 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.640
 aulatal as just before the break per 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.650
 free kick dangerous 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 the shot away at first harmless the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 However, Heinrich makes life a living ground 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.140
 a bit difficult reaction of the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.300
 schlussmanns then it's half-time 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.500
 nadal has to lay down after break though 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.840
 this should be something here 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.149
 but it does not change much poker 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.470
 further oppressive superior lepper keeps in 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.830
 free kick by ebert with a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.899
 spectacular parade 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.600
 then in the 62 minute it rang 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.020
 but again for the corner short off 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.259
 straub ebert lepper holds for the time being and gas 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.270
 dust off the deserved and overdue 2 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.890
 0 for the sv red and white buchau eight 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.930
 minutes later, the next attack rolls 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.940
 on the auetaler gates straub stands 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.490
 completely free and makes if something 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 less elegant the third goal for red 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.650
 knows and cares for the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.650
 decision 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.940
 file succeeds hardly any skill 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.740
 cojocaru substitute dietrich 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.750
 But that does not make any sense 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.640
 get through for the guests and that makes 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.720
 well michael ballack so mad that him 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 blow the fuses 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.130
 the repetition shows this nonsense 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.690
 attack again clear ski report 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.860
 should have had a good view 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.780
 to have 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.970
 he consults briefly with his 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.890
 assistant and then just pulled the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.270
 yellow card 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.010
 Nevertheless, the game is for borna then 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.930
 over when trainer plant had the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.850
 action in view and it fall 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.580
 clear words in the direction of a number 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.260
 11 last action of encounter free kick 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.250
 ebert cheeky past the wall 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.110
 but outside net and that 's it with 13 0 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.270
 wins the sv burghaun highly deserved 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.770
 against innocent allerthals and keeps himself 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.400
 so the chance to climb into the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.870
 group league 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.870
 we have the votes for the game 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.950
 outstandingly conscious , but also exactly 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.180
 that we have to show something to her now 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.400
 definitely have to win 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.780
 I think we all tore ourselves 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.010
 Wanted, if it is still good 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.180
 I think that 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.830
 also done with the 30th 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.090
 now we have no other choice 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.630
 as to wait and see what the 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.570
 make others 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.239
 I can tell you that you have turned 31 into that 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.000
 means you're on in any case 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.470
 the one in the triad is now called am 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.120
 Wednesdays in Neuhof the thumb press 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.110
 probably yes in any case so 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.370
 Let's go for a good news 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.020
 have played at the same time today 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.370
 Guys and let's see I think that 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.370
 we will be supporting with a few 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.769
 guys and of course totally somehow too 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.410
 So you also believe that 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.580
 Now throw everything in, yes me 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.410
 the boys still think the chance this year 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.820
 in second place and I suppose 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.769
 that will be on full throttle against 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.940
 Schluechtern and of course there 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.519
 to support his boys 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.430
 you have clamped itself today 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.040
 score a template before a two good one 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.680
 So, chances have shown you everything 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.209
 you have it yes I think it was quite 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.590
 okay not only from me the whole 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.750
 Team that was incredible I have 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.220
 have really fought the cool yet 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.570
 wednesday and so on 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.739
 a performance of really respect 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.030
 the boys that was outstanding 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.040
 if we lose three times is a me 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.510
 great sparow then in the end synonymous for 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.700
 burghaun deserves so we knew how 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.800
 So they play almost exclusively 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.810
 long diagonal balls play on it 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.060
 not set but by the four 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.100
 failures we had 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.600
 we were able to get the air of brown 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.690
 not compensate at all 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.389
 a dream of blondie sarah why 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.280
 The game always makes such a thing 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.280
 Turns out there to shoot 25 meters 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.080
 the angle great gate second bad 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.240
 third defends me the ball error 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.520
 in the game setup 1 0 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.250
 and then of course we have the 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.250
 chances the few but left 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.060
 now you really have to be 3 0 4 0 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.919
 win second or third on tuesday 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.530
 maybe even first 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.060
 2 comes back the rotgesperrten see 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.790
 You still have opportunities 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.350
 of course, but finally becomes 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.210
 you will have all the free tuesday again 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.490
 everything that happened somewhere yesterday 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.139
 seen at lenas against houseleek in 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.150
 to lie down 30 to win the household 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.910
 the thing 43 outnumbered 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.930
 football is always possible 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:34.240
 It's hard to write someone off 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.240
 but that is absolutely possible 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.620
