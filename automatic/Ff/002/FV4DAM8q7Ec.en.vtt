00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 in relation to what this rain made 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.609
 reservoir the worst thing that could 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 happen happened that's what happened 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.969
 rain arriving late by then is 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.670
 as if today the new reservoirs 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.300
 were there at the beginning of January or 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.160
 be it rained february wet the ground 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 rain remains in the reservoir. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 March there began to accumulate well only that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.800
 with you - already famous already starts to stop 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 it's our recovery she we got 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.829
 of them here right at the beginning of November 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.260
 and the end of March amounted to only 12% this 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's very little if we take the average 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.750
 of the last ten years 12 years or 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 from 2000 until now of the last ones to leave 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.190
 14 and 15 years 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.489
 what we have in average reservoirs 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.699
 in the river in April around 80% in years 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.829
 much less nÃ©is reached 90 ninety 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.460
 few percent in years considered 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.859
 very bad around 60% and maybe only 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.210
 can reach 60 per cent that was already 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.200
 at the time considered missing is not 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.520
 practically double what we have 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.950
 today a sound I think is the only one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 reservoir that at the moment does not 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.119
 worries because in fact it had enough 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.250
 rain if we take the northeast 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.430
 last year has made headlines all year 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.009
 drought by the drought looks at the difference 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 people were but practically not since 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.909
 the beginning of the year of half or even less 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.880
 in the northeast it has not been raining 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.090
 enough time regularly on this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.950
 there really is a people watching 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.829
 but we are really the bottom of the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.500
 well the reserve boom the northern region 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.290
 it is also in the same situation in the north 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.049
 also an odd situation 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.820
 It's not time, just if we take the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.770
 red yellow back 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.119
 here it was more or less half here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 less than half 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.140
 we had a good recovery from right 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 February and March it rained again 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.990
 over the entire tocantins basin 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.390
 but there are still 25 points left 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.829
 percentages for us to compare with the year 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.410
 Last time I was not there, this wonder. 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.830
 It's how we stay. 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.230
 expectation now for this 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.040
 everything said we are entering 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 because it is still a very bad situation to 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.050
 The impression I have is very bad is the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.230
 Record record situation 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.940
 only the negative record is both north 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.620
 and the northeast to the southeast should not 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.140
 rise a little bit now during the month 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.720
 April then snow falls indefinitely 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.010
 until the end of the year and up to the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.050
 spring at least 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.390
 in fact I think so the bottom 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.350
 of the well was 13 to 14 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.170
 from 14 to 15 the rain was already higher than 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.820
 15 to 16 or I think it should be bigger 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.230
 in respect of the latter period 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.660
 just finished 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.390
 however that situation will rain 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.120
 but the reservoir is lower 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.220
 even then the combined effect 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.450
 population consumption 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.900
 the rain that fell in a reservoir 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.390
 very likely to be in 2016 in this 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.760
 time of year we'll keep talking 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.690
 here about the country's energy situation 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.520
 that is our possibility of 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.489
 recovery in the next rainy season 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.489
 It's still still very small
