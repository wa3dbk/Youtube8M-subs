00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
a fantastic job I think that was the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.890 
a fantastic job I think that was the
difference<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:52.700> because<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.180> meant<00:02:53.660> me<00:02:53.780> as

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
difference really because it meant me as

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.819 
difference really because it meant me as
a<00:02:53.930> manager<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.319> could<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:54.680> concentrate

a manager I could just concentrate

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.229 
a manager I could just concentrate
really<00:02:55.340> everyone<00:02:55.579> things<00:02:55.819> on<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.090> pitch

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
really everyone things on the pitch

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.360 
really everyone things on the pitch
perhaps<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:57.049> promotion<00:02:57.500> was<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.769> key<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.250> know

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
perhaps a promotion was the key you know

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.879 
perhaps a promotion was the key you know
it<00:02:58.790> will<00:02:58.970> make<00:02:59.120> things<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.630> much<00:02:59.690> easier<00:02:59.889> from

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
it will make things so much easier from

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.199 
it will make things so much easier from
my<00:03:01.069> point<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.310> view<00:03:01.370> being<00:03:02.000> in<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
my point of view being in the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.500 
my point of view being in the
temperature<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.750> would<00:03:03.739> expect<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:05.239> was

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
temperature I would expect that it was
