00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello girls okay good video today 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.750
 to give a hint to you have skin 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.650
 Ozzy is on the lookout for a new 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.540
 michael ii 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.850
 I'll make a review received through the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.480
 natura is specific for this type of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.890
 skin 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.439
 so if you want to see the finish 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.090
 apply sky and know a little more about 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.390
 the product is just continue watching the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.490
 video got my skin clean I play 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 no product on the skin I just spent one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 layer of pregnant woman is the walk during 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.840
 her foot that my mixed skin she does not 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.870
 It's such valuable skin and this beak here. 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.450
 He's fine, he's fine then. 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 only the skin was mixed I recommend the past 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.829
 before a layer of moisturizers and pass 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.719
 then he is over and only he is 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.120
 not have any need because in the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.489
 true bicuÃ­ it also already hydrates the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 skin but as it is very dry in the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.559
 my skin your step without moisturizer 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.410
 Before he gives a craquelada then 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.870
 then the only tip was that the skin was very oily 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.850
 you can pass straight through but it was not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.890
 a layer of moisturizer that will 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.450
 give a better effect I'm going to start 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.530
 do this the application of the skin to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.330
 you will see 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.330
 and I 'll tell her more about you 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.000
 good already the application I played with 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.060
 the brush but also to apply with the hand 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.429
 the effect of similar size is that 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.509
 thing I observe in this birigui is the 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.000
 color question 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.399
 I bought it was light but the light color 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 it was very clear on my skin 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.060
 I even startled the first time I 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.909
 I went because I usually use color 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.860
 clearer base of nozzle in concealer 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.209
 I know it counts more clearly than I 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.819
 I'm pretty white 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.829
 only this baby that he very well clear 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.840
 you can observe 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.860
 color differences from the neck to the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.049
 face 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.569
 it was very clear on my skin then 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.129
 if you open here goal I recommend it was 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.590
 I think it will work better 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.110
 because the thing is clear of it really is 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.090
 Very clear so I do not recommend it 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.859
 even if you 're white I guess 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.260
 that comedy gets better 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.420
 It's only used it so I can not 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.139
 use because it is very clear what I 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.209
 I do is pass the outline pass the blush 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.739
 Since this is his color, that's when I 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.389
 I can not use normally 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.980
 drawing so much attention 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.380
 I already did a video here on the channel. 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.519
 showing how I spend the blush with all 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.139
 illuminated pain 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.660
 if you have questions if you want 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.880
 learn I'll leave the link on the side 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.549
 It's just you click here and that explains 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.639
 right as I pass the technique that the 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.829
 use and in this way I can be displayed 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.680
 to make use of this technique here because 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.599
 since the site he disguises well the color of it 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.230
 It gets more natural from the goal it works 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.890
 better is another question that I see 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.770
 I found a very positive point about him. 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.090
 the average height is a comparative coverage 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.150
 other rights to market a 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.610
 very good cover he disguised well 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.040
 I have quite a few bars here. 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.230
 side of his nose even scout I 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.959
 I think he covered it well, just look at him. 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.790
 on the skin nothing else so he left it 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.340
 It was solving I 'm in my skin I 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.490
 I found a very good coverage concluded 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.690
 and he is also well thought that however 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.510
 I commented that I use moisturizer 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.940
 underneath because it looks good 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.250
 the skin just does not transfer well 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.530
 that you just applied it has to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.530
 also apply the fast it because so 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.200
 that you pass and stay dry on the skin 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.320
 do not transfer anything then who has skin 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.760
 and this is a very positive point. 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.410
 another issue that it has factor of 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.600
 sun protection 30 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.550
 I found a great differential of natura 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.650
 have done so because most of the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.200
 boys market does not have sun protection 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.780
 or those who have is very soft and this one 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.550
 have 30 sun protection so I thought it was fine 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.340
 cool for people here in Brazil now 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.170
 summer I thought it was a good 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.650
 natura has put a sun protection on 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.350
 high up is another matter of it that maybe 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.290
 May it bother some people is the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.050
 smell he smells do not know me 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.940
 Remember the smell of chocolate and I do not 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.650
 Bother but maybe you are too 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.169
 sensitive to the smell this can be a 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.510
 factor that will bother because the smell 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.729
 his is strong you feel good so the 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.040
 smell you are applying is after 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.450
 I applied now, yes, I also felt the 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.090
 smell but so do you 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.130
 The smell gets very strong. 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.710
 so it's a question, I do not even know 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.390
 understands that he may not like to complain 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.000
 smell so I guess it 's 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.650
 important to note this is another 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.470
 question is that it has a 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.630
 I'm very well behaved. 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.330
 use the focus of the bill clinton palace when 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.490
 I base it and with this event and I do not 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.550
 I need to use powder so that it 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.870
 leave the skin well modified 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.550
 they really do know me 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.800
 specific for those who have oily skin 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.940
 it will help a lot who has this type 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.789
 of skin 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.229
 if you have dry skin normal skin I 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.970
 I think it will not work well 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.060
 will probably stay for miles to 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.280
 skin even to my skin the days that she 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.070
 contacted oil is more than the 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.289
 normal and I feel that he does not leave a 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.690
 coverage so cool and gives a craquelada 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.150
 precisely because of it by this matte effect 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.620
 what he has in composition then this 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.690
 It is also a point I would like to 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.729
 say that if you have normal skin 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.820
 dry skin that is not the most suitable to 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.830
 You but I am the skin is very oily and 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.660
 you can not adapt beak in that 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.300
 usually not specific to those who 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.710
 have oily skin and if the vehicle I 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.830
 I think it's a good option. 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.780
 guide and try it is another question is 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.910
 that it has a very good duration in the 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.949
 skin and lasting my skin but four 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.330
 hours without the need to change people 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.910
 go over 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.590
 if you have oily skin I think 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.919
 You will be very pleased to know that 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.650
 in there it is not so oily and so it 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.930
 gets a little dry on the skin will not drink 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.389
 preferred but it really is excellent 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.610
 it's worth mostly you have to 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.110
 skin well oily then it will be the 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.750
 ideal product for you 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.510
 it is neither 30 ml then an amount 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.940
 reasonable it comes with beak so then 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.610
 makes it easy not to waste product 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.030
 it's easy for you to put it spreads on 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:38.150
 skin is his arm I paid 30 and 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.639
 few reals was eighth in the promotion 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.310
 but I think the price of it 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:45.280
 55 reais I'm not sure but I think 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.840
 that 's the price and that's what you have to 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.759
 Oily skin is looking for a good 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.889
 event that your skin and here I 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.779
 I think it's a very interesting option 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.629
 this video will be accompanied by a 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.610
 blog post where I 'll leave photos of the 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:59.590
 green are also reminded game 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.479
