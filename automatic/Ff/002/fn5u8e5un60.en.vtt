to you uh-huh

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.500 
to you uh-huh
you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> thought<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.489> too<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
you know the thought is too is with the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569 
you know the thought is too is with the
lip<00:00:33.690> liner<00:00:33.719> does<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.590> keep<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.980> from<00:00:35.280> bleeding

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
lip liner does it keep it from bleeding

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
lip liner does it keep it from bleeding
or<00:00:36.360> does<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:37.020> create<00:00:37.530> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
or does it really just create that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.850 
or does it really just create that
boundary<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:39.079> think<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.170> actually<00:00:40.290> does<00:00:40.500> both

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
boundary I think it actually does both

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860 
boundary I think it actually does both
it<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.399> make<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.640> lips<00:00:41.820> look<00:00:41.879> larger<00:00:42.149> okay

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it can make your lips look larger okay

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.139 
it can make your lips look larger okay
make<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.140> look<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.500> finished<00:00:44.030> make<00:00:45.030> your

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
make it look more finished make your

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.729 
make it look more finished make your
lips<00:00:45.329> look<00:00:45.480> more<00:00:45.629> dimensional<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:46.590> then

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
lips look more dimensional because then

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.110 
lips look more dimensional because then
you<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.190> darker<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> edge<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you have a little darker on the edge and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
you have a little darker on the edge and
a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.390> lighter<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> lip<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:50.010> do

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
a little lighter in the lip and I do

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709 
a little lighter in the lip and I do
think<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> also<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.180> you're<00:00:51.329> putting<00:00:51.510> other

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
think it also if you're putting other

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
think it also if you're putting other
things<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.170> top<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.649> tend<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> move<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> little

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
things on top that tend to move a little

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.220 
things on top that tend to move a little
bit<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.270> emollient<00:00:54.840> lip<00:00:54.989> color

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
bit more like a very emollient lip color

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.709 
bit more like a very emollient lip color
or<00:00:55.440> gloss<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.100> think<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.820> keep<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.480> place

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
or gloss I think it can keep it in place

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
or gloss I think it can keep it in place
longer<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.949> tend<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> choose<00:00:59.609> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
longer do you tend to choose that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.220 
longer do you tend to choose that
natural<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.629> close<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> your<00:01:00.989> lip

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
natural because it's close to your lip

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
natural because it's close to your lip
color<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.010> goes<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> most

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
color or because it goes with the most

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.920 
color or because it goes with the most
of<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.090> lipsticks<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.229> okay<00:01:05.540> yeah<00:01:06.540> because

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
of your lipsticks but okay yeah because

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.450 
of your lipsticks but okay yeah because
you<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.380> need<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.830> need<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.010> call<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.310> it's

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you really need you need to call it it's

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.190 
you really need you need to call it it's
just<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:08.909> darker<00:01:09.420> than<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:10.170> natural

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
just a little darker than your natural

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
just a little darker than your natural
and<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.369> has<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.170> soft<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.850> got<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and it has to go on soft it's got a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
and it has to go on soft it's got a
creamy<00:01:15.479> texture<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.500> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
creamy texture you can see this just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
creamy texture you can see this just
gliding<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.310> yeah<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.750> I've

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
gliding on yeah so and that's what I've

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
gliding on yeah so and that's what I've
used<00:01:19.020> from<00:01:19.140> bareMinerals<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.740> forever<00:01:19.979> okay

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
used from bareMinerals for forever okay

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.149 
used from bareMinerals for forever okay
so<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.450> lip<00:01:21.630> stain<00:01:21.890> but<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so now I have a lip stain but I have a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
so now I have a lip stain but I have a
much<00:01:23.400> more<00:01:23.610> polished<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.380> think

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
much more polished look so I think

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
much more polished look so I think
sometimes<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.520> only<00:01:26.880> using<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> lip

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
sometimes we think of only using a lip

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
sometimes we think of only using a lip
stain<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.750> its<00:01:27.900> own<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.979> finish<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
stain on its own but you can finish it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.620 
stain on its own but you can finish it
with<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> lip<00:01:29.759> liner<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.299> anything

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
with the lip liner just like anything

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
with the lip liner just like anything
else<00:01:30.840> it'll<00:01:31.470> last<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.799> day<00:01:31.950> long<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
else it'll last all day long it will and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450 
else it'll last all day long it will and
now<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.689> I'm<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.290> eating<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.340> drinking
