that<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.150> as<00:01:43.480> an<00:01:43.630> installer<00:01:43.990> have<00:01:44.320> built<00:01:44.590> and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
that you as an installer have built and

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.020 
that you as an installer have built and
constructed<00:01:45.150> so<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.390> offers<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.750> wide<00:01:46.870> variety

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
constructed so it offers a wide variety

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.450 
constructed so it offers a wide variety
and<00:01:49.030> also<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.510> high-tech<00:01:50.260> look<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:51.220> your

and also a high-tech look to your

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.660 
and also a high-tech look to your
installs<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.540> gives<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.590> full<00:01:54.190> range

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
installs it gives you the the full range

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.020 
installs it gives you the the full range
or<00:01:55.180> ability<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.650> make<00:01:56.950> panels<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.970> don't

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
or ability to make panels that don't

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.880 
or ability to make panels that don't
necessarily<00:01:58.390> need<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.260> be<00:01:59.350> covered<00:01:59.740> with

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
necessarily need to be covered with

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.130 
necessarily need to be covered with
vinyl<00:02:00.190> or<00:02:00.640> suede<00:02:01.150> or<00:02:01.600> anything<00:02:01.870> like<00:02:02.080> that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
vinyl or suede or anything like that

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.780 
vinyl or suede or anything like that
sometimes<00:02:02.740> they<00:02:02.920> can't<00:02:03.130> even<00:02:03.250> be<00:02:03.400> covered

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
sometimes they can't even be covered

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.150 
sometimes they can't even be covered
with<00:02:03.940> those<00:02:04.090> types<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.510> materials<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.710> we're

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
with those types of materials so we're

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.560 
with those types of materials so we're
going<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.340> be<00:02:06.430> talking<00:02:06.640> about<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.180> material

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
going to be talking about a material

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.259 
going to be talking about a material
that<00:02:08.080> will<00:02:08.349> cover<00:02:08.590> all<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.160> those<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.610> make<00:02:10.149> it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
that will cover all of those and make it

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.440 
that will cover all of those and make it
look<00:02:10.420> extremely<00:02:11.170> high-tech<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.819> in<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.150> next

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
look extremely high-tech so in this next

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.360 
look extremely high-tech so in this next
chapter<00:02:13.659> we're<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.470> be<00:02:14.590> discussing<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
chapter we're going to be discussing and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.550

starting out with the different types of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.610 
starting out with the different types of
paints<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.220> when<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.360> use<00:02:19.540> them<00:02:19.750> when<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:20.409> to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
paints and when to use them when not to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
use them so I'm gonna get the materials

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.750 
use them so I'm gonna get the materials
all<00:02:22.599> set<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.519> show<00:02:24.700> you
