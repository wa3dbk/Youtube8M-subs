00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
this is the Mac 231 and this is lip mix

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.920 
this is the Mac 231 and this is lip mix
in<00:05:12.260> Burgundy<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.130> lip<00:05:13.550> mix<00:05:13.760> in<00:05:13.970> black<00:05:14.270> now<00:05:14.870> the

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
in Burgundy and lip mix in black now the

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.680 
in Burgundy and lip mix in black now the
burgundy<00:05:15.530> one<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:15.950> absolutely<00:05:16.790> amazing<00:05:17.120> but

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
burgundy one is absolutely amazing but

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.680 
burgundy one is absolutely amazing but
it<00:05:17.900> isn't<00:05:18.500> quite<00:05:18.740> as<00:05:19.100> opaque<00:05:19.580> as<00:05:19.640> it<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.300> in<00:05:20.540> the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
it isn't quite as opaque as it is in the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.860 
it isn't quite as opaque as it is in the
pot<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.740> this<00:05:22.550> comes<00:05:22.880> out<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.330> little<00:05:23.600> bit

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
pot so this comes out a little bit

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.200 
pot so this comes out a little bit
lighter<00:05:24.290> than<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.890> is<00:05:25.040> right<00:05:25.250> here<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:25.730> to<00:05:25.940> make

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
lighter than it is right here so to make

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.460 
lighter than it is right here so to make
a<00:05:26.240> darker<00:05:26.660> I'm<00:05:26.810> going<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.020> take<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.290> black

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
a darker I'm going to take the black

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.290 
a darker I'm going to take the black
which<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:27.830> really<00:05:28.370> opaque<00:05:28.730> so<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.000> only<00:05:29.210> need

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
which is really opaque so you only need

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.810 
which is really opaque so you only need
a<00:05:29.480> little<00:05:29.540> bit<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:30.080> that<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:31.040> I'm<00:05:31.490> just<00:05:31.700> going
