 steampunk a project from the great team 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.699
 You see a small but beautiful one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 city ​​which is operated only with steam 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.020
 theoretically at least on a small scale 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.420
 mountain romp close to each other proudly 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 To reach 30 dwellings is the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 city ​​over a mighty bridge as well 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.640
 interesting the huge water wheel 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 in the middle of the city 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.149
 the attacking octopus and the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.600
 Hot air balloons crossing the city 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.770
 pull 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.770
 simply fantastic 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.080
 place four is occupied by the titanic 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.610
 by dead koalas at this 1 1 checkered 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.129
 luxury steamer is a 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.290
 same image of the 1912 sunken rms titanic 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 The sinking of the ship at that time is 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.660
 legendary 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.380
 also one of the most watched 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.950
 Hollywood movies is based on this 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 history 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.260
 Overall, the titanic is 270 meters long 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.820
 3 50 meters high 28 meters wide and was 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.740
 at that time the biggest ever 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 built cruiser the builder of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.040
 minecraft has version of this monster 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 every detail was taken care of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.250
 the four chimneys of the steamers is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 available every cabin is single 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.890
 furnished and also so on each 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.060
 the smallest detail respected 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.649
 In addition, the ship is at one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.610
 shipping company and is not on the high seas 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.930
 Interior also exists so many 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.979
 winding paths since I am right away 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.910
 whose course took 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.259
 Only now did I really have one 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.940
 I know how terrible it was 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.289
 has to save itself and this 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.399
 gears to hear as the ship before good 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.690
 100 years changed 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.860
 Overall, one can say that this 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.300
 version of the titanic really 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500
 impressive is it will be a right 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.180
 gives a clear impression like the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.180
 sea ​​colossus at the time looked well 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.110
 Place three occupies the futures city or 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.970
 also area 73 5 the sfb architect him 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.130
 built city is like the name already 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.410
 betrays settled in the distant future 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.270
 according to developers, construction of the map 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.800
 Cashier took two years taking her 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.170
 but only very rarely built 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.820
 her appear to be as good as the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 Secret pixel her account at planet 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.630
 Minecraft has subscribed to the city 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.250
 consists of five areas the big one 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.020
 The island in the middle serves as the main island 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.580
 and ties in with four other areas 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.830
 These are found in each case 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.450
 heavenly direction during the main island 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.190
 mostly residential building includes 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.080
 In addition to islands, each of them has a theme 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.670
 Reinhard island, for example, is here 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.400
 huge stadium of which a big one 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.720
 cyborg reduces next to another 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.290
 apartment island there is still a room 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.760
 port 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.320
 that is more in sweden that 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.450
 building looks like a real island 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.460
 for fat really out unfortunately this is 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.200
 not quite finished all in all 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.000
 we have a state of the art beautiful 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.960
 city ​​of the future in which I personally 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.960
 would like to live 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.090
 but our second place is the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.439
 White city ​​minas tirith from the roman 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.000
 trilogy lord of the rings 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.680
 she is probably the most important city of the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.030
 kingdom who the really good and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.290
 seen many times winning film 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.700
 The fortress is considered a very 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.140
 impressive building in remembrance 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.060
 have at least as impressive 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.769
 is the acquisition implemented in minecraft 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.239
 Of course, epic rest are 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.680
 also for fans of the film series and trade 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.239
 instead of immediately recognized here too 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.920
 but again on detail loyal hand the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.180
 film template respected the fortress exists 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.859
 out of seven they are wrestling with the huge one 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.090
 fans be deeply in the middle 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.799
 perched on top of the top 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.359
 domination seat of condor apart from 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.739
 massive walls will continue for the 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.329
 Safety of the city catered for huge 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.069
 Towers provide space for bowmen and 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.750
 other fellows are as well 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.189
 gigantic catapult attached the the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.659
 defense continue to strengthen especially 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.250
 the third film of triology has 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.810
 showed what a huge number 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.280
 soldiers are needed around such a fortress 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.989
 presumably minas tirith is 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.760
 one of the most magnificent and safest 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.169
 cities of the entire fantasy world and 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.769
 that's exactly what this map deserves 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.769
 second place 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.620
 the imperial city project has already started 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.180
 almost 500,000 downloads in total 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.780
 have nine minecraft on this project 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.849
 worked 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.409
 The city includes all known styles 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.680
 of the 19th century and the modern age 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.209
 although probably the classic style prevails 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.290
 all existing buildings are from the 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.420
 real world and were only light 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.100
 changing is particularly impressive 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.449
 the size of the city itself after 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.560
 For hours you have exploration 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.389
 not seen everything for a long time 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.800
 this is largely due to the fact that 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.370
 even in dubai with the houses designed 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.720
 has been 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.280
 for faster movement 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.680
 within the city have the builders 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.060
 a metro network relocated 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.830
 when looking closer at the city let 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.479
 to find some interesting things 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.479
 a huge triumphal arch 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.240
 industrial district with smoking chimneys 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.380
 a massive defense system 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:54.980
 taken in a mountain range 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:58.660
 Lighthouse with a huge ships 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.660
 residential complex and much much more 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.410
 the combination of beautiful 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.570
 impressive structures bundled in 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.070
 a huge city make the imperial 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.070
 city ​​to our place one
