00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
um there's a proper way to coil lines on

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.019 
um there's a proper way to coil lines on
a<00:00:03.810> boat<00:00:04.110> most<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.040> lines<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> boat<00:00:05.759> are

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
a boat most of the lines on the boat are

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.749 
a boat most of the lines on the boat are
braided<00:00:06.509> lines<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.740> there<00:00:10.250> you<00:00:11.250> want<00:00:11.519> you

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
braided lines and there you want you

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.820 
braided lines and there you want you
want<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.059> coil<00:00:12.269> them<00:00:12.480> up<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.719> specific<00:00:12.929> way

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
want to coil them up in a specific way

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.140 
want to coil them up in a specific way
not<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:15.800> cowboy<00:00:16.800> would<00:00:17.340> by<00:00:17.640> putting<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
not like a cowboy would by putting a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.260 
not like a cowboy would by putting a
twist<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.619> forming<00:00:20.189> loops<00:00:20.460> because<00:00:21.119> if

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
twist in it and forming loops because if

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.490 
twist in it and forming loops because if
you<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:22.789> what<00:00:23.789> will<00:00:23.970> happen<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.660> see<00:00:25.350> how

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you do that what will happen is see how

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.849 
you do that what will happen is see how
I'm<00:00:25.680> twisting<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.000> UM<00:00:27.180> proper<00:00:27.660> way

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
I'm twisting it now the UM proper way

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.460 
I'm twisting it now the UM proper way
don't<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.400> way<00:00:29.900> when<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> take<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
don't do it this way when you take it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.240 
don't do it this way when you take it
apart<00:00:31.850> you<00:00:32.850> end<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:33.989> call

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
apart you end up with what they call

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.940 
apart you end up with what they call
knuckles<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> line<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:37.230> course<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.770> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
knuckles in the line of course this is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.060 
knuckles in the line of course this is
good<00:00:38.129> getting<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.350> end<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.620> knuckles

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
good getting the end up of knuckles

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.000 
good getting the end up of knuckles
which<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.489> these<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.640> things<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
which are these little things like this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.770 
which are these little things like this
and<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.670> caught<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> blocks

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and they get caught up in the blocks

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.810 
and they get caught up in the blocks
you're<00:00:46.770> trying<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> let<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
you're trying to let them out so on a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.790 
you're trying to let them out so on a
braided<00:00:50.820> line<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> coil<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
braided line when you coil it up you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.700 
braided line when you coil it up you
actually<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.789> pull<00:00:54.559> bring<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
actually want to just pull bring the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.849 
actually want to just pull bring the
line<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.520> let<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> lay<00:00:57.379> naturally<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
line in and let it lay naturally and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.000 
line in and let it lay naturally and
what<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> will<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.879> form<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.620> figure<00:01:01.620> eight

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.000 

naturally<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.049> lay<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.740> same

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
naturally and you lay it the same

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.929 
naturally and you lay it the same
direction<00:01:08.310> each<00:01:08.760> time<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.890> forms<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> figure

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
direction each time it forms in a figure

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.290 
direction each time it forms in a figure
eight<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.650> when<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
eight and then when you

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.530 
eight and then when you
drop<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.510> line<00:01:16.750> down<00:01:17.020> onto<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.620> deck<00:01:18.540> you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
drop the line down onto the deck you

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.460 
drop the line down onto the deck you
won't<00:01:19.840> get<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.290> knuckles

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.210 

they<00:01:26.980> won't<00:01:27.190> get<00:01:27.460> locked<00:01:27.730> up<00:01:27.940> in<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.240> blocks

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
they won't get locked up in the blocks

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.450 
they won't get locked up in the blocks
once<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:30.940> get<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.420> end<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.720> this<00:01:31.870> line<00:01:32.460> if

so<00:02:10.670> that's<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.150> way<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.330> properly<00:02:12.640> put<00:02:13.640> that's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
so that's the way to properly put that's

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.380 
so that's the way to properly put that's
one<00:02:14.690> way<00:02:15.130> properly<00:02:16.130> coiling<00:02:16.640> up<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.970> graded

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
one way properly coiling up the graded

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.600 
one way properly coiling up the graded
line
