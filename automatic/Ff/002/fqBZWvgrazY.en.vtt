00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hello, consider connections 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.610
 380 volt motor to mains 220 to normal 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:17.130
 home network means I have an engine 2 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 800 rpm 2 kW power means 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.350
 network connects buttons at the entrance 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.160
 regular button 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.480
 the cheapest mechanical inlet 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.780
 mean to side terminals casts rights 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.020
 in the starting Conder 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 then I have 2 450 volts 330 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 microphone 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.680
 it is quite enough for such a pen 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.920
 engine working conder i have 300 15 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.370
 volt 30 microfarad it is also quite 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.289
 enough for the operation of such an engine 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.480
 very starting Conder connect on 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.840
 entering the button to the right and middle 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840
 Besides 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.970
 Conder worker connects well as 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.479
 launcher to right and to middle cream like 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.479
 seen on video 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.340
 connecting the button motor itself here 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 We look at all the colors mean 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.500
 yellow blue brown right to left and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.659
 there is also yellow-blue brown on the right 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.610
 left 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.850
 means to change the rotation of the engine 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.280
 the drow side is enough to change 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.820
 yellow and blue in places I just wear means 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.700
 and still need to rearrange the jumpers 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 who previously stood on the engine 380 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:54.860
 so we need to deliver that is to us 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.860
 closing the winding start 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.310
 this engine works without vibration 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.909
 order they are 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.909
 dad is near 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.390
