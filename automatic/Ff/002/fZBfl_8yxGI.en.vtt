 there was a special report from the correspondent flávio fachel 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.869
 seems like an American public school like any other 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.109
 but in the first interval 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.310
 just have a look at the students 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.949
 there are no textbooks in your hands 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.560
 cutters 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.640
 this is one of 20 schools in New York that have given up traditional books 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.869
 using technology to teach 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.300
 you have only two notebooks with one 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.540
 backpack and a coat 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.840
 the project was developed by education specialists 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.070
 is to help increase the number of students who prove the city 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.550
 the content was in the books 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.660
 other teachers' web pages 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 all actors are connected to the right beam 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.449
 in biology class eg luís filipe organisms 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.070
 lead to the discovery of scientists 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.340
 try to develop a vaccine that could fight against HIV 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 but it is distraction one year after a trains pass 70 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.960
 squid confesses 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.790
 she gets distracted once in a while but if they were solid she says it would be too 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.469
 boring 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.770
 with computers 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.620
 the study is much more interesting 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.010
 another advantage 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.180
 yet is online and sometimes to classes not intending people 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.560
 for example the science teacher has become ill can not come to the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.620
 school but that 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.530
 does not mean that you did not or did not just take a look at the event 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.920
 Is everyone studying? 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 debate of ideas haiti already had a try that the botequim spnet 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.840
 the director of face-to-face teaching to carefully teach students now look for the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.490
 information on the internet rather than being limited to the book. 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.330
 students can all the time work session 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.680
 says scientist shiloh maddox for example books here says her reading sounds 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.099
 by the way 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.049
 is compulsory one hour a day at school and several others at home 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.459
 and the main book adopted in this semester is not full of spike 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.050

 dominique finds the new school better without textbooks 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.249
 dividing his time into the computer and video game if the studies he felt 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.639
 exactly what American specialists in education expect 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:36.660
 confident 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.819
 I feel really ready for the future he says 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.189
 the feeling that repeats the school that wants to use the virtual world 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.479
 for shipment of these young beneficiaries
