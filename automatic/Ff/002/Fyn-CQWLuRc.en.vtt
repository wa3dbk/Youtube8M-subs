it<00:01:03.989> yeah<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> my<00:01:05.880> character<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:07.920> believe

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it yeah so my character is I believe

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
it yeah so my character is I believe
like<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.630> base<00:01:10.290> normal<00:01:10.860> characters<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
like the base normal characters not a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.779 
like the base normal characters not a
light<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.359> not<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.929> heavy<00:01:13.369> but<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.759> a

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
light it's not a heavy but it's like a

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.980 
light it's not a heavy but it's like a
in<00:01:15.240> between<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> lighting<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.700> next

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
in between the lighting of the next

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.349 
in between the lighting of the next
level<00:01:18.990> character<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.490> speed<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
level character so my speed is kind of

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.539 
level character so my speed is kind of
normal<00:01:21.869> moving<00:01:22.500> around<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> map<00:01:22.770> relatively

sniper and then your screen freezes and

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.930 
sniper and then your screen freezes and
the<00:03:23.140> characters<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:24.070> enemy<00:03:24.400> character<00:03:24.850> is

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
the characters the enemy character is

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.110 
the characters the enemy character is
moved<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.630> can't<00:03:25.840> get<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> snapshot

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120

I did not just do a whole bunch of

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.320 
I did not just do a whole bunch of
damage<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.290> him<00:04:56.410> so<00:04:57.160> there's<00:04:57.370> like<00:04:57.610> some<00:04:57.850> very

officially but eurogamer.net actually

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.440 
officially but eurogamer.net actually
had<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.150> up<00:05:31.330> on<00:05:31.540> like<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.220> 13th<00:05:33.220> or<00:05:33.430> 12th<00:05:33.820> so<00:05:34.420> a

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
had it up on like the 13th or 12th so a

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.060 
had it up on like the 13th or 12th so a
lot<00:05:34.660> a<00:05:34.780> lot<00:05:34.840> of<00:05:35.050> people<00:05:35.290> downloaded<00:05:35.830> it<00:05:35.950> and

lot a lot of people downloaded it and

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.330 
lot a lot of people downloaded it and
then<00:05:36.430> when<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.300> game<00:05:37.510> actually<00:05:38.190> released<00:05:39.190> to

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
then when the game actually released to

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.080 
then when the game actually released to
the<00:05:39.430> public<00:05:39.610> so<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.330> speak<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:42.700> would<00:05:42.850> run

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
the public so to speak you would run

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.520 
the public so to speak you would run
into<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.390> room<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:43.840> then<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.110> will<00:05:44.200> say<00:05:44.350> there

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
into a room and then it will say there

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.810 
into a room and then it will say there
was<00:05:44.620> two<00:05:44.800> different<00:05:44.920> versions<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.670> the<00:05:45.790> game

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
was two different versions of the game

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.990 
was two different versions of the game
so<00:05:46.300> I<00:05:47.080> actually<00:05:47.470> had<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:47.890> early<00:05:48.280> but<00:05:48.760> then<00:05:48.910> I

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
so I actually had it early but then I

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.270 
so I actually had it early but then I
deleted<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.170> redownloaded<00:05:50.980> it<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.250> I

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
deleted it and redownloaded it and I

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.890 
deleted it and redownloaded it and I
still<00:05:51.520> have<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.700> framerate<00:05:51.970> issue<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:52.660> the

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
still have the framerate issue and the

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.660 
still have the framerate issue and the
matchmaking<00:05:53.290> issue<00:05:53.560> so<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:54.310> know<00:05:54.550> I<00:05:54.580> don't

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
matchmaking issue so you know I don't

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.640 
matchmaking issue so you know I don't
know<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:54.940> don't<00:05:55.270> know<00:05:55.420> if<00:05:55.570> it's<00:05:55.690> just<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:56.380> that

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
know I don't know if it's just that that

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.040 
know I don't know if it's just that that
could<00:05:56.860> be<00:05:56.980> a<00:05:57.580> contribution<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:58.480> it<00:05:58.780> but

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
could be a contribution to it but

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.500 
could be a contribution to it but
needless<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.220> say<00:06:00.400> there's<00:06:00.700> some<00:06:00.940> kinks<00:06:01.480> that

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
needless to say there's some kinks that

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.240 
needless to say there's some kinks that
need<00:06:01.690> to<00:06:01.930> be<00:06:01.990> worked<00:06:02.140> out<00:06:02.350> other<00:06:02.680> than<00:06:02.890> that<00:06:03.010> I

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
need to be worked out other than that I

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.210 
need to be worked out other than that I
mean<00:06:03.280> even<00:06:04.240> with<00:06:04.630> all<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:04.930> those<00:06:05.200> those<00:06:05.740> issues

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
mean even with all of those those issues
