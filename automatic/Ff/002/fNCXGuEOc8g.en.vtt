 hi friends from youtube today I come with a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.980
 debate that is dragon ball z against 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.450
 naruto shippuden good I'll explain what 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.429
 principal 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 good dragon ball is a legendary anime 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.120

 movies like dragon ball evolution that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.029

 question of taste naruto is tremendous 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 anime and manga but I think dragon ball 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.869
 has done more for the industry than Naruto 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.429
