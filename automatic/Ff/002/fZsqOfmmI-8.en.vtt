and drives against HD Woodson well I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.310 
and drives against HD Woodson well I
think<00:01:33.909> we<00:01:34.119> need<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.329> score<00:01:34.540> about<00:01:34.810> three<00:01:35.049> times

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
think we need to score about three times

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.499 
think we need to score about three times
if<00:01:35.590> our<00:01:35.979> office<00:01:36.310> we<00:01:36.430> could<00:01:36.850> score<00:01:37.000> three<00:01:37.240> times

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
if our office we could score three times

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.440 
if our office we could score three times
then<00:01:38.259> we'll<00:01:38.770> probably<00:01:39.009> win<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.399> game<00:01:39.579> I<00:01:39.790> don't

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450
