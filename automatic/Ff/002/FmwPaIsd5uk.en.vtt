00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.819
 five icons in the dock 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.819

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.670
 in three minutes they already have the works 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.500
 this is important so that the packages that we are going to download to disappear 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.070
 continuation 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
