00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 We are now with Veronica Gonzalez 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.850
 we are going to occupy of the summer of the desire 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.500
 to go to the beach that have all the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.940
 people but how do you go to the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 beach and have a good time a person who 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.960
 he has a disability and it gets complicated 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.089
 How will the Augustinian see how she is doing? 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
 well for people who use chair 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.760
 of wheels for example until recently 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.289
 it was impossible to go to the beach because 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 basically they could not get to the arena 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.330
 and not to mention going into the water then 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.390
 the sea organization for all is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.570
 working together with the municipality to 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
 guarantee access to the beach and that 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.010
 can get into the water through some 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.780
 amphibious chairs that can be moved in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.430
 the sand and can also be put in the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.010
 Mar you think we share the note if 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.800
 we see it 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.989
 Solidarity is present and 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.260
 causes smiles on the beaches of the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.329
 happy sea for all is an initiative 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.969
 absolutely free that includes 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.129
 15 lifeguards specialized in 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.649
 use of the so-called chairs 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.020
 amphibians and in assistance to 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.240
 People with disabilities 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.239
 these are given for free 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.770
 ask the lifeguards we 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.150
 We indicate the relatives who already use it 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.150
 he handles it to relatives and 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.310
 we bathe them today we are 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.690
 doing tests at 200 meters inside the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.720
 we can enter the 200 meters 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.760
 we get off the chair we make them swim 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.920
 well we have made a big step in the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.210
 accessibility issue and how do I say the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.000
 chair is only a link 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.500
 we are only some 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.990
 link that we collaborate with the subject of 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.900
 Accessibility at the popular beach 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.300
 between umbrellas chairs and hundreds of 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.640
 tourists installed a social sector 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.580
 for disabled seven chairs 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.619
 amphibians that have a seat under three 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.930
 rubber wheels a handlebar that 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.509
 makes possible the transfer by the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.040
 experts bathers the best prize that 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.720
 we receive in the people who have within the 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.149
 water does not cry and he always tells us 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.310
 I wonder what they feel and they tell you all 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.780
 they say the same in freedom we 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.430
 systems we lower them from the chair 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.610
 we give life and nothing next to us 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.070
 are cared for by lifeguards 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.410
 and we have achieved a very good step 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 important in this subject who are 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.399
 committed to accessibility 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.230
 insist on the importance of adapting 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.750
 the squares and other public places 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.560
 from the bathrooms to the signage 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.480
 adequate 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.920
 we have also been working hard 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.930
 because this has to be said with the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.510
 institutions that work with people 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.430
 with disabilities in the city we come 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.410
 working in coordination 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.230
 jointly because that's how the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.150
 state can ultimately multiply 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.390
 exponentially with all the actors 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.540
 who are working on the policies of 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.220
 inclusion now also with the support of 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.200
 the municipality of general pueyrredon 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.390
 They have amphibious chairs in the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.030
 beaches bristol out streams and the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.100
 Parador Blanco and with a public descent 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.560
 accessible in tip mogotes between 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.970
 spas 8 and 9 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.420
 sir here is the experience in the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.420
 amphibious chair 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.860
 me 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.730
 it helps a lot 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.810
 [Music] 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.690
 organization is the NGO 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.730
 is insurmountable because it has allowed us to 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.950
 all the people that we have mobility 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.770
 reduced power to enter the sea 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.080
 with the lifeguard entry until the 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.090
 tip of the breakwater I really like the 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.690
 water and with this possibility I have 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.040
 recovered in this way from power 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.910
 enjoy again the water 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.680
 terrific nothing better than someone 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.090
 account in the first person but where 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.280
 you can find this in addition in this 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.050
 beach that is the popular beach one there 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 three accessible beaches that have a descent 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.460
 up to the water and amphibious chairs and 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.230
 lifeguards that are specialized and 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.240
 they work between 11 and 17 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.970
 we have the public beach north of 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.310
 point mogotes while spas 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.800
 white sands and 24 in the spa of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.800
 the mermaid that is on the point quarries 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.690
 and in the white spa that is in the 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
 cliff area there are also 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.520
 other spas that have ramp for 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.700
 access to water in monk's tower in 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.550
 VARESE and large sea beach watching 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.590
 exact silver- increasingly it seeks to have 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.850
 in all neighborhoods but good is 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.740
 working on that and also on the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.600
 signage because for people 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.090
 blind is very difficult to reach from the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.770
 sand to the sea and be able to go straight and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.420
 back to the place where it was good that 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.560
 I was just counting the number you had 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.760
 an experience that you went with your 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.800
 goods that are young and that was 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.810
 difficult to guide let's say how are we going to 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.070
 see where the sea is like to return exactly 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.990
 so good is also working 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.520
 in that because good the idea is that one 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.289
 can make it more autonomous as possible 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.150
 and from the beach with the family as 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.220
 any other person here we have a 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.620
 great example of practically autonomous 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.240
 is absolute verónica gonzález working 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.729
 doing mommy of twins 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.800
 including thanks but thanks to you 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.800
 see you in the next week there is
