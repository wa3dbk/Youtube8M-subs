00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.210
 hello how about this time we'll talk 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.430
 of the muscles infra and underlined videos 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.860
 these muscles participate in the control 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.040
 of the position of the larynx also 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.900
 descend to the jaw tense the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.900
 floor of the mouth and offer a base 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.660
 stable to the muscles of the tongue and the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.180
 pharynx 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.300
 we will start with the muscles of the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.970
 region superior to the hyoid bone in this 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.700
 case we first found the muscle of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.820
 gastric 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.940
 and here we can appreciate it in a view 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.850
 lower this in order to study 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.020
 the two wombs that make up a 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.030
 posterior belly and a previous belly 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.890
 let's start with the posterior belly that 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:13.310
 is going to originate on the inner side of 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 the ramona dy and gastric and will end 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.770
 in the intermediate tendon 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 this muscle or else this belly is going to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.460
 find enervated by the cranial pair 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.090
 number 7 but also by 9 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.340
 and is responsible for raising the joides and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.799
 tilt to the head and now 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.560
 your previous belly that is this that 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.369
 we can appreciate in violet color 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.069
 starts from the middle tendon and 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.979
 is going to be inserted into the gastric fossa 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.340
 which is located on the inside of the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.219
 body of the jaw 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.479
 this belly is going to find and snowed 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:00.270
 by the trigeminal nerve and the function of 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.810
 which is responsible is the decline of the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.810
 jaw or elevate the hyoid bone 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.560
 in this view we can also observe 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.410
 a muscle that is supla 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 lying to what is the belly of the di 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.790
 gastric what is this that we can 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.910
 observe here in blue and that you 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.580
 you know like muscle genius video that's going to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.610
 be part of what will be the floor 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.870
 from the mouth this muscle is going to originate 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.170
 in the midline of the line I thought me 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.599
 of the medial surface 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.230
 of the body of the jaw in his face 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.170
 internal and is going to be inserted into the bone 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.390
 hyoid is also going to join with the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.210
 genius and opposite muscle 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.750
 and will be found and enervated by the 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.950
 I thought it was going to come from the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.780
 mandibular nerve your function will be 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:08.180
 support and elevate the floor of the mouth and 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.180
 also to elevate the hyoid bone 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.150
 the next muscle is the video style 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.239
 that will be extended from the process 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.390
 estiloides to the anterior face of the bone 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.459
 hyoid this muscle is found 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.470
 enervated by the facial nerve as well 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.349
 that the posterior belly of the gastric 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.840
 that we had reviewed a moment ago 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:35.870
 and is responsible for bone elevation 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.870
 hyoid in a poster or higher direction 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.570
 in this side view we are also going to 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.940
 find the muscle 1008 video that 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.030
 it has its origin in the chin spine and in 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.780
 the bottom on the inner surface 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.820
 of the jaw and is going to head towards 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.120
 the body of the hyoid where it goes to 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.740
 have your insertion this muscle is 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.290
 finds itself enervated by the nerve 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.460
 hypoglossal and the function of which 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.300
 charge then descend to the jaw or 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.390
 well raise the hyoid bone ready now 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.360
 let's review the muscles influenced 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.420
 videos the first of them is going to be the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.030
 external clÃ©ider what is this that we can 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.730
 see here in yellow and that is going to 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.410
 originate from the back face of the 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.820
 clavicular external union 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.340
 is going to be directed upwards 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.220
 until inserted into the body of the bone 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.340
 hyoid this insertion is going to be 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.440
 adjacent to what is the insertion of the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.800
 muscle as I video that later 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.440
 let's check 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.740
 This muscle is elevated by 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.190
 the previous branches of c-1 three ago 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 by means of the cervical loop and function 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.440
 who is in charge consists of 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.200
 descend to the hyoid bone during 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.140
 swallowing phase 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.050
 very close to this muscle we are going to 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.050
 find the muscle as I video that 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.910
 is this that we see here in violet color 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.870
 that is going to be divided into a belly 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.870
 lower and another upper belly the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.840
 lower belly starts on the edge 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.510
 upper part of the scapula and goes towards 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.940
 forward and upward crossing the 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.870
 posterior triangle and ending in the 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.840
 tendon or intermediate 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.750
 this is where the belly originates 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.480
 superior that goes in direction 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.660
 ascending until inserted into the body 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.570
 of the hyoid bone 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.200
 this muscle is innovated by the branches 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:48.290
 previous of c-1 ago three times 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.370
 of the cervical passage and its action consists 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:54.920
 in descending to the hyoid bone 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.680
 the next muscle is the external 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.140
 thyroid which is this we can 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.780
 appreciate in green and that you 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.450
 extends from the back face of 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.660
 handlebar externally and partially from 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:12.920
 first costal cartilage and is directed in 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.700
 upward direction until inserted in 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.310
 the outer face of the thyroid cartilage 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.280
 This muscle is working as well 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.580
 that the video by the previous branches of 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.820
 c-1 makes three by means of the cervical loop 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.610
 and its function is to descend to 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.960
 hyoid bone and also going to pull the 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.960
 larynx down 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:42.480
 the last muscle is the thyroid that is 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.690
 originates in the steroid tubers and 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.830
 is going to be inserted into the larger shaft and 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.290
 body of the hyoid bone 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.380
 the innervation of this muscle will be 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.670
 given by the thyroid nerve from 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.040
 of the hypoglossus 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.160
 the function that is going to have is going to be 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.100
 descend to the hyoid bone but when 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.100
 This hyoid be fixed on 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.240
 thyroid muscle will cause the 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.500
 Elevation of the larynx 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.330
 and that would be all this time 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.599
 I hope and have a lot of success and see you 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.599
 soon
