00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
assembly here on how it goes together

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.250 
assembly here on how it goes together
and<00:02:01.980> you<00:02:02.980> may<00:02:03.100> want<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.460> use<00:02:03.640> like<00:02:04.480> teflon<00:02:04.990> tape

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
and you may want to use like teflon tape

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and you may want to use like teflon tape
or<00:02:05.530> or<00:02:06.370> something<00:02:06.730> on<00:02:07.000> here<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:09.250> know

or or something on here just you know
for<00:02:09.760> good<00:02:09.940> measure

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.450 

yeah<00:02:26.650> that's<00:02:28.020> pretty<00:02:29.020> much<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.770> she<00:02:30.220> looks

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
yeah that's pretty much what she looks

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.920 
yeah that's pretty much what she looks
like<00:02:30.700> when<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.060> have<00:02:31.270> her<00:02:31.510> all<00:02:31.720> together<00:02:33.930> your

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
like when you have her all together your

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:43.650 
like when you have her all together your
paint<00:02:35.460> goes<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.640> here<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> bottom

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
paint goes in here and on the bottom

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.750 
paint goes in here and on the bottom
here<00:02:43.900> would<00:02:44.320> be<00:02:44.470> your<00:02:44.650> little<00:02:44.920> airline

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
here would be your little airline

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.940 
here would be your little airline
fitting<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:47.020> go<00:02:47.170> into<00:02:47.530> your<00:02:47.740> air<00:02:48.160> hose<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.890> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
fitting to go into your air hose this is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.820 
fitting to go into your air hose this is
a<00:02:51.100> dial<00:02:51.459> here<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.120> adjust<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.840> air<00:02:53.470> pressure

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
a dial here to adjust the air pressure

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.710 
a dial here to adjust the air pressure
at<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.280> gun<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.580> have<00:02:57.790> other<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.120> couple<00:02:58.570> other
