lead guitar course we're going to look

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.520 
lead guitar course we're going to look
at<00:00:25.420> something<00:00:25.870> which<00:00:25.960> we're<00:00:26.170> calling<00:00:26.410> the

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
at something which we're calling the

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.220 
at something which we're calling the
extended<00:00:27.190> pentatonic<00:00:27.820> minor<00:00:27.880> scale<00:00:28.510> this<00:00:29.110> is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
extended pentatonic minor scale this is

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.200 
extended pentatonic minor scale this is
a<00:00:29.260> pentatonic<00:00:29.770> minor<00:00:29.800> scale<00:00:30.369> that<00:00:30.820> will<00:00:30.970> run

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
a pentatonic minor scale that will run

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.750 
a pentatonic minor scale that will run
through<00:00:31.240> position<00:00:32.080> 5<00:00:32.349> into<00:00:33.160> position<00:00:33.520> 1

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
through position 5 into position 1

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.229 
through position 5 into position 1
through<00:00:34.600> position<00:00:35.020> 2<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:35.650> up<00:00:36.129> into<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.760> top

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
through position 2 and up into the top

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.630 
through position 2 and up into the top
end<00:00:37.450> of<00:00:37.660> position<00:00:38.110> 3<00:00:38.620> this<00:00:39.190> will<00:00:39.340> make<00:00:39.460> more

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
end of position 3 this will make more

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.920 
end of position 3 this will make more
sense<00:00:39.700> when<00:00:39.940> I<00:00:40.090> show<00:00:40.270> you<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.450> pattern<00:00:40.629> in<00:00:40.840> a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
sense when I show you the pattern in a

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.720 
sense when I show you the pattern in a
minute<00:00:41.200> it's<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.710> really<00:00:41.980> good<00:00:42.129> position<00:00:42.309> sort

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
minute it's a really good position sort

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.479 
minute it's a really good position sort
of<00:00:42.820> racing<00:00:43.300> through<00:00:43.629> fast<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.129> way<00:00:45.280> of

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
of racing through fast in a way of

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.070 
of racing through fast in a way of
getting<00:00:45.730> from<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> low<00:00:46.300> end<00:00:46.449> of<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.600> guitar<00:00:46.870> to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
getting from a low end of the guitar to

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.990 
getting from a low end of the guitar to
a<00:00:47.110> high<00:00:47.379> end<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.680> guitar<00:00:47.980> very<00:00:48.160> quickly<00:00:48.550> so

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
a high end of the guitar very quickly so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.310 
a high end of the guitar very quickly so
we'll<00:00:49.150> go<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.270> a<00:00:49.390> close-up<00:00:49.629> now<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.140> I'll<00:00:50.230> show

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
we'll go to a close-up now and I'll show

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.650 
we'll go to a close-up now and I'll show
you<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.650> fingering<00:00:51.010> for<00:00:51.040> that<00:00:54.450> ok<00:00:55.450> so<00:00:55.510> we're

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
you the fingering for that ok so we're

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.720 
you the fingering for that ok so we're
going<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.840> look<00:00:55.960> at<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.260> suggested<00:00:57.220> fingering

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
going to look at the suggested fingering

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.880 
going to look at the suggested fingering
for<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.239> extended<00:00:58.660> pentatonic<00:00:59.320> minor<00:00:59.350> scale

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
for the extended pentatonic minor scale

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.290 
for the extended pentatonic minor scale
we're<00:01:00.220> going<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.399> be<00:01:00.489> looking<00:01:00.640> at<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:01.030> scale

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
we're going to be looking at this scale

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.300 
we're going to be looking at this scale
in<00:01:01.600> B<00:01:01.960> minor<00:01:02.640> okay<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:03.850> our<00:01:04.360> root<00:01:05.020> note<00:01:05.310> our

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
in B minor okay so our root note our

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.850 
in B minor okay so our root note our
first<00:01:06.670> root<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.149> we<00:01:07.270> encounter<00:01:07.840> is<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.170> 7th

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
first root that we encounter is a 7th

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.969 
first root that we encounter is a 7th
fret<00:01:09.250> on<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.640> on<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.869> bottom<00:01:11.110> E<00:01:11.380> string<00:01:11.770> and

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
fret on the on the bottom E string and

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.740 
fret on the on the bottom E string and
if<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.310> can<00:01:12.430> imagine<00:01:12.520> your<00:01:12.940> position<00:01:13.360> one<00:01:13.570> is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
if you can imagine your position one is

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.160 
if you can imagine your position one is
going<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.899> come<00:01:14.080> off<00:01:14.259> here

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.620 

so<00:01:21.170> we're<00:01:21.289> gonna<00:01:21.380> be<00:01:21.530> starting<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:22.369> tone<00:01:23.119> to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
so we're gonna be starting a tone to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.499 
so we're gonna be starting a tone to
fret<00:01:23.929> down<00:01:24.259> from<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:24.740> at<00:01:25.579> position<00:01:25.939> 5

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
fret down from that at position 5

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.569 
fret down from that at position 5
so<00:01:26.719> this<00:01:26.869> scout<00:01:27.109> doesn't<00:01:27.499> start<00:01:27.770> on<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.069> tonic

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
so this scout doesn't start on a tonic

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.490 
so this scout doesn't start on a tonic
doesn't<00:01:29.000> start<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.509> be<00:01:29.810> root<00:01:30.079> it's

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
doesn't start on the be root it's

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.940 
doesn't start on the be root it's
starting<00:01:31.450> two<00:01:32.450> frets<00:01:32.689> down<00:01:32.929> at<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950

first bit was so that's a pattern we're

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.990 
first bit was so that's a pattern we're
going<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:00.590> repeat<00:02:00.950> inside<00:02:01.399> this<00:02:01.640> scale<00:02:02.349> 5<00:02:03.429> 7<00:02:04.429> 5

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000

ok<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.140> next<00:02:09.170> octave<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:10.039> this<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.549> going<00:02:10.940> to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
ok the next octave of this is going to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.670 
ok the next octave of this is going to
start<00:02:11.359> at<00:02:11.599> fret<00:02:11.959> 7<00:02:12.940> on<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.569> D<00:02:14.780> string<00:02:14.810> we've

start at fret 7 on the D string we've

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.890 
start at fret 7 on the D string we've
then<00:02:15.920> got<00:02:15.980> exactly<00:02:16.579> the<00:02:16.730> same<00:02:16.819> pattern<00:02:17.329> except

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
then got exactly the same pattern except

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.849 
then got exactly the same pattern except
saw<00:02:18.079> two<00:02:18.319> frets<00:02:18.590> up<00:02:18.799> so<00:02:19.459> we've<00:02:19.609> got<00:02:19.760> frets<00:02:20.650> 7<00:02:21.650> &amp;

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:28.449 
saw two frets up so we've got frets 7 &amp;
9<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:23.299> then<00:02:23.450> onto<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.750> next<00:02:24.049> string<00:02:24.790> 7<00:02:25.790> 9<00:02:26.480> 11

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
9 and then onto the next string 7 9 11

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.290 
9 and then onto the next string 7 9 11
so<00:02:29.030> we've<00:02:29.180> got

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.229 

and<00:02:35.799> then<00:02:36.799> we've<00:02:37.190> got<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.400> do<00:02:37.489> exactly<00:02:37.610> the

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
and then we've got to do exactly the

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.720 
and then we've got to do exactly the
same<00:02:38.480> thing<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.069> time<00:02:40.340> we're<00:02:40.549> going<00:02:40.670> to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
same thing but this time we're going to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.580 
same thing but this time we're going to
move<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.120> up<00:02:41.239> three<00:02:41.780> frets<00:02:42.049> we're<00:02:42.409> going<00:02:42.530> to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
move it up three frets we're going to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.199 
move it up three frets we're going to
start<00:02:42.890> at<00:02:43.040> fret<00:02:43.310> 10<00:02:43.610> because<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.000> way<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
start at fret 10 because of the way the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.210 
start at fret 10 because of the way the
guitar<00:02:44.510> tuned<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.019> B<00:02:45.170> string<00:02:45.530> everything's<00:02:46.040> a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
guitar tuned the B string everything's a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.710 
guitar tuned the B string everything's a
semitone<00:02:46.790> lower<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.209> we've<00:02:47.299> got<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.480> move<00:02:47.599> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
semitone lower so we've got to move it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.720 
semitone lower so we've got to move it
up<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.989> semitone<00:02:48.290> we're<00:02:49.220> going<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> play<00:02:49.640> fret

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
up a semitone we're going to play fret

let's<00:03:14.329> have<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.480> look<00:03:14.629> at<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.810> again

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.730 

so<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.480> go<00:03:25.630> imagine<00:03:26.050> where<00:03:26.200> your<00:03:26.320> positions

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
so you go imagine where your positions

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.440 
so you go imagine where your positions
are<00:03:27.010> here<00:03:27.280> your<00:03:27.640> main<00:03:27.820> positions<00:03:28.180> position

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
are here your main positions position

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.440 
are here your main positions position
one<00:03:29.460> isn't<00:03:30.460> here<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:30.760> we're<00:03:30.880> going<00:03:31.060> from

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
one isn't here so we're going from

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.500 
one isn't here so we're going from
position<00:03:31.540> five<00:03:32.010> up<00:03:33.010> into<00:03:33.520> position<00:03:33.640> one<00:03:34.180> and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
position five up into position one and

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.320 
position five up into position one and
then<00:03:35.080> we're<00:03:35.200> going<00:03:35.320> up<00:03:35.500> into<00:03:36.000> position

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
then we're going up into position

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.170 
then we're going up into position
-<00:03:37.980> that's<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.160> top<00:03:39.460> into<00:03:39.820> position<00:03:39.940> -<00:03:40.590> and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
- that's that top into position - and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.780 
- that's that top into position - and
then<00:03:43.180> we're<00:03:43.300> sliding<00:03:44.250> happening<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.400> position

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
then we're sliding happening to position

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:57.220 
then we're sliding happening to position
three<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:47.470> once<00:03:47.680> more<00:03:47.920> slowly

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.200 

now<00:03:58.230> we're<00:03:58.410> going<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.560> go<00:03:58.680> back<00:03:58.950> down<00:03:59.030> but<00:04:00.030> this

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
now we're going to go back down but this

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.300 
now we're going to go back down but this
time<00:04:00.450> instead<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.900> moving<00:04:01.170> into<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.190> new

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
time instead of moving into the new

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.860 
time instead of moving into the new
position<00:04:02.430> with<00:04:02.760> finger<00:04:02.970> three<00:04:03.000> we're<00:04:03.780> going

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
position with finger three we're going

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.680 
position with finger three we're going
to<00:04:03.960> be<00:04:04.050> moving<00:04:04.260> back<00:04:04.680> into<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.910> position<00:04:06.090> with

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
to be moving back into the position with

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:19.729 
to be moving back into the position with
finger<00:04:07.050> one<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:08.070> we're<00:04:08.220> going<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> start

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:38.990 

so<00:04:20.340> we've<00:04:20.519> got<00:04:20.729> there

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.260 

you

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.190 

okay<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.330> I'm<00:04:49.450> just<00:04:49.510> going<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.840> show<00:04:50.020> some

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
okay so I'm just going to show some

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.530 
okay so I'm just going to show some
examples<00:04:50.290> of<00:04:50.860> how<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.130> might<00:04:51.340> use<00:04:51.910> this<00:04:52.210> scale

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
examples of how you might use this scale

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.780 
examples of how you might use this scale
just<00:04:52.960> with<00:04:53.320> some<00:04:53.500> fast<00:04:53.830> runs<00:04:54.190> through<00:04:54.610> the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
just with some fast runs through the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.210 
just with some fast runs through the
scale<00:04:55.110> we'll<00:04:56.110> put<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.350> backing<00:04:56.530> track<00:04:56.890> on<00:04:57.070> and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
scale we'll put the backing track on and

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.650 
scale we'll put the backing track on and
I'll<00:04:57.310> show<00:04:57.460> some<00:04:57.520> examples<00:05:00.300> okay<00:05:01.300> so<00:05:01.360> I'm<00:05:01.510> just

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
I'll show some examples okay so I'm just

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.300 
I'll show some examples okay so I'm just
going<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.870> start<00:05:02.110> on<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.380> lowest<00:05:02.650> note<00:05:03.070> of<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
going to start on the lowest note of the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.160 
going to start on the lowest note of the
position<00:05:03.430> really<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.120> go<00:05:04.240> from<00:05:04.480> one<00:05:04.750> end<00:05:05.050> of

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
position really and go from one end of

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:14.560 
position really and go from one end of
the<00:05:05.290> position<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.980> other

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.910 

so<00:05:15.570> let's<00:05:15.690> put<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.900> some<00:05:16.020> slides<00:05:16.410> in<00:05:16.710> there

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
so let's put it some slides in there

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.710 
so let's put it some slides in there
when<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.130> was<00:05:17.220> changing<00:05:17.700> position<00:05:18.210> every<00:05:18.690> time

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
when I was changing position every time

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.810 
when I was changing position every time
I<00:05:18.960> was<00:05:19.080> sliding<00:05:19.440> into<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.950> new<00:05:20.160> position<00:05:20.610> so<00:05:20.790> I

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
I was sliding into the new position so I

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.220 
I was sliding into the new position so I
was<00:05:20.970> going

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.760 

slide

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:41.210 

so<00:05:33.310> you<00:05:33.400> could<00:05:33.520> do<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.699> bit<00:05:33.880> faster

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.370 

so<00:05:41.820> when<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.000> play<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.420> position<00:05:42.600> I'm<00:05:42.990> making

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
so when I play this position I'm making

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.590 
so when I play this position I'm making
it<00:05:43.530> quite<00:05:44.130> easy<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.670> play<00:05:44.880> by<00:05:45.090> playing<00:05:45.450> the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
it quite easy to play by playing the

00:05:45.600 --> 00:06:12.350
