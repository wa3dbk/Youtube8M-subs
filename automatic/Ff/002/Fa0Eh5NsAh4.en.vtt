00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.600
 good morning let's present the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.580
 final project that was made for the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.290
 digital treatment subject 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.650
 engineering program images 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.290
 technological mechatronics with consultants 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.680
 but without cuts by means of which 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.220
 using a webcam 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.970
 let's read the numbers 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.430
 in any order 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.689
 and with that software of evil we are going to 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.539
 identify that the number way that 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 We put Grandma's camera using a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.220
 database that was designed with the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.160
 characteristics of each number 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.040
 among them its area its perimeter its 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.820
 solidity and eccentricity their diameters of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.820
 major axis and minor 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.050
 and then we are going to run software for 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.850
 repair the correct functioning of the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.970
 system let's take three numbers to the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.970
 random 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.549
 [Music] 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.490
 good is the first channel number 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.490
 of the system 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.730
 61 good we see that he read the number 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.300
 correctly let's read another number 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.300
 three figures 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.489
 [Music] 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.070
 good the system will identify 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.180
 then the number of which we are 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.180
 reading in real time 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:15.160
 254 well then there we see that the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.490
 union system or correctly 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.180
 I hope you liked the work 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.730
 and if they have any write now what 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.890
 do or throw hotmail.com if they have 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.980
 some two and many thanks for the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.980
 Attention
