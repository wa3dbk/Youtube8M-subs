storage but also covers most of this
stuff<00:03:28.680> around<00:03:28.919> here<00:03:29.129> but<00:03:29.250> then<00:03:29.370> I've<00:03:29.489> also<00:03:29.549> got

kind of see how my defense holds up so I

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.939 
kind of see how my defense holds up so I
can<00:04:15.449> start<00:04:15.599> developing<00:04:15.780> my<00:04:16.260> base<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.500> bit<00:04:16.739> more

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
can start developing my base a bit more

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.229 
can start developing my base a bit more
and<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.280> need<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.549> start<00:04:17.760> attacking<00:04:17.940> because

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
and I need to start attacking because

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.520 
and I need to start attacking because
it's<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.389> good<00:04:18.570> way<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.720> get<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.169> golden

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
it's a good way to get more golden

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.339 
it's a good way to get more golden
elixir<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.840> we're<00:04:21.840> going<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.140> one

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
elixir and we're going to have one

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.320 
elixir and we're going to have one
attack<00:04:22.650> now<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.159> then<00:04:23.760> i'm<00:04:23.909> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.150> wait

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
attack now and then i'm going to wait

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.460 
attack now and then i'm going to wait

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
the bill so i can keep upgrading again

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.900 
the bill so i can keep upgrading again
and<00:04:27.660> with<00:04:28.230> upgrades<00:04:28.650> obviously<00:04:29.340> goes<00:04:29.640> quickly

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
and with upgrades obviously goes quickly

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.190 
and with upgrades obviously goes quickly

2,000<00:04:58.110> elixir<00:04:58.590> he's<00:04:59.100> got<00:04:59.280> one<00:04:59.610> cannon<00:05:00.150> there

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390

and<00:05:01.610> one<00:05:02.610> archer<00:05:03.180> tower<00:05:03.420> so<00:05:04.200> i<00:05:04.230> think<00:05:04.440> i<00:05:04.830> should

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
and one archer tower so i think i should

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.120 
and one archer tower so i think i should
be<00:05:05.190> able<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.460> rob<00:05:05.700> his<00:05:06.380> long<00:05:07.380> before<00:05:07.860> he

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
be able to rob his long before he

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.440 
be able to rob his long before he
can<00:05:08.340> do<00:05:08.460> anything<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:09.000> we're<00:05:09.150> going<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.330> take

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450

this battle what i'm going to do first

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.620 
this battle what i'm going to do first
was<00:05:11.340> i'm<00:05:11.430> going<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.610> drop<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.970> load<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.300> goblins

him completely blind that Archer should

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.670 
him completely blind that Archer should
take<00:05:21.450> on<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.720> troll<00:05:21.930> which<00:05:22.080> is<00:05:22.230> exactly<00:05:22.380> what

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
take on the troll which is exactly what

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.380 
take on the troll which is exactly what
it's<00:05:22.830> doing<00:05:23.130> I<00:05:23.280> didn't<00:05:23.910> even<00:05:23.940> need<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.240> drop

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
it's doing I didn't even need to drop

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.970 
it's doing I didn't even need to drop
that<00:05:24.450> troll<00:05:24.780> their<00:05:24.960> cannons<00:05:25.500> weren't<00:05:25.710> looking

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
that troll their cannons weren't looking

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.830 
that troll their cannons weren't looking
at<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.130> goblins<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.700> I'm<00:05:26.880> taking<00:05:27.540> this<00:05:27.660> guy

at the goblins and I'm taking this guy

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.750 
at the goblins and I'm taking this guy
pretty<00:05:28.320> much<00:05:28.530> down<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.040> his<00:05:29.220> bare<00:05:29.490> bones

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
pretty much down to his bare bones

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.700 
pretty much down to his bare bones
hopefully<00:05:30.540> these<00:05:30.660> goblins<00:05:31.050> manage<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.530> get

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
hopefully these goblins manage to get

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.520 
hopefully these goblins manage to get
rid<00:05:31.890> of<00:05:31.919> all<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:33.390> this<00:05:33.570> all<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.260> stuff

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
rid of all of this all of this stuff

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.280 
rid of all of this all of this stuff
before<00:05:35.070> they<00:05:35.400> get<00:05:35.550> killed<00:05:35.880> of<00:05:36.120> picked<00:05:36.630> up<00:05:36.810> a

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
before they get killed of picked up a

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.010 
before they get killed of picked up a
fair<00:05:37.890> bit<00:05:38.040> so<00:05:38.280> far<00:05:38.580> as<00:05:38.850> still<00:05:39.450> a<00:05:39.480> few<00:05:39.690> goblins

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
fair bit so far as still a few goblins

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.240 
fair bit so far as still a few goblins
to<00:05:40.140> go<00:05:40.260> we'll<00:05:40.440> still<00:05:40.560> get<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.740> bit<00:05:40.890> more<00:05:41.010> elixir

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
to go we'll still get a bit more elixir

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.740 
to go we'll still get a bit more elixir
I<00:05:41.460> don't<00:05:41.669> think<00:05:41.880> we'll<00:05:41.970> get<00:05:42.120> anything<00:05:42.510> out<00:05:42.720> of

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
I don't think we'll get anything out of

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.530 
I don't think we'll get anything out of
the<00:05:42.900> town<00:05:43.110> house<00:05:43.350> but<00:05:44.070> that<00:05:44.370> was<00:05:44.700> a<00:05:44.729> successful

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
the town house but that was a successful

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.480 
the town house but that was a successful
battle<00:05:46.320> I<00:05:46.680> guess<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.070> mean<00:05:47.220> there's<00:05:47.430> a

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
battle I guess I mean there's a

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.760 
battle I guess I mean there's a
forty-eight<00:05:48.450> percent<00:05:48.570> damage<00:05:48.930> which<00:05:49.320> doesn't

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
forty-eight percent damage which doesn't

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.260 
forty-eight percent damage which doesn't
quite<00:05:49.890> give<00:05:50.190> me<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.430> star<00:05:50.669> anise<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:51.030> can

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
quite give me the star anise I can

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.030 
quite give me the star anise I can
manage<00:05:51.570> to<00:05:51.690> take<00:05:51.870> this<00:05:52.020> cannon<00:05:52.410> down<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.830> don't

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
manage to take this cannon down I don't

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.010 
manage to take this cannon down I don't
think<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.340> can<00:05:53.580> they're<00:05:54.210> kind<00:05:54.390> of<00:05:54.510> doing<00:05:54.780> a<00:05:54.870> bit

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
think I can they're kind of doing a bit

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.690 
think I can they're kind of doing a bit
of<00:05:55.050> everything<00:05:55.169> so<00:05:55.620> it's<00:05:55.919> actually<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.430> failed

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
of everything so it's actually a failed

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.300 
of everything so it's actually a failed
battle<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.419> lost<00:05:57.690> one<00:05:57.930> trophy<00:05:58.350> for<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.740> lost

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
battle I lost one trophy for it lost

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.030 
battle I lost one trophy for it lost
twenty<00:05:59.640> twenty<00:06:00.300> goblins<00:06:00.660> and<00:06:00.930> two<00:06:01.410> trolls

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
twenty twenty goblins and two trolls

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.950 
twenty twenty goblins and two trolls
there<00:06:02.400> but<00:06:02.820> it<00:06:02.910> picked<00:06:03.030> up<00:06:03.180> eighteen<00:06:03.600> hundred

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
there but it picked up eighteen hundred

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.010 
there but it picked up eighteen hundred
gold<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.560> thousand<00:06:05.250> elixir<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:05.970> I<00:06:06.210> think

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
gold and a thousand elixir so I think

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.590 
gold and a thousand elixir so I think
that<00:06:07.200> was<00:06:07.440> actually<00:06:07.590> a<00:06:07.800> fairly<00:06:08.600> successful

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
that was actually a fairly successful

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.210 
that was actually a fairly successful
battle<00:06:09.900> of<00:06:10.140> course<00:06:10.380> that<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.740> shoulders<00:06:11.070> gone

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
battle of course that the shoulders gone

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.219 
battle of course that the shoulders gone
now<00:06:11.400> but<00:06:11.430> we're<00:06:11.940> going<00:06:12.030> to<00:06:12.120> train<00:06:12.330> some<00:06:12.600> train

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
now but we're going to train some train

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.320 
now but we're going to train some train
some<00:06:13.380> more<00:06:13.410> troops<00:06:13.770> so<00:06:14.520> I<00:06:14.550> lost<00:06:14.850> about<00:06:15.000> twenty

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
some more troops so I lost about twenty

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.969 
some more troops so I lost about twenty
of<00:06:15.419> those<00:06:15.570> so<00:06:15.840> that's<00:06:16.020> five<00:06:16.410> hundred<00:06:16.800> of<00:06:16.890> those

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
of those so that's five hundred of those

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.440 
of those so that's five hundred of those
I<00:06:17.190> lost<00:06:17.400> plus<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.479> two<00:06:18.630> trolls<00:06:20.300> which<00:06:21.300> is

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
I lost plus the the two trolls which is

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.060 
I lost plus the the two trolls which is
another<00:06:21.690> thousand<00:06:22.260> so<00:06:22.350> how<00:06:22.440> she<00:06:22.500> lost<00:06:22.860> two

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
another thousand so how she lost two

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.270 
another thousand so how she lost two
thousand<00:06:23.550> two<00:06:24.300> thousand<00:06:24.750> wait<00:06:25.410> no<00:06:25.560> 1500

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
thousand two thousand wait no 1500

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.130 
thousand two thousand wait no 1500
elixir<00:06:26.610> to<00:06:26.729> build<00:06:26.910> that<00:06:27.030> so<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.660> was<00:06:27.810> it<00:06:28.020> was

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
elixir to build that so it was it was

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.980 
elixir to build that so it was it was
positive<00:06:28.380> we<00:06:28.860> actually<00:06:29.160> we<00:06:29.280> came<00:06:29.460> out<00:06:29.640> on<00:06:29.669> top

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
positive we actually we came out on top

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.330 
positive we actually we came out on top
so<00:06:30.990> we're<00:06:31.110> going<00:06:31.200> to<00:06:31.290> build<00:06:31.470> a<00:06:31.830> whole<00:06:32.130> bunch

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
so we're going to build a whole bunch

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.399
