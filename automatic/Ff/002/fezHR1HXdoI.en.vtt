00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.480
 how about friends all have an excellent 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.039
 today we are going to do batman from a 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.799
 different perspective in this case the 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.539
 face then we start first let's go 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.910
 to locate 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 at the top do not show with 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.800
 from here we come 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679
 A) Yes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.880
 up here 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.420
 and we arrived here then let's do the 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.899
 part 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.230
 of river the tips of the ears in this 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.230
 case 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.290
 that are well known by this character 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 and again here we are going to try to do 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.410
 Something similar 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.350
 we come like this 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:58.910
 and we come from here 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.690
 in this way then we are going to do everything 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:07.070
 the front we continue here until here 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.440
 similarly we come like this until here and 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.350
 we do the part 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.280
 of the nose 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.229
 in the batman mask 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.800
 we come here then what we do and 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.800
 we come here 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.490
 these two parts 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.000
 and then we limit or reflect the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.960
 part of the face in this case of the chin 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.060
 that comes from the top and low 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.520
 up to the heights but here too 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.180
 we do something very similar and already here in 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.230
 this part 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.790
 we attach the metal then let's do 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.600
 the part of the face 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.200
 highlighting the face to the mouth sorry and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:01.390
 this height we are going to do the part of the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.530
 mouth like that and then we go to jump a 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.830
 little these parts has the mask of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.990
 the sides in the same way in this in this 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.840
 part up here 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.370
 until now we are going to highlight the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.170
 part of the eyes then over here 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:25.690
 comes the expression comes here and goes up 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.560
 to stand out here falls then the eye is of 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.599
 an aggressive malvin perspective like that 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.190
 from the base for something very similar to 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.290
 this time not reflecting the wines 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.219
 here we make ture come 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.409
 and we do all the bottom part and for 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:44.319
 here we do the same then we come and 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.690
 we went up more or less like this already in this 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.960
 angle 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.240
 well the hairline and here we go down no longer 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.720
 let's go a little bit more about the character let's go 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:00.070
 to make the structure then part 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.810
 of the neck in the same way when going down 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.850
 here goes down here and then we are going to 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.390
 highlight a little more nose came to 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.430
 this height here they make a few 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.340
 breaks 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.769
 that wants to jump that here he has the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.829
 somewhat aggressive face then we come 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.079
 from this half we almost went down 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.130
 all half of this ear by 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:29.520
 say it like that until here 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.690
 we went up here we also arrived here and 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.720
 we do the same 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.880
 we go down the entire half or so 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.110
 up here and here we try to do what 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.330
 same will not always be the same but 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.080
 the idea is the same and at this height 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.920
 then I will 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 highlight 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.739
 parts 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.890
 of the eyes let's highlight let's give 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.890
 a little more strength 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.530
 at this height here 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.819
 over here 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.900
 here we also take the force 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.969
 to the character in the part 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.510
 main now what are we going to do with a 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.730
 slightly thinner marker 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.500
 I'm going to decorate this character a little more 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.500
 then we come and we make a few strips 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.019
 the week will be the little shadows that 

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:37.019
 is going to have the character 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.029
 in this case we are going to do it with some 

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:44.090
 lines that are going to give you a little 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.409
 rather quick effect 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.800
 we are not going to complicate 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:52.189
 we came like this we created all this effect of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.189
 shadow 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.180
 over here 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:32.819
 already then we are going to give it a touch 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.819
 different to the character 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.040
 and everyone gives the shadow for the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.140
 sectors that want in this case I what 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.140
 I'm doing this way 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.600
 this helps you improve a bit more the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.600
 expression in the same way here 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.160
 so over here 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.570
 around here on the chin the expressions 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.570
 by the nape of the neck 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.360
 personado helps decorate or something a 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.360
 little bit more strength to the character 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.319
 that we know goes black but in this 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.249
 case we're not going to paint it black but 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:27.109
 that we are going to simulate 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.109
 parts of the shadow 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.480
 in this way then we are almost going to 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.480
 finish 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.150
 in this way 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.150
 we make some expressions here 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.930
 then we polish this part 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.620
 until the side this sector 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:10.699
 and we come here also in this way 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.770
 we go down here 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.540
 and we have finished the character 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.580
 we have batman I hope you liked it 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.700
 see you in upcoming tutorials up 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.700
 then
