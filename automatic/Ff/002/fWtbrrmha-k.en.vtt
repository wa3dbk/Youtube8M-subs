00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.990
 and today I won the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.890
 of the song I know of the band 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.870
 urban legion 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.300
 Let's welcome you here that is the eagle is 66 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.650
 63 with this cool song for who is 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.050
 beginning because she has none 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.670
 eyelash and jaco are well known for 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.130
 to play the whole song we 're going to use a rhythm 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.130
 Only those chords here are bigger. 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.000
 there smaller 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:25.120
 the smallest 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.010
 the home with seventh 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.340
 the dogma 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.599
 that appears only in the chorus 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.140
 so let's take a look at the introduction 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:39.150
 in the first part 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.150
 [Music] 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:51.130
 verbal sex does not make my style words 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.130
 only mistakes and mistakes are yours 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.780
 I want to remember 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.780
 I is 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:12.120
 one day i want to try to find out why 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.120
 is stronger and who knows how to lie 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.080
 I do not want to enter 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.150
 the film 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.150
 I paint too 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:28.460
 I'll play a rhythm once slowly 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.919
 I'll show you later by parts. 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.870
 [Music] 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.669
 I will show rhythm in two parts in the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.120
 first part is already assembled is bigger and goes 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.909
 knock two down 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.020
 [Music] 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.210
 in the second part we will play 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.870
 four alternating beats starting with 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.870
 a low 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.170
 the whole team stays like this 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.680
 with this is the rhythm that we will use 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.510
 to play the whole song what goes 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.670
 to vary is the number of times it will be 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.110
 played in each chord the introduction by 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.110
 example they will play four times 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.120
 [Music] 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.819
 after that the first part begins and the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.509
 We'll start singing the hit my 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.979
 same 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.169
 but how did I say the number of times I 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.699
 it will be played in each chord varies 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.530
 So I'll play the chord sequence of 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.830
 first verse once for you to follow 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:50.050
 with the little ones 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:52.160
 [Music] 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:06:08.640
 [Applause] 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:10.750
 [Music] 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.550
 It is how we will play on 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.100
 first stanza and in the second is just the 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.990
 people repeat this same sequence 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.790
 refrain has no news anymore which are 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.570
 the same in each one we will play 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.800
 a pace twice that way it is 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.800
 [Music] 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.050
 W 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.410
 B 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 6 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.150
 after ready is the second part but 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.830
 people will only repeat what I taught 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.050
 so just stay connected on the figure to 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.490
 know how to structure namur and to 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.380
 to train only to return at the beginning of 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.090
 class and play with me so that's it 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.280
 to watch more videos and learn more 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.420
 songs just get the fan club any
