Advent seven days before Christmas that

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.050 
Advent seven days before Christmas that
could<00:02:04.500> mean<00:02:04.710> why<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> Feast<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.000> the

Seven<00:02:06.270> Fishes<00:02:06.530> there<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.799> also<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.819> seven

deadly sins
that's<00:02:10.500> another<00:02:10.770> reason<00:02:11.070> why<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.550> could<00:02:11.730> have

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
that's another reason why we could have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.060 
that's another reason why we could have
the<00:02:12.060> Feast<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.480> Seven<00:02:12.690> Fishes<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
sacraments the seven centers a priest

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.020 
sacraments the seven centers a priest
just<00:02:19.260> told<00:02:19.590> me<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.710> recently<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.430> that's

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
just told me that recently that that's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.430 
just told me that recently that that's
why<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.960> Seven<00:02:22.950> Fishes<00:02:23.160> on

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
why we have the Seven Fishes on

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.810 
why we have the Seven Fishes on
Christmas<00:02:25.440> Eve<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:26.430> about<00:02:26.490> it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
Christmas Eve when you think about it

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.370 
Christmas Eve when you think about it
most<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.330> immigrants<00:02:27.780> who<00:02:27.810> came<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
most of the immigrants who came to this

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.680 
most of the immigrants who came to this
country<00:02:28.440> came<00:02:29.040> from<00:02:29.250> southern<00:02:29.790> Italy<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
country came from southern Italy and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.510 
country came from southern Italy and
they<00:02:30.930> brought<00:02:31.170> those<00:02:31.410> traditions<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.310> them

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
they brought those traditions with them

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.460 
they brought those traditions with them
so<00:02:33.000> obviously<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.660> brought<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.900> fish<00:02:34.200> culture

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
so obviously they brought a fish culture

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.680 
so obviously they brought a fish culture
with<00:02:34.860> them<00:02:35.040> because<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:36.120> from<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
with them because if you are from the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.900 
with them because if you are from the
south<00:02:36.930> fish<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> big<00:02:37.830> part<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> diet<00:02:38.550> big

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
south fish is a big part of the diet big

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.720 
south fish is a big part of the diet big
part<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> Mediterranean<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:41.550> would

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
part of the Mediterranean and this would

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.430 
part of the Mediterranean and this would
make<00:02:41.880> sense<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.570> think<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.230> was

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
make sense so I think that this was

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.840 
make sense so I think that this was
something<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.800> travelled<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.430> immigrants

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
something that travelled with immigrants

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.450 
something that travelled with immigrants
to<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.510> country<00:02:45.570> they<00:02:46.250> embellished<00:02:47.250> it

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
to this country they embellished it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.910 
to this country they embellished it
however<00:02:47.760> they<00:02:47.940> wanted<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:49.260> became<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
however they wanted to and it became the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.590 
however they wanted to and it became the
fish<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.970> Feast<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.390> Seven
