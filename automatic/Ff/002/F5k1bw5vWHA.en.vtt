00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 I have two cups of rice tea. 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.950
 I'm going to use as a measure a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.620
 cup 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.929
 you will need this're equal measure 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.089
 both water and ros 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.460
 if you are going to use two cups of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.460
 rice you will need the same measure 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 only that the double four cups of tea 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.170
 water and here I have two cloves of garlic 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.929
 smashed in my rice I do not 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.750
 I put onion because besides not liking 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.809
 taste of onion in rice 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.960
 I learned that the lifetime of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.640
 Rice is larger without onion because it is 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 she runs the risk of souring on the day 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.129
 next time and if you want without 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 without the onion it lasts 11 diana there is more 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.129
 huh 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.440
 and reminding you that this rice 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.079
 you find on the website 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.640
 telemig dot com then we go to the preparation 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 so the first step we'll go 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
 start washing and turning a 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.540
 light beer is in the grains if 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
 to rub very hard they break we 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.430
 Let's repeat this process. 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.930
 four times is suspicious 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.780
 and now here we will leave supported 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.550
 to drain off all excess water and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.530
 people will only prepare this rice when 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.360
 he has taken away all the excess water 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.330
 have to win here in approximately 15 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.220
 minutes until all the water is running after 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.470
 knock I have washed the rice 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.479
 We already have to put boiling water 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 It's so easy, we're welcome. 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.530
 preparing rice cooking 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.300
 so here on low heat I'm going to put 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.340
 look a little jewel 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.210
 a soup spoon okay I like 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.880
 each one 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 It's getting the garlic 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.430
 here I have two cloves of garlic seasoning 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.890
 also varies according to the taste of each 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.990
 You may want to put onion why then 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.009
 to vote anything any time for the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.289
 sector may mix a little and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.950
 now I'm going to let it fry and I'm turning the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.450
 The panela is because other than garlic 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.790
 I like to mix while the oil 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.299
 affecting because otherwise it sticks urgently 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.110
 in the spoon will only generate in the pan the oil 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.370
 It turned golden a little double already 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.030
 Now we're going to see the search too. 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.829
 is well sequinho can not have water're 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.829
 because we're going to fry the rice 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.350
 now we will found that the ros 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.470
 perfect it this takes three 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.150
 minutes is a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.320
 Pinadinha, you'll see how it goes. 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.320
 stay all the great agents 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.379
 so it's easy because the 33 44 minutes 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.810
 That I was frying this rice 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.739
 mixing is always for that fry 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.900
 equally complete and you realize 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.909
 that the grains also they also count 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.489
 It's also pretty good, it's fine. 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.510
 the little beans here is already the hour of the people 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.069
 put the water boiling water to 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.109
 facilitate're 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.109
 put the fire down because how are you? 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.790
 Hot is going to work hard here. 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.250
 I have two cups of rice tea. 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.510
 for those two cups of rice tea 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.519
 4 cups boiling water tea 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.930
 Steam care is on top of the pan 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.329
 how am I doing here? 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.120
 I think it 's a much lower hand 4 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.379
 cups of water tea to whoever is still 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.239
 Good that you put a little one 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.970
 a slightly higher amount of water to 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.900
 boiling is still a little 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.280
 Water 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.519
 We're going to leave this water still. 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.290
 reserved here because in any case it 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.720
 rice not not give to the kitchen 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.220
 completely with these four cups 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.199
 We will be using it to 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.409
 finish baking the coast 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.979
 so we mix and now I put 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.669
 the salt 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:05.579
 now let's put sun and salt to taste 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:09.329
 also to the pocket of each place the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:13.470
 Salt there, you mix of taste to be 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:17.820
 Your taste of salt for me is good 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.669
 now we will put the cap will 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.229
 capping leave open also to semi 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.990
 steam and we'll wait here 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.639
 she on low heat will wait for 10 a 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.460
 15 minutes approximately 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.159
 till the water stays after we come back 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.650
 to see the consistency of the rice then the 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:40.169
 spent approximately 15 minutes 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.970
 rice stayed here and it's already cured from the water 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.500
 You see they deal with the roads. 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.919
 Do you hear that you do not have any more? 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.340
 water bubbling into it then this moment 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.500
 is the time for us gives conferred on 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.690
 rice but here to the center is here 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.090
 last part of cooking the eaves 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.380
 cook first always last 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.270
 there you check 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.770
 try the version is well cooked 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.630
 here in case 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.140
 will be a little bit boring one 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.170
 little is not even my little 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:14.550
 So I'll do the following, I've learned. 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.790
 this trick I came in somewhere to 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.030
 you are 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.030
 do it like this 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:31.010
 You are 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.990
 split because when you went to dump 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.360
 one more plus a little bit of water 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.010
 it is not in the elite only end 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.520
 Cook 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.530
 now it will be distributed equally 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.910
 she will not be concentrating 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:49.190
 On one side, it's only good for me. 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.770
 amount of jaÃº was enough 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.650
 Now I'm going to ring that bell. 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:59.990
 rice for him to finish cooking 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.680
 it will take 15 more minutes alone 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.720
 that 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.340
 then I go back to show put 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.810
 water a little water for the second 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.150
 turn 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.400
 this time the European Champion Panela 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.580
 because my cap that I also have 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.620
 a hole where the color came out if the lid 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.230
 your pot is not so you leave 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.280
 she so open and semi're not not 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.920
 if you can, the water can rise and end 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.560
 spilling now here the people 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.340
 put out the fire already passed the three 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.270
 little 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.000
 Okay, you 'll check it out again. 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.520
 A big one is soft now who goes 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.940
 we will not be vice rice 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.400
 immediately is over the cooking is 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.380
 fundamentally leave him there ten minutes 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.660
 resting before serving 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.250
 so you have to spend 10 minutes 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.780
 Look our rice is ready 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:07:04.940
 I'll show you how to be alone. 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:08.210
 also and as the rice gets a 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.640
 feijÃ£ozinho is also our 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.910
 perfect combination 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:17.950
 our rice kidney beans that we 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.950
 Eat every day that we like a lot.
