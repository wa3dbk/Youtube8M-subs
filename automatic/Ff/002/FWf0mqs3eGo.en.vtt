 prepare this delicious spaghetti 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:56.809
 chipotle but you know that a version with 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.030
 much less fat because we are not going to 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.159
 use cream we will use that 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.739
 just ricotta cheese and yogurt to create 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.449
 our own cream at home and get off at 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.979
 very much the calories of this recipe 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.189
 so here are the ingredients 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.720
 look, I have here 4 tomatoes that I put 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.070
 to boil and remove the skin not you 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.350
 worry when you put them to boil 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.140
 I just lose the shell I have salt 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.360
 I have some chipotle chili from that 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.520
 who sell in cans I have fresh cheese and 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.750
 I have those chihuahua or cheese types 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.180
 cheddar type 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.140
 will be your choice the most light version 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.670
 you can do with the fresh cheese 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.460
 remember that fresh cheese has 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.760
 very little fat this cheese positive 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.670
 fat and here I have a half cup 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.420
 of cottage cheese I have half a clove of garlic 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.460
 I have natural yogurt and I have pasta 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.070
 here this pasta so what do you think if 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.020
 we start preparing our pasta and 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.900
 all we need is a pot with 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.270
 boiling water here I have it already and to this 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.940
 we are going to add a piece of garlic a 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.580
 little salt and we are going to put here our 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.229
 pasta to boil until it is ready as 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.320
 you will know that your pasta is ready 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.000
 when you touch it and it's soft enough 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.530
 They say it 's al dente that we 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.660
 about costs because you do it you touch it and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.759
 sneaking in, it's not good 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.610
 it has to be al dente then that 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.920
 whether it's cooked when you open it 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.989
 you break it here and you see that there is no 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.900
 nothing white there is your pasta ready 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.580
 we're going to leave this here and we're going to 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.200
 make our mixture while 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.050
 cook this pasta 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.970
 for our delicious chipotle so 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.239
 here is a very healthy version 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.400
 Look, I have cottage cheese here, I'm going to 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.349
 add in the usa you can find it as 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.500
 ricotta cheese I have here half a cup of 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.420
 yogurt we are going to add let's go 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.190
 tempting you because my yoghurt depends 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.110
 it's super watered down but yogurt is coming 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 more dense then in Khanty in that 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.010
 let's go measuring the amount because 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.900
 according to the consistency that we want with 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.910
 the chipotle go slowly because then 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.980
 his profile I add a chili 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.810
 chipotle if you have children I recommend you 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.600
 add half and then try 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.990
 see if you like salt to taste 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.290
 half a clove of garlic and the four 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.120
 tomatoes here boiled there goes and now 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.340
 yes let's mix everything is fine in the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.440
 blender 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.599
 when I liked it, everything was ready 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.220
 I did was drain the water off the 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.989
 drained well with cold water so that 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.120
 look at someone important that runs off 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.800
 is the hot water and then you go 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.480
 a little in cold water if it's not going to 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.879
 continue cooking the pasta and you 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.620
 is about cooking and look here I have 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.230
 and my creampie 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.940
 It was delicious and the texture is 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.860
 perfect it's like you're eating 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.140
 creams remember if you have peaks or 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.690
 add more chipotle add more salt according to 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.400
 what I need and look 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.400
 that look at the texture of this cream 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.959
 and let's go mixing together with this and 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.430
 I have here my cheeses you can 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.810
 add the cheese you want I'm going to 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.849
 add some fresh cheese 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.190
 and I'm going to add a little bit of cheese 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.840
 chihuahua but more little cheese 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.480
 chihuahua that cool cool fresh 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.330
 has more calories and we are mixing 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.989
 well and adding more cream in case of 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.989
 need it 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.570
 look over here our pasta has already been 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.520
 chipotle cream and homemade and 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.320
 super light if you stay for the appointment 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.090
 save it because you can put it in the 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.470
 table together with the turkey and I assure you that 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.510
 everyone is going to be fighting 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.070
 because you can use it as a 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.560
 graybeal for the turkey and you will see what 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.530
 so wonderful thing here is our 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.320
 How about spaghetti chipotle does not 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.180
 it looks great and it still does not end 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.970
 recipe because I have the oven put there 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.680
 with the turkey this step that I'm going to do 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.750
 you have to do it so it's ready 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.850
 to eat but if you want to give it a 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.620
 touch so more special and that is 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.249
 prettier what I will do is 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.439
 mix some of these cheeses 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:55.049
 I'm going to put a little bit of this cheese and 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.909
 a little bit of the other one and I'm going to put it 

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:58.790
 oven to melt and you have it a 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.740
 little bit 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.710
 to give more color to this recipe 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.860

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.110

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.340

 you can also put oregano 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.530
 and a little touch and let's go now 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.040

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.979
