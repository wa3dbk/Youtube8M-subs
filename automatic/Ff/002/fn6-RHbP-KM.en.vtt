00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.020
 not so grind it a bit 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.010
 hmm 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.810
 That's how you measure Mr. Stegmaier 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.119
 long grown teeth are one 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.070
 model how long with the scissors and 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.750
 then messina how long they are now 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.299
 and then you bring also small lengths 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.039
 because by the silicone key while 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.039
 a commission always a little bit longer 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:53.099
 because the minimal repositioning 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:53.099
 mistake makes it how long it is 11.4 11 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:07.119
 really good and is still good 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:10.299
 eva proxess file and polish instead 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.660
 thomas bond with bond coat and 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.660
 manipulated 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.030
 No 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.160
 Thus on a blaze one can still one 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.520
 bit the teeth 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.520
 we separate 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.240
 this is palatin mirror 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.840
 so paradis nalbach in principle nothing at all 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:08.740
 Now make bond if the train of 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:09.730
 caribou applicator rather than polish so 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:21.010
 there you can still a bit 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:23.850
 play on that son in the end 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:28.410
 is on it and finished is the polish 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.410
 as well as an occlusion control 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:43.000
 ok so it is still a bit high with one 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.210
 bit of plastic swing came up in 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.340
 every composite shrank with the tooth 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.340
 take a bit off the composite 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:25.629
 But it has to do every makeshift like that 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:28.399
 it will surely come back to the two 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:33.800
 you just do not add plastic to the tooth 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:36.020
 Do not lose your dentist like this 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.889
 real aggression you can spray 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.039
 if the anesthesia is completely out of the man 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.089
 a little something from the pre-order form 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.759
 and the thing is for the patient 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:52.339
 completed 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:54.949
 so and now look at the woman today 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:57.219
 which is practically the continuation of 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.069
 hanni big now that lonely 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:03.559
 needed all-ceramic crowns and lonely 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:07.759
 could be supplied with mini now 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:09.589
 spring m2 fully made what is and 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.749
 today it gets so baked when he 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:13.819
 see if that look good that the 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:19.899
 Crowns looks different, yes 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:19.899
 the difficulty of doing so is laboratory prof
