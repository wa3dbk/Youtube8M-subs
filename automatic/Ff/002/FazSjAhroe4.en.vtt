00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.550
 to 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.870
 now let's see the different parts 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.480
 that have a name the plural is 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.120
 composed basically of three parts 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.280
 fundamentals that are the table the axes 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.390
 and the wheels inside the wheels go 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.030
 the bearings which is what we 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.550
 allows the rotation of the wheels 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.410
 the axes are usually made of steel and 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.640
 there are different types and brands are 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.290
 around 15 30 so many euros in 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.700
 this case are mounted on a table 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.700
 loa of bhangra that is freestyle 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.190
 dancing in the parts of a table 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.150
 longboard are these the tail kit is that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.460
 are these two areas here 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.850
 the ceip which is the form that the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.700
 table the concave which is the curve that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 makes the surface of the table the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.240
 freestyle tables usually have a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.800
 thing called flex that is an index 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.660
 of flexibility of the table for 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.540
 make them more comfortable around 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.030
 transmit less vibrations the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.740
 wheels there are different types of wheels 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 They classify by their size and their hardness 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.050
 there is usually intermediate hardness that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.630
 goes between 83 84 to that is an index 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.940
 american of hardness the hardest arrive 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860
 up to 100 that are skateboarding and 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.270
 the softest ones are used mostly for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.030
 pure travel for its 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.119
 comfort and grip the sizes usually 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.700
 walk between 65 and 75 up to even 100 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.229
 millimeters in diameter is also 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.420
 important to assess the width of the band 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.060
 of rolling even as the size of the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.400
 size will give us more speed there is more 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 comfort and less stability 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.750
 bigger go being there are different 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.630
 prices of wheels and different brands 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 they go around 30 to 40 euros up 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 60 66 the most expensive 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.830
 the axes are another part 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.240
 fundamentals of the longboard that are the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.520
 who get are those who give us the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.650
 I turn basically as they do when 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.250
 tilt the weights on your dropouts 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.899
 on your heels the skate reduces the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.990
 distance between the wheels where 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.740
 we are putting weight and that produces the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.259
 turn tend to have constructions from 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.880
 steel aluminum metal is pretty hard 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.790
 an axis is composed of the different 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.800
 parts that are the basis that is what 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.650
 subject to the shaft itself on the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 the table attached by four screws on the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.910
 screw camping that is the dow that 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.580
 attached to the shaft itself and in it 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.350
 finds the gums howitzer ins 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.390
 they are rubber bands that are used 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.660
 to give progressivity and uniformity to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.000
 the turns in them turning this nut 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.160
 from here we can get more hardness more 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.370
 elasticity and then this is one thing 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.299
 that goes about tastes and can be changed 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.280
 the bearings are a few pieces 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.810
 metallic ones that go that go inside 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.549
 inserted inside the wheels are the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.680
 that help us provide us with the money 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.620
 of the wheel there are different types though 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.540
 in the measure it is usually standard 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.190
 a specific classification that is the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.680
 most famous is the classification to 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.060
 beck but it 's a classification that takes 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.799
 as a reference, very few variables 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.510
 then it is a thing that does not have much 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.150
 importance if the bearings are 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.260
 ab7 vectors otherwise the important thing is 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.299
 that are in good condition and lubricated 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.920
 another of the fundamental parts of 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.720
 Longboard is the sandpaper is what we 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.360
 will allow the grip on the table in 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.909
 turning or sliding situations 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.040
 it's usually a pretty fat summer and 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.689
 in this case it does not have sandpaper in the middle 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.879
 so that when your skates are not 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.349
 too much beachgoers spend this 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.590
 it's a pretty common thing in this 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.590
 sport
