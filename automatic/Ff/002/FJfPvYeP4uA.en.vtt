00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 as soon as 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.240
 now that we have understood a little better how a fire works 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.859
 talking about the reaction 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.159
 that in fact makes fire itself 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:25.069
 we ship to try to understand the based on the principles of the extension of 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.980
 fire 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.149
 we said that is the little is a chemical reaction catania 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.409
 which is based on the simultaneous presence of the three elements 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.400
 in the fire triangle 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.930
 Consequently 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.310
 the extension of the fire must occur by breaking 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.179
 one of the three elements 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.590
 in the fire triangle 1 + 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.110
 d1 d3 elements that make up the fire triangle, remembering that it is enough 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.059
 the absence of one of the three apps in you fire 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.500
 if not the offshoots 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.490
 however, extinguished 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.090
 in particular what we must do 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090
 beyond the private 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.220
 choke the comburent remove the oxygen 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.380
 from the air 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.579
 the circumstances the area where 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.999
 black sands the fire causes fire extinguishing immediately 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.719
 same 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:19.539
 example 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.039
 + common in practice the use of the polar course cover the fire see for example 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.380
 a people here dressed 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.280
 year% catching fire - tried another argument to suffocate 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.320
 remove 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.740
 contact with air and therefore immediate restriction of the paper 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 of the fire itself 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.600
 second chance to remove the fuel 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.170
 as they do for example forestry like a forest fire 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.789
 create an area 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.999
 king without trees 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.380
 re what circus write the area where fire is taking place 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.560
 places for independence. you no longer find the place where 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.590
 propagate and then 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.259
 Reverend to consume all the fuel 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.000
 red that its provision 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.420
 naturally 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.189
 map extinguish by itself 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.619
 in the interior of a reality 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.520
 a building to remove the fuel may mean not placing it 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.250
 the fire in your example of the paper that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.200
 resia crammed in places that are not adequately equipped 3 hears yourself in 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.810
 corridors and security routes that should take the exit the presence 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.640
 cat's combustible material in these little cause areas 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.439
 or increase propagation 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.439
 of the fire year 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.859
 third element 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.999
 elimination of the trigger which is carried out by subtracting the necessary heat 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.690
 to the combustion 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.130
 commonly this is done 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.040
 by verampil whose main task is to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.220
 cool down 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.139
 beautiful surfaces ce below the fire even through those types 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.349
 d extinguishers 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.680
 the heat and reaction is withdrawn 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 it can no longer happen 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:12.729
 practically 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.519
 interrupting any of these for the chain reaction of 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.630
 combustion comes 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.689
 inter fight 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.780
 and is that it is possible to go to proceed to extinguish the fire fire 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:24.659
 it was held 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.009
 to extinguish and of course 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:28.850
 of course from water 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.950
 correctly what we are talking about then interrupt one of the three 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.599
 lakes we must know 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.730
 what is burning to understand what kind of little we have in front of us 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.059
 and therefore how to react accordingly 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.570
 ike cooks are classified 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.629
 based on the nature of the fuel this burning 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.099
 in particular 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.329
 and let's finish 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.730
 stern fires 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.520
 the fires of solid materials such as 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.529
 the coal is the white lacquered line 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:04.879
 hehe solid material is certainly the most common case inside 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.119
 in buildings 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:07.609
 the particularity 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.440
 of the mad then of solid material coma 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.090
 my lawyer who generate berracing then 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.860
 even if there is no reaction 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.850
 the fire with the lamma die ankora a ember that hatches rilke wacken to return 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.290
 angela let's put the moment 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.000
 the conditions of presence dvd adequate new fuel of are verified 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.990
 presence of comburent of me I go out 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.250
 at 4 then 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.240
 when extending a fire of solid material 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.419
 it is necessary 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.479
 make sure de rerum et extinguishing that allows the complete extension also 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.670
 of the embers that are generated 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.849
 from the same little 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.320
 the tvb boundaries instead 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.820
 they are fires of liquids I have of solids 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.040
 which can liquefy 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.150
 and if you naturally have all the alcohols 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.990
 paraffin solvent gasoline 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.589
 kaolinite are all liquid 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:08.760
 what side can burn 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.800
 and therefore and in general potentially a fire 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.460
 what is the peculiarity of these fairs of these types of fires outside of 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.900
 type b from the point of view of extension 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.260
 I had truth is that the liquid moves easily moves with the wind 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.319
 and its move too 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.139
 breakfast of the means we use to pay it off 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.969
 so just a sketch of the flammable liquids that easily allows d 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.309
 the spread of the fire to taxes where before there was therefore not 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:39.900
 particular attention 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.729
 we'll see in a proposal to say cost to when we talked about extension 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.900
 of cooks of materials for in general 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.360
 how another extinguisher armor is used for the extension 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.740
 in the fire itself 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.419
 instead studies of porcini are the fires 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.470
 cheee are gera of the combustion of the gavassa 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.960
 for example methane class gpl 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.960
 Italian post office and then day 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.930
 only pokemon hotels are frequent in the acuita type companies in which it has 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.120
 called inkjet news 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.180
 addressed 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.430
 this course in particular apart from typically 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.070
 grandmother is expected to have this kind of presence 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.499
 d re fuels 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:28.509
 in general 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.099
 and the peculiarity of virus type of fuel that when they are present is 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.139
 need to also evaluate the 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.300
 possibility 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.300
 of the danger of explosion of can arise 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.379
 other ddd fires 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:49.509
 the installed class d fires is stronger than me speak that they can burn 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.410
 of the merits 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.039
 conditions 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.039
 electrical fires that come from electrical equipment 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.839
 is under voltage are classified as few d 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.839
 type l 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.389
 heart type fires 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.590
 and vegetable fats are wally fires and are of interest to ask about tv 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.980
 and cooking then in reality like the example 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.690
 industrial kitchens
