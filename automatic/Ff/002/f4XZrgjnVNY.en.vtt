wanted<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> whole<00:00:51.989> bunch<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.350> them<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
wanted to do a whole bunch of them in

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.400 
wanted to do a whole bunch of them in
your<00:00:53.370> survival<00:00:54.210> world<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.660> whatever<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.230> make

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
your survival world or whatever and make

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.069 
your survival world or whatever and make
a<00:00:55.440> floor<00:00:55.820> that<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.690> hard<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
a floor that would be really hard but

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
a floor that would be really hard but
you<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.620> epically<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.850> basically

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you could epically do it so basically

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.130 
you could epically do it so basically
all<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> gotta<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.489> have<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> cactus<00:01:03.140> these

rid of this clutter here is making it
difficult<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.509> cactus<00:01:24.990> nice

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
difficult so there we go one cactus nice

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.890 
difficult so there we go one cactus nice
and<00:01:25.409> easy<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> put<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.840> there

you<00:02:08.450> know<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:08.990> really<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.770> think<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:10.550> would<00:02:10.670> be

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
you know I really I think it would be

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.120 
you know I really I think it would be
super<00:02:11.180> cool<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.840> were<00:02:11.960> so<00:02:12.500> good<00:02:12.740> at<00:02:12.920> this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
super cool if you were so good at this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.970 
super cool if you were so good at this
whoo<00:02:13.970> there's<00:02:14.420> something<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.500> on<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
whoo there's something going on in the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.810 
whoo there's something going on in the
hood<00:02:17.020> if<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.530> were<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.800> get<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.250> good<00:02:19.490> at<00:02:19.550> this

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
hood if you were to get so good at this

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.610 
hood if you were to get so good at this
that<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.120> made<00:02:20.330> an<00:02:20.450> actual<00:02:20.930> floor<00:02:21.260> out<00:02:21.500> of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
that you made an actual floor out of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.940 
that you made an actual floor out of
beds<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:22.130> know<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.710> certain<00:02:24.710> this

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
beds you know and this is a certain this

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.740 
beds you know and this is a certain this
is<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.130> regular<00:02:25.400> texture<00:02:26.030> pack<00:02:26.210> but<00:02:26.420> if<00:02:26.600> you

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
is the regular texture pack but if you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.330 
is the regular texture pack but if you
had<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> city<00:02:27.200> one<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:27.590> bed<00:02:27.770> would<00:02:27.920> be<00:02:27.950> blue

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
had a city one this bed would be blue

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.370 
had a city one this bed would be blue
and<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.090> could<00:02:29.330> make<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> floor<00:02:29.990> like<00:02:30.320> a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
and you could make a floor like a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.680 
and you could make a floor like a
parquet<00:02:30.980> floor<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.640> don't<00:02:31.940> know<00:02:32.060> how<00:02:32.270> hard<00:02:32.540> it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
parquet floor I don't know how hard it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.910 
parquet floor I don't know how hard it
would<00:02:32.780> be<00:02:32.960> because<00:02:33.080> you'd<00:02:33.320> have<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:33.800> it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
would be because you'd have to do it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.180 
would be because you'd have to do it
next<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> cactus<00:02:34.820> non-stop<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.350> mean<00:02:36.650> if<00:02:36.860> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
next to a cactus non-stop so I mean if I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.370 
next to a cactus non-stop so I mean if I
put<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.550> there<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.150> then<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.540> put<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.930> here

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
put it there and then I put this here

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.890 
put it there and then I put this here
see<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.190> won't<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:40.580> there<00:02:40.850> but<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.270> will<00:02:41.420> here

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
see it won't go there but it will here

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.750 
see it won't go there but it will here
so<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.560> would<00:02:42.710> actually<00:02:42.890> ultimately<00:02:43.220> have<00:02:43.730> to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
so you would actually ultimately have to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.700 
so you would actually ultimately have to
keep<00:02:44.090> doing<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.630> until<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.050> came<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:45.590> you

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
keep doing it until you came but you

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.400 
keep doing it until you came but you
know<00:02:45.830> what<00:02:45.980> honestly<00:02:46.130> would<00:02:46.730> look<00:02:46.910> cool<00:02:47.410> even

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
know what honestly would look cool even

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.670 
know what honestly would look cool even
with<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.860> regular<00:02:49.790> purple<00:02:50.510> around<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.990> but

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
with just regular purple around it but

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.200 
with just regular purple around it but
there<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.950> go<00:02:51.980> guys<00:02:52.310> that's<00:02:52.700> that's<00:02:53.090> pretty

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
there you go guys that's that's pretty

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.480 
there you go guys that's that's pretty
much<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.600> whole<00:02:53.900> reason<00:02:54.410> why<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.680> which<00:02:55.310> is

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
much the whole reason why this which is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.950 
much the whole reason why this which is
cool<00:02:55.730> because<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.210> can<00:02:56.240> fit<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.690> into<00:02:56.840> your

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
cool because you can fit it into your

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.210 
cool because you can fit it into your
stuff<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.530> one<00:02:57.650> thing<00:02:57.830> you're<00:02:57.920> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.070> keep

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
stuff the one thing you're going to keep

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.920 
stuff the one thing you're going to keep
in<00:02:58.340> mind<00:02:58.520> guys<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.330> bed<00:02:59.570> will<00:02:59.750> not

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
in mind guys is that this bed will not

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.660 
in mind guys is that this bed will not
let<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.200> sleep<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.770> it's<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.220> going<00:03:01.550> to
