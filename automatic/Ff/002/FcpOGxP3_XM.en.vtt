need to do it but if you do put the
Allen<00:00:49.110> heads<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> make

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
Allen heads in here you want to make

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.510 
Allen heads in here you want to make
sure<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:52.800> too<00:00:52.860> deep<00:00:53.280> or

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
sure that you do not go too deep or

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.130 
sure that you do not go too deep or
they're<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> touch<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.000> winding<00:00:54.719> if

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
they're going to touch that winding if

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.889 
they're going to touch that winding if
this<00:00:55.440> starts<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> spin<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.750> has

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
this starts to spin on you so this has

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.610 
this starts to spin on you so this has
been<00:00:58.050> loose<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.109> screw<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> off

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
been loose and you just screw it off

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.020 
been loose and you just screw it off
like<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:05.100> take<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> look<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
like that and you take a look at it and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.060 
like that and you take a look at it and
you<00:01:06.119> tell<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.390> no<00:01:07.170> one's<00:01:07.350> touched<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.890> it's

flywheel part and that goes in the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.830 
flywheel part and that goes in the
threads<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:21.810> nice<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.799> numb

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
puller is on and you can get one of

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.980 
puller is on and you can get one of
these<00:02:25.620> off<00:02:25.860> at<00:02:26.010> eBay<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.300> they<00:02:27.480> fit<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> whole

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
these off at eBay and they fit a whole

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.540 
these off at eBay and they fit a whole
bunch<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.440> models<00:02:28.820> we<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.210> flywheel

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
bunch of models we have the flywheel

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.700 
bunch of models we have the flywheel
which<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.730> right<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.380> now<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.440> have<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
which is right here now we have to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.650 
which is right here now we have to
remember<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.190> flywheel<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.910> pressed<00:02:36.330> onto

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
remember that flywheel is pressed onto

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.830 
remember that flywheel is pressed onto
the<00:02:36.990> shaft<00:02:37.700> what<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.790> means<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.240> once<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.690> on

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the shaft what it means is once it's on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.120 
the shaft what it means is once it's on
there<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:41.340> doesn't<00:02:41.670> come<00:02:41.760> off<00:02:41.910> too<00:02:42.090> easy<00:02:42.300> plus

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
there it doesn't come off too easy plus

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.460 
there it doesn't come off too easy plus
the<00:02:44.130> magnets<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.660> flywheel

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the magnets in this flywheel

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.920 
the magnets in this flywheel
it<00:02:46.980> probably<00:02:47.400> weighs<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.940> don't<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.450> good

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
it probably weighs I don't know good

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.150 
it probably weighs I don't know good
three<00:02:49.440> pounds<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.370> more<00:02:50.540> solid<00:02:51.540> steel<00:02:52.040> but<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
three pounds or more solid steel but the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.810 
three pounds or more solid steel but the
magnets<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.910> inside<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:55.820> flywheel

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
magnets on the inside of this flywheel

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.560 
magnets on the inside of this flywheel
right<00:02:57.210> here<00:02:57.420> will<00:02:58.050> stick<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.060> magneto

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
right here will stick to the magneto

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.670 
right here will stick to the magneto
which<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.080> already<00:03:01.290> stuck<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:03.320> inside<00:03:04.320> of

which is already stuck to the inside of
the<00:03:04.770> engine<00:03:04.920> case<00:03:05.250> before<00:03:05.460> we<00:03:05.610> get<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> out<00:03:06.030> so

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
the engine case before we get it out so

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.840 
the engine case before we get it out so
they<00:03:07.620> don't<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:08.100> if<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.580> do<00:03:08.700> this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
they don't know if I can do this

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.170 
they don't know if I can do this
one-handed

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
one-handed

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.090 
one-handed
but<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.300> you'll<00:03:12.480> if<00:03:12.989> you'll<00:03:13.200> notice<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:16.100> what

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
but if you'll if you'll notice here what

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.600 
but if you'll if you'll notice here what
we<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.660> this<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:19.080> part<00:03:19.380> right<00:03:19.530> here<00:03:19.610> hits

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
we do is this this part right here hits

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.060 
we do is this this part right here hits
the<00:03:20.850> shaft<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:22.470> other<00:03:23.250> end<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
the shaft the other end of the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.430 
the shaft the other end of the
crankshaft<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.550> what<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.880> does<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.450> we

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
crankshaft and what it does is we

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.800 
crankshaft and what it does is we
already<00:03:28.620> have<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.100> welded<00:03:30.060> or<00:03:30.180> glued<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
already have it welded or glued to the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.229 
already have it welded or glued to the
flywheel<00:03:31.050> right<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.890> by<00:03:32.640> pushing<00:03:32.970> on

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
flywheel right here and by pushing on

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.680 
flywheel right here and by pushing on
the<00:03:33.300> shaft<00:03:34.370> with<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.640> as<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.150> screw<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.510> in

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
the shaft with this as we screw it in

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.550 
the shaft with this as we screw it in
and<00:03:36.930> screw<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.320> screw<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.739> in<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:39.560> begins

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and screw it and screw it in this begins

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.990 
and screw it and screw it in this begins
to<00:03:40.680> pull<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.760> will<00:03:41.790> snap<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:46.400> flywheel

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.080 

usually<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.090> takes<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.420> lot<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.660> force<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:53.090> do

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
usually it takes a lot of force to do

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.820 
usually it takes a lot of force to do
this<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.510> don't<00:03:54.870> think<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.290> knew<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.560> one-handed

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
this I don't think I knew it one-handed

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.590 
this I don't think I knew it one-handed
it'll<00:03:56.220> take<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> lot<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.760> force<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.450> I'm

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
it'll take a lot of force to do it I'm

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.729 
it'll take a lot of force to do it I'm
gonna<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.930> hold<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.230> flag<00:03:58.560> we'll

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
gonna have to hold this flag we'll

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.130 
gonna have to hold this flag we'll
somehow<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.400> then<00:04:00.180> all<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.690> sudden<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:01.080> will

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
somehow and then all of a sudden it will

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.790 
somehow and then all of a sudden it will
just<00:04:01.290> pop<00:04:01.560> off<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:03.360> gonna<00:04:03.620> hold<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
just pop off so I'm gonna hold the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.009 
just pop off so I'm gonna hold the
flywheel<00:04:05.010> with<00:04:05.970> something<00:04:06.330> over<00:04:06.450> here<00:04:06.780> and

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
flywheel with something over here and

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.390 
flywheel with something over here and
then<00:04:07.140> pop<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:07.530> off<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.680> I'll<00:04:08.010> show<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.250> what

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
then pop it off and I'll show you what

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.450 
then pop it off and I'll show you what
that<00:04:08.430> looks<00:04:08.760> like

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
that looks like

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.559 
that looks like
flywheel<00:04:11.460> is<00:04:11.580> popped<00:04:11.850> off

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
flywheel is popped off

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.979 
flywheel is popped off
I<00:04:13.950> gave<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.099> little<00:04:15.509> screwing<00:04:16.509> right<00:04:16.720> there

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
I gave it a little screwing right there

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.330 
I gave it a little screwing right there
and<00:04:17.289> it<00:04:17.500> forced<00:04:18.310> against<00:04:18.759> the<00:04:18.880> end<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
and it forced against the end of the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.850 
and it forced against the end of the
crankshaft<00:04:21.340> right<00:04:21.789> here<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:23.470> popped<00:04:23.710> it

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
crankshaft right here and it popped it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.219 
crankshaft right here and it popped it
right<00:04:23.889> off<00:04:24.220> but<00:04:25.120> now<00:04:25.330> what<00:04:25.660> we<00:04:25.750> want<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.139> is

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
right off but now what we want to do is

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.200 
right off but now what we want to do is
we<00:04:26.350> want<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.590> look<00:04:26.710> at<00:04:26.860> look<00:04:27.430> at<00:04:27.639> the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
we want to look at look at the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.320 
we want to look at look at the
electronics<00:04:28.780> just<00:04:29.680> where<00:04:29.919> they<00:04:30.039> are<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:31.150> want

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
electronics just where they are we want

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.110 
electronics just where they are we want
to<00:04:31.449> look<00:04:31.539> at<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.810> inside<00:04:32.199> of<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
to look at the inside of the of the

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.480 
to look at the inside of the of the
flywheel<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.259> you<00:04:35.380> can<00:04:35.500> see<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.740> flywheel

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
flywheel and you can see the flywheel

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.249 
flywheel and you can see the flywheel
it's<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.150> heavy<00:04:37.389> little<00:04:37.630> deal<00:04:37.979> except<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:40.259> the

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
it's a heavy little deal except that the

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.200 
it's a heavy little deal except that the
inside<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:42.130> rubber<00:04:42.310> seal<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.820> good<00:04:43.030> on<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
inside the rubber seal is good on the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.480 
inside the rubber seal is good on the
outside<00:04:43.620> but<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.770> inside<00:04:44.800> these<00:04:45.280> are<00:04:45.430> the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
outside but the inside these are the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.270 
outside but the inside these are the
magnets<00:04:45.940> these<00:04:46.120> rust<00:04:46.449> colored<00:04:46.810> things

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
magnets these rust colored things

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.520 
magnets these rust colored things
there's<00:04:48.280> one<00:04:48.610> two<00:04:48.880> three<00:04:49.389> four<00:04:49.750> five<00:04:50.110> six<00:04:50.320> of

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
there's one two three four five six of

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.640 
there's one two three four five six of
them<00:04:50.620> those<00:04:51.430> all<00:04:51.820> should<00:04:52.150> be<00:04:52.360> nice<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:53.050> clean

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
them those all should be nice and clean

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.960 
them those all should be nice and clean
I<00:04:54.270> shot<00:04:55.270> not<00:04:55.539> shiny<00:04:55.960> but<00:04:56.110> no<00:04:56.830> rust<00:04:57.099> on<00:04:57.280> them<00:04:57.430> and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
I shot not shiny but no rust on them and

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.680 
I shot not shiny but no rust on them and
what<00:04:58.900> they<00:04:59.169> do<00:04:59.229> is<00:04:59.680> they<00:04:59.949> circulate<00:05:00.690> around

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
what they do is they circulate around

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:10.010 
what they do is they circulate around
the<00:05:05.190> magnetic<00:05:06.190> pickups<00:05:06.610> on<00:05:07.479> top<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:08.050> these<00:05:08.349> six

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
the magnetic pickups on top of these six

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.909 
the magnetic pickups on top of these six
coils<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> what<00:05:13.060> we<00:05:13.180> have<00:05:13.389> here<00:05:13.419> is<00:05:13.919> basically

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
coils so what we have here is basically

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.810 
coils so what we have here is basically
there's<00:05:15.910> been<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.150> lot<00:05:16.389> of<00:05:16.539> water<00:05:16.780> down<00:05:17.110> in<00:05:17.289> here

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
there's been a lot of water down in here

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.770 
there's been a lot of water down in here
which<00:05:18.820> is<00:05:21.000> not<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.210> best<00:05:24.419> but<00:05:25.419> with<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:25.599> little

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
which is not the best but with a little

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.990 
which is not the best but with a little
Emery<00:05:26.169> cloth<00:05:26.349> I<00:05:26.770> can<00:05:27.099> clean<00:05:27.310> all<00:05:27.460> this<00:05:27.610> up<00:05:27.820> to

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
Emery cloth I can clean all this up to

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.409 
Emery cloth I can clean all this up to
almost<00:05:28.360> brand<00:05:28.810> new<00:05:28.960> looking<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.940> next<00:05:31.210> step

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
almost brand new looking the next step

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:37.200 
almost brand new looking the next step
is<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.840> take<00:05:32.020> out<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:34.150> magneto<00:05:34.919> or<00:05:36.210> alternator

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
is to take out the magneto or alternator

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.110 
is to take out the magneto or alternator
I'm<00:05:37.419> not<00:05:37.570> sure<00:05:37.720> what<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.020> is<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:39.370> that<00:05:39.550> has<00:05:39.849> a

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
I'm not sure what it is and that has a

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.029 
I'm not sure what it is and that has a
little<00:05:43.120> 10<00:05:43.300> millimeter<00:05:43.720> right<00:05:43.900> here<00:05:44.139> a<00:05:44.320> little

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
little 10 millimeter right here a little

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.490 
little 10 millimeter right here a little
10<00:05:45.340> millimeter<00:05:45.789> right<00:05:46.000> there<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.479> then<00:05:47.229> on

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
10 millimeter right there and then on

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.939 
10 millimeter right there and then on
the<00:05:47.830> bottom<00:05:48.250> there<00:05:48.789> is<00:05:49.560> this<00:05:50.560> is<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.770> whole

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
the bottom there is this is a whole

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:51.960 
the bottom there is this is a whole
different<00:05:51.070> unit<00:05:51.460> right<00:05:51.550> here<00:05:51.610> but<00:05:51.849> it's

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
different unit right here but it's

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.290 
different unit right here but it's
connected<00:05:52.150> this<00:05:52.479> is<00:05:52.539> the<00:05:52.750> I<00:05:52.780> unit<00:05:53.139> there<00:05:53.500> that

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
connected this is the I unit there that

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.290 
connected this is the I unit there that
magnetic<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:56.070> something<00:05:57.070> like<00:05:57.219> unit<00:05:57.610> but<00:05:58.150> it's

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
magnetic I something like unit but it's

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.100 
magnetic I something like unit but it's
got<00:05:58.509> one<00:05:59.349> right<00:05:59.620> here<00:05:59.889> and<00:06:00.099> one<00:06:00.580> right<00:06:00.610> here

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
got one right here and one right here

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.240 
got one right here and one right here
now<00:06:02.110> I'm<00:06:02.229> going<00:06:02.349> to<00:06:02.409> see<00:06:02.530> if<00:06:02.590> we<00:06:02.680> can<00:06:02.860> take<00:06:03.070> this

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
now I'm going to see if we can take this

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.060 
now I'm going to see if we can take this
out<00:06:04.139> with<00:06:05.139> my<00:06:05.380> little<00:06:06.060> hammer<00:06:07.060> drill<00:06:08.070> very

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
out with my little hammer drill very

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.860 
out with my little hammer drill very
carefully<00:06:09.729> you<00:06:10.090> don't<00:06:10.240> want<00:06:10.360> to<00:06:10.419> strip<00:06:10.690> these

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
carefully you don't want to strip these

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:19.010 
carefully you don't want to strip these
out<00:06:11.110> either<00:06:12.090> but<00:06:14.669> okay<00:06:15.669> there's<00:06:15.880> one

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.709 

that's<00:06:20.020> two<00:06:20.819> and<00:06:21.819> we'll<00:06:21.939> take<00:06:22.120> those<00:06:22.300> off<00:06:22.479> very

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
that's two and we'll take those off very

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.409 
that's two and we'll take those off very
nicely<00:06:23.969> put<00:06:24.969> those<00:06:25.150> away

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
nicely put those away

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.170

real<00:06:26.050> careful<00:06:26.439> to<00:06:26.469> everything<00:06:26.919> and<00:06:27.189> then

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
real careful to everything and then

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:40.159 
real careful to everything and then
here's<00:06:28.569> the<00:06:28.719> one<00:06:28.900> on<00:06:29.289> the<00:06:29.800> bottom<00:06:29.949> on<00:06:30.280> the<00:06:30.310> eye

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:47.010 

alright<00:06:41.849> so<00:06:42.849> we've<00:06:43.030> taken<00:06:43.180> the<00:06:45.689> the<00:06:46.689> four<00:06:46.900> of

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
alright so we've taken the the four of

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.300 
alright so we've taken the the four of
them<00:06:47.139> out<00:06:47.199> and<00:06:47.259> we<00:06:47.560> gotta<00:06:47.710> remember<00:06:47.860> did<00:06:48.219> these

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
them out and we gotta remember did these

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.459 
them out and we gotta remember did these
black<00:06:48.610> ones<00:06:48.639> are<00:06:49.060> supposed<00:06:49.389> to<00:06:49.509> go<00:06:49.629> back<00:06:49.780> in

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:50.469 
black ones are supposed to go back in

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:51.749 
black ones are supposed to go back in
here<00:06:50.830> and<00:06:50.919> that's<00:06:51.099> for<00:06:51.279> a<00:06:51.310> reason<00:06:51.340> they're

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
here and that's for a reason they're

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.019 
here and that's for a reason they're
hardened<00:06:52.680> so<00:06:53.680> we<00:06:53.800> take<00:06:53.979> those<00:06:54.159> put<00:06:54.789> them<00:06:54.879> in<00:06:54.969> a

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:55.029 
hardened so we take those put them in a

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.369 
hardened so we take those put them in a
little<00:06:55.180> ish<00:06:56.189> and<00:06:57.189> come<00:06:57.370> back<00:06:57.490> out<00:06:57.699> here<00:06:57.729> and

00:06:58.369 --> 00:06:58.379 
little ish and come back out here and

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:03.269 
little ish and come back out here and
all<00:06:59.379> of<00:06:59.620> this<00:06:59.740> should<00:06:59.949> fall<00:07:00.189> away<00:07:01.169> by<00:07:02.279> pulling

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279 
all of this should fall away by pulling

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.610 
all of this should fall away by pulling
this<00:07:03.430> out<00:07:03.639> very<00:07:04.300> easily<00:07:04.509> if<00:07:04.870> it's<00:07:05.020> not<00:07:05.199> rusted

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
this out very easily if it's not rusted

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.119 
this out very easily if it's not rusted
sometimes<00:07:06.569> there<00:07:07.569> is<00:07:07.750> rust<00:07:10.650> right<00:07:11.650> down<00:07:11.949> in

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:12.129 
sometimes there is rust right down in

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:14.939 
sometimes there is rust right down in
there<00:07:12.340> and<00:07:12.909> that<00:07:13.599> gets<00:07:13.870> on<00:07:14.080> the<00:07:14.259> case<00:07:14.500> and<00:07:14.800> it's

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:14.949 
there and that gets on the case and it's

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:17.550 
there and that gets on the case and it's
hard<00:07:15.219> to<00:07:15.279> get<00:07:15.400> out<00:07:15.629> that<00:07:16.629> the<00:07:16.779> I<00:07:16.810> should<00:07:16.960> come

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
hard to get out that the I should come

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:27.149 
hard to get out that the I should come
out<00:07:18.150> here<00:07:21.330> then<00:07:22.330> ya<00:07:25.469> see<00:07:26.469> why<00:07:26.680> that's<00:07:26.919> not

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:27.159 
out here then ya see why that's not

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:30.290 
out here then ya see why that's not
coming<00:07:27.430> out<00:07:27.550> as<00:07:27.699> easy

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:38.189 

oh<00:07:34.949> god<00:07:35.949> there's<00:07:36.639> a<00:07:36.759> little<00:07:37.029> rubber<00:07:37.180> dust<00:07:37.900> boot

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 
oh god there's a little rubber dust boot

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:41.579 
oh god there's a little rubber dust boot
right<00:07:38.680> down<00:07:38.860> here<00:07:39.099> it<00:07:39.789> slides<00:07:40.180> out<00:07:40.479> just<00:07:41.409> like

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:41.589 
right down here it slides out just like
