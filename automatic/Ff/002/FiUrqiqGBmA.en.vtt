00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 regina volpato here wants to know that here 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.390
 In São Paulo, you 're out of São Paulo. 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.910
 paulo anyway if your municipality does not have 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.710
 subway here in são paulo is the best 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.269
 way people get around 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.280
 here in the capital is a methodology of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 level has already walked a lot and subway walk 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.390
 I have walked a lot and even today because in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.250
 some places here in São Paulo 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.830
 I think it's more advantageous 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 smart and subway than by car 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 beyond which we collaborate with the environment 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.199
 environment with broadcast arrives hard you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.980
 You know who to give the stations are 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.080
 very few 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 It's true, it's not too close either. 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.469
 there's just subway it's true you know that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.510
 at the time of my house until the avenue 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.250
 São Paulo comes from my house to the avenue 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.870
 Paulista of car takes more or less 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.640
 half an hour 40 minutes passed with 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.340
 Transits more or less or less 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.750
 underground water I did the math and it is said 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.680
 that I went I took the subway from the bar 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.840
 founded and went to São Paulo more or less 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 20 minutes, so much faster. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.170
 now why are you talking about all this? 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.300
 because we're this blah blah blah 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.609
 Well it's not so bla bla bla so not 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 because we are going to talk about a crime every 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.110
 increasingly common on the subway just here 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.540
 in São Paulo 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.439
 Look at the victims are usually the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.180
 women 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.790
 and the fuller the wagons 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 the greater the chance of cases occurring 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.330
 just look at this number from the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.939
 metro police 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.270
 since the beginning of the year, 91 cases 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.909
 harassment and sexual abuse were recorded 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.880
 in number which must be much larger 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.790
 regina because many victims prefer 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 do not denounce ashamed to expose yourself to 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 Our reporter Ana Paula Abra talked 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 with some women who went through 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 very embarrassing situations 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.149
 Look, just do not stop to think about the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.000
 number of people circulating all 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.600
 the days at the subway stations in the city 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 from Sao Paulo 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 on working days are approximately 3 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 millions of users 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.590
 it's a lot of people 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.520
 in the wagons a damn difficult grip up 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.060
 breathing but this daily battle can 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.420
 reserve far more unpleasant moments 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.430
 from 6 am to 9 am at 5 pm 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.739
 seven night period comprising the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.690
 famous subway peak time 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.610
 It is at this time that many women 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.650
 over the stairs that give access to 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.410
 one of the main public transport 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.020
 should be aware that a 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.260
 simple way to work can 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.930
 meaning a trauma a lifetime is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.300
 this 24-year-old student who does not want 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.910
 be identified still tries to 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.980
 recover from the nightmare that has 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.410
 approximately one month 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.230
 she was a victim of sexual abuse when 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 I was on my way to work at 7 o'clock 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.170
 the morning he arrived the port dominated 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.110
 toulon 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.239
 it has to be by this evil leaned on the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.140
 body was not a little in the much that I 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.530
 took to fighting in the rivers as in the limit 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.410
 Sunday in the face and looked into my eye and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.260
 a stare that annoyed in tone 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.959
 ironic way the student says no 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.170
 felt any kind of physical contact and 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.590
 only when getting off at the station if you came across 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.170
 with the embarrassing situation in a 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.040
 possible film consulted on watering 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.290
 tirol 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.840
 I asked with the other employee's 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.450
 and they took in nearly 16 million 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.359
 like flood clothes in the country 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.890
 some possession did not make or defend the 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.650
 Conjure phishing 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.480
 the young victim of abuse now moves a 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.870
 action of moral damages against the company 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.519
 which manages the São Paulo subway and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.870
 got scared to get caught 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.239
 again subway 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.140
 I'm afraid I did not stay, I get 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.750
 but his avoid the time tuca another 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.459
 by Christina found environment that 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.820
 you have to get closer to 13 women 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.130
 that the victor painter pronounced his bucket 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.690
 with man just as it happened with 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.850
 this student 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.370
 Have you ever imagined that it can also be 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.959
 victim of such a situation. 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.710
 Thank God nothing happened to me. 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.160
 I do not know what I would do. 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.350
 What happened if I needed to 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.260
 I do not know, maybe I'd use it on my elbow to 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.270
 hit somebody's stomach do not know is 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.360
 that we are a bit embarrassed is not 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.000
 because you do not know what happens but has 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.160
 that make some occurrence sometimes more 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.860
 happened enough with me from here 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.990
 little you will see flagrant abuse 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.020
 that occurred with women within the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.020
 subway and an account of one more victim 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.400
 I think the rookie disgusted the girl 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.860
 against looks at that dimension but I can 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.720
 afford me the luxury of riding the subway when 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.640
 I want at weekends, the people. 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.100
 take the subway every day to work and 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.720
 go through this douglas camargo situation 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.430
 it's not amazing his business 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.960
 because because you usually get 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.150
 peak time the subway 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.580
 Who do you pick your state from in your city? 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.430
 who is not afraid but has buses imagine 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.070
 Only the bus leaves your city and time 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.630
 of a crowded peak like a can of 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.120
 sardine the subway is only worse is that everything 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.950
 world had no title attached to it, right? 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.080
 Unfortunately I do not think it happens in the 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.330
 subway should happen on the bus on the train 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.010
 in all that is place the report 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.810
 we will continue to see the second part 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.080
 of the report in a moment because they are 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.140
 scenes that were recorded are flagrant 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.250
 look at the woman who gives a rage or 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.250
 schedule a rage
