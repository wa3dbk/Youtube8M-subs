out and then we'll get this one right
here<00:02:36.700> regeneration<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.790> pre<00:02:38.000> level<00:02:38.299> 1<00:02:38.480> it's

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
here regeneration of pre level 1 it's

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.050 
here regeneration of pre level 1 it's
gonna<00:02:39.170> be<00:02:39.290> pretty<00:02:39.409> slow<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:39.739> we'll<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.909> it
