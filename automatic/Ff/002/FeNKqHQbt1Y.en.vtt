a little bit into this bowl and I'm
actually<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.410> bowl<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.980> my

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
actually going to use this bowl as my

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.090 
actually going to use this bowl as my
mixing<00:00:35.790> bowl<00:00:36.230> into<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
mixing bowl into here I'm just going to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.389 
mixing bowl into here I'm just going to
add<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> half<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.969> tablespoon<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.989> oil<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
add a half a tablespoon of oil now that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.610 
add a half a tablespoon of oil now that
might<00:00:41.550> seem<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.210> quite<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.930> little<00:00:43.260> amount

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
might seem like quite a little amount

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
might seem like quite a little amount
but<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.250> remember<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.360> nuts<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.840> going

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
but do remember that the nuts are going

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
but do remember that the nuts are going
to<00:00:46.200> emit<00:00:46.559> their<00:00:46.829> own<00:00:47.039> oil<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:48.000> begin<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
to emit their own oil as they begin to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
to emit their own oil as they begin to
heat<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.620> we're<00:00:49.800> actually<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> put

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
heat and we're actually going to put

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
heat and we're actually going to put
them<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.449> oven<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.530> heat<00:00:52.770> will

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
them in the oven so the heat will

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.790 
them in the oven so the heat will
release<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> nuts<00:00:54.120> themselves<00:00:54.800> also

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
release out of the nuts themselves also

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
release out of the nuts themselves also
if<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.430> too<00:00:56.640> much<00:00:56.850> oil<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> nuts

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
if you have too much oil in the nuts

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
if you have too much oil in the nuts
then<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.530> flavors<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.340> add<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> these

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
then the flavors that we add to these

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630 
then the flavors that we add to these
will<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.899> begin<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.370> drop<00:01:02.370> out<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
will then just begin to drop out a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
will then just begin to drop out a
little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.539> important<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
little bit so it's important that the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.429 
little bit so it's important that the
oil<00:01:04.860> ratio<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.450> sort<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:07.110> low

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
oil ratio is actually sort of very low

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.980 
oil ratio is actually sort of very low
quantity<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> oil<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.030> spices<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> we

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
quantity of oil to the spices that we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
quantity of oil to the spices that we
add<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> hear<00:01:11.460> i'm<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> add<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
add so to hear i'm going to add a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.740 
add so to hear i'm going to add a
teaspoon<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:14.070> under<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> teaspoon<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.420> salt

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
it takes a little bit of time because
the<00:02:03.180> oil<00:02:03.210> has<00:02:03.810> sunk<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.380> bottom<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.829> don't

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the oil has sunk to the bottom I don't

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.200 
the oil has sunk to the bottom I don't
know<00:02:05.070> whether<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.399> see<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.759> but

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
know whether you can see that but

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.600 
know whether you can see that but
there's<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.990> little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.350> oil<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.550> we

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
there's a little bit of oil here now we

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.080 
there's a little bit of oil here now we
want<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.810> spread<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.770> over<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.280> nuts

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
want that to be spread all over the nuts

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.290 
want that to be spread all over the nuts
and<00:02:12.500> if<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.620> find<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.069> actually<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.180> know

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and if you find that actually you know

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.910 
and if you find that actually you know
the<00:02:15.450> spoon<00:02:15.810> method<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> little<00:02:16.800> bit

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the spoon method is a little bit

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
the spoon method is a little bit
ineffective<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.970> actually<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.750> afraid

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
ineffective and actually don't be afraid

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320 
ineffective and actually don't be afraid
to<00:02:19.110> get<00:02:19.440> your<00:02:19.470> hands<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.160> there<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.730> really

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
to get your hands in there and really

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.180 
to get your hands in there and really
move<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.750> around<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.379> by<00:02:22.560> doing<00:02:22.620> so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
move it around because by doing so

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.309 
move it around because by doing so
you're<00:02:23.819> actually<00:02:24.030> rubbing<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.840> lot<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
you're actually rubbing a lot of the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.180 
you're actually rubbing a lot of the
