00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.580 
I thought with this promotion to captain
that<00:02:13.940> I'd<00:02:14.060> gotten<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.450> bit<00:02:14.630> closer<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.110> my<00:02:15.350> goal

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
that I'd gotten a bit closer to my goal

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.949

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
but I have to face the fact that the law

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.930 
but I have to face the fact that the law
can't<00:02:18.260> even<00:02:18.500> punish<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> single<00:02:19.310> person<00:02:19.760> like

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
can't even punish a single person like
