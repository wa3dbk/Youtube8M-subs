edge on this one is great so if you

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.880 
edge on this one is great so if you
don't<00:00:18.660> want<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> stretch<00:00:19.109> too<00:00:19.439> much<00:00:19.619> that

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
short but it's for demonstration

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of a tail end to weave in so you put

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
with your working yarn over this way

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.590 
with your working yarn over this way
what<00:00:41.280> you're<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.570> through

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
what you're going to do is go through

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.660 
what you're going to do is go through
the<00:00:43.230> first<00:00:43.559> Slipknot<00:00:44.520> stitch<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.690> knit

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
the first Slipknot stitch as if to knit

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.720 
the first Slipknot stitch as if to knit
pull<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:49.399> new<00:00:50.399> loop<00:00:50.899> make<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.020> big<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.730> slip

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
pull up a new loop make it big and slip

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
pull up a new loop make it big and slip
it<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> end<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> needle<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.530> this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it on to the end of the needle so this

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.209 
it on to the end of the needle so this
is<00:00:56.340> very<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> knitted<00:00:57.270> cast<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is very like a knitted cast on but a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
is very like a knitted cast on but a
little<00:00:59.730> more<00:00:59.910> sturdy<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.750> you're

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
little more sturdy because what you're

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
little more sturdy because what you're
going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.530> instead<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.280> through

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
going to do is instead of going through

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
going to do is instead of going through
this<00:01:02.879> next<00:01:03.090> stitch<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> knit<00:01:03.870> you're

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this next stitch as if to knit you're

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.179 
this next stitch as if to knit you're
going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.100> between<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:06.060> stitches<00:01:07.189> from

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
going to go between these stitches from

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
going to go between these stitches from
front<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> back<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.030> you've<00:01:09.390> got<00:01:09.630> needle

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
front to back so you've got needle

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
front to back so you've got needle
touching<00:01:11.430> needle<00:01:11.850> between<00:01:12.780> those<00:01:13.110> two

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
touching needle between those two

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.050 
touching needle between those two
stitches<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.549> snug<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
stitches and when you snug up the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.090 
stitches and when you snug up the
working<00:01:15.360> yarn<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.990> keeps<00:01:16.439> these<00:01:16.650> needles<00:01:17.009> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
working yarn it keeps these needles in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
working yarn it keeps these needles in
place<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> let<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
place so like I can let go of it and it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
place so like I can let go of it and it
stays<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.560> I've<00:01:19.680> snugged<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.210> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
stays there because I've snugged it so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.670 
stays there because I've snugged it so
you're<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> wrap<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.080> yarn<00:01:22.320> around

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you're going to wrap your yarn around

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
you're going to wrap your yarn around
that<00:01:23.070> bottom<00:01:23.310> needle<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.830> pull<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.670> loop

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that bottom needle and pull up a loop

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.980 
that bottom needle and pull up a loop
between<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.229> two<00:01:28.770> stitches<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.570> there's<00:01:30.840> your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
between the two stitches so there's your

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.350 
between the two stitches so there's your
new<00:01:31.170> loop<00:01:31.350> make<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> big<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> end

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
new loop make it big put it on the end

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.230 
new loop make it big put it on the end
of<00:01:33.540> your<00:01:33.810> left<00:01:34.020> hand<00:01:34.110> needle<00:01:34.460> slip<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.850> right

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
of your left hand needle slip your right

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
of your left hand needle slip your right
hand<00:01:36.479> needle<00:01:36.630> between<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.650> new<00:01:37.890> loop<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
hand needle between that new loop and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.300 
hand needle between that new loop and
the<00:01:38.430> old<00:01:38.640> loop<00:01:38.880> before<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.140> snug<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:43.310> so

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the old loop before you snug it up so

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.130 
the old loop before you snug it up so
once<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.729> snug<00:01:47.390> you're<00:01:48.390> gonna<00:01:48.540> wrap<00:01:48.810> again

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
once it's snug you're gonna wrap again

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
once it's snug you're gonna wrap again
and<00:01:50.180> pull<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.689> new<00:01:52.290> loop<00:01:52.500> between<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.369> two

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and pull up a new loop between the two

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.929 
and pull up a new loop between the two
so<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:55.219> bit<00:01:56.219> awkward<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
so it's a little bit awkward of a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.280 
so it's a little bit awkward of a
movement<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:57.990> different

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
movement because it's very different

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.100 
movement because it's very different
from<00:01:58.680> our<00:01:58.890> normal<00:01:58.920> knitting<00:01:59.729> movement<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
from our normal knitting movement you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.630 
from our normal knitting movement you
want<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> make<00:02:01.590> sure<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.100> keep<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
want to make sure that you keep the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.010 
want to make sure that you keep the
needles<00:02:03.409> perpendicular<00:02:05.540> until<00:02:06.540> you've<00:02:06.750> got

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
needles perpendicular until you've got

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:21.380 
needles perpendicular until you've got
that<00:02:07.200> new<00:02:07.530> stitch<00:02:08.190> pulled<00:02:08.580> up

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.850 

so<00:02:22.110> once<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.220> get<00:02:23.430> used<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.260> new

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
so once you get used to it the the new

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.080 
so once you get used to it the the new
loop<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> pull<00:02:26.460> up<00:02:26.580> doesn't<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:26.970> to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
loop that you pull up doesn't have to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.730 
loop that you pull up doesn't have to
get<00:02:27.180> too<00:02:27.420> big<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.080> don't<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.530> make

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
get too big you don't have to like make

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.620 
get too big you don't have to like make
it<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:29.100> big<00:02:29.430> because<00:02:30.180> you're<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.510> gonna

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
it this big because you're just gonna

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.140 
it this big because you're just gonna
end<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:30.990> having<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.410> Snug<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.740> back<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.340> all

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
end up having to Snug that back up all

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.240 
end up having to Snug that back up all
that<00:02:33.300> excess<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:35.550> once<00:02:36.240> you've<00:02:36.480> got<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
that excess so once you've got the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.950 
that excess so once you've got the
number<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.640> stitches<00:02:38.910> cast<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.660> see

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
number of stitches cast on you can see

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.370 
number of stitches cast on you can see
that<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.740> makes<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:41.160> nice<00:02:41.400> twisted<00:02:42.150> edge

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
that it makes this nice twisted edge

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.460 
that it makes this nice twisted edge
along<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.440> bottom<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:45.050> be<00:02:46.050> careful

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
along the bottom and just be careful

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.290 
along the bottom and just be careful
because<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.950> last<00:02:47.220> stitch<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.910> you've<00:02:48.060> cast

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
because the last stitch that you've cast

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.320 
because the last stitch that you've cast
on<00:02:48.540> kind<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.530> overlaps<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.520> tight<00:02:50.820> likes<00:02:51.180> to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
on kind of overlaps it tight likes to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.720 
on kind of overlaps it tight likes to
overlap<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.200> previous<00:02:52.680> stitch<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.520> just

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
overlap with the previous stitch so just

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.220 
overlap with the previous stitch so just
make<00:02:53.850> sure<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.209> work<00:02:54.360> those<00:02:54.570> two<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:54.959> two

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
make sure that you work those two as two

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.480 
make sure that you work those two as two
separate<00:02:55.530> stitches<00:02:55.890> or<00:02:56.010> you'll<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.310> one

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
separate stitches or you'll be one

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.250 
separate stitches or you'll be one
stitch<00:02:56.760> short<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.930> that's<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.650> cable<00:02:58.920> cast<00:02:59.100> on
