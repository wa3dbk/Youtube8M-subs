to shoot in because there are certain
ways<00:00:49.110> rethinking<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> markers<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.730> stuff

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
ways rethinking it markers on your stuff

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.650 
ways rethinking it markers on your stuff
it's<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.690> very<00:00:51.960> common<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.390> yeah<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.570> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it's not very common and yeah but this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
it's not very common and yeah but this
is<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> perfect<00:00:55.140> example<00:00:55.170> shotguns<00:00:55.949> aren't

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
is a perfect example shotguns aren't

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.650 
is a perfect example shotguns aren't
doing<00:00:56.309> shit<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> me

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this is round one but later on the video

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
this is round one but later on the video
you'll<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.230> gets<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.710> intense

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219

at this point I'm on level 79 and I
can't<00:01:49.830> really<00:01:49.920> handle<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> had<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> quit<00:01:51.120> out

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
and let me know how far you made it

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.520

because this is as far as I ever made I
only<00:02:01.830> done<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.190> once<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.550> twice<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.150> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
