00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 an idea in the head and one in the hands 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.580
 may seem strange but at the end of the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.330
 certain is what this painter and craftsman 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.460
 anders with does in the last ten years 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.369
 transforms waste material into art and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.010
 utilities old tires that fatally 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.130
 they would go to the trash they saw raw material 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.250
 for the production of decorative objects 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.830
 how are these flower shops? and the best is that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.769
 Anderson teaches to work this kind of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.100
 free stuff at the plant of being 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.920
 next to the brazilian college 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.899
 how does the course take place? 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 course happens Monday to Friday 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.829
 match against the 8:30 commercial 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.829
 afternoon 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.809
 we work with different types of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.020
 tire material is recycled material is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.879
 in fact it is our idea is 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.120
 reuse of materials as 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.829
 time the person can only produce a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 material for example by taking a tire from 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.930
 car 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.930
 I believe that the person can make a 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.869
 month and a half of practice here in the workshop 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.689
 That's the time that it's cool for now. 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.490
 is producing at home anderson says 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.710
 anyone can learn the technique 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.290
 of object transformation 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.990
 just have the disposition and use the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.799
 creativity and he explains what the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.900
 inspires the production of art and 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.970
 utilities where they will have this 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.140
 reuse of materials 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.600
 ecological idea has been widespread 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.150
 So much expression in this is the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.450
 people can come here is to understand the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.310
 here does not have to be 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.829
 develop work the tire for example 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.100
 a subject wants to see discarded there and 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.479
 take to their residences I believe that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 the community will gain from this 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.290
 inspiration is doing something for the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.570
 community 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 the tires can be used in ideas 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.590
 This creative as a tire 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.290
 truck with strips of scrap tires 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.690
 they will turn that into a pula-pula 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.349
 totally useful in education classes 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.800
 physical activity or even for the 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.220
 at home 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.980
 gaza a group of people there in 1993 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.770
 intended to think about the issues 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.720
 environmental conditions in a manner 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.940
 more artistic way more playful 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.070
 then these people gathered to 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.440
 best organized way to make a 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.750
 work through an association then 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.640
 the association was founded to work 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.500
 values of environmental education and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 development sustainability 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.570
 sustainable through art was a group 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.760
 promotes some actions of 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.100
 environmental education in the park 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.470
 It was then in this context that 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.710
 that the association was already thinking about 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.630
 this mentality of having a better world 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.240
 to have a sustainable world where 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.430
 consumption was reduced if we could 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.920
 take advantage of things then from the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.970
 We had already started this dust with 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.770
