11th ounce fills and mix them in with
the<00:00:59.109> 12-ounce<00:00:59.559> films<00:00:59.979> so<00:01:00.159> that<00:01:00.309> every<00:01:00.609> sixpack

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
the 12-ounce films so that every sixpack

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.989 
the 12-ounce films so that every sixpack
average<00:01:01.690> 12<00:01:02.079> ounces<00:01:02.440> per<00:01:02.679> bottle<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.819> we're

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
average 12 ounces per bottle so we're

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.060 
average 12 ounces per bottle so we're
kind<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.269> all<00:01:04.420> over<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.750> map<00:01:04.839> down<00:01:05.740> here<00:01:05.950> you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
kind of all over the map down here you

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.459 
kind of all over the map down here you
can<00:01:06.250> see<00:01:06.490> some<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.630> bigger<00:01:07.810> bottles<00:01:08.259> that

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
can see some of the bigger bottles that

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.300 
can see some of the bigger bottles that
we<00:01:08.850> started<00:01:09.850> doing<00:01:09.969> it<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.110> late<00:01:11.350> 90s<00:01:11.950> you

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
we started doing it in the late 90s you

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.080 
we started doing it in the late 90s you
know<00:01:12.340> we<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:13.079> handstamped<00:01:14.079> every<00:01:14.409> bottle<00:01:14.860> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
know we I handstamped every bottle of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.740 
know we I handstamped every bottle of
120<00:01:16.090> minute<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:17.110> first<00:01:17.380> year<00:01:17.770> we<00:01:17.920> which<00:01:18.460> was

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
120 minute the first year we which was

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.980 
120 minute the first year we which was
2003<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.899> guess<00:01:20.259> that<00:01:20.560> we<00:01:20.649> started<00:01:21.070> doing<00:01:21.990> 120

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
2003 I guess that we started doing 120

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.249 
2003 I guess that we started doing 120
minute<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:23.500> bottles<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.240> then<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:25.840> got<00:01:25.990> beers

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
minute in bottles and then you got beers

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.069 
minute in bottles and then you got beers
like<00:01:26.439> I<00:01:26.500> painted<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.520> noble<00:01:27.850> rot<00:01:28.030> bottle<00:01:28.810> the

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
like I painted the noble rot bottle the

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.429 
like I painted the noble rot bottle the

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
soon it was cool that once we could

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.690
