00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
now they're looking like this I just put

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.969 
now they're looking like this I just put
a<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.579> cheese<00:01:06.090> pump<00:01:06.509> or<00:01:06.890> little<00:01:07.890> mesh<00:01:08.840> and

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
a little cheese pump or little mesh and

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.719 
a little cheese pump or little mesh and
I<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.280> let<00:01:11.490> them<00:01:11.520> again<00:01:12.329> drain<00:01:13.460> now<00:01:14.460> you'll

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I just let them again drain now you'll

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.059 
I just let them again drain now you'll
begin<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.270> these<00:01:15.749> little<00:01:15.990> tails<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:17.009> are

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
begin to see these little tails that are

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.929 
begin to see these little tails that are
throwing<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> water<00:01:19.319> actually<00:01:19.939> activated

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
throwing so the water actually activated

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.679 
throwing so the water actually activated
the<00:01:21.060> protein<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> B<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> B<00:01:24.420> now

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the protein in the B and so the B now

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.129 
the protein in the B and so the B now
has<00:01:24.929> little<00:01:25.229> tails<00:01:25.670> there<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.509> fortified

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
has little tails there is your fortified

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:32.809 
has little tails there is your fortified
protein<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.359> then<00:01:30.359> what<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.819> that

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
protein and then what we can do is that

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.789 
protein and then what we can do is that
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.929> creative<00:01:34.319> with

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you can get very creative with

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.489 
you can get very creative with
seasonings<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.090> add<00:01:36.359> lime<00:01:36.810> juice<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
seasonings you can add lime juice on it

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:41.349 
seasonings you can add lime juice on it
among<00:01:38.039> these<00:01:38.249> or<00:01:38.609> lemon<00:01:39.030> juice<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.469> add

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
among these or lemon juice you can add

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.169 
among these or lemon juice you can add
cayenne<00:01:42.359> pepper<00:01:43.009> paprika<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.030> do

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
cayenne pepper paprika you can do

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.139 
cayenne pepper paprika you can do
whatever<00:01:45.359> you<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.229> added<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.829> little

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
whatever you want I added a little

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.389 
whatever you want I added a little
shredded<00:01:48.149> organic<00:01:48.929> coconut<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:50.219> a<00:01:50.249> little

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
shredded organic coconut for a little

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.599 
shredded organic coconut for a little
sweetness<00:01:50.819> and<00:01:51.529> so<00:01:52.529> this<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.249> final

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
sweetness and so this is the final

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.029 
sweetness and so this is the final
product<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.209> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.539> see<00:01:54.779> and<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:56.009> you

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
product as you can see and when you

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.039 
product as you can see and when you
actually<00:01:56.459> taste<00:01:56.999> them<00:01:57.389> they're<00:01:57.749> crunchy

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
actually taste them they're crunchy

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.880 
actually taste them they're crunchy
obviously<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.959> they<00:02:00.959> have<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.409> kick

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
obviously and they have a little kick

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.250 
obviously and they have a little kick
today<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.390> seasoned<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:03.990> up

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
today because I really seasoned them up

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.100 
today because I really seasoned them up
so<00:02:05.010> what<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.370> can<00:02:05.550> do<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> add<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.540> two

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so what you can do is add these two

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.240 
so what you can do is add these two
vegetables<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:08.280> pasta<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.390> rice<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:11.009> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
vegetables to pasta to rice it's just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.690 
vegetables to pasta to rice it's just
another<00:02:11.640> alternative<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:13.170> protein<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.520> we

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
another alternative for protein so we

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.670 
another alternative for protein so we
all<00:02:14.819> get<00:02:15.060> tired<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> same<00:02:15.930> old<00:02:16.200> protein

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
all get tired of the same old protein

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.730 
all get tired of the same old protein
foods<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.520> eat<00:02:17.870> however<00:02:18.870> good<00:02:19.260> i<00:02:19.440> love
