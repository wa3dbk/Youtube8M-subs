impact<00:01:18.390> resistant<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.650> will<00:01:19.860> actually

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
impact resistant so this will actually

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
impact resistant so this will actually
add<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.939> only<00:01:20.970> will<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:21.990> add<00:01:22.140> scratch

while I'm operating the camera but we'll

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.970 
while I'm operating the camera but we'll
try<00:03:00.420> our<00:03:00.630> best<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:03.030> may<00:03:03.180> take<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> few<00:03:03.600> tries

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
don't rush and if you accumulate some

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.840 
don't rush and if you accumulate some
dust<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> sticker<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.550> try<00:03:11.790> to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
dust there is a sticker you can try to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.760 
dust there is a sticker you can try to
get<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> best<00:03:12.900> off<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.350> way<00:03:15.560> okay<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.620> you

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
get the best off that way okay so you

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.890 
get the best off that way okay so you
want<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:16.980> try<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.160> get<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.519> as<00:03:17.760> close<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
want to try to get this as close to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.540 
want to try to get this as close to
perfect<00:03:19.170> as<00:03:19.410> possible<00:03:19.890> before<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.190> put<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.489> on

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
perfect as possible before you put it on

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.400 
perfect as possible before you put it on
because<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.360> kind<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.780> difficult<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
because it is kind of difficult to

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.470 
because it is kind of difficult to
remove<00:03:22.709> once<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.670> get<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> set<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.330> would

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
remove once you get it set but I would

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.870 
remove once you get it set but I would
suggest<00:03:24.630> probably<00:03:24.959> not<00:03:25.470> using<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.580> speaker

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
suggest probably not using the speaker

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.550 
suggest probably not using the speaker
as<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> guide<00:03:27.420> but<00:03:27.690> rather<00:03:27.900> using<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.410> home

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
as a guide but rather using the home

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.320 
as a guide but rather using the home
button<00:03:28.890> I'll<00:03:29.280> try<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.550> correct<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.000> later

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
button I'll try to correct this later

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.690 
button I'll try to correct this later
but<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.950> sake<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> video<00:03:32.250> will<00:03:32.550> just

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
but for the sake of the video will just

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.759 
but for the sake of the video will just
continue<00:03:32.970> now<00:03:33.750> what<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.019> want<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.200> do<00:03:34.320> next<00:03:34.470> is
