00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.990 
like that and yeah let's see how the
movies<00:03:25.040> gonna<00:03:25.100> go<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.610> if<00:03:25.760> they're<00:03:25.910> gonna

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
movies gonna go and if they're gonna

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.270 
movies gonna go and if they're gonna
make<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.209> franchise<00:03:26.690> out<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.080> i<00:03:27.380> would<00:03:28.040> say

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
make a franchise out of that i would say

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.910 
make a franchise out of that i would say
go<00:03:28.550> for<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.810> if<00:03:30.080> they're<00:03:30.410> going<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.709> be<00:03:30.890> a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
go for it but if they're going to be a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.240 
go for it but if they're going to be a
fight<00:03:31.730> between<00:03:31.970> him<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.600> godzilla<00:03:33.440> if<00:03:33.830> i

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
fight between him and godzilla if i

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.420 
fight between him and godzilla if i
would<00:03:34.489> be<00:03:34.940> into<00:03:35.239> that<00:03:35.269> um<00:03:35.750> yeah<00:03:36.440> definitely<00:03:37.190> i

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
would be into that um yeah definitely i

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.670 
would be into that um yeah definitely i
mean<00:03:37.640> if<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.880> makes<00:03:38.060> sense<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.570> course<00:03:38.810> only<00:03:39.380> if

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
mean if it makes sense of course only if

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.340 
mean if it makes sense of course only if
it<00:03:39.890> makes<00:03:40.100> sense<00:03:40.430> if<00:03:40.760> King<00:03:41.450> Kong<00:03:41.750> takes<00:03:42.080> place

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
it makes sense if King Kong takes place

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.370 
it makes sense if King Kong takes place
back<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.980> 30s<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:43.970> 40s<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.690> King<00:03:45.170> Kong

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
back in the 30s and 40s and King Kong

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.500 
back in the 30s and 40s and King Kong
takes<00:03:45.650> place<00:03:45.890> in<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.100> modern<00:03:46.459> time<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:46.940> don't

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
takes place in a modern time I don't

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.880 
takes place in a modern time I don't
think<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.750> gonna<00:03:47.870> make<00:03:48.050> it<00:03:48.170> too<00:03:48.350> much<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> lot<00:03:48.739> of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
think is gonna make it too much a lot of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.430 
think is gonna make it too much a lot of
sense<00:03:49.100> because<00:03:49.370> King<00:03:49.640> Kong<00:03:49.850> dies<00:03:50.209> at<00:03:50.959> that

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
sense because King Kong dies at that

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.009 
sense because King Kong dies at that
time<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:53.060> don't<00:03:53.480> think<00:03:53.630> it's<00:03:53.720> gonna<00:03:53.840> make<00:03:53.959> a

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
time so I don't think it's gonna make a

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.110 
time so I don't think it's gonna make a
whole<00:03:54.290> lot<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.500> sense<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:55.070> we'll<00:03:55.820> see<00:03:56.090> how

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
whole lot of sense but we'll see how

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.430 
whole lot of sense but we'll see how
they're<00:03:56.420> gonna<00:03:56.510> do<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.840> maybe<00:03:57.019> they'll<00:03:57.260> make

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
they're gonna do it maybe they'll make

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.370 
they're gonna do it maybe they'll make
it<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.590> modern<00:03:57.769> King<00:03:58.730> Kong<00:03:58.940> movie<00:03:59.300> then<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.750> guess

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
it a modern King Kong movie then I guess

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.990 
it a modern King Kong movie then I guess
that<00:04:00.560> could<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.739> cool<00:04:01.040> but<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.730> each<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.910> its

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that could be cool but to each of its

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.150 
that could be cool but to each of its
own<00:04:02.150> let's<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.140> what<00:04:03.260> its<00:04:03.350> gonna<00:04:03.410> happen<00:04:03.860> are

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470

director of this movie i seen attack the
block<00:04:36.500> um<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.760> think<00:04:38.180> it's<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.360> really<00:04:38.570> really

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
block um I think it's a really really

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.469 
block um I think it's a really really
good<00:04:39.080> movie<00:04:39.700> effects<00:04:40.700> wise<00:04:40.880> that's<00:04:41.180> probably

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
good movie effects wise that's probably

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.360 
good movie effects wise that's probably
why<00:04:41.600> they<00:04:41.750> want<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.930> hire<00:04:41.990> him<00:04:42.110> um<00:04:42.950> yeah

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
why they want to hire him um yeah

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.120 
why they want to hire him um yeah
definitely<00:04:43.850> good<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:44.630> if<00:04:44.960> he<00:04:45.380> can<00:04:45.800> become<00:04:46.039> the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
definitely good so if he can become the

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.340 
definitely good so if he can become the
director<00:04:46.390> definitely<00:04:47.390> but<00:04:47.750> then<00:04:47.930> again<00:04:48.050> he

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
director definitely but then again he

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.909 
director definitely but then again he
said<00:04:48.530> no<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.860> direct<00:04:49.400> star<00:04:49.700> trek<00:04:49.970> 3<00:04:50.330> so<00:04:51.110> if<00:04:51.650> he's

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
said no to direct star trek 3 so if he's

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.650 
said no to direct star trek 3 so if he's
gonna<00:04:52.070> say<00:04:52.280> yes<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:52.820> is<00:04:53.150> kind<00:04:53.570> of

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
gonna say yes to this is kind of

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.350 
gonna say yes to this is kind of
unlikely<00:04:53.840> but<00:04:54.560> we'll<00:04:54.830> see<00:04:55.160> anyway<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.060> not

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
unlikely but we'll see anyway is not

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.790 
unlikely but we'll see anyway is not
gonna<00:04:56.539> end<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.810> video<00:04:56.930> thank<00:04:57.349> you<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:57.650> much
