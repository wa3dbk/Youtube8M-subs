 Hello partners 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.669
 how many of us have not ever taken some photos that by various 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.939
 circumstances have become obsolete or in low light 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.489
 that's why I share this small and simple tutorial so that 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.710
 learn to clarify these photos in a quick and easy way using the 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.869
 photoshop 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.630
 well, first of all we start first and logically we open that photo that 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.080
 we want to be clear 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.780
 once opened the photo to modify the first thing we have to do is copy 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.390
 or double the capacity 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 since we copy the layer we go to layer fusion modes and we put it in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.150
 the plot option as you can automatically see our photo is us 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.790
 clarifies in a significant way but in case it needs more 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.510
 light all we have to do is copy our layer in function frame and 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.870
 As you can see, each time we copy the layer in frame, it becomes clear to us 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.790
 more our photo 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.090
 in case you have duplicated and monopolize frame form you have given us lights 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.130
 The only thing we have to do is lower the opacity percentage 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.760
 play with the percentage of opacity until finding the one that satisfies us 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.980
 we already have our clearer photo in a simple fast way and with a good 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.300
 result 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.900
 Now it's just a matter of saving our new photo and you're done 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.070
 Note the results may vary in each one depends on the quality of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.820
 our original photo may be the case that when clarifying our photo we 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.200
 generate noise which can also be corrected and later on 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.950
 I taught to read in a new tutorial 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.880
 I hope you liked and served this tutorial at your orders your friend
