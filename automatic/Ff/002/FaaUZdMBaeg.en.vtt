this<00:00:10.880> biology<00:00:11.210> high<00:00:11.600> school<00:00:13.450> what<00:00:14.450> well

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
this biology high school what well

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.950 
this biology high school what well
physics<00:00:15.590> there's<00:00:15.770> a<00:00:15.830> lot<00:00:16.480> when<00:00:17.480> you<00:00:17.600> get<00:00:17.780> into

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
physics there's a lot when you get into

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.230 
physics there's a lot when you get into
the<00:00:18.170> majestic<00:00:18.800> pH<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:19.310> all<00:00:19.430> that<00:00:19.610> comes<00:00:20.619> we<00:00:21.619> do

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
the majestic pH and all that comes we do

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.910 
the majestic pH and all that comes we do
and<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.450> younger<00:00:23.780> a<00:00:23.810> fifth<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.410> sixth<00:00:24.650> grade

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
and the younger a fifth and sixth grade

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.890 
and the younger a fifth and sixth grade
we<00:00:25.370> do<00:00:25.550> potential<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.060> kinetic<00:00:26.120> energy<00:00:26.450> with

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
we do potential and kinetic energy with

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.180 
we do potential and kinetic energy with
them<00:00:27.080> we're<00:00:27.350> rolling<00:00:27.590> down<00:00:27.740> an<00:00:27.860> inclined

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
them we're rolling down an inclined

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.540 
them we're rolling down an inclined
plane<00:00:28.450> visit<00:00:29.450> the<00:00:29.630> younger<00:00:29.960> kids<00:00:30.170> they<00:00:31.160> don't

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
plane visit the younger kids they don't

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.100 
plane visit the younger kids they don't
understand<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.000> concept<00:00:32.450> of<00:00:32.509> mass<00:00:32.719> really

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
understand the concept of mass really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.020 
understand the concept of mass really
get<00:00:33.289> but<00:00:33.500> they<00:00:33.620> can<00:00:33.770> understand<00:00:34.100> biggest<00:00:34.460> and

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
get but they can understand biggest and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.299 
get but they can understand biggest and
then<00:00:35.750> we<00:00:35.899> change<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.320> service<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.129> talk

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
then we change the service and talk

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.389 
then we change the service and talk
about<00:00:37.460> rich<00:00:38.079> there's<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.140> lot<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.399> math

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
about rich there's a lot of math

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.369 
about rich there's a lot of math
calculations<00:00:41.210> in<00:00:41.359> there<00:00:41.570> for<00:00:41.809> physics

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
calculations in there for physics

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.220 
calculations in there for physics
calculate<00:00:43.100> using<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.460> caliper<00:00:43.909> and

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
calculate using the caliper and

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.860 
calculate using the caliper and
calculating<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.940> diameter<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.149> then<00:00:47.690> using

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
calculating the diameter and then using

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.569 
calculating the diameter and then using
the<00:00:48.019> formula<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.499> calculate<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:49.010> volume<00:00:49.339> of

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
the formula to calculate the volume of

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.169 
the formula to calculate the volume of
the<00:00:49.670> sphere<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.329> then<00:00:51.079> seeing<00:00:51.379> if<00:00:51.679> they<00:00:52.179> the

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
the sphere and then seeing if they the

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.579 
the sphere and then seeing if they the
volume<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:53.690> they<00:00:53.839> calculated<00:00:54.379> with<00:00:54.559> the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
volume that they calculated with the

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:55.989 
volume that they calculated with the
caliper<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.249> know<00:00:55.370> they're<00:00:55.789> going<00:00:55.909> to

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
caliper you know they're going to

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:57.579 
caliper you know they're going to
measure<00:00:56.149> 10<00:00:56.479> of<00:00:56.659> them<00:00:56.749> to<00:00:56.809> calculate<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.409> and

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
measure 10 of them to calculate it and

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.919 
measure 10 of them to calculate it and
then<00:00:58.129> put<00:00:58.429> 10<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.089> those<00:00:59.149> cylinder<00:00:59.839> and

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
then put 10 of those cylinder and

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.709 
then put 10 of those cylinder and
displace<00:01:00.319> it<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.010> see<00:01:01.249> if<00:01:01.339> it's<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.609> same

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
displace it and see if it's the same

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.879 
displace it and see if it's the same
that<00:01:02.719> was<00:01:02.809> not<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.170> same<00:01:03.409> you<00:01:03.559> know<00:01:03.620> what's

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:03.889 
that was not the same you know what's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:06.370 
that was not the same you know what's
the<00:01:03.979> difference<00:01:04.370> now<00:01:04.909> where<00:01:05.150> did<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.659> three

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
the difference now where did that three

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.110 
the difference now where did that three
or<00:01:06.470> four<00:01:06.620> milliliters<00:01:06.890> go<00:01:07.370> you<00:01:07.790> know<00:01:07.880> why<00:01:08.060> is

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
or four milliliters go you know why is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.530 
or four milliliters go you know why is
it<00:01:08.299> going<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:09.760> have<00:01:10.760> my<00:01:10.880> kids<00:01:11.120> because

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
it going so I have my kids because

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.060 
it going so I have my kids because
they're<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:11.810> cheap<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.350> there's<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:12.650> many<00:01:12.830> in

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
they're so cheap and there's so many in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.590 
they're so cheap and there's so many in
hair<00:01:13.630> which<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.930> prolific<00:01:15.320> classes<00:01:15.800> there

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
hair which is a prolific classes there

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.499 
hair which is a prolific classes there
about<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.470> meeting<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.850> if<00:01:19.150> you're<00:01:19.299> doing

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
about that meeting and if you're doing

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.090 
about that meeting and if you're doing
so<00:01:19.840> when<00:01:19.990> I'm<00:01:20.110> when<00:01:20.500> you're<00:01:20.710> doing<00:01:20.920> the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
so when I'm when you're doing the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.510 
so when I'm when you're doing the
experiment<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.439> sixth<00:01:23.710> period<00:01:24.009> day<00:01:24.159> I<00:01:24.189> use

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
experiment for a sixth period day I use

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.180 
experiment for a sixth period day I use
about<00:01:24.759> that<00:01:24.970> much<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:26.470> I<00:01:26.500> put<00:01:26.799> that<00:01:26.830> in<00:01:27.100> a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
about that much and so I put that in a

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.310 
about that much and so I put that in a
ziplock<00:01:27.549> baggie<00:01:27.790> gallon<00:01:28.360> ziplock<00:01:28.780> fill<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.229> up

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
ziplock baggie gallon ziplock fill it up

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.830 
ziplock baggie gallon ziplock fill it up
about<00:01:29.530> halfway<00:01:29.830> with<00:01:30.190> water<00:01:30.299> zip<00:01:31.299> it<00:01:31.450> up<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.720> I

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
about halfway with water zip it up and I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.270 
about halfway with water zip it up and I
just<00:01:31.869> leave<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.350> overnight<00:01:32.560> I'd<00:01:32.890> started

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
just leave it overnight I'd started

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.039 
just leave it overnight I'd started
before<00:01:33.399> went<00:01:33.759> home<00:01:33.909> that<00:01:34.090> day<00:01:34.149> then<00:01:34.659> we<00:01:34.780> raided

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
before went home that day then we raided

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.539 
before went home that day then we raided
the<00:01:35.110> next<00:01:35.290> morning<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.860> lot<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.460> the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
the next morning a lot of the

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.850 
the next morning a lot of the
experiments<00:01:37.270> you're<00:01:37.539> measuring<00:01:37.960> how<00:01:38.500> fast

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
experiments you're measuring how fast

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.260 
experiments you're measuring how fast
they<00:01:39.070> grow<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.399> certain<00:01:39.670> period<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.940> time<00:01:40.000> we

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
they grow in a certain period of time we

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.130 
they grow in a certain period of time we
do<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> lot<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.600> grassy<00:01:40.930> with<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.420> on<00:01:43.600> those<00:01:43.810> you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
do a lot of grassy with so on those you

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.600 
do a lot of grassy with so on those you
wouldn't<00:01:44.409> start<00:01:44.619> hydrating<00:01:44.770> for<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.369> kids

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
wouldn't start hydrating for the kids

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.010 
wouldn't start hydrating for the kids
out<00:01:45.820> there<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.210> know<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.330> they<00:01:46.539> would<00:01:46.720> do<00:01:46.869> it

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
out there you know and they would do it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.649 
out there you know and they would do it
did<00:01:47.950> seventh<00:01:48.399> grade<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.060> was<00:01:49.210> looking<00:01:49.479> for

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
did seventh grade so I was looking for

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.240 
did seventh grade so I was looking for
something<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.080> would<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.710> could<00:01:51.100> use<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
something that would I could use the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.040 
something that would I could use the
gorgeous<00:01:51.670> cuz<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.880> enjoy<00:01:52.149> them<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:52.899> did

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
gorgeous cuz I enjoy them we did

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.139 
gorgeous cuz I enjoy them we did
microscope<00:01:53.590> studies<00:01:53.979> with<00:01:54.190> because<00:01:54.940> if<00:01:55.060> you

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
microscope studies with because if you

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.520 
microscope studies with because if you
look<00:01:55.330> at<00:01:55.479> them<00:01:55.569> under<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.840> microscope<00:01:55.869> they

oh<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> good<00:02:18.090> experiment<00:02:18.540> they

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
oh that was a good experiment they

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
the water so if you lower the pH and
