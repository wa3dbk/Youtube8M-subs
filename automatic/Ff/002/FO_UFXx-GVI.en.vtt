amount that I have to repair just do
that<00:02:50.010> on<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> other<00:02:50.519> side<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.049> can

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
that on the other side and then we can

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.190 
that on the other side and then we can
start<00:02:52.530> sewing<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.220> there<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.489> no<00:02:53.670> way<00:02:53.819> of

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
start sewing so there is no way of

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.110 
start sewing so there is no way of
closing<00:02:55.200> up<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> shoulder<00:02:56.010> seam<00:02:56.219> and<00:02:56.430> having

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
closing up the shoulder seam and having

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.640 
closing up the shoulder seam and having
it<00:02:57.239> look<00:02:57.420> exactly<00:02:57.659> like<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.200> was<00:02:58.439> before

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it look exactly like it was before

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.710 
it look exactly like it was before
unless<00:02:59.579> you<00:02:59.760> turn<00:02:59.939> the<00:03:00.120> whole<00:03:00.299> thing<00:03:00.450> inside

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
unless you turn the whole thing inside

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.379 
unless you turn the whole thing inside
out<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.079> sew<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.709> all<00:03:01.799> over<00:03:02.129> again<00:03:02.209> but<00:03:03.209> we're

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
out and sew it all over again but we're

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.229 
out and sew it all over again but we're
going<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.629> try<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.079> make<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.349> look<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:05.239> close

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
going to try and make it look as close

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.710 
going to try and make it look as close
to<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:07.019> original<00:03:07.109> as<00:03:07.560> possible<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> lightly

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
to the original as possible so I lightly

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720 
to the original as possible so I lightly
pinch<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.950> seam<00:03:11.220> close<00:03:11.609> together<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:13.730> with

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
pinch the seam close together and with

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.110 
pinch the seam close together and with
similar<00:03:15.030> colored<00:03:15.599> thread<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:20.700> gonna<00:03:20.849> patch

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
similar colored thread just gonna patch

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:38.339

it<00:03:21.299> up

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:45.229 

so<00:03:38.799> tie<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.099> knot<00:03:39.370> at<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.610> beginning<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:42.579> then

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.990 

quickly<00:03:47.760> run

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.930 

your<00:03:54.160> needle<00:03:55.160> in<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.580> out<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:57.410> seam<00:04:00.940> kind
