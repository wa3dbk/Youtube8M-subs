00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
right now shimmer is extremely powerful

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.340 
right now shimmer is extremely powerful
it's<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> most<00:01:30.350> natural

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it's one of the most natural

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
it's one of the most natural
anti-inflammatories<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.729> get

okay
and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.920> competes<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.520> ibuprofen

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and it actually competes with ibuprofen

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.429 
and it actually competes with ibuprofen
and<00:01:37.130> hydrocortisone<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.810> more

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and hydrocortisone so it's actually more

now<00:04:18.489> I'm<00:04:18.639> grading<00:04:19.060> this<00:04:19.329> you<00:04:20.139> can<00:04:20.440> pop<00:04:20.680> all<00:04:20.889> of

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
now I'm grading this you can pop all of

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.279 
now I'm grading this you can pop all of
this<00:04:21.130> into<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.519> blender<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.000> just<00:04:22.180> whip<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.080> up

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
this into a blender and just whip it up

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.439 
this into a blender and just whip it up
in<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.500> blender<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:23.979> that's<00:04:24.160> fine<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:25.150> reason

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
in a blender and that's fine the reason

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.969 
in a blender and that's fine the reason
why<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.570> liked<00:04:25.870> it<00:04:25.990> graded<00:04:26.199> is<00:04:26.440> because<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:26.889> a

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
why I liked it graded is because it's a

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.550 
why I liked it graded is because it's a
slow<00:04:27.220> extraction<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.389> believe<00:04:29.229> that<00:04:29.440> it

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
slow extraction and I believe that it

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.379 
slow extraction and I believe that it
oxidizes<00:04:30.280> less<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.789> this<00:04:30.849> is<00:04:31.030> more<00:04:31.240> of<00:04:31.270> a

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
oxidizes less and this is more of a

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.140 
oxidizes less and this is more of a
traditional<00:04:31.570> way<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.080> preparing<00:04:32.560> ingredients

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
traditional way of preparing ingredients

traditional way of preparing ingredients
because<00:04:34.150> back<00:04:34.419> then<00:04:34.449> they<00:04:34.810> didn't<00:04:35.020> have

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
because back then they didn't have

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.189 
because back then they didn't have

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
machines at wisdeth high velocities that

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.560 
machines at wisdeth high velocities that
oxidized<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:39.130> lot<00:04:39.759> of<00:04:39.849> the<00:04:39.970> ingredients

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
oxidized a lot of the ingredients

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.219 
oxidized a lot of the ingredients
I<00:04:40.599> flew<00:04:41.590> support<00:04:42.280> using<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:42.759> blender<00:04:43.210> but<00:04:44.139> if

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
I flew support using a blender but if

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.020 
I flew support using a blender but if
you<00:04:44.320> can<00:04:44.620> grade<00:04:45.099> it<00:04:47.490> now<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.550> can<00:04:49.000> use

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
you can grade it now you can use

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.909 
you can grade it now you can use
turmeric<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.139> powder<00:04:50.349> form

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
turmeric and powder form

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.909 
turmeric and powder form
I<00:04:50.949> recommend<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.030> use<00:04:52.180> about<00:04:52.330> a

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
I recommend that you use about a

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:59.219 
I recommend that you use about a
teaspoon<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:54.580> day<00:04:55.000> so<00:04:57.120> when<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.240> make<00:04:58.419> this<00:04:58.660> I'd

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
teaspoon a day so when you make this I'd

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.050 
teaspoon a day so when you make this I'd
probably<00:04:59.530> consume<00:05:00.070> this<00:05:00.220> twice<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.639> day<00:05:00.940> if

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
probably consume this twice a day if

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.850 
probably consume this twice a day if
you're<00:05:01.240> trying<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.570> fight<00:05:01.840> disease<00:05:02.229> process

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.159 
you're trying to fight disease process
of<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.130> body<00:05:03.250> or<00:05:03.490> inflammation<00:05:03.849> and<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:05.050> way

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
of the body or inflammation and the way

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.740 
of the body or inflammation and the way
you<00:05:05.229> do<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:05.770> is<00:05:05.949> you'd<00:05:06.130> make<00:05:06.539> two<00:05:07.539> batches

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
you do that is you'd make two batches

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.409 
you do that is you'd make two batches
you'd<00:05:08.620> use<00:05:08.800> half<00:05:09.099> a<00:05:09.190> teaspoon<00:05:09.699> of<00:05:09.880> powdered

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
you'd use half a teaspoon of powdered

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.659 
you'd use half a teaspoon of powdered
shimmering<00:05:10.870> in<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.830> morning<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:12.400> then<00:05:12.490> put

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
shimmering in the morning and then put

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.040 
shimmering in the morning and then put
another<00:05:12.699> half<00:05:13.210> as<00:05:13.419> well<00:05:13.570> as<00:05:13.720> your<00:05:13.840> fresh
