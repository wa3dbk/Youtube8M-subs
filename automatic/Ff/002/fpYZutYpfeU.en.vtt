00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
like that if the intensity is a bit too

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
like that if the intensity is a bit too
high<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.740> need<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> come<00:01:08.460> to
