okay<00:00:25.860> as<00:00:26.850> we<00:00:27.120> heard<00:00:27.270> from<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.810> Shepherdson<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
okay as we heard from in Shepherdson the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.860 
okay as we heard from in Shepherdson the
economic<00:00:28.830> outlook<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.400> pretty<00:00:29.910> appalling<00:00:30.450> for

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:30.870 
economic outlook is pretty appalling for

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.260 
economic outlook is pretty appalling for
for<00:00:31.260> Europe<00:00:31.620> and<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.369> stresses<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.879> tensions

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
for Europe and the stresses and tensions

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.639 
for Europe and the stresses and tensions
in<00:00:33.390> Europe<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.719> inevitably<00:00:34.079> gonna<00:00:34.200> knock<00:00:34.410> onto

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
in Europe or inevitably gonna knock onto

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.799 
in Europe or inevitably gonna knock onto
the<00:00:34.710> real<00:00:34.829> estate<00:00:34.950> markets<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.510> looks<00:00:36.750> like

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the real estate markets so it looks like

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.380 
the real estate markets so it looks like
the<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.770> wind<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.400> gonna<00:00:38.520> blow<00:00:38.880> everybody

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the the wind is not gonna blow everybody

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
the the wind is not gonna blow everybody
in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.630> right<00:00:39.810> direction<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:41.550> looks<00:00:41.760> like

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
in the right direction so it looks like

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.740 
in the right direction so it looks like
the<00:00:42.240> the<00:00:43.050> big<00:00:43.230> cities<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> big<00:00:44.750> high-quality

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the the big cities the big high-quality

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
the the big cities the big high-quality
assets<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> perform<00:00:46.739> reasonably

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
assets are going to perform reasonably

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.340 
assets are going to perform reasonably
well<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.210> they're<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> dominate

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
well because they're going to dominate

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
well because they're going to dominate
the<00:00:49.470> market<00:00:49.829> share<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.940> peripheral

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the market share and the peripheral

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
the market share and the peripheral
assets<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.350> likely<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> lose<00:00:52.890> market<00:00:53.370> share

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
assets are likely to lose market share

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.240 
assets are likely to lose market share
so<00:00:54.200> unfortunately<00:00:55.200> I<00:00:55.320> suspect<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so unfortunately I suspect it's going to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010 
so unfortunately I suspect it's going to
be<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> market<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> big<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.540> bigger<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
be a market where the big get bigger and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.560 
be a market where the big get bigger and
the<00:00:58.110> small<00:00:58.380> get<00:00:58.620> smaller<00:00:58.950> and<00:00:59.250> a<00:01:00.149> flight<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the small get smaller and a flight to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.000 
the small get smaller and a flight to
quality<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
quality is what we're going to see and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.799 
quality is what we're going to see and
that's<00:01:02.070> probably<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> affect<00:01:02.880> cities

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that's probably going to affect cities

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.060 
that's probably going to affect cities
it's<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> affect<00:01:04.409> countries<00:01:04.860> it's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's going to affect countries it's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's going to affect countries it's
going<00:01:05.219> to<00:01:05.280> affect<00:01:05.579> the<00:01:05.700> individual<00:01:06.119> assets<00:01:07.130> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
going to affect the individual assets so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.399 
going to affect the individual assets so
probably<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> time<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> big<00:01:10.170> guys

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
probably a time to to back the big guys

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
probably a time to to back the big guys
that<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:10.979> their<00:01:11.220> got<00:01:11.760> their<00:01:11.909> assets

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that have got their got their assets

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
that have got their got their assets
already<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.720> place<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.170> suspect<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
already in place I suspect what do you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340 
already in place I suspect what do you
think<00:01:14.729> Epis<00:01:15.000> priorities<00:01:15.600> should<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
think Epis priorities should be over the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.550 
think Epis priorities should be over the
next<00:01:16.650> 12<00:01:16.920> months<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.970> clearly<00:01:18.479> yep<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.320> doing

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
next 12 months well clearly yep is doing

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
next 12 months well clearly yep is doing
a<00:01:19.650> great<00:01:20.130> job<00:01:20.190> promoting<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.240> sector<00:01:21.690> as<00:01:21.930> an

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
a great job promoting the sector as an

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.580 
a great job promoting the sector as an
investment<00:01:22.650> medium<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:25.350> there's<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
investment medium and I think there's a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
investment medium and I think there's a
lot<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.190> go<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.520> lot<00:01:26.640> further<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
lot more to go a lot further to go you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.260 
lot more to go a lot further to go you
know<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> lot<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.170> lot<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.619> world<00:01:28.860> a

volatile<00:01:40.860> sector<00:01:41.460> which<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.700> somewhat

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
volatile sector which is somewhat

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.390 
volatile sector which is somewhat
separate<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> mainstream<00:01:43.229> real<00:01:44.100> estate

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.460 
separate from the mainstream real estate
market<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.720> great<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.080> about<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

or<00:05:25.879> so<00:05:26.289> I<00:05:27.289> would<00:05:28.099> have<00:05:28.339> argued<00:05:28.759> five<00:05:28.999> years<00:05:29.269> ago

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
or so I would have argued five years ago

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.089 
or so I would have argued five years ago
maybe<00:05:29.749> ten<00:05:29.959> years<00:05:30.139> ago<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:30.649> I'd<00:05:30.829> probably

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
maybe ten years ago and I'd probably

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.819 
maybe ten years ago and I'd probably
have<00:05:31.399> at<00:05:31.519> Neary<00:05:31.909> conferences<00:05:32.569> that<00:05:32.829> listed

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:33.829 
have at Neary conferences that listed

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:35.439 
have at Neary conferences that listed
real<00:05:33.979> estate<00:05:34.249> is<00:05:34.429> volatile<00:05:34.909> it's<00:05:35.179> correlated

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
real estate is volatile it's correlated

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.239 
real estate is volatile it's correlated
with<00:05:35.659> stock<00:05:35.869> market<00:05:36.289> it's<00:05:36.529> not<00:05:36.709> really<00:05:37.069> real

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.249 
with stock market it's not really real

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.399 
with stock market it's not really real
estate<00:05:37.669> I've<00:05:38.479> really<00:05:38.809> changed<00:05:39.079> my<00:05:39.199> view

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
estate I've really changed my view

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.029 
estate I've really changed my view
because<00:05:39.619> the<00:05:40.209> the<00:05:41.209> collapse<00:05:41.599> in<00:05:41.839> 2008<00:05:42.619> showed

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
because the the collapse in 2008 showed

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.819 
because the the collapse in 2008 showed
that<00:05:43.339> private<00:05:43.729> real<00:05:43.879> estate<00:05:43.909> is<00:05:44.449> volatile

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:45.829 
that private real estate is volatile

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:47.499 
that private real estate is volatile
clearly<00:05:46.309> volatile<00:05:46.789> it's<00:05:47.029> capable<00:05:47.239> of<00:05:47.449> being

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
clearly volatile it's capable of being

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.540 
clearly volatile it's capable of being
leveraged<00:05:48.139> -<00:05:48.349> even<00:05:48.589> more<00:05:48.769> than<00:05:49.009> listed<00:05:49.399> real

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
leveraged - even more than listed real

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.129 
leveraged - even more than listed real
estate<00:05:49.849> tends<00:05:50.209> to<00:05:50.360> be<00:05:50.509> capable<00:05:50.899> of<00:05:51.079> being

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
estate tends to be capable of being

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.489 
estate tends to be capable of being
leveraged<00:05:51.649> so<00:05:52.869> really<00:05:53.869> the<00:05:54.019> performance

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:54.499

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:01.809 
that are reported are generally noise
