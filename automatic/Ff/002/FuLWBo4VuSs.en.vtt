even turned the mixer well right don't

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.109 
even turned the mixer well right don't
even<00:01:20.759> bother

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
even bother

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
even bother
this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> fennel<00:01:21.900> seed<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> half

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this is fennel seed it's one and a half

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.280 
this is fennel seed it's one and a half
teaspoons<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.580> toasted<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.360> fennel<00:01:24.780> seeds<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
teaspoons of toasted of fennel seeds and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
teaspoons of toasted of fennel seeds and
I<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.740> chopped<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.759> eat

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
I just chopped them a little bit for eat

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
I just chopped them a little bit for eat
more<00:01:27.270> distribution<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> dough<00:01:28.530> okay

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
more distribution in the dough okay

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
more distribution in the dough okay
and<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> probably<00:01:29.549> adds<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> unique<00:01:30.180> flavor

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and that probably adds a unique flavor

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
and that probably adds a unique flavor
to<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> biscotti<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.259> missions<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
to the biscotti so missions a lot of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.630 
to the biscotti so missions a lot of
biscotti<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.390> has<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.890> flavoring<00:01:35.460> or

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
biscotti actually has this flavoring or

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
biscotti actually has this flavoring or
anise<00:01:36.090> seed<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.780> similar<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.259> that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
anise seed which is very similar to that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.319 
anise seed which is very similar to that
and<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.159> delicious<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.150> can

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and it's very delicious but you can

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.060 
and it's very delicious but you can
change<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> wanted<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
change it up if you wanted to if you

should take about 25 minutes all right
25<00:02:47.489> minutes<00:02:47.820> not<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.090> long<00:02:48.300> biscotti<00:02:48.750> means

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
25 minutes not so long biscotti means

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.140 
25 minutes not so long biscotti means
twice-baked<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.459> were<00:02:50.580> discussing<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
twice-baked we were discussing that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.030 
twice-baked we were discussing that
before<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.290> want<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.830> once

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
before so what you want to do is once

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.830 
before so what you want to do is once
they're<00:02:53.250> baked<00:02:53.520> they're<00:02:53.790> set<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.300> firm<00:02:54.600> but

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
they're baked they're set and firm but

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.690 
they're baked they're set and firm but
not<00:02:54.989> really<00:02:55.290> hard<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.010> know<00:02:56.130> Scotty<00:02:56.550> are

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
not really hard and you know Scotty are

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610 
not really hard and you know Scotty are
really<00:02:57.000> hard<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.510> crunchy<00:02:57.750> that's<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.410> sort

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
really hard and crunchy that's the sort

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.970 
really hard and crunchy that's the sort
of<00:02:58.700> defining<00:02:59.840> characteristic<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.989> them<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.920> to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
of defining characteristic of them so to

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.979 
of defining characteristic of them so to
get<00:03:02.250> them<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.850> slice<00:03:03.360> them<00:03:03.630> across

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
get them like that you slice them across

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.320 
get them like that you slice them across
okay<00:03:04.739> at<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.340> time<00:03:05.400> they<00:03:05.820> sort<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
okay at this time they sort of have the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.000 
okay at this time they sort of have the
consistency<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.989> what<00:03:07.230> looks<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.709> sugar

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
consistency of what looks like a sugar

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.010 
consistency of what looks like a sugar
cookie<00:03:08.190> yeah<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> sugar<00:03:09.720> cookie<00:03:09.870> a
