two giant robots and you run around the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.930 
two giant robots and you run around the
map<00:01:14.560> grab<00:01:14.920> crystals<00:01:15.370> feed<00:01:15.640> them<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:15.880> the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
map grab crystals feed them to the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.850 
map grab crystals feed them to the
robots<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.600> then<00:01:17.080> those<00:01:17.410> two<00:01:17.440> were<00:01:17.710> allowed

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
robots and then those two were allowed

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.900 
robots and then those two were allowed
to<00:01:17.890> fight<00:01:18.100> each<00:01:18.190> other<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.880> know

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
to fight each other and you know

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.630 
to fight each other and you know
whichever<00:01:19.300> one<00:01:19.540> wins<00:01:19.830> wins<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.980> match<00:01:21.160> each

whichever one wins wins the match each

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.790 
whichever one wins wins the match each
each<00:01:21.970> mode<00:01:22.210> has<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.420> different<00:01:22.720> map<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.140> that's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
each mode has a different map so that's

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.380 
each mode has a different map so that's
that's<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.220> 33<00:01:24.670> map<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:24.940> actually<00:01:25.180> have<00:01:25.270> two

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
that's a 33 map we actually have two

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.140 
that's a 33 map we actually have two
three<00:01:25.630> three<00:01:25.870> maps<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.770> then<00:01:26.940> each<00:01:27.940> of<00:01:27.970> the

three three maps and then each of the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
three three maps and then each of the
other<00:01:28.300> modes<00:01:28.450> has<00:01:28.630> its<00:01:28.750> own<00:01:28.870> man

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
that that happened during developer what

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.699 
that that happened during developer what
was<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> most<00:02:31.110> difficult<00:02:31.200> part<00:02:31.500> of

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
was the most difficult part of

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.470 
was the most difficult part of
development<00:02:32.010> I've<00:02:32.640> kind<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.030> interesting

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
development I've kind of interesting

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.940 
development I've kind of interesting
story<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.320> went<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> school<00:02:34.920> for

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
story like I went to school for

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.259 
story like I went to school for
animation<00:02:35.400> ever<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.850> taught<00:02:36.150> myself

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
animation ever I taught myself

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.539 
animation ever I taught myself
programming<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.260> didn't<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.519> what

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
programming so I didn't really know what

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.340 
programming so I didn't really know what
I<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:38.790> doing<00:02:39.180> there's<00:02:39.720> kind<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:40.019> one

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
I was doing there's kind of like one

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.780 
I was doing there's kind of like one
away<00:02:40.500> game<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.830> right<00:02:40.860> yeah<00:02:41.100> sure<00:02:41.310> that's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
away game all right yeah sure that's

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.390 
away game all right yeah sure that's
right<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.600> went<00:02:43.590> through<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.769> lot<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.980> iterations

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
right I went through a lot of iterations

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.620 
right I went through a lot of iterations
of<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.610> server<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.090> all<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.330> kind<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.570> thing

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
of the server and all that kind of thing

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.240 
of the server and all that kind of thing
eventually<00:02:46.140> found<00:02:46.590> some<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.890> worked<00:02:47.070> and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
eventually found some that worked and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
eventually found some that worked and
just<00:02:47.519> went<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.850> how<00:02:48.209> difficult<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.720> a

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
just went with that how difficult was a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.810 
just went with that how difficult was a
unity<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> work<00:02:49.470> with<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.890> mean<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.670> he's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
unity to work with I mean you he's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.729 
unity to work with I mean you he's
pretty<00:02:51.000> great<00:02:51.120> tried<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> couple<00:02:52.140> engines<00:02:52.560> at

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
pretty great tried a couple engines at

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.190 
pretty great tried a couple engines at
stuvi<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.100> work<00:02:53.310> for<00:02:53.489> two<00:02:53.880> studios<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.450> this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
stuvi I work for two studios and this

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.330 
stuvi I work for two studios and this
just<00:02:55.410> fits<00:02:55.530> our<00:02:55.650> company<00:02:55.920> better<00:02:56.010> because<00:02:56.220> we

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
just fits our company better because we

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
basically just use the same engine for

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.380 
basically just use the same engine for
