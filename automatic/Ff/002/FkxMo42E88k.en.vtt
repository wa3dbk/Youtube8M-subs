 foreigners take advantage of that and bandage us 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.780
 Morisien take us some time 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.950
 we took the place for us we 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.140
 we could from the beach we would 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.600
 are we really strange and dance to 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.030
 the place the dance at the plaza and that's 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.950
 the place that very much appreciated in the south 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.530
 that's where we bus in the beach side 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.900
 does not have much couch and our white sand 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.769
 the mother of the turquoise water and the man does 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.230
 not understand that they were handling 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.709
 authority and accepted good project seems 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.180
 alas do not learn who in 2050 50 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.579
 do we plunge the place to disappear 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.500
 with warming the earth but there with 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.030
 their founders 50 inches more 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.470
 equipped data do we pose the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.390
 question that matters is the range for 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.400
 stay for us and our people and 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500
 grow up are we going to find that very very 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.209
 really regrettable that he authorities 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.880
 promise similar numbers and we 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.720
 we insisted that as in business the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.640
 public place 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.620
 livia remain to the public and do not have two 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.250

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.190
 no mega passed m last year says 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.160
 average the ramp 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.290
 all this is the cliff that al of 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.810
 rose 10.6 point crying over there 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.190
 and is only about 800 m away and all that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.950
 I was in trouble with us 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.920
 to tire even for all this 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.370

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.190
 I did the whole thing down there 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.920
 nearly 1 km further we needed all black 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.000

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.440
 we are not able 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.500
 because it's public domain fed 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.500
 and maybe it's not worth it 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.510
