00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.670
 pumpkin 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.320
 that's actually for me 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.840
 easy to process pumpkin because he 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.140
 I always have this one pretty much 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.470
 the upper part of the narrower part there 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.420
 there are no cores in it and only in this one 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:44.170
 piece the kernels in it so this pumpkin 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.170
 completely only flesh in schillig 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.399
 You can also with a peeler probably 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.980
 the skin is pretty tight because of that 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.980
 better a decent sharp knife 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.890
 pumpkin is very versatile for 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.500
 sauces for soups you can otto 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.860

 a quiche on it beautiful war 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.159
 For example, I would now be a piece 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:18.560

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:31.549

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.670
 puff pastry is to be poured with 1 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.340
 to bake out 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:44.119
 The upper parts can be easily in 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:48.860
 cut dice as another thing and 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:52.759
