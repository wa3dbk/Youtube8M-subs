00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.550
 Solon welcome back last Bremen 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.629
 in Linz 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.629
 So after we have our last part of the series 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.959
 have set goals against Biel without success 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.649
 in short I brought home from the second part because I too 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.159
 had the quake after the first fight 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.599
 Problem is now I have two years in between 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.940
 The two days I went back to Pandora and have 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.850
 Hermann character healed and also not yet exercised on Sell back 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.390
 definitely not a problem 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.060
 where is the title 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.270
 because it makes sense that the undercover shipyard otherwise only when buying 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.120
 is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 I 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 is to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.830
 4 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.260
 is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.080
 or it could come to that 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.839
 could be in short supply with preference 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.299
 is clearly better than the other positive and indeed stop 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 for Christoph Hörstel 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 there 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 for posts 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.080
 DAPD 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.150
 is 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 is 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.590
 the furniture is 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.590
 both had to join 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.680
 not really well 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.810
 good as well 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.240
 so 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 send back a short stop 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.970
 and look at what the blog will get 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.370
 dpa 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.439
 Euro 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.439
 construction work 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 Thus, the idea rejected a way those critters 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.239
 Vogts openly serving Egidi Dietinger CEP hardly gives Nokia with 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:36.349
 from 20 funny park where I spilled two stood there in a professional of the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.319
 Doors did not move, so I had to go too 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.319
 not too bad to leave the hut 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:49.999
 Buses brought 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.999
 and it's not just raining 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.450
 I also think that actually the most beautiful in the seasons in the game 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 After the moon peeped out photo not exploited 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 Me, yes 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.570

 Dell on the way to the final 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.599
 the cooling air 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.649
 All this is still very close to Mora 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.489
 Wind conditions is there is mission there you have to share 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.799
 Run for 20 minutes without fun and just go for the dress code 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.230
 that one through the part and should soon buy them again on the outer track 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.949
 Although not so good I'm sorry 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.829
 that's easy 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.339
 not only times 70's own part of circulation to wage war 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.739

 What about these Aigner who just drove siblings to Simon Ammann 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.649

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.759
 their pirate well here are supposed to guess so admired and still have a few dirty ones 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:16.469

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.959

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.710
 given by the economy 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.759
 and Robert Rappen goes 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.979

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.400
 about giving more kill for the riots currently going on with being responsible 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.400
 are 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.570
 Vettel was Megan Consult for wanting to deepen the part of the series level 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.639
 Ore mines are responsible for it all are now also take on the Ruhr 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.629
 to carry around to Taymor 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.209
 Alps RP settlers Veltins settle in a cave in the hill north of the mine 

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:04.860
 Meldorf increases back when they're dead, so be careful with them 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.409
 a gun make her come Burgfest drawback of the lungs annually 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.489

 good question the next night has Dr 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.110
 I'm not too fat with the GLG brand, "I'd worry 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.370
 Can still transport loads between you can try it with every victory 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.589
 just time »out 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.779
 choose 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.550
 "I would've tilted that thing, too 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.110
 this is my personal opinion on these points together Schoeps 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.110
 these three points 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.199
 to travel 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.099
 is cool 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.099
 now in winter the home win Vettel 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.499
 The fight is also really loud 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.150
 therefore 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.599
 no longer place yours from the red shirt like that 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.599
 somehow 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.819
 after good 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.340
 fresh door 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.490
 too big for them 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.490
 give it to 1 4 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.639
 Citi 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.639

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:14.349
 Möggers 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.409
 Close to naked men, I was afraid 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.190
 Well, well, it should be I have to part no longer so much recording time 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.669
 sda Bendix in the next part then definitely comes first 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:35.759
 real highlight and indeed the fight against this 4 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.309
 Tavernier apply 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:41.849
 That's why I want to say we're doing final round here I'm running between already 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:43.039
 go on 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:47.550
