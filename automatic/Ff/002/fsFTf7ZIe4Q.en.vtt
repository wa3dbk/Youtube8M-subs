always like these types of maps and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.170 
always like these types of maps and
especially<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.370> set<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180

time that own new weapon has ever been
released<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.020> DLC<00:01:34.439> I'm<00:01:34.950> aware<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.790> called

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
released in DLC I'm aware of it's called

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.990 
released in DLC I'm aware of it's called
the<00:01:36.270> Peacekeeper<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.530> SMG<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the Peacekeeper and it's an SMG and the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760 
the Peacekeeper and it's an SMG and the
reason<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> look<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
reason I really like the look at this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
reason I really like the look at this
gun<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.220> because<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.150> kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.509> reminds<00:01:42.869> me<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
gun is because it kind of reminds me of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.639 
gun is because it kind of reminds me of
the<00:01:43.680> PPSh<00:01:44.340> from<00:01:44.820> world<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.570> war<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.439> that's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the PPSh from world at war so if that's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.170 
the PPSh from world at war so if that's
the<00:01:46.770> case<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.430> I'm<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.000> loving

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the case well I'm going to be loving

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.580 
the case well I'm going to be loving
that<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.689> comes<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> mystery<00:01:49.380> box

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that if that comes out the mystery box

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
that if that comes out the mystery box
in<00:01:49.890> zombies<00:01:50.340> imagine<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.850> pack<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> punched

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
in zombies imagine that pack a punched

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.670 
in zombies imagine that pack a punched
epi<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.500> let's<00:01:52.619> look<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> zombie<00:01:53.189> map<00:01:54.680> okay
