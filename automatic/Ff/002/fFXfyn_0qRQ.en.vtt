00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
briefings which were powerful and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.159 
briefings which were powerful and
amazing<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.120> we<00:04:50.180> just<00:04:50.390> didn't<00:04:50.660> have<00:04:50.690> time<00:04:50.780> to

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
amazing and we just didn't have time to

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.500 
amazing and we just didn't have time to
put<00:04:51.320> them<00:04:51.440> all<00:04:51.530> in<00:04:51.970> hopefully<00:04:52.970> one<00:04:53.150> day<00:04:53.180> we'll

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
put them all in hopefully one day we'll

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.500 
put them all in hopefully one day we'll
be<00:04:53.570> able<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.840> make<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.020> longer<00:04:54.229> version<00:04:54.850> we<00:04:55.850> need

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
be able to make a longer version we need

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.960 
be able to make a longer version we need
the<00:04:56.690> film<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.140> do<00:04:57.290> well<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:58.700> we<00:04:58.820> can

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
the film to do well so that we can

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.060 
the film to do well so that we can
afford<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.510> go<00:04:59.660> back<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.080> ask<00:05:00.169> Bernie<00:05:00.530> again

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
to give us more footage because we have

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.840 
to give us more footage because we have

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.670 
to we have to buy more footage to put on
another<00:05:04.970> DVD<00:05:05.479> or<00:05:05.690> something<00:05:06.110> like<00:05:06.470> that<00:05:06.590> you

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
another DVD or something like that you

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.260 
another DVD or something like that you
know<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.070> one<00:05:07.490> day<00:05:07.669> hopefully

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.990 

I<00:05:12.620> think<00:05:13.620> there's<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.889> lot<00:05:14.069> of<00:05:14.160> great<00:05:14.490> drivers

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
I think there's a lot of great drivers

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.650 
I think there's a lot of great drivers
now<00:05:15.419> I<00:05:16.199> don't<00:05:16.889> know<00:05:17.099> if<00:05:17.130> any<00:05:17.430> of<00:05:17.550> them<00:05:17.789> have<00:05:18.030> the

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
now I don't know if any of them have the

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.070 
now I don't know if any of them have the
pressure<00:05:19.020> that<00:05:19.919> he<00:05:20.160> had<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:21.150> whole<00:05:21.419> country

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
pressure that he had for a whole country

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.860 
pressure that he had for a whole country
looking<00:05:22.770> up<00:05:22.919> to<00:05:23.039> him<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.819> size<00:05:24.150> of<00:05:24.389> Brazil<00:05:24.509> I

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
looking up to him the size of Brazil I

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.300 
looking up to him the size of Brazil I
don't<00:05:25.110> think<00:05:25.319> that<00:05:25.440> any<00:05:25.590> of<00:05:25.710> them<00:05:25.889> have<00:05:26.130> that

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
don't think that any of them have that

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.460 
don't think that any of them have that
issue<00:05:26.580> now<00:05:26.849> you<00:05:27.090> know<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.870> know<00:05:27.990> lots<00:05:28.319> of

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.460 
of them have the same kind of pressure
that<00:05:38.160> he<00:05:38.340> had<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:39.509> don't<00:05:39.569> know<00:05:39.810> if<00:05:39.900> many<00:05:40.259> of

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
that he had and I don't know if many of
