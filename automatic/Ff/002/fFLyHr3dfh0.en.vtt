00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello everyone, Sasha is the author of the channel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.080
 the kind of rock by animation you watch 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.179
 third final lesson on how 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040
 create here is such effect 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.160
 authority 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 you and I made the reflection 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.760
 tracking and tied the jar to the water and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.180
 Now we will animate the flag and so 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.769
 go to the after effect 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 but before you create an animation for 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.529
 flag let's create a duplicate of this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.529
 the flag 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.820
 so take the selection tool 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.980
 select the flag and press control the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.739
 then his name I don't even know which one 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.739
 the name will be 123 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.149
 ok, let's hide this flag for now and 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.129
 change the mask on the first flags from the first 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.129
 flag we only need a stick 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.770
 This left side can be not touched 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.299
 fundamentally but generally mask 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.429
 occupy seats and of course yes 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.429
 fundamentally but not in our case 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.260
 at 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.469
 so from the first layer we only see 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.799
 shelf 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.859
 turn on the second layer and let's turn it off 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.479
 the first layer and the second layer will do 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:15.700
 the mask here is such that we need only here 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.099
 this part without a stick at what here we 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.880
 make such a beautiful cutout 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:26.910
 which we saw types 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.760
 waving flag 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:37.530
 ok now turn on the bottom layer to 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.530
 see what we do here ok 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.549
 let's move on to create a flag animation 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.950
 for this go to the effect window 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.400
 crouch prophetic effect mercury 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.519
 then the heart tag grab for it and 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.519
 I drag on our flag more precisely here on 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.250
 this part she disappeared with us so we her 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.000
 seen let's move on temporary 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.790
 the scale is slightly on the right perfectly we see 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.480
 some particles let's get this 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.780
 value 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.739
 I increase to 50 and the number of particles by 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.470
 x and y 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:33.359
 or rather the scattering will do about here 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:36.150
 so that's great now we raise here 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:40.709
 this value and we have formed 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.810
 such a flag so that we see it 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.069
 animation let's turn off the visibility of all 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.930
 layers so that the computer does not slow down 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.840
 I will not click here every time 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.720
 this eye and clamped the button once 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.840
 mouse hold the mouse down and all my 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.870
 automatically turns off and so let's 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.859
 with you dan we build our contribution to him 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.930
 and did not fly away these areas will increase 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:12.180
 Ix reader's wheels are more precise scatter 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.750
 let's check that no part a 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.159
 flag and do not fly away from it 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.400
 sorry the quality still died a little 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:25.139
 brakes and so generally flag animation and 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.590
 you can not like it yet 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:32.510
 go to the lighting settings and add 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.510
 here are such light bands amo 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.310
 fine i think you can figure it out 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:43.690
 this effect on tweak twist 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.850
 these levers benefit them a little and i think 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.290
 you will achieve the desired effect by the way this 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.480
 particle direction for example 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.780
 the wind can be changed let it blow now 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.780
 right and so i turn on all our layers 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.150
 go to the beginning of the animation look at 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.570
 we are now no flag so let's 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:16.270
 skip a couple of frames until that moment 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:19.990
 until our contribution appears now 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.140
 this effect also does not need time to 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.170
 form here it is already 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.630
 formed therefore we must put 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.210
 restriction 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:34.240
 but our composition can be manually 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:38.590
 drag this sound here and you can click 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:44.800
 English key b is km limited 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:50.770
 our composition and that's all I do 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.420
 quality of viewing is maximum 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.480
 made a render of a small piece and 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.810
 let's see what we did and so 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.210
 I render is over and here is such a 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.250
 we are the result in my opinion everything turned out 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.810
 very good 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.170
 let me remind you how this village 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.320
 I say bring in each lesson but 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.940
 all of a sudden you watch this hands for the first time 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.030
 you choose songs with which 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.900
 working on the timeline 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:24.040
 click on it here then composition 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:27.880
 this is a render in this window you are checking 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.660
 your settings we work with 30 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.840
 frames per second resolution if you don't 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:39.130
 agree put your in this window we 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:42.880
 choose the h264 codec of this mpeg4 and 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.729
 Click ok and then we select 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.139
 address where to save click safe and 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.749
 render 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.580
 and you have a yellow stripe here I 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:53.259
 I hope this series of lessons for you was 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.479
 useful and you know something for yourself 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.289
 new 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.020
 subscribe to my channel leave 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:02.639
 questions if something was not clear until 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.639
 meeting in new lessons for now
