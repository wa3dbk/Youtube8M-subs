00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.639 
succeed or to fail based on how close
you<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.450> resistance<00:00:40.440> players

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
you think your the resistance players

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.830 
you think your the resistance players
are<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> catching<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
are to catching on to you and and that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840 
are to catching on to you and and that
kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> thing<00:00:43.350> there's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> certain<00:00:44.760> number

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
kind of thing there's a certain number

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.660 
kind of thing there's a certain number
of<00:00:45.059> spies<00:00:45.360> per<00:00:45.780> game<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:47.129> depends<00:00:47.550> on

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of spies per game and that depends on

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.500 
of spies per game and that depends on
how<00:00:47.850> many<00:00:47.910> players<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.690> playing<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
how many players are actually playing so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.490 
how many players are actually playing so
every<00:00:51.510> game<00:00:51.690> has<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.199> score

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
every game has got one of these score

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
every game has got one of these score
cards<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
cards and here you can see that this is

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549

an 8 player game and for an 8 player

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
an 8 player game and for an 8 player
game<00:00:55.800> they're<00:00:56.010> 3<00:00:56.280> spies<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> game<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
resistance when three missions then they

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.490 
resistance when three missions then they
went<00:02:10.179> if<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.539> spies<00:02:10.780> went<00:02:11.050> three<00:02:11.200> missions

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
went if the spies went three missions

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.890 
went if the spies went three missions
then<00:02:11.680> their<00:02:11.860> win<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.220> round<00:02:13.150> wins<00:02:13.450> are<00:02:13.629> marked

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
resistance and red for spies so let's

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:19.979 
resistance and red for spies so let's
have<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.030> look<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.330> components<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:19.900> you

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
have a look at the components that you

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.009 
have a look at the components that you
get<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.470> box<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.830> more<00:02:21.069> detail<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> let's

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
get in the box in more detail so let's

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.149 
get in the box in more detail so let's
take<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> look<00:02:23.409> at<00:02:23.500> what<00:02:23.590> you'll<00:02:23.739> get<00:02:23.860> when<00:02:24.010> you

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
take a look at what you'll get when you

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.160 
take a look at what you'll get when you
open<00:02:24.190> up<00:02:24.489> their<00:02:24.730> assistance<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.780> first<00:02:25.989> thing

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
open up their assistance the first thing

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.780 
open up their assistance the first thing
you'll<00:02:26.290> find<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.799> nice<00:02:27.010> thin<00:02:27.340> little<00:02:27.489> rule

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you'll find is a nice thin little rule

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.309 
you'll find is a nice thin little rule
