could<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.760> been<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.619> another<00:01:35.930> 12

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
could have been here for another 12

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.820 
could have been here for another 12
months<00:01:37.140> very<00:01:37.530> easily<00:01:37.830> until<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.760> was<00:01:39.030> five<00:01:39.830> six

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
months very easily until it was five six

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.940 
months very easily until it was five six
feet<00:01:41.190> tall<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.940> can<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.080> root<00:01:43.410> was

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
feet tall you can see that this root was

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.359 
feet tall you can see that this root was
trimmed<00:01:44.490> by<00:01:45.300> exposing<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.140> air<00:01:46.410> but<00:01:47.160> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
trimmed by exposing it to air but you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.469 
trimmed by exposing it to air but you
could<00:01:47.580> see<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.150> new<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.050> coming<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.830> here

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
could see a new one coming out here

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
could see a new one coming out here
brand-new<00:01:51.479> old<00:01:51.750> nice<00:01:52.050> color<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.400> all

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
brand-new old nice color and you see all

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.969 
brand-new old nice color and you see all
the<00:01:53.910> other<00:01:54.119> feeder<00:01:54.600> roots<00:01:57.289> breaking<00:01:58.289> up<00:01:58.440> after

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the other feeder roots breaking up after

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.889 
the other feeder roots breaking up after
they<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.310> their<00:01:59.460> prune<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.119> smaller<00:02:00.600> pieces

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
they get their prune in smaller pieces

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.249 
they get their prune in smaller pieces
so<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> very<00:02:01.890> healthy<00:02:02.399> way<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.390> rock<00:02:03.810> trees

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so it's a very healthy way to rock trees

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.940 
so it's a very healthy way to rock trees
I<00:02:04.820> have<00:02:05.820> reduced<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> root<00:02:06.720> ball<00:02:06.929> a<00:02:06.990> bit<00:02:07.380> for

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I have reduced the root ball a bit for

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.860 
I have reduced the root ball a bit for
chipping<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.750> look<00:02:09.750> what<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> nice<00:02:10.410> perfect

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
chipping and look what a nice perfect

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.460 
chipping and look what a nice perfect
set<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.080> small<00:02:13.850> feeder<00:02:14.850> roots<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.750> shows<00:02:16.230> in

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
set of small feeder roots it shows in

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.850 
set of small feeder roots it shows in
here<00:02:19.160> excellent<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:21.690> root<00:02:21.960> will<00:02:21.990> go<00:02:22.440> very

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
here excellent this root will go very

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.010 
here excellent this root will go very
well<00:02:22.980> anywhere<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.030> put<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.330> because<00:02:24.810> it's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
well anywhere you put it because it's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680 
well anywhere you put it because it's
got<00:02:25.140> enough<00:02:25.410> feeder<00:02:25.620> roots<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:27.210> survive

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
got enough feeder roots to survive

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.890 
got enough feeder roots to survive
anything<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.520> use<00:02:29.910> fabric<00:02:30.390> part<00:02:30.660> as

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
anything this is the use fabric part as

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.230 
anything this is the use fabric part as
you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:31.530> very<00:02:31.560> strong<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.400> little

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
you can see it's very strong a little

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.200 
you can see it's very strong a little
cleaning<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.580> ready<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.240> used<00:02:36.270> again
