00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
anything I can go around my sides I want

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.120

to<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:09.340> you're<00:02:09.430> really<00:02:09.760> looking<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.450> kind<00:02:10.840> of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
to and you're really looking for kind of

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.620 
to and you're really looking for kind of
90-degree<00:02:12.130> angles<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:16.000> here's<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.420> time

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
90-degree angles but here's the time

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.490 
90-degree angles but here's the time
when<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.870> would<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.110> start<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.800> trim<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:23.320> if

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
when I would just start to trim and if

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.280 
when I would just start to trim and if
there<00:02:23.740> are<00:02:23.770> any<00:02:24.190> little<00:02:24.580> imperfections<00:02:25.290> keep

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
there are any little imperfections keep

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.630 
there are any little imperfections keep
in<00:02:26.440> mind<00:02:26.650> you're<00:02:26.800> going<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.980> be<00:02:27.070> covering<00:02:27.430> it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
in mind you're going to be covering it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.000 
in mind you're going to be covering it
anyway<00:02:28.320> with<00:02:29.320> decorations<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.560> nicer

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
anyway with decorations but the nicer

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.740 
anyway with decorations but the nicer
you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.340> get<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.820> better<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.450> problem

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
you can get it the better the problem

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.660 
you can get it the better the problem
with<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.020> bottom<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.530> if<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.460> kind

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
with the bottom is if you this is kind

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.760 
with the bottom is if you this is kind
of<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.850> part<00:02:37.000> where<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.270> may<00:02:37.450> get<00:02:37.510> crumbs<00:02:37.960> so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
of the part where you may get crumbs so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.170 
of the part where you may get crumbs so
this<00:02:38.980> part<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.370> kind<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.820> get<00:02:40.000> rid<00:02:40.030> of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
this part I just kind of get rid of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.700 
this part I just kind of get rid of
unless<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.720> feel<00:02:40.900> like<00:02:40.990> it's<00:02:41.140> really<00:02:41.350> clean

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
unless you feel like it's really clean

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.980 
unless you feel like it's really clean
and<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.220> save<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.270> save<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.810> but

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
and you want to save it and save it but

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.270 
and you want to save it and save it but
otherwise<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.620> kind<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.010> necessary

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
otherwise it's kind of a necessary

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.990 
otherwise it's kind of a necessary
sacrifice<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.770> just<00:02:48.010> make<00:02:48.220> sure<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.460> go<00:02:48.730> all

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
sacrifice but I just make sure I go all

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.600 
sacrifice but I just make sure I go all
the<00:02:49.270> way<00:02:49.300> around<00:02:49.620> make<00:02:50.620> sure<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:51.040> nice<00:02:51.280> and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
the way around make sure it's nice and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.320 
the way around make sure it's nice and
smooth<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.790> that's<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.090> quick

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
smooth and that is it so that's a quick

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.730 
smooth and that is it so that's a quick
way<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.810> cover<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.920> cake<00:02:57.130> with<00:02:57.520> fondant
