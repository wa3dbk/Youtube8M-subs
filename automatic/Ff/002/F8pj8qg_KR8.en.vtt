00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.560
 Some of you told me they wanted to know more about my bike 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.340
 Indeed, I have not made a video about her yet 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.080
 What if we talked about her now? 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.880
 She has a nickname, but it's a well-kept secret! ;) 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.060
 It's a Honda CBF 600 NA 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.640
 so with a 600cc engine 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.240
 "N" because it is the "Naked" and "A" version because it has ABS 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.100
 Let's quickly go around the owner ... 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.400
 As you can see, the bike is completely original, including the muffler 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.500
 Subscribers sometimes ask me why I do not change the pot, the retro, or that I do not add carbon parts ... 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.880
 In my opinion, the beauty of this bike lies in its simplicity 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.860
 So I want to keep it as it is. If I tried to make it more aggressive ... 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.180
 ... it would be like a cat who thinks he's a lion 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.800
 Because it's a nice and soft bike, not an aggressive bike 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.020
 Well, let's go for a walk ... 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.720
 Personally, I really like this classic dashboard! 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.600
 Logically, the noise is discreet, but it fits well with his personality 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.160
 4 cylinders, 78 hp at 10,500 rpm, 58 nm at 8,000 rpm 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.100
 The motor is linear: not player, but flexible and pleasant 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.160
 The driving position is straight, natural and rather comfortable 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.120
 It is fantastically easy to handle 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.500
 215 kg all full facts 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.440
 The 6-speed gearbox is the sweetest I've ever used 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.300
 The brakes could be better, but they are ok ... 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.900
 And ABS saved me in critical situations! 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.140
 In conclusion... 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.280
 It's a great bike for everyday use in urban areas 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.160
 Perfect for beginners and bikers who resume after a long break 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.120
 Totally reliable and inexpensive in maintenance 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.220
 Even though I'm slowly starting to think about my next bike ... 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.300
 ... I will take all my time because I am still very much in love with her 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.260
 And I have the feeling that we still have a lot to live together!
