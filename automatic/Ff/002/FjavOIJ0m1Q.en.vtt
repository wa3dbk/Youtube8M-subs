like all the models the only one I

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.360 
like all the models the only one I
haven't<00:02:37.030> picked<00:02:37.150> up<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.540> dreams<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:39.250> one

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
haven't picked up of the dreams the one

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.160 
haven't picked up of the dreams the one
that<00:02:39.489> did<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.880> where<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.300> somebody<00:02:40.630> else<00:02:40.840> I
