into getting a Chromebook thinking

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.570 
into getting a Chromebook thinking

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
you're buying laptop because you're I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.690 
you're buying laptop because you're I
mean<00:02:49.910> you're<00:02:50.300> not<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.960> a<00:02:51.050> Chromebook<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.700> so

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
at their house typically the campuses

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.050 
at their house typically the campuses
have<00:03:14.480> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.870> all<00:03:15.110> over<00:03:15.410> them<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.460> that's<00:03:16.640> great

again<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.630> did<00:03:17.840> say<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.020> some<00:03:18.200> other<00:03:18.290> video<00:03:18.560> I

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
again I did say to some other video I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.840 
again I did say to some other video I
believe<00:03:19.070> there's<00:03:19.250> Chromebooks<00:03:19.670> where<00:03:19.790> you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
believe there's Chromebooks where you

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.280 
believe there's Chromebooks where you
can<00:03:19.940> actually<00:03:20.060> get<00:03:20.300> data<00:03:20.540> plans<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:21.020> that's<00:03:21.170> an

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
can actually get data plans so that's an

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.080 
can actually get data plans so that's an
option<00:03:21.380> too<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:21.920> I'm<00:03:22.010> talking<00:03:22.400> about<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
option too but I'm talking about the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.390 
option too but I'm talking about the
Wi-Fi<00:03:23.450> model<00:03:24.020> which<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.350> what<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.680> Wi-Fi

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
requires certain certain programs now

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.950 
requires certain certain programs now
then<00:04:49.490> you're<00:04:49.610> kind<00:04:49.910> of<00:04:50.270> out<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.420> luck<00:04:50.540> so

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
then you're kind of out of luck so

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.320 
then you're kind of out of luck so

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
like the email research type of things

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.250 
like the email research type of things
so<00:04:55.400> similar<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.030> whole<00:04:56.210> student<00:04:56.510> aspect

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260

might<00:06:15.620> actually<00:06:15.710> make<00:06:15.950> a<00:06:16.010> separate<00:06:16.400> video

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
might actually make a separate video

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.580 
might actually make a separate video
comparing<00:06:17.150> a<00:06:17.210> laptop<00:06:17.690> to<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:17.930> Chromebook<00:06:18.470> so

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
comparing a laptop to a Chromebook so

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.080 
comparing a laptop to a Chromebook so
that<00:06:18.680> we<00:06:18.800> can<00:06:18.980> kind<00:06:19.100> of<00:06:19.220> see<00:06:19.430> up<00:06:19.610> front<00:06:19.640> but

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
that we can kind of see up front but

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.210 
that we can kind of see up front but
anyways<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:21.020> figured<00:06:21.440> I<00:06:21.590> would<00:06:21.740> do<00:06:21.830> a<00:06:21.860> follow-up

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
anyways I figured I would do a follow-up

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.920 
anyways I figured I would do a follow-up
for<00:06:22.400> you<00:06:22.520> guys<00:06:22.669> because<00:06:22.880> again<00:06:23.180> a<00:06:23.480> lot<00:06:23.750> of

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
for you guys because again a lot of

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.480 
for you guys because again a lot of
people<00:06:24.080> actually<00:06:24.530> seem<00:06:24.740> interested<00:06:25.250> in<00:06:25.370> those

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
people actually seem interested in those

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.460 
people actually seem interested in those
videos<00:06:25.669> and<00:06:26.090> I<00:06:26.150> figured<00:06:26.510> it<00:06:26.690> was<00:06:26.810> only<00:06:26.840> fair<00:06:27.410> to

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
videos and I figured it was only fair to

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.620 
videos and I figured it was only fair to
kind<00:06:27.950> of<00:06:28.070> you<00:06:28.640> know<00:06:28.669> after<00:06:29.030> having<00:06:29.180> it<00:06:29.450> for

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
kind of you know after having it for

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.170 
kind of you know after having it for
some<00:06:29.840> time<00:06:29.870> give<00:06:30.710> my<00:06:31.100> opinion<00:06:31.700> because<00:06:31.850> you

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
some time give my opinion because you

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.520 
some time give my opinion because you
know<00:06:32.270> opinions<00:06:32.600> change<00:06:32.840> absolutely<00:06:33.140> for<00:06:33.500> a

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
know opinions change absolutely for a

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.760 
know opinions change absolutely for a
little

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
little

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.439 
little
then<00:06:34.069> over<00:06:34.310> time<00:06:34.490> you<00:06:34.759> find<00:06:34.940> things<00:06:35.090> you<00:06:35.270> don't

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449 
then over time you find things you don't

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.300 
then over time you find things you don't
necessarily<00:06:35.569> like<00:06:35.990> about<00:06:36.319> it<00:06:36.349> but<00:06:36.650> I<00:06:36.860> got<00:06:37.280> to

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
necessarily like about it but I got to

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.909 
necessarily like about it but I got to
say<00:06:37.400> that<00:06:37.729> with<00:06:37.879> these<00:06:38.030> with<00:06:38.629> this<00:06:38.919> Chromebook

say that with these with this Chromebook

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.800
