again both put the three probes on the
gas<00:02:55.820> cybernetics<00:02:56.820> core<00:02:57.000> coming<00:02:57.300> down<00:02:57.420> for

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
gas cybernetics core coming down for

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.860 
gas cybernetics core coming down for
both<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.930> believe<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:59.270> gen<00:03:00.270> putting<00:03:00.690> down<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
both I believe a gen putting down the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.920 
both I believe a gen putting down the
cybernetics<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.120> yes<00:03:03.120> her<00:03:03.300> rang<00:03:03.480> put<00:03:03.750> down

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
cybernetics and yes her rang put down

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.160 
cybernetics and yes her rang put down
his<00:03:04.170> cybernetics<00:03:04.890> core<00:03:05.130> as<00:03:05.250> well<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.900> I'm

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
his cybernetics core as well and I'm

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.590 
his cybernetics core as well and I'm
actually<00:03:07.290> kind<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.680> surprised<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.390> her<00:03:09.390> rang

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
actually kind of surprised that her rang

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.280 
actually kind of surprised that her rang
went<00:03:09.960> for<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.590> dt<00:03:11.010> rush<00:03:11.940> cuz<00:03:12.390> yeah<00:03:12.960> harang

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
went for the dt rush cuz yeah harang

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.380 
went for the dt rush cuz yeah harang
does<00:03:13.500> have<00:03:13.650> kind<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.890> legendary<00:03:14.310> PvP<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.000> he

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
does have kind of legendary PvP is he

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.110 
does have kind of legendary PvP is he
was<00:03:15.540> always<00:03:15.750> sent<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> pvp<00:03:17.040> sniper<00:03:17.400> just

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
was always sent out as a pvp sniper just

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.479 
was always sent out as a pvp sniper just
because<00:03:18.360> he's<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.750> good<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> matchup<00:03:19.709> so

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
because he's so good and the matchup so

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.500 
because he's so good and the matchup so
you<00:03:20.550> think<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:20.820> he<00:03:21.000> would<00:03:21.090> feel<00:03:21.360> more

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
you think that he would feel more

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.300 
you think that he would feel more
comfortable<00:03:21.570> going<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> more<00:03:22.770> standard

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
comfortable going for a more standard

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.920 
comfortable going for a more standard
type<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.640> play<00:03:23.850> but<00:03:24.390> maybe<00:03:24.450> he<00:03:24.630> was<00:03:24.840> just

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
type of play but maybe he was just

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.570 
type of play but maybe he was just
trying<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.230> shake<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.980> be

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
trying to shake it up and be

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.510 
trying to shake it up and be
unpredictable<00:03:27.650> which<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.830> definitely<00:03:29.160> was

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
unpredictable which I definitely was

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.310 
unpredictable which I definitely was

teammate going down to that bottom left

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.110 
teammate going down to that bottom left
with<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.450> first

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
with the first

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.340 
with the first
jørgen<00:04:27.120> just<00:04:27.690> going<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.930> try<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.080> get<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.289> jump

jørgen just going to try to get a jump

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.409 
jørgen just going to try to get a jump
on<00:04:28.830> her<00:04:29.400> rang<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:29.789> once<00:04:29.940> he<00:04:30.060> sees<00:04:30.240> that

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
on her rang but once he sees that

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.760 
on her rang but once he sees that
scouting<00:04:30.720> probe<00:04:31.050> going<00:04:31.229> down<00:04:31.500> there<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.680> think

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
scouting probe going down there I think

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.860 
scouting probe going down there I think
he's<00:04:31.979> going<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.340> start<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.300> divert<00:04:33.539> those

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
he's going to start to divert those

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.620 
he's going to start to divert those
chickens<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.350> bit<00:04:34.530> although<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:36.150> might<00:04:36.330> trick

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
chickens a bit although this might trick

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.330 
chickens a bit although this might trick
her<00:04:36.780> rang<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.139> bit<00:04:37.320> too<00:04:37.560> moving<00:04:37.979> out<00:04:38.100> with<00:04:38.250> the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
her rang a bit too moving out with the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.909 
her rang a bit too moving out with the
Dragoon<00:04:38.610> from<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.180> position<00:04:39.710> yeah<00:04:40.710> i<00:04:40.740> think

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
Dragoon from that position yeah i think

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.040 
Dragoon from that position yeah i think
the<00:04:41.130> harangue<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.610> going<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.970> think<00:04:42.570> that<00:04:42.690> he's

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
the harangue is going to think that he's

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.379 
the harangue is going to think that he's
down<00:04:43.259> at<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.410> lower<00:04:43.860> left<00:04:44.250> he's<00:04:45.030> gonna<00:04:45.180> see

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
down at the lower left he's gonna see

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.790 
down at the lower left he's gonna see
nothing<00:04:45.690> down<00:04:45.840> there<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.110> go<00:04:46.199> wait<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> second

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
nothing down there and go wait a second

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.350 
nothing down there and go wait a second
but<00:04:46.889> that's<00:04:47.190> not<00:04:47.310> right<00:04:47.520> that's<00:04:48.090> how<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.270> you

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
but that's not right that's how that you

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.240 
but that's not right that's how that you
can<00:04:48.509> come<00:04:48.720> from<00:04:48.900> down<00:04:49.080> there<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:49.530> think<00:04:50.160> is

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
can come from down there I think is

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.830 
can come from down there I think is
going<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.430> be<00:04:50.520> extremely<00:04:50.850> confusing<00:04:51.509> for

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
going to be extremely confusing for

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.640 
going to be extremely confusing for
harangue<00:04:52.820> but<00:04:53.820> James<00:04:54.419> booming<00:04:54.810> up<00:04:54.930> he<00:04:55.080> has<00:04:55.320> I

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
harangue but James booming up he has I

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.379 
harangue but James booming up he has I
think<00:04:56.100> he<00:04:56.190> has<00:04:56.280> two<00:04:56.460> gateways<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:57.060> harangue

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
think he has two gateways and harangue

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.749 
think he has two gateways and harangue
has<00:04:57.660> one<00:04:57.960> if<00:04:58.199> I<00:04:58.320> saw<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.740> correctly<00:04:59.130> but<00:04:59.639> to

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
has one if I saw that correctly but to

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.110 
has one if I saw that correctly but to
take<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.940> look<00:05:00.150> again<00:05:00.419> at<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:02.430> main<00:05:02.729> for

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
take a look again at the the main for

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.909 
take a look again at the the main for
her<00:05:03.270> rang<00:05:03.509> and<00:05:03.720> not<00:05:03.840> sure<00:05:03.990> if<00:05:04.110> he<00:05:04.229> well<00:05:04.800> we
