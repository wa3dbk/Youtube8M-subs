00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.300 
money the best way in my opinion would
be<00:04:08.970> put<00:04:09.360> nine<00:04:09.660> people<00:04:09.990> on<00:04:10.260> maples<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.010> that'll

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
be put nine people on maples and that'll

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.550 
be put nine people on maples and that'll
get<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.670> eight<00:04:11.970> hundred<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.540> two<00:04:12.840> maples<00:04:13.470> a

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
get you eight hundred and two maples a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.010 
get you eight hundred and two maples a
day<00:04:13.740> so<00:04:14.160> you'll<00:04:14.340> still<00:04:14.610> get<00:04:14.700> nests<00:04:15.390> but<00:04:15.870> then

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
day so you'll still get nests but then

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.599 
day so you'll still get nests but then
you<00:04:16.170> can<00:04:16.290> put<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.470> one<00:04:16.620> extra<00:04:17.100> person<00:04:17.310> on

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
you can put that one extra person on

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.610 
you can put that one extra person on
something<00:04:17.970> else<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.840> put<00:04:18.989> six<00:04:19.230> people

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
something else so you can put six people

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.670 
something else so you can put six people
on<00:04:19.830> herbs<00:04:20.340> or<00:04:21.000> seeds<00:04:21.480> which<00:04:22.020> you<00:04:22.140> probably<00:04:22.320> the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
on herbs or seeds which you probably the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.140 
on herbs or seeds which you probably the
best<00:04:22.890> money<00:04:23.130> unless<00:04:23.520> you're<00:04:23.880> after

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
best money unless you're after

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.390 
best money unless you're after
something's<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:24.930> coal<00:04:25.380> or<00:04:25.410> teak<00:04:26.130> or

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
something's like coal or teak or

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.680 
something's like coal or teak or
mahogany<00:04:26.729> or<00:04:27.120> so

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
mahogany or so

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.190 
mahogany or so
he<00:04:27.780> tells<00:04:28.970> ya<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.150> whichever<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.570> prefer

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
he tells ya so whichever you prefer

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.240 
he tells ya so whichever you prefer
but<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.430> sell<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.790> Maples<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.800> 80k<00:04:34.800> day

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
but you can sell the Maples for 80k day

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.760 
but you can sell the Maples for 80k day
because<00:04:35.490> you're<00:04:35.640> selling<00:04:36.530> roughly<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.560> hundred

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
because you're selling roughly a hundred

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.230 
because you're selling roughly a hundred
each<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.460> think<00:04:38.640> they're<00:04:38.790> worth<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.060> bit

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
each but I think they're worth a bit

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.820 
each but I think they're worth a bit
more<00:04:39.420> than<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:39.780> that's<00:04:40.170> obviously<00:04:40.650> going

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
more than that so that's obviously going

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.890 
more than that so that's obviously going
to<00:04:40.890> be<00:04:40.950> more<00:04:41.160> profit<00:04:41.520> right<00:04:41.640> there<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.690> that's

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
to be more profit right there and that's

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.860 
to be more profit right there and that's
still<00:04:43.320> just<00:04:43.620> regarding<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> herbs<00:04:44.870> slash

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
still just regarding the herbs slash

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.530 
still just regarding the herbs slash
seed<00:04:46.290> slash<00:04:46.770> nest<00:04:47.190> slash<00:04:47.760> everything<00:04:48.360> else

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
seed slash nest slash everything else

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.720 
seed slash nest slash everything else
that<00:04:48.930> you're<00:04:49.620> getting<00:04:49.920> with<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.160> extra<00:04:50.460> six

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730
