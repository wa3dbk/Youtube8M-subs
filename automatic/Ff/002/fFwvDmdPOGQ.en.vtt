00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
that a good concert set was start with a

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.910

bang

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.340 
bang
end<00:00:18.039> with<00:00:18.640> a<00:00:18.670> bang<00:00:18.910> and<00:00:19.180> then<00:00:19.300> everything<00:00:20.260> in

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
the middle doesn't matter and so you

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.620

what<00:02:01.460> may<00:02:01.970> be<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.210> main<00:02:02.420> theme<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.110> song

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
what may be the main theme of the song

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.870 
what may be the main theme of the song
was<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.220> wouldn't<00:02:04.580> want<00:02:04.820> to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
was and that I wouldn't want to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.630 
was and that I wouldn't want to
necessarily<00:02:05.000> play<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.110> just<00:02:06.140> exact<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:07.190> would

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
necessarily play it just exact I would

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.030 
necessarily play it just exact I would
look<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.210> like<00:02:08.780> theme<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.290> variations<00:02:09.920> you

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
look to like theme and variations you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.280 
look to like theme and variations you
sort<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.760> figure<00:02:11.390> out<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.570> way<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.810> give<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.230> a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
sort of figure out a way to give it a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.830 
sort of figure out a way to give it a
little<00:02:12.500> bit<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.740> variety<00:02:12.890> or<00:02:13.310> color<00:02:13.550> then<00:02:14.180> if<00:02:14.660> I

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
little bit of variety or color then if I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.870 
little bit of variety or color then if I
was<00:02:14.990> trying<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.230> develop<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.950> solo<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:16.850> I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
was trying to develop the solo then I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.640 
was trying to develop the solo then I
would<00:02:17.120> think<00:02:17.210> okay<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:17.510> now<00:02:17.780> I'm<00:02:18.260> supposed<00:02:18.560> to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
would think okay so now I'm supposed to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.280 
would think okay so now I'm supposed to
maybe<00:02:18.920> show<00:02:19.370> off<00:02:19.520> some<00:02:19.730> chops<00:02:20.000> or<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:20.660> get<00:02:21.230> a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
maybe show off some chops or or get a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.210 
maybe show off some chops or or get a
little<00:02:21.530> busier<00:02:23.050> rant<00:02:24.050> ratchet<00:02:24.530> up<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.740> energy

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
little busier rant ratchet up the energy

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.550 
little busier rant ratchet up the energy
that's<00:02:25.400> going<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.270> now<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.510> might<00:02:27.020> employ

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
that's going on so now I might employ

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.040 
that's going on so now I might employ
techniques<00:02:28.160> like<00:02:28.340> pull<00:02:28.640> offs<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.660> get<00:02:29.840> more

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
techniques like pull offs to get more

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.190 
techniques like pull offs to get more
notes<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.440> shorter<00:02:31.070> spaces<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.640> time

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.970 

use<00:02:36.069> kind<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.700> scales<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.569> build<00:02:37.870> upon<00:02:38.080> that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
use kind of scales to build upon that

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.470 
use kind of scales to build upon that
kind<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.040> stuff<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.519> that<00:02:42.940> would<00:02:43.060> create<00:02:43.269> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
kind of stuff and that would create the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.850 
kind of stuff and that would create the
energy<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.870> now<00:02:43.989> you're<00:02:44.170> getting<00:02:44.290> towards

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
energy and now you're getting towards

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.130 
energy and now you're getting towards
the<00:02:45.280> ending<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.150> go<00:02:46.480> back<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.930> Keith

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the ending so to go back to the Keith

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.020 
the ending so to go back to the Keith
Moon<00:02:47.349> thing<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.310> know<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.519> start<00:02:49.000> with

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
Moon thing you know you start with

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.520 
Moon thing you know you start with
something<00:02:49.420> good<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.319> end<00:02:50.500> with

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
something good and you end with

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.229 
something good and you end with
something<00:02:50.860> good<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.430> look<00:02:51.580> for<00:02:51.819> something

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
something good you look for something

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.440 
something good you look for something
that<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.680> know<00:02:53.769> caps<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.580> solo<00:02:54.819> for<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.269> end

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
that you know caps the solo for the end

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.680 
that you know caps the solo for the end
so<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.319> might<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.769> don't<00:02:57.519> know<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.790> might<00:02:58.510> use<00:02:58.660> a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
so you might I don't know I might use a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.930 
so you might I don't know I might use a
two<00:02:58.959> string<00:02:59.230> band<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:03.160> has<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> real<00:03:03.610> truck

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
two string band it has a real truck

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.170 
two string band it has a real truck
brakes<00:03:04.239> kind<00:03:04.629> of<00:03:04.780> whoo<00:03:05.489> kind<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.610> sound<00:03:06.849> to<00:03:06.970> it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
brakes kind of whoo kind of sound to it

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.059 
brakes kind of whoo kind of sound to it
that<00:03:07.450> works<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.840> know<00:03:07.959> there's<00:03:08.140> other<00:03:08.290> ones

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.530 

something<00:03:12.069> like<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.610> think<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.390> mistake

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
something like that I think the mistake

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.900 
something like that I think the mistake
that<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.930> lot<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.230> guitar<00:03:14.500> players<00:03:14.769> make<00:03:15.670> with

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
that a lot of guitar players make with

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.390 
that a lot of guitar players make with
solos<00:03:16.299> is<00:03:16.510> they<00:03:16.630> think<00:03:16.690> oh<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:16.989> have<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.920> you

there are easy things to do to make lots
of<00:03:38.349> notes<00:03:38.590> happen<00:03:39.069> like<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.780> play

of notes happen like you can play
arpeggios<00:03:41.859> that<00:03:42.459> pull<00:03:42.700> off<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.000> open<00:03:43.299> shape

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
arpeggios that pull off to open shape

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.990 
arpeggios that pull off to open shape
and<00:03:45.630> that's<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.920> gives<00:03:48.220> energy<00:03:48.459> without

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
and that's it gives energy without

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.319 
and that's it gives energy without
necessarily<00:03:49.810> being<00:03:50.280> overly<00:03:51.280> crazy<00:03:51.639> busy<00:03:52.239> as
