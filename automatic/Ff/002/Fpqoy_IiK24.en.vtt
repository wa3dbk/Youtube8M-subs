00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello, we are today on a comparative 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.990
 review of such 2 mods in my opinion 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.160
 comparative review will be more interesting than 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.380
 separate review 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.389
 of these knives and so we have 746 mura and mora 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.890
 companion in g both 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.400
 They are from stainless steel, in principle, that's it 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.930
 companions I have a few options 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 besides this option there are five more 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.179
 other colors have a rater option 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 and there are options with carbon ki option from 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.670
 carbon ki in the bus a little bit longer 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 there are two and a half then somewhere two 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.750
 millimeter that is another option m jeep not 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.370
 heavy duty x see 32 millimeters and x 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.469
 see it chill so be 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 neat option 740 746 the sea is still there 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.170
 in carbon the whale is already called 711 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.039
 mora also they have a little bit different 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.660
 positioning is the manufacturer 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.559
 companion is positioned here as 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.590
 the knife is such a convenient tourist 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.549
 746 Mura is positioned as such itself 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 construction knife and so let's start 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.110
 means all the characteristics of all that is possible 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.570
 trying on will be as always under the video 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.900
 and we begin with need means there is no such 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.000
 interesting nuance in 746 the sea ​​the thing is 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.640
 that she doesn't quite have a mount 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.810
 under the belt through reality here 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.020
 Of course the belt for the fate of well, for example, my 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.020
 belt 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.380
 in general, we see some sort of crash 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.580
 if it comes in here 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.220
 it would seem on such a narrow strap 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.830
 which actually has a little more 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.520
 two and a half centimeters wide but 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.290
 here it is so here it is barely barely barely all 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.820
 the fact is that this one is 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.680
 Largely not intended to 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 plenty of belts for special 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.520
 suspensions 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.040
 they are separately sold principle e100 on 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.190
 two knives are also in principle 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.430
 gimmick on some knives you have here 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.250
 such a kind of puff like that and we 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.780
 we can 2 clicked so connect that is 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.350
 they will be on a belt with us like this 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.610
 hang a companion to a greater extent 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.810
 intended for this business because 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.640
 Well, actually here for this and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.750
 positioned maximum width 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.830
 belt we will have about 4 and a half 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.830
 centimeters thick live semi 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.390
 centimeter it is possible to shove here 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.020
 if we have a thin belt 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.380
 about four 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.600
 a few centimeters less than four 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.820
 centimeters can shove here well 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.820
 thickness so two millimeters is the maximum 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.320
 also this mount allows you to mount 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.450
 on the button but the fact is that it is better 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.620
 just he fits on a cubic of such 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.260
 here's a plan like on pants 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.500
 but worn at this place and no matter how well 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.950
 quite my interesting and the thickness we 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.830
 see which one here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.800
 that is, not every button here 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.420
 here it will normally pass but the buttons on 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.950
 shirts are likely to just come off 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.170
 over time also another one said on 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.890
 the company does not have here the clip is worth it 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.769
 There is a need to shoot the name now 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:46.180
 let's look at the finger guards in 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.400
 port for a finger on the sea 746 very such 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.890
 small and 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.989
 pronounced that is reality 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.120
 It is not very convenient to do this . 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.439
 our rubber grip sits well 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.579
 I need an operation 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.950
 here is a place on a companion here 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.799
 more pronounced more comfortable and here 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:15.560
 you can freely do it already 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.560
 do with one hand that's problematic 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:26.240
 on the hilt the hilt on the 746 sea 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.740
 almost completely rubberized as we see 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.770
 plastic interior protrude 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.389
 only here here and how would she more 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.979
 surround is likely to be suitable for people 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.410
 with a small hand 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.669
 the handle on the companion about lysing here 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.280
 only in the middle here with us 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:45.180
 plastic parts 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.669
 let's look at the handle on the 746 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.510
 the sea, it is more rough and better sitting 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.729
 in hand but at the same time as for me for 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.639
 my hand, it is less convenient than a companion 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.910
 there are also complaints about this 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.710
 the thing is that here is this thing 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.680
 fastened in the sheath there over there 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:10.110
 such a bump we will try now 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.840
 show here you can see a little here 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.960
 But this thing can be kept on 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.570
 sheath and in time I complain that this 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.979
 thing is erased 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.030
 here we have this thing plastic and 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.090
 no problem but the fact is that this 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.630
 Nozhika new this, too, in principle, we 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.630
 half a year somewhere 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.670
 regarding blades barret his blades 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:43.180
 the same but me and the connection one thing 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:45.790
 to boo on 746 sea it is not processed not 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.250
 have here is such a view but this plague 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:53.560
 cheaper difference between these knives 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.710
 about 4 bucks, that is, it's 30 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.340
 hryvnia a little less pop in the same 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.510
 case 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.690
 here on the companion it is processed by 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.660
 dimensions are the same and also 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:12.280
 there is such a nuance but I don't know maybe 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.290
 it is as if simply possible 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.140
 there is just a little scatter in 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.910
 sharpening and maybe a little bit different 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.360
 behind . goes me that is how we are here 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:30.130
 we see about seven millimeters here 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:33.430
 this one is about six downhill here 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:37.480
 a little more than 6 but this knife is a sharpener but how 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.430
 would not be so shob strongly on the shank who 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.370
 may want to see a reference 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.990
 The reference will be on offsight regarding 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.940
 this knife that is there it is shown that 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.690
 the shank somewhere here comes to the letter a 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.540
 that would be so healthy here 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.490
 a link to the forum where it was cut then 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.370
 there are but they are the same too somewhere here 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.750
 here is the shank but 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.479
 well let's see how good 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.750
 they sit new then there so here 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:08.410
 shake out your words and suffer also 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:11.650
 some but if the price is well tried 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:17.520
 this one is basically possible with such 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:20.110
 good blow here that is these pole 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.740
 holding on to the necessary waving them fate 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.330
 absolutely not necessarily can fly away 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.080
 it is with the same knife do it much 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.740
 harder it is also possible in principle 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.440
 You can also generally say according to 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.039
 good cheap scandinavian knives 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.900
 geometry good hands lie ergonomic 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.910
 in this case, here if the color is still 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.130
 it will be good on the belt hanging us here 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.539
 Of course, you need to specifically mount 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.050
 buy what's normal for a belt 

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:49.490
 hang not very well yourself 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.810
 they show on a tree 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.500
 that is, one can even say one of 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:57.460
 best on a tree well, so basically everything 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.460
 bye everyone
