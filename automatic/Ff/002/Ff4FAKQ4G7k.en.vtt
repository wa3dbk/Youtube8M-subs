 ancestral for generations 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.619
 traditional peasants have been 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.390
 forgotten but now they are the ones 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.619
 they have the key to a wide variety of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.619
 very precious foods 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.560
 as here in the Andes 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.360
 the farmers cultivate varieties of 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.090
 potatoes that are given only in this 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.180
 region and now demand the best 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:55.059
 restaurants around the world that have 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.059
 brought to this phase beautiful 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.230
 pedro miguel schiaffino is owner 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.009
 from one of the best restaurants in the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.340
 Malabar world and greatly appreciates the 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.710
 traditional potatoes of Peru not only for 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.399
 its flavor and variety but also for its 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.399
 nutritional value 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:21.080
 in the future people will 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.430
 worry more about feeding better and not 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.440
 plus 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.990
 for these chefs it is not only important 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.920
 the food itself but also how it has 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.170
 been cultivated 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.229
 not long ago this Andean region was a 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.270
 center of Maoist insurgents a place 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.640
 of violence and bloodshed 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.580
 today it is the cradle of another kind of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.399
 revolution of solidarity between 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.590
 chefs and peasants before their tragic 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.600
 death in 2012 the acclaimed chef Ivan 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.520
 castle I visited regularly from 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.259
 these places to pay tribute to the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 mother earth together with seven others 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.650
 farmers as cooks already several 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.890
 years that seems unfair 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.140
 that the main executors of the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.570
 products that we have in our tables 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.640
 nowadays we cook in the kitchens 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.740
 do not have a decent life 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.540
 That's why chefs demand a change 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.880
 they want to ensure that these peasants 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.459
 can continue to grow the products 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.459
 traditional and live with dignity 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.320
 also that is the goal of life the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.180
 UN agency that exists between the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.050
 small farmers to improve their 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.670
 income according to mike appel tola 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.620
 representative of the organization what 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.210
 these beings are doing has a 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.280
 enormous impact on the lives of 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.280
 peasants and the stability of Peru 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.370

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.580
 experience is really band country and 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.330

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.880

 this food revolution of the chefs 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.390
 is the center of the debate about the future 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.390
 of food and agriculture 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.120

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.880
 social change

 today it is in the festival of the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.590
 native potato of Peru to highlight the 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.819
 importance of the relationship between chefs and 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.469
 farmers 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.700
 and clearly the cooks 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.700
 we found in a privileged position 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.379
 and it is our duty to make those who 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.799
 are in that chain have the same 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.609
 benefits and opportunities and successes that 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.400

 that the collaboration between the peasants 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.819
 and the chefs is crucial although the most 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.489
 important to us to seal that 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.370
 alliance teach the alliance but under the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:56.109
