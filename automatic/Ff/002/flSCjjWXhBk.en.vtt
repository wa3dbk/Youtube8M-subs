we'll have some leftover snow showers or

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
we'll have some leftover snow showers or
flurries<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> morning<00:01:23.790> hours<00:01:24.060> finally

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there you go all the snow clears out by

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.630 
there you go all the snow clears out by
