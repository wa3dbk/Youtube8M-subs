00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.800
 the caesar for those who will take a few days 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.210
 will enjoy traveling to 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.250
 car is already here to give some 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.649
 maintenance tips 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.630
 the engine is in your house he can 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.970
 check some basic items the 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.189
 first item to be checked would be the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.290
 engine oil level and reaching the street 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.790
 wait 15 minutes for the oil to 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.610
 back to the case 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.710
 she has a correct indication of the book 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.840
 next step is to check would be the level 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.250
 of the coolant 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.190
 it is very important that the person 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.350
 check this with the cold engine here 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.930
 inside it in liquid is under 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.360
 pressure when the person opens the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.620
 cover can burn the powers that 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 they chose car but clean 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.230
 but I can not gasoline is very common is 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.140
 only come with that watering can 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.850
 put water and everything not even in the car two 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.610
 places that can be put into the water 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.030
 would be in the liquid reservoir of 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.619
 cooling system and in the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.609
 Washer cleaner for breeze can 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.619
 put a neutral detergent 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.810
 windscreen wiper of a product 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.310
 not the rubber attack of the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.200
 brake fluid cleaner a detail that 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.899
 deserves special attention 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.450
 first if the fluid from the level of the 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.090
 brake fluid is low should not 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.859
 be completed then it is in the reservoir 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.529
 there is a sensor that will indicate 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.779
 of this low flu and boot fluid level 

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:46.630
 than that usually the same lamp 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:49.029
 which indicates that the handbrake has been pulled 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.450
 that lamp starts to light up with the 

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.450
 moving car 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.000
 is that the person can check the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.400
 lighting is also an easy way to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.390
 person start the car contact 100 of 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.180
 lanterns 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.300
 then 100 of the headlights for a 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.110
 right side to the other single point that 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.880
 the person will need help in order to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.520
 check the brake lamps then a 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.890
 person is sitting on the car on the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.880
 driver back there, he checks that all 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.930
 the freight lamps do not light up 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.900
 how the person can check 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.830
 tire wear in your own home 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.840
 in the garage 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.130
 the first is flipping the wheel to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.790
 one side 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:40.580
 how am I going to do now in that position? 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.930
 person has a full view of the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.630
 tire tread 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.700
 so he can check the wear 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.290
 as a whole of tires and also the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.200
 depth of the tire groove 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.540
 normally on the side of the tire in the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.560
 it always has an indication or 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.120
 a small number or the acronym tw is important 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.190
 get released also step I go 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.840
 show the steppe of this car here is 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.850
 It is also important for the person to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.070
 the steppe is really there right 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.890
 always check if it is tight 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.470
 local and also in tool set 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.140
 the triangle and the monkey careful 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.209
 maintenance is a way of having a 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.209
 safe trip back 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.420
 also to be edited later in the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.450
 house but so relaxed here is a lot 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.450
 quiet
