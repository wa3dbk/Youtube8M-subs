00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.940
 in melbourne and dubai will leave me 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.970
 ok so I introduce myself 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.200
 Nice riktigt 23 years old singer I 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.840
 recently signed on label my major 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.280
 company and I prepare my first album 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.280
 with emma 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.870
 most people know by 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 report to my eyes on youtube so 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.820
 especially heart attack of half lovato and 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.989
 10.6 halloween so it's halloween 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.489
 it's the most popular going soon 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.470
 to reach the 5000 of view is very 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.879
 cool 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.420
 after me I started singing towards 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.730
 the age of 11 at the age of 13 I 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.100
 started to go in a little bit to 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 the school good I'm starting to have landed a 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.690
 fire was not too much my thing 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.239
 as soon as I could stop 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.610
 course left high school at age 16 I'm 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:16.450
 left I devoted myself to music to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:18.520
 my passion teaser concept 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.570
 so that's from an idea I had 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.000
 in fact, the same, it's really 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 Finally, I was really inspired by 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.340
 fantastic cinema of fairy tales 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.170
 this is childhood 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.179
 I really wanted to present a 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.979
 quite wide palette of the album 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.600
 and from my universe by showing several 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.799
 different characters characters with 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.450
 different musical styles and that's it 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.560
 it's pretty barred it's pretty true but 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.649
 it's at the same time that's what I'm 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.789
 so here I did that hoping 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.250
 that we can not put myself 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.459
 of etiquette and I hope that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.459
 it succeeded 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 so in my album there will be really 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.950
 a little bit everything is really a mix of 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.360
 styles as I said just now 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.360
 I do not want to put a label 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.860
 a priori yes there will be featurings 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.989
 guests on this album for the moment 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.410
 I do not really want to keep 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.660
 surprise 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:29.260
 but am I going to have some 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:33.099
 invited to its costs so I have a universe 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.790
 quite vast enough offbeat so the games 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.280
 video and manga are part of it 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.440
 is comic this I am a big fan 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.459
 Joker so it's the wicked 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.880
 meats aged in batman 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.650
 I like a lot, otherwise I'm inspired 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.579
 a lot of tim fantasy cinema 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.090
 burton terry gilliam fairy tales 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:57.340
 here I am a bit of a big kid 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.930
 and then next to that I have a big 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.760
 passionate about hip hop since my most 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.860
 young age 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.760
 so it's going to give a pretty good result 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.980
 nice 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.770
 he combines three mortals I condemn 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.000
 with the everlasting attempt at nicotine 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.860
 I make a cross to appear a 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.960
 mango hemoglobin tuesday 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.810
 without their partner while cooking joker5 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.410
 poker and I 'll be your harley quinn walk 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.430
 back in career I imagine 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.620
 I imagine long bale I imagine them 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.660
 with I imagine I see myself on stage already 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.150
 because I really need to do 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.940
 of the scene to start in any case to 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.560
 lead on stage the proximity with the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.420
 public all that I really need 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.510
 and I really hope to be able to express myself 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.310
 on stage as I do on my album 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.380
 with crazy outfits of 2.2 and with a 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.640
 dd true concept of beautiful staging 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.730
 all this is that it really is 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.920
 theatrical and then here I hope that 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.569
 I will have in I will be able to launch my 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.709
 career already in the advanced and then to the 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.709
 to endure after
