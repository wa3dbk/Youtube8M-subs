for the close combat here playing it

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.110 
for the close combat here playing it
very<00:07:07.080> risky<00:07:07.800> since<00:07:07.950> I<00:07:08.010> cannot<00:07:08.340> out<00:07:08.490> speed<00:07:08.850> and

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
very risky since I cannot out speed and

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.030 
very risky since I cannot out speed and
I<00:07:09.690> prigs<00:07:10.020> that<00:07:10.140> very<00:07:10.470> nicely<00:07:10.710> because<00:07:10.920> he

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
I prigs that very nicely because he

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.790 
I prigs that very nicely because he
sends<00:07:11.340> in<00:07:11.400> wash<00:07:11.640> Rotom<00:07:11.940> here<00:07:12.240> and<00:07:12.630> I<00:07:13.200> and<00:07:13.500> since

sends in wash Rotom here and I and since

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.470 
sends in wash Rotom here and I and since
it<00:07:13.950> actually<00:07:14.220> has<00:07:14.370> leftovers<00:07:14.940> I<00:07:15.090> could<00:07:15.270> kill

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
it actually has leftovers I could kill

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.660 
it actually has leftovers I could kill
