00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
main line which I'll just slip that just

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.530 
main line which I'll just slip that just
slides<00:01:21.619> through<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:22.340> that's<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.060> important

thing<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.840> actually<00:01:24.170> make<00:01:24.799> sure<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:25.280> line<00:01:25.939> is

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
thing to actually make sure you line is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.139 
thing to actually make sure you line is
clips<00:01:26.540> in<00:01:27.399> instead<00:01:28.399> of<00:01:28.520> free<00:01:28.700> spool<00:01:28.939> we've

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
actually just lightened the drag right

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.050 
actually just lightened the drag right
off<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.039> just<00:01:31.130> gonna<00:01:31.340> run<00:01:31.520> out<00:01:31.549> nice<00:01:31.850> and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
off so it's just gonna run out nice and

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
and you've got a counter on this side

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.890 
and you've got a counter on this side
and<00:01:38.830> just<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.310> line<00:01:39.549> will<00:01:39.790> run<00:01:39.909> often<00:01:40.299> off<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
and just the line will run often off the

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.310 
and just the line will run often off the
reel<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:42.430> watching<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.880> counter<00:01:43.150> like<00:01:44.140> an
