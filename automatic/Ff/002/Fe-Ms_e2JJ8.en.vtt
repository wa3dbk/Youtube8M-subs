00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.160 

the<00:02:28.300> core<00:02:28.659> that's<00:02:28.959> kind<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.409> like

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.970

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:19.480

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.420 

and<00:03:49.120> hopefully<00:03:49.900> when<00:03:50.379> I<00:03:50.410> speak<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.099> little<00:03:51.250> bit

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
and hopefully when I speak a little bit

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.580 
and hopefully when I speak a little bit
louder<00:03:51.519> it's<00:03:52.269> also<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.260> lot<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:53.680> bad<00:03:55.319> maybe<00:03:56.319> it

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
louder it's also a lot so bad maybe it

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.970 
louder it's also a lot so bad maybe it
sounds<00:03:57.340> even<00:03:57.430> better<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:58.060> talk<00:03:58.989> quietly<00:03:59.470> but

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
sounds even better if I talk quietly but

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.020 
sounds even better if I talk quietly but
not<00:04:00.459> quite<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.940> whisper<00:04:02.459> but<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.519> think<00:04:03.910> it

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
not quite in the whisper but I think it

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.740 
not quite in the whisper but I think it
sounds<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.420> little<00:04:04.540> too<00:04:04.870> raspy

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
sounds a little too raspy

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.490 
sounds a little too raspy
