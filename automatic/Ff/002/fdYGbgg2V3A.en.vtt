00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.190 
see how the late how the the Leafs are
misaligned<00:01:48.259> going<00:01:49.259> forward<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.860> backward<00:01:50.280> I

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
misaligned going forward and backward I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.120 
misaligned going forward and backward I
don't<00:01:52.200> quite<00:01:52.710> understand<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.460> at<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:55.130> now

towards<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.209> back<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.599> truck<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.110> I'm

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
towards the back of the truck so I'm

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720 
towards the back of the truck so I'm
taking<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> picture<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> front<00:02:11.220> end<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
taking a picture of the front end of the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.000 
taking a picture of the front end of the
leaf<00:02:11.910> springs

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
leaf springs

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.070 
leaf springs
and<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:14.000> can<00:02:14.150> see<00:02:14.390> how<00:02:14.540> they're<00:02:14.780> even

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and you can see how they're even

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.300 
and you can see how they're even
misaligned<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.370> one<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.940> left<00:02:17.209> side<00:02:18.310> well

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
misaligned the one on the left side well

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.070 
misaligned the one on the left side well
if<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.909> look<00:02:20.060> at<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.269> one<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.629> right<00:02:20.780> side

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
if you look at the one on the right side

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.410 
if you look at the one on the right side
you<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.440> there's<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.769> one<00:02:22.150> leaf<00:02:23.150> that's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
you can see there's that one leaf that's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.020 
you can see there's that one leaf that's
got<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:23.750> little<00:02:23.959> hole<00:02:24.200> drilled<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.159> it<00:02:25.310> okay

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
got the little hole drilled in it okay

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.350 
got the little hole drilled in it okay
well<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.049> other<00:02:27.170> side<00:02:27.879> you<00:02:28.879> can't<00:02:29.120> see

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
well on the other side you can't see

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.350 
well on the other side you can't see
that<00:02:29.540> hole<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.769> third<00:02:31.220> leaf<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
that hole because the third leaf is

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.900 
that hole because the third leaf is
covering<00:02:32.900> up<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:34.069> first<00:02:34.400> one<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:36.489> this<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:37.730> all

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
covering up the first one so this is all

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.490 
covering up the first one so this is all
really<00:02:38.090> kind<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.870> messed<00:02:39.110> up

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
really kind of messed up

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.710 
really kind of messed up
and<00:02:40.239> um<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.980> don't<00:02:42.980> understand<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:44.390> know<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.540> can

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.180 
and um I don't understand you know I can
kind<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.049> can<00:02:45.170> understand<00:02:45.799> how<00:02:45.920> they<00:02:46.069> would

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
kind of I can understand how they would

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.430 
kind of I can understand how they would
shift<00:02:46.459> side-to-side<00:02:47.000> sideways<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.319> going

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
shift side-to-side sideways but going

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.699 
shift side-to-side sideways but going
forward<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:48.980> backward<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.610> don't<00:02:49.819> know<00:02:50.709> now

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
forward and backward I don't know now

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.619 
forward and backward I don't know now
these<00:02:51.890> are<00:02:52.040> all<00:02:52.160> four<00:02:52.400> pictures<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.910> what<00:02:53.510> they

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
these are all four pictures of what they

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.190 
these are all four pictures of what they
look<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:56.390> pretty<00:02:56.750> much<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.079> I'm

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
look like and so pretty much what I'm

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.990 
look like and so pretty much what I'm
wondering<00:02:57.349> is<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:58.420> if<00:02:59.420> I<00:03:00.400> take<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.609> these

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
wondering is this if I take this these

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.130 
wondering is this if I take this these
all<00:03:02.030> apart<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.140> realign<00:03:03.859> all<00:03:04.549> these<00:03:05.140> leaf

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
all apart and realign all these leaf

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.930 
all apart and realign all these leaf
springs<00:03:06.530> together<00:03:09.069> which<00:03:10.069> is<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.700> weird

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
springs together which is so weird

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.369 
springs together which is so weird
because<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:14.540> makes<00:03:14.720> me<00:03:14.840> almost<00:03:14.959> wonder<00:03:15.260> if

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
because it makes me almost wonder if

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.339 
because it makes me almost wonder if
maybe<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.709> bolt<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.370> center<00:03:16.760> bolt<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.349> broke

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
maybe the bolt the center bolt is broke

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.640 
maybe the bolt the center bolt is broke
and<00:03:18.790> that's<00:03:19.790> why<00:03:19.970> these<00:03:20.030> these<00:03:20.660> leaves<00:03:21.349> are

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and that's why these these leaves are

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.580 
and that's why these these leaves are
sliding<00:03:22.040> forward<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.910> backward<00:03:23.349> but<00:03:24.349> I<00:03:24.380> don't

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
sliding forward and backward but I don't

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.280 
sliding forward and backward but I don't
really<00:03:24.739> see<00:03:24.859> that<00:03:25.040> happening<00:03:25.900> be<00:03:26.900> at<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.109> same

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
really see that happening be at the same

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.720 
really see that happening be at the same
time<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.530> can<00:03:27.709> also<00:03:27.829> understand<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.579> guy

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
time I can also understand that the guy

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.300 
time I can also understand that the guy
did<00:03:29.060> put<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.389> three-inch<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.590> know<00:03:30.709> kid<00:03:31.160> on

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
did put a three-inch you know kid on

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.430 
did put a three-inch you know kid on
here<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:32.120> maybe<00:03:32.299> he<00:03:32.450> assembled<00:03:32.930> these<00:03:33.079> Springs

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
here so maybe he assembled these Springs

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.659 
here so maybe he assembled these Springs
wrong<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.889> don't<00:03:36.980> know<00:03:37.190> what<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.639> think

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
wrong but and I don't know what to think

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.000 
wrong but and I don't know what to think
so<00:03:38.540> we're<00:03:38.720> right<00:03:38.900> now<00:03:39.049> on<00:03:39.319> eBay<00:03:39.680> looking

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
so we're right now on eBay looking

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.940 
so we're right now on eBay looking
around<00:03:40.130> for<00:03:40.940> leaf<00:03:41.359> springs<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.739> we<00:03:42.829> can

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
around for leaf springs that we can

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.309 
around for leaf springs that we can
replace<00:03:43.459> onto<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.120> truck<00:03:44.419> but<00:03:44.959> looking<00:03:45.230> at

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
replace onto the truck but looking at

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.379 
replace onto the truck but looking at
these<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:46.130> looks<00:03:46.310> like<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.519> springs<00:03:46.849> are<00:03:47.000> okay

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
these it looks like the springs are okay

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.629 
these it looks like the springs are okay
you<00:03:47.720> know<00:03:48.169> a<00:03:48.200> little<00:03:48.500> surface<00:03:49.280> for<00:03:49.400> us<00:03:49.489> of

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
you know a little surface for us of

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.449 
you know a little surface for us of
course<00:03:49.819> but<00:03:50.269> it<00:03:50.480> looks<00:03:51.109> like<00:03:51.169> our<00:03:51.459> biggest

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
course but it looks like our biggest

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.039 
course but it looks like our biggest
problem<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.120> they're<00:03:53.329> just<00:03:53.480> misaligned

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
problem is that they're just misaligned

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.720 
problem is that they're just misaligned
through<00:03:54.590> vibration<00:03:55.280> crap<00:03:55.669> so<00:03:57.250> for<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.459> car

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
through vibration crap so for you car

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.819 
through vibration crap so for you car
guys<00:03:58.940> out<00:03:59.150> there<00:03:59.180> if<00:04:00.109> I<00:04:00.319> were<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.500> take<00:04:00.680> this

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
guys out there if I were to take this

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.759 
guys out there if I were to take this
all<00:04:01.010> apart<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.690> redo<00:04:02.690> these<00:04:02.989> Springs<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.620> try

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
all apart and redo these Springs and try

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.099 
all apart and redo these Springs and try
to<00:04:03.829> get<00:04:03.980> their<00:04:04.129> alignment<00:04:04.370> set<00:04:04.819> back<00:04:05.030> up<00:04:05.239> what

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
to get their alignment set back up what

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.979 
to get their alignment set back up what
do<00:04:06.200> we<00:04:06.290> still<00:04:06.500> be<00:04:06.620> able<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.799> keep<00:04:06.980> using<00:04:07.220> these

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
do we still be able to keep using these

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.089 
do we still be able to keep using these
because<00:04:08.989> if<00:04:09.139> we<00:04:09.199> can<00:04:09.319> go<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.590> route<00:04:09.829> that's

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
because if we can go that route that's

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.800 
because if we can go that route that's
gonna<00:04:10.220> save<00:04:10.549> us<00:04:10.669> about<00:04:10.879> four<00:04:11.419> or<00:04:11.480> five<00:04:11.629> hundred

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
gonna save us about four or five hundred

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.770 
gonna save us about four or five hundred
bucks<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.560> my<00:04:13.129> ass<00:04:13.609> being<00:04:14.000> underneath<00:04:14.599> this

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
Springs or should we try to fix these

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.580 
Springs or should we try to fix these
because<00:04:43.370> we've<00:04:44.370> only<00:04:44.550> got<00:04:44.790> maybe<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.630> week<00:04:46.140> to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
because we've only got maybe a week to

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
do this a week for me to tear them all

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.600 
do this a week for me to tear them all
apart<00:04:50.850> well<00:04:51.600> not<00:04:52.140> really<00:04:52.380> but<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.830> know<00:04:52.860> if<00:04:53.220> if

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
apart well not really but you know if if

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.700
