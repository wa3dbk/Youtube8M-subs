00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 the idea that we have found it is to create a fictional family in the 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.800
 present 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.790
 that allows us to make the connection between the past and the present to come back 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.260
 very often in the present to make comparisons also between 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.189
 different aircraft 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.229
 compared to the past and so present and so the of to allow us to us 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:17.679
 escape from history and power 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.029
 a little bit broke the story 4 rhythm and so to go back and forth 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.039
 and that really allows us to stay 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.649
 on an interesting book 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.649
 paul jeanneteau drew in the cabbage cars the planes 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 eugène toulon so to impose no problem 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.070
 we actually have 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.800
 I started with my brother 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 she jumps d and tracing the album 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.230
 tanguy and washdure then asterisk or if of course 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.720
 I did that for ten years 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.550
 and then at some point we want to prove ourselves that we are able to 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.180
 do something else 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.180
 and just so I embarked on this adventure 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.230
 which is not very easy by the way 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 this back his first rise though still obvious 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.420
 Anyway 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.550
 I followed my little way 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.440
 you do not have to remove the losc 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.730
 working time who spent on asterix was at war with his 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.500
 brother 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.240
 but at the same time we also find very happy 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.490
 marcel uderzo bridge for drawing and not in relation to them what can be 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.670
 to do at eidos editions albert rené coll 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.250
 it was not at all different 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.090
 our concern besides we are putting very very well right now and 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.040
 his name originally I wanted I wanted to take a nickname a pseudonym 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740
 to conclude 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.280
 and happy first 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.160
 so 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.100
 melet the first losers the first people who did 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.830
 to work in the name not this side I change my name 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.800
 for obvious reasons 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.920
 p 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.750
 for finally I have I approved since I'm standing okay but he 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.790
 must do it 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.420
 but for name anyway marseille tent 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.140
 who by the way will be no more to my older brother if I signed up high 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 on axa aph his attack makes sense 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.830
 but that causes some problems of order from time to time even 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.479
 today besides geforce preview 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.859
 people automatically think that I am the author of series sponsors 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.139
 it's great and it's a problem it's a little problem speak very seriously 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.089
 but for the beginning the site needed moreover local problems 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.079
 All is relative 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.319
 but people can bring MPs a series of unions there 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.219
 glue 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.219
 today I announce that I see this collector 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.619
 it was always annoying for people 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.079
 I was happy to see the writing 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.309
 of this little corridor rodez 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.159
 but she meets 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.949
 it's a bit like this 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:47.509
 I've gotten used to
