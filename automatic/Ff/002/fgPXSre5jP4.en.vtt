00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.960
 very good everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.360
 video of my guide to legendary weapons 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.980
 borden 2 we continue with the pistols and 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.530
 play the wonderful the fantastic 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.849
 incredible infinite and I love this 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.840
 gun so he 's waiting a lot 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.830
 make this video 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.980
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.570
 get to the doctor's office seth a 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.550
 Once we arrived the Santuari for the first time 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.380
 and will give us a mission in which 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.720
 We will have to perform surgery on a 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.430
 uncle and after that we'll have to go to 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.260
 do and hoeness is worth in the second 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.730
 mission that you send us has killed the doctor 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.399
 piety that is based on our mission 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.899
 target once we get to wheat worth 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.870
 we will see that we will not have quick trips 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.660
 so we'll have to go to the hotel happy 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.550
 picks at happy feet motel 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.870
 in the rewards panel there will be a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.910
 mission that will make us the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.590
 the hotel's electricity will be restored 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.809
 activated when activated we will have 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.370
 the quick trip there as you will see and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.989
 we can travel directly to wheat the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.239
 badri every time we want so that 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.660
 we do this so that we have 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.879
 the doctor ask for much more accessible 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.050
 once we complete the mission once 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.580
 completed what we have to do is 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.649
 get to do with it is worth and ride 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.649
 on top of this geyser on the little corner 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.740
 looking for the exact point that throws us 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.690
 through the air and take us to the piquito 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.000
 the rock that passes the rock peg 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.820
 Well, as you can see there is a kind of skull 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.229
 giant of a kind of monster in 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.060
 that skull is where the doctor is 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.729
 mercy and why do we do this because 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.590
 Even if we fail twice it is 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.020
 much faster than doing it from the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.399
 conventional way that would be entering 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.790
 through the door and killing everyone 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.530
 psychopaths and reaching the walls 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.540
 once arrived, simply 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.880
 we have to kill him see if we've had 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.540
 luck and I have not had it out 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.520
 enter and do it again 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.110
 there you see I go up the stairs thinking 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.030
 that will come out of there but does not come out 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.830
 there because he had left before because 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.360
 had failed the first and is there 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.110
 down does not have much complication 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.110
 find him 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.580
 there we see what 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.100
 the results 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.070
 one of the best features 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.130
 of the infiniti 6 the characteristic 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.210
 main of infiniti 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.780
 that you can not hear or speak 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.870
 is that he has infinite ammunition as his 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.090
 name says it means after the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.460
 infinite only has one bullet and I was 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.050
 giving himself he never spent so he did not 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.460
 we will have to worry about ammunition 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.500
 of per charger because the charger 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.330
 we will have infinite another of your 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.340
 characteristics is you can leave 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.890
 any element can come out corrosive 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.090
 of electric fire of esla or without 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.680
 elements 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.900
 what I was looking for the same thing that 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.930
 come out of fire but I get corrosive 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.489
 so I stayed with the program that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.160
 I'm using for shooting tests 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.550
 a fire with the pre fix venge full 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.160
 because this gun is not affected 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.500
 by the pre fix that gives us two bullets per 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.920
 shots today they dance pistols and 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.290
 works very well even in 8 does not 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.599
 lack of even using the skill and 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.770
 phasing or anything to kill with 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.630
 she 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.650
 It's not as good as others but good 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.920
 it's still pretty good 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.210
 this gun is not affected by the 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.760
 profile that gives you two bullets per shot 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.550
 because since he only spends one and that one 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.800
 is infinite the game does not interpret what 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.510
 the two bullets for shots so let's go 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.010
 to have to look for it with the pre fix 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.870
 benji full which is what I have now 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.270
 same as what it does is upload a lot 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 the cadence and there right now I have it 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.390
 of fire because they batman the crop is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.190
 vulnerable to fire so you'll see what 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.520
 very easy to get off this guy with 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.460
 this weapon practically two seconds or 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.770
 so in another fact it also works the same 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.250
 of good well there is no equal a little less 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.300
 but it works quite well because 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.310
 practically all the enemies are the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.700
 easily load there you see that in the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.910
 charges without phasing them or using anything 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.890
 especially there is putting it in phase me what 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.250
 charge in a second but still I know what 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.450
 can kill practically well without using 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.060
 the ability 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.840
 now see how it works in 8 too 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.450
 it works pretty well 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.519
 brother and I did not have much trouble 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.720
 alda because he was lucky enough but in 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.989
 its time I had enough problems 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.460
 because I do not know I never had much luck with 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.639
 that guy even saw a video of an uncle 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.040
 arme andola that instead of leaving the 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.590
 infinite and he released another legendary weapon 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.050
 you see that that has a probability 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.240
 quite strange to this gentleman of 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.520
 drop it but if you do not release it let's go 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.330
 we are going to ejaculate flowers because it is a 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.430
 pretty good weapon there is no there sees and that 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.950
 I just downloaded it to batman with 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.500
 a phasing nothing else compared 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.660
 with the two or three I had to put it 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.979
 before an effect with the race but the 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.020
 cinnamon in what happens is that you spend a 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.669
 heap of ammunition this weapon does not waste 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.600
 nothing there you see that I have ammunition at 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.669
 stop at 900 and it does not lower me so that it does not 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.919
 it can serve very much it is armed then 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.780
 simply when we have other 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.400
 guns and I'm using and we 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.729
 we are without ammunition always not 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.469
 finally in high infiniti because of course 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.229
 we will never worry about the 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:21.349
 ammunition unless we have 000 of 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.120
 ammunition we will not be able to use it but 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.620
 while we have at least we are going to 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.509
 be able to use it as much as we want and not 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.610
 let's spend on the ammo was going to 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.860
 work pretty well at the time 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.990
 before more weapons were discovered and 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.210
 more methods to do things 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.669
 this was practically the best gun 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.740
 of the game next to the magic but then 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.469
 they put several patches and of course the 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.259
 things were getting worse little by little for 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.689
 this weapon but I still love it 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.699
 here we see the statistics the 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.499
 farm difficulty was a 3 because 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.029
 you have seen that it is a bit realistic 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.710
 but let 's go well 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:58.699
 the utility the utility of the soul is 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.960
 pretty good in both 8 and mode 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.090
 normal 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.560
 and I highly recommend you have a 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.710
 good damage good cadence all 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.910
 elements is pretty good and good I've 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.130
 here the video I hope you liked it 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.490
 if it has served you something you already know 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.169
 you can give it to like of you 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.360
 suggestions in the comments and 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.990
 subscribe for more come to the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.470
 next

 good shape or
