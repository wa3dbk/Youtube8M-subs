Commander Shepard from Mass Effect I
know<00:00:03.720> there's<00:00:03.990> been<00:00:04.080> some<00:00:04.410> talks<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.859> the

know there's been some talks about the
DLC<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.670> her<00:00:06.029> different<00:00:06.390> opinions<00:00:06.870> people

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
DLC and her different opinions people

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.110 
DLC and her different opinions people
have<00:00:07.560> but<00:00:08.040> personally<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.610> still<00:00:08.880> like<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
have but personally I still like the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.990 
have but personally I still like the
game<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> content<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.469> holds<00:00:11.000> anyways

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
game for the content it holds anyways

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.299 
game for the content it holds anyways
this<00:00:12.719> piece<00:00:13.049> took<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.710> longer<00:00:13.980> than<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this piece took a little longer than I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.519 
this piece took a little longer than I
thought<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:15.299> thing<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.719> difficult<00:00:15.960> was

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
thought one thing that was difficult was

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.650 
thought one thing that was difficult was
drawing<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.190> features<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:17.910> scale<00:00:18.420> at

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
drawing in the features at this scale at

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.230 
drawing in the features at this scale at
the<00:00:18.720> physical<00:00:19.410> angle<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.400> I'm<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.210> know

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the physical angle that I'm at you know

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.000 
the physical angle that I'm at you know
because<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:22.320> trying<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.619> draw<00:00:22.800> without

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
because I'm trying to draw without

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.220 
because I'm trying to draw without
getting<00:00:23.430> into<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.670> shot<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.900> would<00:00:25.109> definitely

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
getting into a shot it would definitely

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.500 
getting into a shot it would definitely
been<00:00:25.619> easier<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.220> drew<00:00:26.430> them<00:00:26.490> bigger<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
been easier if I drew them bigger but I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.859 
been easier if I drew them bigger but I
wanted<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.900> fit<00:00:28.199> other<00:00:28.470> things<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> window

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
wanted to fit other things in the window

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.240 
wanted to fit other things in the window
I'll<00:00:30.869> working<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.439> filling<00:00:31.740> his<00:00:31.920> upper<00:00:32.219> body

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
I'll working and filling his upper body

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.540 
I'll working and filling his upper body
and<00:00:32.550> work<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.030> his<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.420> arm<00:00:34.280> one<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.460> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and work on his right arm one thing I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.670 
and work on his right arm one thing I
liked<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> painted<00:00:36.840> draw<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
liked but was a painted draw where the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.490 
liked but was a painted draw where the
subtle<00:00:37.950> patterns<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.550> his<00:00:38.820> armor<00:00:39.120> I'm<00:00:40.020> adding

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
subtle patterns on his armor I'm adding

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
subtle patterns on his armor I'm adding
the<00:00:40.590> detail<00:00:40.950> strut<00:00:41.250> arm<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.820> try<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> shape<00:00:42.780> in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the detail strut arm and try to shape in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
the detail strut arm and try to shape in
his<00:00:43.079> closed<00:00:43.379> fist<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.100> marker<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> using

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
his closed fist with my marker and using

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.389 
his closed fist with my marker and using
my<00:00:45.420> wipers<00:00:45.989> mo<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.350> punch<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> knuckles

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
my wipers mo to punch out the knuckles

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.750 
my wipers mo to punch out the knuckles
so<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.910> reads<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.660> clenched<00:00:49.050> fist

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
so that it reads like a clenched fist

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.910 
so that it reads like a clenched fist
then<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.820> work<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> other<00:00:51.390> arm<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.020> decided

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
then I work on the other arm I decided

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
then I work on the other arm I decided
that<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.670> should<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> little<00:00:54.270> washed<00:00:54.660> out

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that it should be a little washed out

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.319 
that it should be a little washed out
with<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> latter<00:00:56.070> value<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.030> kind

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
with the latter value because it's kind

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.590 
with the latter value because it's kind
of<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> way<00:00:57.890> but<00:00:58.890> I'm<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> use<00:00:59.940> my<00:00:59.969> pencil

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of a way but I'm going to use my pencil

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.979 
of a way but I'm going to use my pencil
so<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.399> his<00:01:02.399> left<00:01:02.730> arm<00:01:03.030> doesn't<00:01:03.449> completely

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so that his left arm doesn't completely

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.240 
so that his left arm doesn't completely
lack<00:01:04.379> details<00:01:06.470> when<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.560> done<00:01:07.740> drawing<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
lack details when I'm done drawing in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.780 
lack details when I'm done drawing in
the<00:01:08.280> weapon<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.850> his<00:01:08.970> hand<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:09.990> work<00:01:10.200> down

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
the weapon on his hand I don't work down

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.179 
the weapon on his hand I don't work down
from<00:01:11.790> his<00:01:11.909> chest<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.479> his<00:01:13.439> core<00:01:13.740> section<00:01:14.040> just

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
from his chest and his core section just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.609 
from his chest and his core section just
took<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.700> long<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> draw<00:01:15.320> there<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> lot<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
took so long to draw there are a lot of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
took so long to draw there are a lot of
details<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> different<00:01:17.850> textures<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.540> mean<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
details and different textures I mean I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.990 
details and different textures I mean I
try<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> simplify<00:01:19.680> them<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.670> there

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
try to simplify them a little but there

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.320 
try to simplify them a little but there
are<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.390> many<00:01:21.500> different<00:01:22.500> sections<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
are just so many different sections and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.550 
are just so many different sections and
thinking<00:01:24.330> back<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.810> probably<00:01:25.170> wasn't<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
thinking back this probably wasn't the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.520 
thinking back this probably wasn't the
best<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> draw<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.960> what<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:27.990> mean<00:01:28.170> by<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
best way to draw it what I mean by that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.800 
best way to draw it what I mean by that
is<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.670> might<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.909> been<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.509> bit

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
is that it might have been a little bit

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
is that it might have been a little bit
easier<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.740> worked<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.100> pulling<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
easier if I worked on pulling in the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
easier if I worked on pulling in the
various<00:01:33.270> first<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.650> certain

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
various first and then going in certain

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.260 
various first and then going in certain
areas<00:01:35.250> versus<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.540> section<00:01:37.079> by<00:01:37.200> section

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
areas versus going section by section

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.880 
areas versus going section by section
i'm<00:01:39.270> using<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.600> prismacolor<00:01:40.380> pencil<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
i'm using my prismacolor pencil to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.550 
i'm using my prismacolor pencil to
divide<00:01:41.430> areas<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.240> add<00:01:42.450> texture<00:01:42.930> around<00:01:43.320> his

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
divide areas and add texture around his

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
divide areas and add texture around his
obliques<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:46.159> treated<00:01:47.159> his<00:01:47.310> legs<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:48.030> way

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
obliques I treated his legs the same way

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.450 
obliques I treated his legs the same way
starting<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.930> left<00:01:49.200> again<00:01:49.890> filling<00:01:50.340> in

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
starting with this left again filling in

prismacolor<00:01:55.350> pencil<00:01:56.299> there's<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.420> more

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
prismacolor pencil there's a more

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.030 
prismacolor pencil there's a more
mechanical<00:01:58.229> feel<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.829> late

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
mechanical feel and it's right late

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.670 
mechanical feel and it's right late

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
more exposed there are little details

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.800 
more exposed there are little details
like<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.160> pivotal<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.700> sip<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.239> kind<00:02:09.720> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
like the pivotal and sip that kind of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.219 
like the pivotal and sip that kind of
show

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
show

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.910 
show
how<00:02:10.560> his<00:02:10.920> armor<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.370> allow<00:02:11.640> them<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.849> run<00:02:12.920> so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
how his armor would allow them to run so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.119 
how his armor would allow them to run so
that's<00:02:14.400> pretty<00:02:14.730> much<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:16.549> so<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.830> guys<00:02:20.010> I

stripper<00:02:26.489> as<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> male<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.269> female<00:02:27.750> character

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
stripper as a male or female character

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.990 
stripper as a male or female character
and<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.950> thought<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.340> was<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> great<00:02:29.760> opportunity

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and I thought it was a great opportunity

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.259 
and I thought it was a great opportunity
to<00:02:30.780> compare<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> two<00:02:31.410> or<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.610> more<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> how<00:02:33.239> I

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
to compare the two or it's more of how I

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.020 
to compare the two or it's more of how I
would<00:02:33.660> compare<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.140> two<00:02:34.340> her<00:02:35.340> head<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.610> pretty

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
would compare the two her head is pretty

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.789 
would compare the two her head is pretty
much<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.209> same<00:02:36.540> size<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.230> you'll<00:02:37.530> see<00:02:37.769> that

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
much the same size and you'll see that

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.680 
much the same size and you'll see that
it's<00:02:38.220> pretty<00:02:38.400> much<00:02:38.579> her<00:02:38.849> frame<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.480> makes

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
it's pretty much her frame that makes

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.259 
it's pretty much her frame that makes
her<00:02:39.840> more<00:02:39.989> distinguishable<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> male

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
her more distinguishable like a male

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.420 
her more distinguishable like a male
version<00:02:42.540> her<00:02:43.170> facial<00:02:43.680> features<00:02:43.890> were<00:02:44.400> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
version her facial features were a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.580 
version her facial features were a
little<00:02:44.640> difficult<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.269> draw<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.870> mean

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
little difficult to draw I mean

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.039 
little difficult to draw I mean
especially<00:02:46.769> her<00:02:47.250> hair<00:02:47.489> well<00:02:48.299> all<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.510> can<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:49.019> is

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
especially her hair well all I can do is

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.500 
especially her hair well all I can do is
try<00:02:49.769> my<00:02:49.890> best<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.280> interpret<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.060> move<00:02:51.390> on

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
try my best to interpret it and move on

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.860 
try my best to interpret it and move on
and<00:02:51.959> then<00:02:52.650> work<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> left<00:02:53.310> arm<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:54.540> was

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
and then work on the left arm and I was

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.180 
and then work on the left arm and I was
a<00:02:54.900> little<00:02:55.290> concerned<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.040> beginning

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
a little concerned in the beginning

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.280 
a little concerned in the beginning
where<00:02:56.579> I<00:02:56.609> personally<00:02:57.299> didn't<00:02:57.660> want<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.019> arms

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
where I personally didn't want the arms

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.009 
where I personally didn't want the arms
to<00:02:58.349> overlap<00:02:58.950> one<00:02:59.129> another<00:02:59.480> it<00:03:00.480> was<00:03:00.690> no<00:03:00.840> big

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
to overlap one another it was no big

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.530 
to overlap one another it was no big
deal<00:03:01.109> if<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.650> did<00:03:01.859> but<00:03:02.400> ended<00:03:03.239> up<00:03:03.269> working

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
deal if they did but ended up working

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.559 
deal if they did but ended up working
out<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.430> mean<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.819> know<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.000> was<00:03:06.269> constantly

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
out I mean you know I was constantly

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.410 
out I mean you know I was constantly
measuring<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.440> make<00:03:07.590> sure<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:09.120> overall

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
measuring to make sure and the overall

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.940 
measuring to make sure and the overall
width<00:03:09.720> seems<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.319> a<00:03:10.349> little<00:03:10.590> more<00:03:10.739> than

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
width seems to be a little more than

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.130 
width seems to be a little more than
half<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.519> height<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.510> knew<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.780> as<00:03:13.049> long

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
half the height so I knew that as long

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.190 
half the height so I knew that as long
as<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.530> stayed<00:03:13.799> in<00:03:14.389> those<00:03:15.389> parameters<00:03:15.660> should

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
as I stayed in those parameters should

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.599 
as I stayed in those parameters should
be<00:03:16.950> fine<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.900> terms<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.109> scale<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:20.220> compare

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
be fine in terms of scale just compare

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.699 
be fine in terms of scale just compare
the<00:03:20.700> two<00:03:20.880> shoulders<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.959> armor<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.410> their

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the two shoulders and the armor on their

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.479 
the two shoulders and the armor on their
deltoids<00:03:23.540> her<00:03:24.540> muscle<00:03:24.900> mass<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.230> arms<00:03:25.650> would

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
deltoids her muscle mass on arms would

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.490 
deltoids her muscle mass on arms would
be<00:03:26.669> slimmer<00:03:26.970> but<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.780> doesn't<00:03:28.169> take<00:03:28.319> away

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
be slimmer but this doesn't take away

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.270 
be slimmer but this doesn't take away
her<00:03:29.040> any<00:03:29.400> less<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.970> being<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.299> boss<00:03:30.540> um<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.590> then

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
her any less of being a boss um I then

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.809 
her any less of being a boss um I then
move<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.609> her<00:03:32.849> chest<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.359> core<00:03:33.630> area<00:03:34.049> and

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
move on to her chest and core area and

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.550 
move on to her chest and core area and
again<00:03:35.819> notice<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.209> slightly<00:03:36.599> smaller<00:03:37.049> frame

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
again notice the slightly smaller frame

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.039 
again notice the slightly smaller frame
and<00:03:38.099> what's<00:03:38.400> interesting<00:03:38.639> is<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.599> noticed

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
and what's interesting is that I noticed

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.020 
and what's interesting is that I noticed
that<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.319> male<00:03:40.500> Shepherd<00:03:40.980> has<00:03:41.220> six<00:03:41.819> pack

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
that the male Shepherd has six pack

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.120 
that the male Shepherd has six pack
while<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.780> female<00:03:43.109> Shepard<00:03:43.620> doesn't<00:03:43.950> I

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
while the female Shepard doesn't I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.120 
while the female Shepard doesn't I
actually<00:03:45.000> like<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.690> look<00:03:45.930> because<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.829> know

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
mean that that area has to be a mirror

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
arrest higher on her hips which gives

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.259 
arrest higher on her hips which gives
her<00:03:58.139> a<00:03:58.379> sleeker<00:03:58.769> silhouette<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.489> has<00:04:00.239> a

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
buckle that would support it the armor

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
their legs are more fluid and I want to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.220 
their legs are more fluid and I want to
try<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.120> give<00:04:06.299> us<00:04:06.419> some<00:04:06.599> dimension<00:04:07.049> by

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
try to give us some dimension by

try to give us some dimension by
darkening<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:08.340> edges<00:04:09.049> I'm<00:04:10.049> just<00:04:10.290> working<00:04:10.650> on

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
darkening the edges I'm just working on

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.159 
darkening the edges I'm just working on
our<00:04:10.889> legs<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.400> then<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.760> go<00:04:12.000> back<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.569> work<00:04:13.019> on

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
our legs and then I go back to work on

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.979 
our legs and then I go back to work on
our<00:04:13.319> left<00:04:13.500> arm<00:04:13.739> just<00:04:14.129> a<00:04:14.280> little<00:04:14.459> bit<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.690> for

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
our left arm just a little bit just for

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.699 
our left arm just a little bit just for
some<00:04:16.260> contrast<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:17.039> thought<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:17.880> was<00:04:18.180> just

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
some contrast I thought that was just

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.000 
some contrast I thought that was just
blending<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.890> little<00:04:20.280> bit<00:04:20.400> too<00:04:20.549> much<00:04:20.760> so

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
blending in a little bit too much so

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.630 
blending in a little bit too much so
yeah<00:04:23.010> that's<00:04:23.310> why<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.580> did<00:04:24.390> what<00:04:24.420> I<00:04:24.540> did<00:04:25.640> well

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
yeah that's why I did what I did well

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.510 
yeah that's why I did what I did well

supporting<00:04:31.680> my<00:04:31.740> channel<00:04:32.240> I'm<00:04:33.240> never<00:04:33.510> scanning

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
supporting my channel I'm never scanning

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.390 
supporting my channel I'm never scanning
the<00:04:34.020> drawing<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.440> see<00:04:34.620> if<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.830> textures<00:04:35.220> will

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
the drawing to see if the textures will

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.490 
the drawing to see if the textures will
pick<00:04:35.550> up<00:04:35.700> on<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.940> screen<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.540> I<00:04:37.020> think<00:04:37.230> it's<00:04:37.380> a

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
pick up on the screen and I think it's a

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.490 
pick up on the screen and I think it's a
little<00:04:37.620> better<00:04:37.920> um<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:39.240> anyways<00:04:39.600> i'll<00:04:40.050> be

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
little better um but anyways i'll be

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.530 
little better um but anyways i'll be
uploading<00:04:40.710> another<00:04:41.160> one<00:04:41.340> soon<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.180> until<00:04:42.420> then

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
uploading another one soon so until then

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.080 
uploading another one soon so until then
take<00:04:43.020> care
