changed over the years what would you

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.759 
changed over the years what would you
say<00:00:28.660> is<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.750> biggest<00:00:28.869> influence<00:00:29.199> in<00:00:29.590> those

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
say is the biggest influence in those

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.859 
say is the biggest influence in those
changes<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:31.029> single<00:00:31.419> biggest<00:00:31.509> influence

changes the single biggest influence
without<00:00:32.290> doubt<00:00:32.529> is<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.829> change<00:00:33.309> in<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.519> laws

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
without doubt is the change in the laws

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.729 
without doubt is the change in the laws
of<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:33.970> game<00:00:34.590> initially<00:00:37.019> the<00:00:38.019> laws<00:00:38.230> allowed

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
of the game initially the laws allowed

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.740 
of the game initially the laws allowed
the<00:00:38.980> bowler<00:00:39.160> only<00:00:39.699> to<00:00:40.000> roll<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.329> ball<00:00:40.360> along

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
the bowler only to roll the ball along

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.399 
the bowler only to roll the ball along
the<00:00:40.930> floor

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
the floor

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.889 
the floor
finally<00:00:42.040> it's<00:00:42.190> two<00:00:42.550> little<00:00:42.720> stumps<00:00:43.720> that<00:00:43.750> were

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
finally it's two little stumps that were

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.380 
finally it's two little stumps that were
called<00:00:44.110> wickets<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.879> batsman<00:00:46.269> all

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
called wickets and the batsman all

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.329 
called wickets and the batsman all
really<00:00:46.690> had<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:46.930> do<00:00:47.050> was<00:00:47.229> scoop<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.620> ball<00:00:47.769> the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
really had to do was scoop the ball the

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.799 
really had to do was scoop the ball the
bat<00:00:48.909> would<00:00:49.030> then<00:00:49.180> we<00:00:49.300> shaped<00:00:49.540> much<00:00:49.659> like

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
bat would then we shaped much like

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.130 
bat would then we shaped much like
hockey<00:00:50.140> stick<00:00:50.350> but<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.550> 1770s<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.960> law

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
hockey stick but in the 1770s the law

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.380 
hockey stick but in the 1770s the law
was<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.710> change<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.460> an<00:00:54.550> hour<00:00:54.699> length<00:00:54.940> bowling

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
was a change to an hour length bowling

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.180 
was a change to an hour length bowling
which<00:00:55.809> meant<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.170> bowler<00:00:56.350> could<00:00:56.679> lob<00:00:57.039> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
which meant the bowler could lob the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.250 
which meant the bowler could lob the
ball<00:00:57.219> towards<00:00:58.059> work<00:00:58.239> in<00:00:58.390> try<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.719> hit<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:59.019> and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
ball towards work in try and hit it and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.229 
ball towards work in try and hit it and
could<00:00:59.890> impart<00:01:00.190> spin<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.730> all<00:01:00.850> that<00:01:00.969> sort<00:01:01.179> of

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
could impart spin and all that sort of

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.959 
could impart spin and all that sort of
thing<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.100> batting<00:01:03.429> now<00:01:03.579> those<00:01:03.940> days

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
thing so the the batting now those days

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.260 
thing so the the batting now those days
I<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.920> had<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.220> majority<00:01:06.369> of<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.910> wake<00:01:07.060> down

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
I have had the majority of the wake down

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.090 
I have had the majority of the wake down
at<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.509> bottom<00:01:07.630> because<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.410> ball<00:01:08.590> didn't

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
at the bottom because the ball didn't

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.730 
at the bottom because the ball didn't
bounce<00:01:09.130> very<00:01:09.340> much<00:01:09.750> therefore<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:11.410> work<00:01:11.590> the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
bounce very much therefore the work the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.680 
bounce very much therefore the work the
weight<00:01:11.890> was<00:01:12.039> there<00:01:12.220> so<00:01:12.460> when<00:01:12.850> when<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.539> bat

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
weight was there so when when the bat

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.810 
weight was there so when when the bat
struck<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.050> ball<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:15.100> most<00:01:15.280> mass<00:01:15.670> was

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
struck the ball that most mass was

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.690 
struck the ball that most mass was
behind<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.270> ball<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.810> 1820s<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:21.220> law<00:01:21.369> was

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
behind the ball in the 1820s the law was

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.430 
behind the ball in the 1820s the law was
changed<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:22.210> allow<00:01:22.420> round<00:01:22.929> round<00:01:23.229> down

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
changed to allow round round down

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.559 
changed to allow round round down
bowling<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> ball<00:01:24.880> traveled<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> lot

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
bowling so the ball traveled a lot

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.960 
bowling so the ball traveled a lot
quicker<00:01:25.800> not<00:01:26.800> probably<00:01:27.130> as<00:01:27.190> quick<00:01:27.369> as<00:01:27.520> malinga

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
quicker not probably as quick as malinga

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.520 
quicker not probably as quick as malinga
bowls<00:01:28.149> these<00:01:28.390> days<00:01:28.630> but<00:01:28.869> it's<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.049> similar<00:01:29.350> sort

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
bowls these days but it's a similar sort

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.800 
bowls these days but it's a similar sort
of<00:01:29.619> action<00:01:29.920> was<00:01:30.040> allowed<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.329> therefore<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
of action was allowed and therefore the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.230 
of action was allowed and therefore the
bat<00:01:31.960> had<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.439> change<00:01:33.310> shape<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.909> allow<00:01:34.180> that

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
bat had to change shape to allow that

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.870 
bat had to change shape to allow that
and<00:01:34.630> essentially<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.430> weight<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:36.790> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
and essentially the the weight of the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.639 
and essentially the the weight of the
bat<00:01:37.060> well<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.570> mass<00:01:37.750> of<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:37.990> blade<00:01:38.200> moved

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
bat well the mass of the blade moved

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.590 
bat well the mass of the blade moved
upwards<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.759> this<00:01:39.909> is<00:01:40.000> about<00:01:40.240> from<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
upwards and this is about from the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.899 
upwards and this is about from the
1730's<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:42.670> as<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.000> can<00:01:43.030> see<00:01:43.210> has<00:01:44.110> got<00:01:44.909> as

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
1730's which as you can see has got as

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.850 
1730's which as you can see has got as
much<00:01:46.119> weight<00:01:46.390> at<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.630> toe<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.320> has<00:01:47.469> at<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.680> top

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
much weight at the toe it has at the top

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.700 
much weight at the toe it has at the top
at<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.610> middle<00:01:48.899> very<00:01:49.899> similar<00:01:50.229> really<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.680> a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
at the middle very similar really to a

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.580 
at the middle very similar really to a
flat<00:01:51.009> baseball<00:01:51.549> bat<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:53.170> quite<00:01:53.380> heavy

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
flat baseball bat but quite heavy

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.730 
flat baseball bat but quite heavy
because<00:01:54.460> they<00:01:54.549> were<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:54.759> much<00:01:54.909> wood<00:01:55.090> in<00:01:55.119> it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
because they were so much wood in it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.319 
because they were so much wood in it
when<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.890> laws<00:01:57.399> were<00:01:57.640> changed<00:01:58.030> again<00:01:59.159> in<00:02:00.159> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
when the laws were changed again in the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.200 
when the laws were changed again in the
1860s<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:02.020> allow<00:02:02.200> overarm<00:02:02.950> bowling<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:04.000> ball

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
1860s to allow overarm bowling the ball

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.600 
1860s to allow overarm bowling the ball
traveled<00:02:04.810> much<00:02:05.079> much<00:02:05.320> quicker<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.829> bounced<00:02:06.460> a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
traveled much much quicker and bounced a

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.590 
traveled much much quicker and bounced a
lot<00:02:06.729> more<00:02:06.909> because<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> higher<00:02:07.390> trajectory

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
lot more because the higher trajectory

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.800 
lot more because the higher trajectory
it<00:02:08.530> was<00:02:08.679> coming<00:02:08.979> from<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> bat<00:02:10.600> had<00:02:10.750> to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
it was coming from so the bat had to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.259 
it was coming from so the bat had to
change<00:02:11.019> with<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.579> it<00:02:12.579> needed<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.060> lighter

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
change with it it needed to be lighter

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.500 
change with it it needed to be lighter
so<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.200> bat<00:02:14.350> makers<00:02:14.970> worked<00:02:15.970> out<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so the bat makers worked out that the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.819 
so the bat makers worked out that the
best<00:02:16.660> way<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.810> do<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.079> was<00:02:17.230> take<00:02:17.500> wood<00:02:17.709> from

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
best way to do that was take wood from

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.479 
best way to do that was take wood from
the<00:02:18.040> shoulder<00:02:18.910> own<00:02:19.840> wood<00:02:20.109> from<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> toe<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the shoulder own wood from the toe and

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.940 
the shoulder own wood from the toe and
need<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.820> mass<00:02:22.000> towards<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.049> driving<00:02:23.799> Harry

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
need the mass towards the driving Harry

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.520 
need the mass towards the driving Harry
in<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.100> middle<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.079> essentially<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.350> bat

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
in the middle and essentially the bat

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.910 
in the middle and essentially the bat
has<00:02:27.070> changed<00:02:27.489> not<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.450> much<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:29.109> the<00:02:29.739> weight

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
has changed not that much in the weight

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.979 
has changed not that much in the weight
distribution<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:31.209> today's<00:02:31.480> bats<00:02:31.750> there's

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
distribution to today's bats there's

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.870 
distribution to today's bats there's
lots<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.260> fancy<00:02:32.590> things<00:02:32.889> that<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:33.130> do<00:02:33.280> but

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
lots of fancy things that we do but

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.120 
lots of fancy things that we do but
essentially<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.959> bat<00:02:35.109> hasn't<00:02:35.470> changed<00:02:35.859> in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
essentially the bat hasn't changed in

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.000 
essentially the bat hasn't changed in
hundred<00:02:36.549> years

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
hundred years

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.460 
hundred years
and<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.580> basic<00:02:38.030> shape<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.260> looks<00:02:39.290> like

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
and the basic shape of it it looks like

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.600 
and the basic shape of it it looks like
about<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.100> most<00:02:40.310> people<00:02:40.430> would

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
about that so most people would

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.660 
about that so most people would
recognize<00:02:40.700> these<00:02:41.270> days<00:02:41.450> yes<00:02:42.670> it's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
recognize these days yes it's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.950 
recognize these days yes it's
interesting<00:02:43.820> how<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.270> changed<00:02:44.600> over<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
interesting how it's changed over the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.190 
interesting how it's changed over the
years<00:02:45.170> for<00:02:45.350> example<00:02:45.740> I've<00:02:46.070> got<00:02:46.250> two<00:02:46.430> bats<00:02:46.640> here

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
years for example I've got two bats here

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.550 
years for example I've got two bats here
this<00:02:48.200> bat<00:02:48.380> was<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:49.060> 1930<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.350> see

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
this bat was in 1930 and you can see

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.600 
this bat was in 1930 and you can see
it's<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.740> pretty<00:02:51.860> big<00:02:52.160> bat<00:02:53.170> that's<00:02:54.170> pretty

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
it's a pretty big bat that's pretty

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.850 
it's a pretty big bat that's pretty
pretty<00:02:55.610> big<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:58.130> bat<00:02:58.370> was<00:02:59.120> from<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.140> 1950s

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
wouldn't hit the ball very far but the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.010 
wouldn't hit the ball very far but the
fact<00:03:24.380> was<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.709> course<00:03:24.860> in<00:03:25.100> those<00:03:25.430> days

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020

uncovered<00:03:27.020> pitchers<00:03:27.350> meant<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> ball<00:03:28.220> could

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
uncovered pitchers meant the ball could

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.240 
uncovered pitchers meant the ball could
deviate<00:03:29.150> hugely<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.470> bounce<00:03:30.709> more

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
deviate hugely and bounce more

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
to have a very light back to have to get

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.340 
to have a very light back to have to get
to<00:03:34.970> position<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:35.450> play<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.690> baseball<00:03:35.870> later

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
the chat time of the just after the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.160 
the chat time of the just after the
change<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.489> laws<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:50.209> May<00:03:50.390> we<00:03:50.810> started<00:03:51.110> in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
change of the laws in May we started in

change of the laws in May we started in
1885<00:03:51.880> before<00:03:52.880> then<00:03:53.200> cricketers<00:03:54.200> will<00:03:54.350> get<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
1885 before then cricketers will get the

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.729 
1885 before then cricketers will get the
bat<00:03:55.340> from<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.700> local<00:03:56.170> carpenter<00:03:57.170> would<00:03:57.620> make

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
bat from the local carpenter would make

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.970 
bat from the local carpenter would make
a<00:03:57.769> bat<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.420> wake<00:03:59.570> wasn't<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.019> crucial<00:04:00.500> but

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
a bat and the wake wasn't so crucial but

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.220 
a bat and the wake wasn't so crucial but
once<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.120> wake<00:04:02.630> became<00:04:03.019> more

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
once the the the wake became more

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.680 
once the the the wake became more
important<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:04.760> allow<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.000> batsman<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.480> play

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
important to allow the batsman to play

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.199 
important to allow the batsman to play
shots<00:04:06.019> on<00:04:06.370> with<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.430> ball<00:04:07.580> traveling<00:04:07.940> quicker

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
shots on with the ball traveling quicker

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.560 
shots on with the ball traveling quicker
then<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.230> needed<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.560> more<00:04:09.709> resilient

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
then the needed a more resilient

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.030 
then the needed a more resilient
manufacturing<00:04:11.570> process<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.620> make<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.860> bats
