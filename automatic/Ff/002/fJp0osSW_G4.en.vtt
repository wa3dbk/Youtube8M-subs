to prove it you now I'll save the

changes<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:41.490> game<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:42.090> across<00:02:42.270> some

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
changes in the game going across some

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.500 
changes in the game going across some
games<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.080> I'll<00:02:43.830> quickly<00:02:44.310> go<00:02:44.520> through<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
games and I'll quickly go through the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.740 
games and I'll quickly go through the
trap<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.790> pro<00:02:47.790> two<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.830> works<00:02:49.830> no<00:02:50.250> ring

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
trap and pro two that it works no ring

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.330 
trap and pro two that it works no ring
we<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.990> do<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.140> follow<00:02:52.410> them<00:02:52.680> two<00:02:52.920> simple

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
we have to do is follow them two simple

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.870 
we have to do is follow them two simple
steps<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:54.890> your<00:02:55.890> map<00:02:56.459> will<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.730> compatible<00:02:58.880> co

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
steps and your map will be compatible co
