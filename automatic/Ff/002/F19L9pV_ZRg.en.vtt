00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
times and I actually really like the way

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
times and I actually really like the way
it<00:00:15.719> turned<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.440> I'm<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.220> try<00:00:17.340> it

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.099 
it turned out so I'm going to try it
again<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.330> easy<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.020> really

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
again and it's really easy and really

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.260 
again and it's really easy and really
simple<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.490> felt<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.970> wanted<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
simple and I just felt like I wanted to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910 
simple and I just felt like I wanted to
show<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.510> guys<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:22.050> did<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.560> so

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
show you guys how I did this so

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.140 
show you guys how I did this so
basically<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.340> I've<00:00:23.490> been<00:00:23.580> doing<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
basically how I've been doing this is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150 
basically how I've been doing this is
taking<00:00:24.480> three<00:00:24.869> sections<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.769> side<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> my

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
taking three sections on this side of my

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.410 
taking three sections on this side of my
head<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> lot<00:00:27.000> more<00:00:27.150> hair

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
head because I have a lot more hair

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.050 
head because I have a lot more hair
since<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:27.990> hair<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.289> parted<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.429> side<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
since my hair is parted to this side and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.959 
since my hair is parted to this side and
then<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.230> sections<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.279> sides<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
then I do two sections on this sides and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.780 
then I do two sections on this sides and
then<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.840> I've<00:00:33.960> been<00:00:34.079> doing<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.559> just

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
then what I've been doing is just

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.510 
then what I've been doing is just
twisting<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.570> sections<00:00:37.110> away<00:00:37.559> from<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.250> face

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
twisting the sections away from my face

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580 
twisting the sections away from my face
and<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.270> does<00:00:39.420> help<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.020> hair<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.200> damp

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and it does help when your hair is damp

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.700 
and it does help when your hair is damp
to<00:00:40.829> get<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:41.820> tightly<00:00:42.750> coiled<00:00:43.260> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to get it really really tightly coiled I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
to get it really really tightly coiled I
guess<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.210> want<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> let<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.719> like

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
guess so then you want to let it like

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
guess so then you want to let it like
naturally<00:00:46.800> loop<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:49.250> that<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
naturally loop like this that kind of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
naturally loop like this that kind of
looks<00:00:50.700> ridiculous<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:51.690> warning<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
looks ridiculous and I'm warning you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
looks ridiculous and I'm warning you
guys<00:00:52.289> I'm<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.739> look<00:00:52.920> crazy<00:00:53.100> once<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.940> have

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
guys I'm gonna look crazy once I have

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270 
guys I'm gonna look crazy once I have
all<00:00:54.600> these<00:00:54.960> clips<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.500> hair<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> promise

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it looks cute at the end so it's totally

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.650 
it looks cute at the end so it's totally
worth<00:00:58.289> looking<00:00:58.770> ridiculous<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.609> around<00:01:00.420> like

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
worth looking ridiculous for around like

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.709 
worth looking ridiculous for around like
an<00:01:00.780> hour<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.039> once<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.480> twist

an hour so then once you do the twist
and<00:01:04.080> let<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.260> bunch<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.270> you<00:01:06.270> take<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and let it bunch up like that you take a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.120 
and let it bunch up like that you take a
clip<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.400> then<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.150> secure

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130

my hair on this side into two other
sections<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> twist<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
sections so I'm going to twist this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.730 
sections so I'm going to twist this
section<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> same<00:01:25.920> exact<00:01:26.280> way<00:01:27.470> alright<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
section the same exact way alright and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:38.330 
section the same exact way alright and
then<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> coil<00:01:35.329> okay

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.219 

and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.439> we<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.590> try<00:01:40.859> to<00:01:41.570> pin<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.780> section

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
and then we will try to pin this section

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.480 
and then we will try to pin this section
up<00:01:45.200> or<00:01:46.200> clip<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.069> I<00:01:47.189> guess<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:49.429> feel<00:01:50.429> like

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
up or clip it up I guess I feel like

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.669 
up or clip it up I guess I feel like
these<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.700> massive<00:01:51.359> chunks<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.140> hair<00:01:52.350> for

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
these are massive chunks of hair for

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.730 
these are massive chunks of hair for
these<00:01:52.969> size<00:01:53.969> clips<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:56.179> hopefully<00:01:57.179> it<00:01:57.270> works

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
these size clips but hopefully it works

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
these size clips but hopefully it works
alright<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:58.920> here's<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> last<00:01:59.490> section<00:02:00.149> well
