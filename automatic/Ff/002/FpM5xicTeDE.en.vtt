00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the last few weeks that you will have to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609 
the last few weeks that you will have to
progress<00:00:26.880> through<00:00:27.090> weeks<00:00:27.510> eight<00:00:27.750> nine<00:00:28.170> ten

eleven twelve

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.089 
eleven twelve
and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.269> think<00:00:30.330> week<00:00:30.869> six<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.380> well<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.769> an

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and I think week six as well is an

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.440 
and I think week six as well is an
anomaly<00:00:32.490> that<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.670> know<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:32.880> few<00:00:33.120> people<00:00:33.240> have

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
anomaly that I know a few people have

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
anomaly that I know a few people have
also<00:00:33.600> struggled<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.230> where<00:00:34.830> you<00:00:34.920> will<00:00:35.040> have

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
also struggled with where you will have

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.790 
also struggled with where you will have
a<00:00:35.220> challenge<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.150> has<00:00:36.180> 100<00:00:37.080> percent<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.590> your

certain challenge they're harder it gets

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.940 
certain challenge they're harder it gets
to<00:00:59.040> do<00:00:59.310> later<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.900> for<00:01:01.260> example<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.830> you

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
to do later on so for example if you

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.250 
to do later on so for example if you
choose<00:01:02.250> downs<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.180> lot<00:01:03.360> when<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> first<00:01:03.960> start

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
choose downs a lot when you first start

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
choose downs a lot when you first start
playing<00:01:04.320> later<00:01:05.160> on<00:01:05.460> you'll<00:01:05.940> have<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.240> get

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
playing later on you'll have to get

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
playing later on you'll have to get
something<00:01:06.690> like<00:01:06.810> 20<00:01:07.320> downs<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.250> reach

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
something like 20 downs to just reach

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730 
something like 20 downs to just reach
the<00:01:08.700> first<00:01:08.940> here<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.780> should<00:01:09.990> avoid<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the first here you should avoid that and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.840 
the first here you should avoid that and
make<00:01:10.860> sure<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.100> always<00:01:11.280> scroll<00:01:11.550> down<00:01:11.730> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
make sure you always scroll down the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.310 
make sure you always scroll down the
list<00:01:11.940> cuz<00:01:12.120> there<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.300> some<00:01:12.570> quite<00:01:12.810> easy<00:01:13.050> ones

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
list cuz there are some quite easy ones

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.050 
list cuz there are some quite easy ones
to<00:01:13.410> do<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.980> always<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.400> revolver<00:01:14.910> for

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
example you could be on week 12 there's

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.380 
example you could be on week 12 there's
a<00:01:17.070> hundred<00:01:17.400> percent<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:17.760> clan<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.150> risk

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and you only have two down maybe four or

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
and you only have two down maybe four or

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
five people with a revolver which is

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
five people with a revolver which is
very<00:01:21.930> easy<00:01:22.140> second<00:01:23.100> tip<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.460> play<00:01:23.640> with

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
very easy second tip is to play with

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.190 
very easy second tip is to play with
friends<00:01:24.300> because<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.020> working

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
friends because if you're all working

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.810 
friends because if you're all working
together<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.680> makes<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> lot<00:01:26.340> easier<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
together it makes it a lot easier you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.060 
together it makes it a lot easier you
can<00:01:27.060> always<00:01:27.300> focus<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.960> getting<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.680> person

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
can always focus on getting the person

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
can always focus on getting the person
that<00:01:29.250> has<00:01:29.490> 100<00:01:30.120> percent<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.480> their<00:01:30.600> clan<00:01:30.810> at

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
that has 100 percent of their clan at

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
that has 100 percent of their clan at
risk<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.460> order<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.730> proceed

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
risk what they need in order to proceed

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.810 
risk what they need in order to proceed
so<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.200> example<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:35.010> need<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.670> get

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
so for example if you need to get

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
so for example if you need to get

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
to take out in some way which is usually

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.470 
to take out in some way which is usually
far<00:03:51.040> more<00:03:51.070> than<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.519> game<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.700> survivors<00:03:52.299> and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
far more than a game of survivors and

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.810 
far more than a game of survivors and
basically<00:03:53.440> it's<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.890> lot<00:03:54.040> easier<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.549> get
