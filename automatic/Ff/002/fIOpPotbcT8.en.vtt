00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.520
 secondary structure of the DNA in the 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.220
 genetic storage 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.980
 the DNA is and born in our disc 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.049
 formed with two songs 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.049
 It consists of stress that emits 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.310
 in DNA like proteins are 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.210
 differentiate different levels of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.000
 complexity 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.420
 the primary the tertiary secondary and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.370
 structure 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.230
 Elementary School 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.460
 here is the information 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.390
 and it's from a single secondary structure 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.280
 explain storage of the 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.610
 genetic information and duplication 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.160
 of the DNA and this double structure 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.280
 tertiary DNA is stored in a 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.100
 reduced space and in the probes is 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.290
 a suggestive structure with ternary the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.080
 DNA forms proteins and its structure 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.519
 may or may not be asymmetric in 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.519
 chances will know about women 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.000
 characteristics of the structure 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.660
 it's a double structure 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.340
 from the time 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.080
 was nominated by watson and crick 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.590
 based on the infraction of the rays 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.590
 of effects 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.190
 for me 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.009
 the secondary structure of DNA 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.990
 suckers and the phosphates that give 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.270
 studies 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.970
 because of the initiation the passions neither 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.759
 lawsuits want character so the bases 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.759
 of both inner lines 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.040
 in 1950 the rebounds 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.400
 they had so much moment determines how 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.120
 discriminate and love cooking 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.120
 how is it 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.360
 the DNA molecules were civilians long 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.910
 and thin its structure should be 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.940
 helical DNA molecules are 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.020
 formed by two poly chains 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.060
 deoxyribonucleic the two chains 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.250
 they are confronted by their bases 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.500
 nitrogenated the two chains are not 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.840
 same 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.690
 the structure allows the strands that 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.880
 they are formed with their involvement of DNA be 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.800
 complementary copies of each of 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.800
 the existing saws 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.950
 At present three types are known 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.910
 of double helix structures of the DNA 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.670
 the forms of a izeta the way it was 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.440
 described by bat solitude is a helix 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.710
 destro tour with complementary bases 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.780
 located in horizontal planes the form 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.580
 it is also destroyed but the bases 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.600
 complementary activities are found in the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.690
 final plan the zeta form is new row 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.050
 and has an irregular winding that 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.480
 causes a zig-zag configuration to 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.849
 the one that makes reference 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.920
 as we already know the second propeller is 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.959
 constituted by two strands therefore 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.450
 when in a thread we find the 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.670
 find dominates the other ends 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.640
 when in a thread we find guanina 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.680
 in the other I call cytosine these bases 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.700
 reinforced are those that constitute the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.700
 Hydrogen bonds
