from
to<00:00:44.810> point<00:00:45.050> B<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.830> we're<00:00:45.920> trying<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.160> get<00:00:46.220> you

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.920 
to point B so we're trying to get you
guys<00:00:46.490> away<00:00:46.700> from<00:00:46.730> that<00:00:47.060> so<00:00:47.450> what<00:00:47.660> do<00:00:47.720> you<00:00:47.780> think

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
guys away from that so what do you think

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.500 
guys away from that so what do you think
about<00:00:47.989> function<00:00:48.940> you<00:00:49.940> know<00:00:50.000> one<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.360> bait

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
about function you know one of the bait

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.720 
about function you know one of the bait
bumps<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:50.930> texture<00:00:51.380> don't<00:00:51.860> know<00:00:51.980> about<00:00:52.070> is

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
bumps in the texture don't know about is

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.729 
bumps in the texture don't know about is
it's<00:00:52.940> an<00:00:53.059> internal<00:00:53.450> rotators

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.709 

so<00:00:56.890> internally<00:00:57.489> rotating<00:00:58.000> always<00:00:58.270> said<00:00:58.450> only

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
so internally rotating always said only

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.580 
so internally rotating always said only
do<00:00:58.840> this<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.730> chance<00:01:00.730> to<00:01:00.879> practice<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.440> we're

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
do this a chance to practice so we're

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.079 
do this a chance to practice so we're
gonna<00:01:02.710> try<00:01:02.920> to<00:01:02.949> cooperate<00:01:03.399> that<00:01:03.579> that

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
gonna try to cooperate that that

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.810 
gonna try to cooperate that that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.380 
protects
like<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.480> pushing<00:02:29.480> at<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:29.720> angle

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.950 

and<00:02:37.950> they're<00:02:41.010> different

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.309 

this<00:02:46.960> function<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:48.220> external

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
this function this external

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.259 
this function this external
rotation<00:02:50.099> function<00:02:50.689> a<00:02:51.689> chest<00:02:51.989> exercise<00:02:52.290> they

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
rotation function a chest exercise they

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.350 
rotation function a chest exercise they
apply

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.430 

organization<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.480> allows<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.990> free<00:02:58.170> range

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
organization it allows you to free range

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.470 
organization it allows you to free range
of<00:02:58.530> motion<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.610> on<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.790> cable<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.270> would<00:03:00.360> look

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
of motion so on a cable it would look

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.590 
of motion so on a cable it would look
like<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.810> at<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> back<00:03:01.260> coming<00:03:01.830> up

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
like this at the back coming up

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.540 
like this at the back coming up
external<00:03:04.600> rotate<00:03:05.050> back

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.880 

that's<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.150> very<00:03:10.540> attractive

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.930 

so<00:03:13.490> these<00:03:13.730> things

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
so these things

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.550 
so these things
