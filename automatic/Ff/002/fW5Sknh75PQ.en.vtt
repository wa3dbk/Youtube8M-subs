00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.369
 be all welcome to our 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:30.430
 encounter nor valero in legs and feet today 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.500
 we accompany 16-year-old bubi to 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.960
 veterinarian and we take advantage for 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.809
 tell them about the old dogs 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.909
 we also delve into the interesting 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.089
 history of the domestic dish up 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.790
 our days and to start in college 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.220
 of dogs we show you how to take advantage 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.430
 the time of the meal to educate 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.550
 our canine companions already begins 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.620
 legs and feet 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.620
 [Music] 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.879
 such as a house like the 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.110
 yours, let's use the moment of the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.960
 food to train 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.700
 how will they know the food and the people are 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.800
 one of the main mobiles for 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.440
 them and we can take advantage of them to 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.140
 teach them quickly and in a very 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.120
 friendly the fact of providing the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.550
 food makes us your 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.770
 suppliers is in a natural state 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.280
 It would be very important because we 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.650
 position in the highest place in the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.260
 hit scale because we're going to take advantage 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.360
 this hierarchical positioning so that 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.150
 all the coexistence is much more 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.690
 ordered since it will be us who 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.060
 we mark all the daily guidelines 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.100
 Otherwise if you must surrender before his 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.660
 cries if we win the food when 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.970
 they come because he makes us with the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.690
 it's missing when it comes up and other things 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.850
 we will be doing an effect totally 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.340
 undesirable since we will be the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.990
 submitted to them with all that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.420
 this entails in a coexistence 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.640
 everyday 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.040
 good as you will see the first moments 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.630
 before starting to feed him there 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.000
 certain alteration that many confuse 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.980
 with joy it's actually a state 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.870
 of anxiety that is generated in the dog 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.960
 clear because he's going to receive one of those 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.540
 most important mobile food 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.940
 this state what the dogs jump gives 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.530
 turns and they wave their tail really is not 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.690
 ideal to start bringing 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.030
 we share that we will be reinforcing the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.240
 anxiety so we have to start 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.190
 for expecting you to feel any 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.050
 way immediately provide the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.350
 food and less in the state that we are 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.350
 seeing 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.710
 You'll see that this walk is quick and 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.130
 these these corridors the type march that 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.530
 does with their hands are signs of 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.940
 anxiety and this is what we will owe 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.220
 reinforce I know that sometimes it costs us 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.320
 because we feel sorry that they suffer the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.050
 waiting for the food actually them 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.210
 we are doing a good we process 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.100
 practicing also the patience thing 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.140
 that will serve us if he later moves 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.140
 to other orders of coexistence 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.960
 we see that paquita is calming down 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.850
 now erika is going to approach little by little 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.250
 this is what should not be reinforced there 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.660
 to remove the food and start all 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.660
 again of zeros 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.370
 [Music] 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.880
 and that he will have to learn that he achieves his 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.880
 objective when it is absolutely 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.880
 quiet 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.920
 happens to a child you can tell him or her 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.770
 explain if you do well in school 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.470
 then we go shopping and we buy you 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.800
 determined I play this with the dogs not 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.960
 you can do the reinforcement is immediate 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.720
 the instant you perform the action and 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.250
 that later they will not understand that it is 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.630
 rewarding 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.280
 [Music] 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.660
 we remove the plate 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.660
 and we start again 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.650
 missing several repetitions 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.600
 depending on the dog so the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.970
 exercise is fixed because then a 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.790
 time is not enough for the scene a 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.300
 stereotype as always explain it 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.889
 fix the dog 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.080
 [Music] 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.330
 stay very well now you will be given order 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.159
 erika is noticing that despite being 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.259
 sitting at any time as it happened 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.220
 she was going to get up because of that she was 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.639
 waiting to give him his food 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.530
 [Music] 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.330
 very well you will see as language 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.360
 Erika's body made her paquita 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.749
 feel I use the leg as 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.719
 element of distance and association 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:54.590
 for the cis with the hand is doing 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:56.390
 That Paquita understands that he should stay 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.900
 and now he gives the gordilla in state 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.389
 tranquility very well for kita 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.009
 let's let him eat and remove another 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.270
 time the food to start the exercise 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:15.560
 of the dream 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:15.560
 [Music] 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.970
 very well over time the reinforcement 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.910
 material or in this case repros 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.370
 positive of the food can be started at 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.680
 distance and then remove 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.590
 completely and that the association remains 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.530
 without the food you will see the 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.819
 difference in how this ritual began 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.590
 from food to how it is 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.770
 developing at this time with 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.450
 absolute tranquility 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.450
 [Music] 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.710
 I dont know 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.450
 very important the body language as 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.020
 we walk how we move as 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.660
 we extend our hands all the dog 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.130
 it is capturing as learning this 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.500
 we have to take it into account because things 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.860
 that for us are absolutely 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.960
 innocuous for the dog mean 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.520
 Permanent learning 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.520
 [Music] 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.389
 very well 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.460
 well now we see Calvin corpses in 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.940
 one of advanced in which has been 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.200
 used food as an element of 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.430
 positive reinforcement 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.430
 it takes it like this 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:41.599
 very well calm and now when we 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.599
 we have to eat 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.780
 we should never abuse the times 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.569
 because they have a natural mechanism 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.939
 of defense that when they surpass their 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.840
 attention automatically it's as if 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:07:06.569
 will erase all the information 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:06.569
 [Music] 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.210
 it is important that our pity never 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.490
 that human feeling leaves us 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.990
 beat especially in the puppies that 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.080
 when we try to do that exercise 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.610
 those cry they ask us to aspire with that 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.650
 face of tenderness and generally people 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.160
 claudica and these are documents 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.270
 henkel instead of educating them begins 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.010
 train them but to do what 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.010
 we then do not want him to do 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:40.639
 [Music] 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.780
 remember that quiet dogs are 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.870
 happy and this way we will give you 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.870
 a better coexistence for them and 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.840
 we 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.300
 it seems very simple this practice today 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.610
 I'll try it myself with my dog 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.490
 now with the next patatín we are going 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.770
 at the first cut if your cat steps on 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.200
 unusual places and have changes in their 

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:06.290
 conduct may be because of your period 

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.790
 of heat consult your veterinarian and 

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:14.319
 we come back with more legs and feet
