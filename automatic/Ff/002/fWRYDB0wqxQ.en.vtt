00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:10.769
 So that's my first tutorial or 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:17.100
 also great and a gameplay ago said to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.760
 hedgehog yes and here are three times four 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.960
 different modes you can play 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.119
 once kate tournament 2 multiplayer only 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.390
 First I would say or I wanted 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.450
 say that multiplayer does it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.719
 already fun to play the multiplex but it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.239
 really hooks so it's pretty strong 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.489
 with some or some went adversaries 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.670
 I do not know why it varies so much 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.120
 does not find any from 1 to the other 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.829
 know that would have because of the in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.539
 order or build one 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 fix so survival mode is here you can 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.070
 her your players choose with whom you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 wanted to start that the already 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.070
 have unlocked the others 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.270
 just unlocked 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.130
 if you can do certain things here 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.500
 For example, you can join the tournament 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:19.320
 ten different characters walter 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 1003 One point here is about it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 picked a character theme has so 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 to stand against others as much as possible 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.619
 but to insist in the pot of the game 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.470
 and the f stands for the ftc I grad 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.200
 one has done ss or it 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.200
 generally global the best then trend 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.119
 clearly tournament one seeks his 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.310
 out to the cupals currently served like 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 Often you have already won with them 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.850
 those already 38 times we take the times 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.340
 you go next and then you will be here 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 automatically created an opponent and then 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.670
 Pulled that long decided won that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.330
 are usually three games 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.700
 that you like all opponents plays with 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.099
 whom you are respected 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.440
 Now I have to say that you are here after 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.690
 you defeated the poland in adnet 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.970
 poland is also from the allowances 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.440
 you need 50,000 points you first 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.140
 must have to compete against him there 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.480
 and after that a little something switched off 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.989
 what i close for me because the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.150
 do not bring anything but alright 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.510
 You can also get the costumes 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.050
 you can also buy the upgrade here 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.160
 Speed the kick as Abbott the rest 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.470
 yes upgrade almost always bring 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.100
 different things two players in the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.580
 heart lock head brings plus a speed 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:58.100
 and the hedge was possible to see what that 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:01.670
 best it is as I said it is the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.269
 best how to have the survivor mode 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.160
 can 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.440
 and depending on who his quadruped 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:15.280
 Moses will do different things here 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:22.100
 unlocked here sometimes tilts like that 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:23.989
 Let's just play a game 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.880
 may the whole thing be built up 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.480
 Orlando survival is actually that 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.100
 same 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.250
 So it's only because of the game 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.739
 different game modes are like me 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.019
 have said before up here looks 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.420
 above you can still see the player below 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.989
 select 400 c 214 to play as much 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.850
 altogether made the times 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:50.470
 easiest and sometimes to show 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:53.380
 Here I went to take the korea 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.299
 hat in front of the media 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.329
 but there is still a player 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:04.609
 comes the jump is clear 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:06.730
 kik is clear and then there is still 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.890
 the kick 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.810
 shoots in the summer and when it shoots up 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.690
 lights up at power bought power click 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.479
 is david regensburg was super power 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.760
 Attacks, however, in the alien so the 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.799
 all attacks can and not like 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.720
 otherwise that's the very specific one 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.449
 Attack and he can do anything 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.669
 But what hunting success which all 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.710
 otherwise if you are fast 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.290
 the left or right moves through the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.540
 dash as you can see it actually 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:40.050
 very effective would not be just shitty 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.210
 day of course, an attack worked out that way 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.410
 I score a goal conceded fuck 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.410
 see now and demonstrate 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.539
 okay but not even if the shit is allowed 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.490
 what should I shit 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.780
 let's see what comes next that is their 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.760
 been from germany 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.850
 well mad loses against the weakest 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.850
 right now what's not there 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.950
 packed shit was lost now 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.360
 knows points or wins 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.820
 you get points with the one here too 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.820
 because the upgrades can upgrade 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.460
 otherwise you just need game center 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.240
 into the deep and or how it gets out 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.410
 Savings are made, we make options 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:38.169
 music house to facebook connect like 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:40.650
 It was always that and actually until then 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.650
 next time
