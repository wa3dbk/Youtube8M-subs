00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.540 
to patch it and I think he wants to fix
that<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> would<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.620> pretty<00:00:34.860> goddamn<00:00:35.219> sweet

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
if they fix that so it will be much

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.520 
if they fix that so it will be much

very<00:01:00.270> liefde<00:01:00.809> k<00:01:01.230> AI<00:01:01.469> think<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.340> leaf

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
very liefde k AI think that is when leaf

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.450 
very liefde k AI think that is when leaf
is<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.359> falling<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.140> moving<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.100> think

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is like falling and moving more I think

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
is like falling and moving more I think
is<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.790> yeah<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.049> he's<00:01:07.290> working<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is that yeah and then he's working on a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.980 
is that yeah and then he's working on a
server<00:01:08.159> side<00:01:08.670> inventory<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.780> quite<00:01:09.960> sure

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
server side inventory I'm not quite sure

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.039 
server side inventory I'm not quite sure
I'm<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.770> playing<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.189> much<00:01:11.430> online<00:01:12.049> like

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
I'm not playing that much online like

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.530 
I'm not playing that much online like
multiplayer<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.040> I'm<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.790> quite<00:01:15.000> sure<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
multiplayer so I'm not quite sure that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.090 
multiplayer so I'm not quite sure that
is<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.560> probably<00:01:16.950> going

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
is going to be but it's probably going

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.149 
is going to be but it's probably going
to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.310> better<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> be

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to be better because it's going to be

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.770
