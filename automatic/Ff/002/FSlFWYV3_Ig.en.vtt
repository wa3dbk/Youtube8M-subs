I<00:00:02.800> say<00:00:03.800> looking<00:00:04.340> at<00:00:04.490> the<00:00:04.609> next<00:00:04.880> 100<00:00:05.450> years<00:00:05.649> that

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
I say looking at the next 100 years that

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.890 
I say looking at the next 100 years that
there<00:00:06.889> are<00:00:06.950> two<00:00:07.130> trends<00:00:07.880> in<00:00:08.029> the<00:00:08.269> world<00:00:08.300> today

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
there are two trends in the world today

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.009 
there are two trends in the world today
the<00:00:09.860> first<00:00:10.099> trend<00:00:10.519> is<00:00:10.820> toward<00:00:11.179> what<00:00:11.660> we<00:00:11.690> call<00:00:11.990> a

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
the first trend is toward what we call a

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.440 
the first trend is toward what we call a
type<00:00:12.349> one<00:00:12.650> civilization<00:00:13.129> a<00:00:13.700> planetary

type one civilization a planetary
civilization<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:15.469> civilization<00:00:16.190> that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
civilization a civilization that

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.060 
civilization a civilization that
resembles<00:00:18.140> something<00:00:18.320> out<00:00:18.560> of<00:00:18.590> Buck<00:00:18.800> Rogers

or Flash Gordon a type two civilization
is<00:00:22.369> stellar<00:00:22.900> they<00:00:23.900> consume<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:24.560> much<00:00:24.619> energy

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
is stellar they consume so much energy

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.880 
is stellar they consume so much energy
they<00:00:25.609> can<00:00:25.670> play<00:00:25.970> with<00:00:26.179> stars<00:00:26.619> that's<00:00:27.619> for

they can play with stars that's for

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.679 
they can play with stars that's for

what the hell I'm talking about but what
they're<00:04:32.060> reacting<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.719> is<00:04:33.020> not<00:04:33.460> modernism

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
tolerant scientific society and that's

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.920 
tolerant scientific society and that's
what<00:04:43.189> they<00:04:43.400> don't<00:04:43.639> want<00:04:43.909> they<00:04:44.599> don't<00:04:44.779> want

what they don't want they don't want
science<00:04:45.349> they<00:04:45.650> want<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.919> theocracy

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
science they want a theocracy

type one civilization

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.709 
type one civilization
now<00:05:00.080> which<00:05:00.319> tendency<00:05:01.009> will<00:05:01.310> win<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.879> don't<00:05:02.569> know

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
now which tendency will win I don't know

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.279 
now which tendency will win I don't know
but<00:05:03.469> I<00:05:03.500> hope<00:05:03.919> that<00:05:03.949> we<00:05:04.340> emerge<00:05:04.849> as<00:05:05.150> a<00:05:05.210> type<00:05:06.050> one

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
but I hope that we emerge as a type one

but I hope that we emerge as a type one
civilization<00:05:06.740> now<00:05:07.639> you<00:05:07.699> know<00:05:07.909> to<00:05:08.029> space<00:05:08.360> we

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
civilization now you know to space we

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.260 
civilization now you know to space we
look<00:05:09.199> for<00:05:09.409> signs<00:05:09.620> full<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.639> intelligent<00:05:11.240> life

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
look for signs full of intelligent life

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.040 
look for signs full of intelligent life
in<00:05:11.479> outer<00:05:11.629> space<00:05:11.719> so<00:05:12.620> far<00:05:12.830> we<00:05:12.949> find<00:05:13.219> none

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
in outer space so far we find none

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.059 
in outer space so far we find none
civilizations<00:05:15.050> like<00:05:15.289> type<00:05:15.560> one<00:05:15.770> should<00:05:15.949> be

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
civilizations like type one should be

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.619 
civilizations like type one should be
commonplace<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.879> the<00:05:16.909> galaxy

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
commonplace in the galaxy

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.260 
commonplace in the galaxy
some<00:05:18.289> people<00:05:18.560> assume<00:05:18.860> therefore<00:05:19.159> that<00:05:19.460> type

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
some people assume therefore that type

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.079 
some people assume therefore that type
zero<00:05:20.659> civilizations<00:05:21.469> are<00:05:21.589> rather<00:05:21.710> common<00:05:22.219> but

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.089 
zero civilizations are rather common but

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.760 
zero civilizations are rather common but
only<00:05:23.389> a<00:05:23.509> few<00:05:23.839> of<00:05:23.870> them<00:05:24.169> make<00:05:25.159> it<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.999> type<00:05:26.270> 1

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
only a few of them make it the type 1

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.290 
only a few of them make it the type 1
because<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:28.039> society<00:05:28.639> for<00:05:28.789> the<00:05:28.879> first<00:05:29.089> time

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
because that society for the first time

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.390 
because that society for the first time
in<00:05:29.449> his<00:05:29.569> history<00:05:29.930> has<00:05:30.409> the<00:05:30.680> ability<00:05:31.039> to<00:05:31.069> commit

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
in his history has the ability to commit

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.209 
in his history has the ability to commit
planetary<00:05:31.909> suicide<00:05:32.469> so<00:05:33.469> maybe<00:05:33.770> that's<00:05:34.069> the

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
planetary suicide so maybe that's the

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.610 
planetary suicide so maybe that's the
reason<00:05:34.699> why<00:05:34.879> we<00:05:35.089> don't<00:05:35.270> see<00:05:35.449> aliens<00:05:35.870> in<00:05:36.469> outer

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
reason why we don't see aliens in outer

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.700 
reason why we don't see aliens in outer
space<00:05:36.770> maybe<00:05:37.759> they<00:05:38.000> never<00:05:38.150> made<00:05:38.479> it<00:05:38.509> maybe<00:05:39.409> one

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
space maybe they never made it maybe one

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.290 
space maybe they never made it maybe one
day<00:05:39.889> when<00:05:40.039> we<00:05:40.129> have<00:05:40.250> starships<00:05:40.819> and<00:05:41.029> visit

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
day when we have starships and visit

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.649 
day when we have starships and visit
them

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
them

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.480 
them
we'll<00:05:42.110> see<00:05:42.319> atmospheres<00:05:43.099> that<00:05:43.370> are

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
we'll see atmospheres that are

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.010 
we'll see atmospheres that are
irradiated<00:05:44.270> because<00:05:44.419> they<00:05:44.509> had<00:05:44.629> a<00:05:44.659> nuclear

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
irradiated because they had a nuclear

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.679 
irradiated because they had a nuclear
war<00:05:45.550> atmospheres<00:05:46.550> too<00:05:46.759> hot<00:05:47.029> to<00:05:47.330> sustain<00:05:47.659> life

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:47.689 
war atmospheres too hot to sustain life

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.119 
war atmospheres too hot to sustain life
because<00:05:48.199> they<00:05:48.319> had<00:05:48.439> a<00:05:48.469> runaway<00:05:48.800> greenhouse

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
because they had a runaway greenhouse

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.730 
because they had a runaway greenhouse
effect<00:05:49.629> maybe<00:05:50.629> when<00:05:51.050> we<00:05:51.199> go<00:05:51.319> went<00:05:51.500> out<00:05:51.620> of

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
effect maybe when we go went out of

effect maybe when we go went out of
space<00:05:51.979> we'll<00:05:52.639> see<00:05:52.789> the<00:05:52.909> corpses<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:53.599> type<00:05:54.259> one
