jabbers<00:00:07.770> question<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:09.030> do<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.599> perform

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
jabbers question is how do you perform

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.350 
jabbers question is how do you perform
them<00:00:10.320> that's<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.920> got<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.639> think<00:00:12.000> about<00:00:12.059> I

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
them that's what we got to think about I

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.870 
them that's what we got to think about I
think<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:13.500> hunch<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.549> whip<00:00:14.670> them

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
think my hunch is you have to whip them

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.300 
think my hunch is you have to whip them
both<00:00:15.210> into<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.599> corner<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.289> then<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.920> an<00:00:17.039> OMG

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
both into a corner and then do an OMG

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.490 
both into a corner and then do an OMG
moment<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:18.240> makes<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.600> most<00:00:18.750> logical<00:00:18.960> sense

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
moment that makes the most logical sense

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.950 
moment that makes the most logical sense
it<00:00:19.920> could<00:00:20.340> necessarily<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
it could necessarily be that it is a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.509 
it could necessarily be that it is a
counter<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.279> TT<00:00:23.820> move<00:00:24.210> using<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.810> finisher

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
counter for TT move using the finisher

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.099 
counter for TT move using the finisher
potentially<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.699> mean<00:00:27.210> he's<00:00:27.330> lifting<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> mark

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
potentially I mean he's lifting the mark

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.150 
potentially I mean he's lifting the mark
near<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.220> corner<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.410> that's<00:00:31.410> why<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:31.949> getting

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
near a corner so that's why I'm getting

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.760 
near a corner so that's why I'm getting
my<00:00:32.460> assumption<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
my assumption on that but it's not the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.430 
my assumption on that but it's not the
first<00:00:34.980> time<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.219> obviously<00:00:35.760> there's<00:00:35.940> been

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
first time that obviously there's been

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.170 
first time that obviously there's been
double<00:00:37.440> team<00:00:37.710> finishers<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> speak<00:00:38.969> in
