00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
off I think we we see the mistakes we

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.260 
off I think we we see the mistakes we
made<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.370> settle<00:01:59.790> down

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.740 
fourth and two to make it first down is
that<00:03:44.310> shows<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.850> kind<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.090> attitude<00:03:45.420> his<00:03:45.540> team

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
that shows the kind of attitude his team

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.990 
that shows the kind of attitude his team
has<00:03:45.990> I<00:03:46.290> think<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.800> was<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.980> critical<00:03:47.850> moment

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
has I think that was a critical moment

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.300 
has I think that was a critical moment
also<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.810> this<00:03:49.260> game<00:03:49.440> there's<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.740> lot<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.130> them

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
also in this game there's a lot of them

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.070 
also in this game there's a lot of them
and<00:03:50.460> that<00:03:50.550> was<00:03:50.730> one<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:50.970> them<00:03:51.240> in<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.780> game<00:03:51.930> to

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
and that was one of them in this game to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.690 
and that was one of them in this game to
make<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.860> difference<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.430> think<00:03:53.640> I

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
make that difference and I think I

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.800 
make that difference and I think I
believe<00:03:53.850> we<00:03:54.000> went<00:03:54.120> down<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:54.390> scored<00:03:54.480> on<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
believe we went down and scored on the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:13.480 
believe we went down and scored on the
same<00:03:54.990> Drive

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.140 

there<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.210> is<00:04:14.360> my<00:04:14.990> room<00:04:15.500> kicks<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:17.000> is

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
there it is my room kicks it and it is

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.360 
there it is my room kicks it and it is
good<00:04:17.360> for<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.050> first<00:04:18.320> time<00:04:18.620> today

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.370
