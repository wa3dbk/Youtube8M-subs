00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
got one jumper here for switch machine a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
got one jumper here for switch machine a
and<00:01:20.700> after<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.330> finish<00:01:21.630> doing<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.200> I'll

the jumper back in the switch it so
let's<00:02:38.790> try<00:02:39.120> program<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.380> switch<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.040> again

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
let's try program and switch a it again

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.820 
let's try program and switch a it again

to select accessory and the 201 numbers

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.690 
to select accessory and the 201 numbers
still<00:03:21.870> there<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.769> enter<00:03:23.220> and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
still there so just go enter and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.080 
still there so just go enter and
prostitute<00:03:28.310> all<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:29.640> I'm<00:03:29.700> gonna<00:03:29.820> try

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
prostitute all right so I'm gonna try

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.690 
prostitute all right so I'm gonna try
out<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.330> other<00:03:30.420> one<00:03:30.630> now<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.140> then<00:03:31.830> see<00:03:32.580> what

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
out the other one now and then see what

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.500 
out the other one now and then see what
happens

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.900 

so<00:03:36.510> both<00:03:37.200> switches<00:03:37.560> now<00:03:37.950> working<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.700> there

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
so both switches now working in there

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.080 
so both switches now working in there
throwing<00:03:39.299> back<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.810> forth<00:03:40.019> like<00:03:40.200> they<00:03:40.380> should

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
throwing back and forth like they should

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.740 
throwing back and forth like they should
now<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.709> NCP<00:03:43.709> power<00:03:44.040> cab<00:03:44.340> has<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.329> function

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
now the NCP power cab has this function

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.240 
now the NCP power cab has this function
called<00:03:46.049> macro<00:03:48.320> now<00:03:49.320> what<00:03:49.620> I've<00:03:49.739> done<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.100> I've

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
called macro now what I've done is I've

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.569 
called macro now what I've done is I've
set<00:03:50.579> up<00:03:50.610> three<00:03:51.120> macros<00:03:52.010> what<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.130> will<00:03:53.250> do<00:03:53.400> is

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
set up three macros what this will do is

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.190 
set up three macros what this will do is
when<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.820> macro<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.390> will<00:03:54.570> set<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.840> route

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
when the macro one will set a route

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.940 
when the macro one will set a route
going<00:03:55.620> off<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:56.040> line<00:03:57.019> macro<00:03:58.019> two<00:03:58.410> will<00:03:58.769> go

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
going off on this line macro two will go

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.259 
going off on this line macro two will go
straight<00:03:59.340> ahead<00:03:59.690> and<00:04:00.709> macro<00:04:01.709> three<00:04:02.070> will<00:04:02.269> put

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
straight ahead and macro three will put

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.970 
straight ahead and macro three will put
it<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.959> way<00:04:04.170> on<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.560> third<00:04:04.799> line<00:04:06.950> okay<00:04:07.950> so

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
it this way on to the third line okay so

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.449 
it this way on to the third line okay so
if<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.510> set<00:04:09.510> macro<00:04:09.959> 1<00:04:10.260> which<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.680> just<00:04:10.920> push<00:04:11.130> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
if I set macro 1 which is just push the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.099 
if I set macro 1 which is just push the
macro<00:04:11.820> button<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.829> 1<00:04:14.120> enter

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
macro button and 1 enter

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.080 
macro button and 1 enter
is<00:04:18.109> now<00:04:18.320> throwing<00:04:18.650> this<00:04:18.920> switch<00:04:19.250> now<00:04:19.790> I'm<00:04:19.970> the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
is now throwing this switch now I'm the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.220 
is now throwing this switch now I'm the
train<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.510> go<00:04:20.630> off<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.959> way

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.860 

so<00:04:24.230> go<00:04:24.440> macro<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:27.790> enter<00:04:31.240> both<00:04:32.240> switches<00:04:32.540> have

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
so go macro to enter both switches have

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.200 
so go macro to enter both switches have
been<00:04:33.020> set<00:04:33.290> straight<00:04:33.710> now<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.790> go<00:04:34.970> straight

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
been set straight now to go straight

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.659 
been set straight now to go straight
ahead

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
ahead

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:44.920 
ahead
so<00:04:37.669> go<00:04:37.940> macro<00:04:38.830> three<00:04:39.850> enter<00:04:43.510> now<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.570> third

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
so go macro three enter now the third

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.230 
so go macro three enter now the third
one<00:04:45.230> route<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.950> going<00:04:45.980> off<00:04:46.370> on<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.820> this<00:04:46.940> line

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
one route is going off on to this line

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.310 
one route is going off on to this line
here<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:49.400> it's<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.610> pretty<00:04:49.790> good<00:04:49.880> option<00:04:50.150> by<00:04:50.540> NCE

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
here so it's a pretty good option by NCE

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.940 
here so it's a pretty good option by NCE
and<00:04:51.590> yeah<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.340> liked<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:52.790> lot
