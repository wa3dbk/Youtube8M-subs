 Good day to all today 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.480
 tell you how using windows 8 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.039
 exchange install game 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.710
 disk image file with iso extension 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.820
 we all usually download such a file 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 weight image file we put it through 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.820
 alcohol damon thuls or ultraiso or 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.289
 some other third-party programs 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.190
 who work slept and with files 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.730
 images but specifically for the image file 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.500
 disk iso expansion bis can not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 use no other programs 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.230
 except windows 8 itself 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.920
 81 here we do not have such 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.320
 handler old toys look 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.039
 properties 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.850
 Ares iso disk image file 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:09.140
 who is more comfortable with what we do with him 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:12.710
 and we select it with the right mouse button 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.150
 open with and select the explorer 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.229
 as you can see with us automatically 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 virtual 9 disk drive was formed 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:26.360
 which unpacked the disk image file by 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.040
 The idea of this is the same archive as winrar 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.750
 rather as rar zip 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.689
 but the only other so experience and so 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 now after unpacking the images 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.570
 virtual drive we are elementary 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.130
 run the installation of the game 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.810
 choose a language 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.110
 as they say and so on after 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.890
 we installed the game in the folder as we started 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.880
 to use it to remove the clear 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.060
 virtual sticky drive again pdm 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.250
 mice 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:09.190
 extract all we have no game 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:14.209
 installed image file unpacked 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:18.650
 installed and we do not use any 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.440
 other third-party pro there on it all 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.680
