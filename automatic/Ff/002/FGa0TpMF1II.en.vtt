00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.109
 2 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.119
 first and foremost at the moment 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.140
 start changing understand how much it is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.520
 faces are increasingly defined by their ideas 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.130
 it's always that for sure 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.980
 I'm losing myself and two ways fama is understandable 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.180
 yes replacing people second to teach those who 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.970
 have implanted give away those agents 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.030
 change that year I understand 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.050
 after that both formulate those 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.010
 targets and goals 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.700
 which organization wants to achieve 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.910
 strategy questions that 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.220
 is based 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.440
 heart-rending which then decomposition these goals 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.640
 tasks 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.490
 oddly enough big state 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.490
 organizations mission of their unit 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.570
 articulating mercy 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.060
 composers poets strategy and writing 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.070
 respectively, goals and objectives 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.530
 Izhtu people you have an ally at the level 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.260
 yours 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
 the next morning their subordinates to someone further 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.210
 bring this knockout idea backed by 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.800
 this girl's makarenko shoulders 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.220
 but at the level of your colleagues 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 because any changes in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730
 organizations are always collective labor not 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.640
 it happens that there is one day and 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.500
 which change something and all the rest 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 which looks like it happens 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.340
 especially banking environment 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.900
 but however as probably in any 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.310
 another organization 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.160
 very important at the moment 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.510
 formation by the way the idea is to understand for someone 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.130
 more operations downstairs 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880
 who is near you because you 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 inside the organization and just as important 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.380
 convey the purpose of their changes before without 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.420
 these sponsor who stands above you is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.570
 your lead 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.980
 lack of consensus in 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.060
 organizations 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.210
 will break any changes if lived 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.360
 warehouse insist on its position at least 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.630
 scarecrow though the carcass but the kill 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.790
 consensus at different levels of the organization 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.919
 the second big task that stood 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.539
 presented with the team 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.059
 this creation 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.629
 unified tools for working with 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.579
 customer information for work 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.219
 with jsc data array first of all with that 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.589
 to teach people to make decisions 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.889
 based on analytical data 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.280
 that is, the food agents 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.880
 and fixing what you do but 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.740
 print kind to hunt these roadmaps by 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.620
 which further these changes can 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.720
 replicate inside the organization you 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.870
 you start doing the standard 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.180
 actually unfolding process 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.690
 scaling your project inside 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.719
 organizations 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.729
 we need to build the predictable 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.399
 processes that works like clockwork 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.680
 only for the great top 400 but for 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.019
 the remaining 30 thousand customers on 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:56.899
 the territory of the Russian Federation 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.029
 with whom we want to work and make 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.159
 it can only be in two ways 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.109
 processes which are debugged and products 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.169
 but for those positions people who 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.789
 interested in that in certain 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:09.419
 time span to accurately deliver 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.309
 party service
