here but I'm really going to cut on this
is<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.330> interior<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.170> top<00:00:31.500> layer<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
is this interior this top layer and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.520 
is this interior this top layer and
through<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.640> bay<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.149> my<00:00:33.329> short<00:00:33.660> -<00:00:33.930> not

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
through this bay with my short - not

parted<00:00:35.190> her<00:00:35.309> hair<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.730> combed<00:00:35.969> her<00:00:36.149> hair<00:00:36.180> and

her<00:00:37.020> natural<00:00:37.469> fall<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.300> helps<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
her natural fall I think that helps a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
her natural fall I think that helps a
lot<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> way<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.379> you're<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
lot with the way that you're going to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
lot with the way that you're going to
design<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.190> haircut<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
design the haircut because this is the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.840 
design the haircut because this is the
way<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> falls<00:00:43.110> naturally<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
way it falls naturally and we like this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.060 
way it falls naturally and we like this
asymmetric<00:00:45.600> feel<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.500> subtle

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
asymmetric feel it's just very subtle

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
asymmetric feel it's just very subtle
but<00:00:47.489> even<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:49.079> going

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but even with what I do now it's going

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.290 
but even with what I do now it's going
to<00:00:49.320> make<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> even<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.800> little<00:00:49.829> more<00:00:50.190> edgier<00:00:50.399> I'm

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
make a little guide on that side and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.880 
make a little guide on that side and
then<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:35.030> sections<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.180> travel<00:01:39.890> Verge

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
then like my sections will travel Verge

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.569 
then like my sections will travel Verge
a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.490> more<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.829> shorter

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
in all her length it'll actually make

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.460 
in all her length it'll actually make
this<00:02:30.580> look<00:02:30.850> wispier<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.140> little<00:02:32.350> more

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
this look wispier and a little more

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.800 
this look wispier and a little more

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
ragged instead of thicker blunt there

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.690 
ragged instead of thicker blunt there
now<00:02:35.290> I'm<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.739> just<00:02:35.890> travel<00:02:36.310> around<00:02:36.370> the

now I'm going to just travel around the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.960 
now I'm going to just travel around the
head<00:02:36.880> fling<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.320> point<00:02:38.590> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
head fling this up to this point and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
head fling this up to this point and
taking<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.120> off<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.660> lot<00:02:41.019> of<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.230> hair<00:02:41.500> won't

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
taking this off a lot of this hair won't

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.320 
taking this off a lot of this hair won't
reach<00:02:41.920> because<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.459> too<00:02:42.640> short<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.150> that's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
reach because it's too short and that's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.810 
reach because it's too short and that's
okay<00:02:43.810> because<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.709> will<00:02:44.830> kind<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.130> elongate

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
okay because it will kind of elongate

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.490 
okay because it will kind of elongate
that<00:02:46.030> it'll<00:02:46.420> make<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.690> hair<00:02:46.930> actually<00:02:47.140> look

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
that it'll make that hair actually look

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.180 
that it'll make that hair actually look
longer

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
longer

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.520 
longer

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
to that you can see where that hair is

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.700 
to that you can see where that hair is
going<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.670> come<00:04:00.880> off<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.780> converge<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.530> you

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
going to come off you converge it you

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.160 
going to come off you converge it you
can<00:04:02.860> feel<00:04:03.160> but<00:04:03.430> thickness<00:04:03.850> where<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.180> stops

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.960 

bringing<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.500> up<00:04:08.800> taking<00:04:09.460> another<00:04:09.700> piece

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
bringing that up taking another piece

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.060 
bringing that up taking another piece
off<00:04:10.300> you<00:04:10.990> can<00:04:11.140> see<00:04:11.350> where<00:04:11.560> her<00:04:11.680> hair<00:04:11.920> is

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
off you can see where her hair is

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.670 
off you can see where her hair is
probably<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.670> thickest<00:04:13.210> as<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.200> top<00:04:14.440> her

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
probably the thickest as in the top her

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.280 
probably the thickest as in the top her
sides<00:04:14.980> are<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.220> little<00:04:15.400> finer<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:17.080> will<00:04:17.170> be

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
sides are a little finer so that will be

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.750 
sides are a little finer so that will be
leading<00:04:17.500> her<00:04:17.739> lecture<00:04:18.040> here<00:04:18.250> will<00:04:18.370> actually

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
leading her lecture here will actually

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.390 
leading her lecture here will actually
look<00:04:18.880> longer<00:04:19.480> when<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:19.989> finish<00:04:20.440> not<00:04:20.769> shorter

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
look longer when I finish not shorter

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.310 
look longer when I finish not shorter
but<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:22.090> think<00:04:22.330> what's<00:04:22.510> nice<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.050> gives<00:04:23.230> this

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
but I think what's nice is it gives this

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.500 
but I think what's nice is it gives this
nice<00:04:23.590> face<00:04:23.950> framing<00:04:24.370> fringe<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.090> leave<00:04:25.330> her
