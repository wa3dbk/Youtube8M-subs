00:00:01.529 --> 00:00:09.090
 Good morning, I'm going to show you three more days. 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:14.860
 streets that germinated are mint zucchini 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.789
 and broccoli here mint finished with 12 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.109
 days so very little is today 's day 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.699
 24 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:28.479
 just take a while to grow 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:37.150
 keeping from 8 to bob pumpkin favor 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:40.930
 gemam with about 34 days in home 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.310
 according to 17 days 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.300
 I'll show you broccoli and tem 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:53.940
 to be careful when you implant 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.920
 toss the seed to protect them from the sun 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 so I was thinking about a young man from here 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.800
 to about 34 degrees 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.130
 and take care to hide but the sun 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.940
 since it changes drills so I put 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:22.810
 30 people practically together in this 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:31.479
 first meeting with 14 days 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:33.580
 the other here in this other, but not this one. 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.270
 I also think that 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.229
 it is negotiated to grow a little more 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.009
 prudent to stay she does not know this self 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:49.030
 I do not know yet and do not let the sport 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.039
 It is very important not to leave seedlings 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.610
 exposed to the sun until they grow 1 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.830
 appropriate good size grass 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.119
 I put the gentleman on what I have to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.009
 export the sound for about three days 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.690
 now it's taking longer to grow 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.610
 even more and mourinho 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.500
 This happened after I got back to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.049
 Answer a sun drying a little now only 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.480
 with the greatest difficulty to recover 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.829
 and grow 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.829
 Thanks, hug
