 also to maintain these centers of

 rural areas where there must be a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.530
 cloth and a presence of help there 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.340
 is no reason that people because 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.379

 volunteer firefighter requires 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.180
 availability and self-giving but provides 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.460
 indisputable sensations what more 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.810
 nice to save a life without the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.890
 serious accidents or less fat you 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.560

 in the course of life differently times 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 often it happened to me once with 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.470
 a team of course to set up 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.850
 what's called a defibrillator and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.140
 reset 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.299
 resuscitate a person to hand him over to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.159
 the opinion before the doctor samu be 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.700
 on the spot so be the wii and this 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.630
 nobody there have seen him tempered little 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.240
 come to thank me it's true that it's 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 very striking large scale extinction 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.530
 a fire extrication as much 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.360
 spectacular operations by 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.299
 firefighters to conquer an audience and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.409
 interested in their job 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.690
 volunteer firefighter and visitors 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.890
 impressions and selected pieces 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.659
 Firefighter is a job 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.009
 exciting we see a lot of things 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.140
 I personally am in it 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.509
 since I'm very small so that's 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.670
 especially going into inter of 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.080
 to rescue people not it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.269
 not bad it's not all the time 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.880
 see that it's impressive so often 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:16.080
 allow some of me I found that 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.580
 very impressive and for young people 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.739
 passionate it is possible for them to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.750
 engage as jsp young sappers 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.730
 firefighters they will be able to pursue a 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.190
 four-year training and so get 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.170
 a young firefighter's certificate of 16 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.310
