approaching fabric shopping one is to

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.669 
approaching fabric shopping one is to

have your pattern in hand the other

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.919 
have your pattern in hand the other
approach<00:01:15.160> is<00:01:15.429> to<00:01:16.119> go<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.600> fabric<00:01:16.720> store
