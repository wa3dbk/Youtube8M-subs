00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
were running pretty good offense and you

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.649 
were running pretty good offense and you
know<00:04:04.890> keep<00:04:05.549> running<00:04:05.849> good<00:04:05.939> offense<00:04:06.329> we'll<00:04:06.540> get

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
know keep running good offense we'll get

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.030 
know keep running good offense we'll get
the<00:04:06.750> shots<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.200> they'll<00:04:07.349> start<00:04:07.530> dropping<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
the shots and they'll start dropping and

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.770 
the shots and they'll start dropping and
they<00:04:08.099> started<00:04:08.400> dropping<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:08.970> says<00:04:09.150> my<00:04:09.390> role<00:04:09.659> is

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
they started dropping it says my role is

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.390 
they started dropping it says my role is
really<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.049> play<00:04:10.260> defense<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:10.950> did<00:04:11.190> that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.190 
really to play defense and I did that
and<00:04:11.609> I<00:04:11.700> think<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:12.000> was<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.209> put<00:04:12.359> my<00:04:12.510> offense

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
and I think it was just put my offense

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.140 
and I think it was just put my offense
up<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.829> stepped<00:04:14.400> up<00:04:14.519> on<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> offense

up and I just stepped up on the offense

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.759 
up and I just stepped up on the offense
cuz<00:04:15.299> they're<00:04:15.420> taking<00:04:15.750> away<00:04:15.840> Jeff<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.380> Charles

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
cuz they're taking away Jeff and Charles
