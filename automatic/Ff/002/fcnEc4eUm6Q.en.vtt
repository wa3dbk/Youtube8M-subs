00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.550 

it<00:01:13.030> forces<00:01:13.510> you<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.780> start<00:01:14.140> looking<00:01:14.440> at

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
you can do to make a difference so when

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.790 
you can do to make a difference so when
you're<00:01:22.360> operating<00:01:22.480> on<00:01:22.930> your<00:01:23.140> own<00:01:23.290> as<00:01:23.680> an

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
you're operating on your own as an

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.260 
you're operating on your own as an
individual<00:01:24.220> contributor<00:01:24.730> either<00:01:25.060> often

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
individual contributor either often

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.120 
individual contributor either often
think<00:01:25.690> about<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.229> impact<00:01:26.530> you're<00:01:26.740> having<00:01:26.770> on

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
think about the impact you're having on

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.890 
think about the impact you're having on
others<00:01:27.400> but<00:01:28.180> we<00:01:28.240> need<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.570> move<00:01:28.720> into

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
others but we need to move into

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.870 
others but we need to move into
leadership<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.650> see<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:30.580> there's<00:01:30.790> this

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
leadership you see it so there's this

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.760 
leadership you see it so there's this
awareness<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.750> comes<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.410> that<00:01:32.500> first

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
awareness that comes and that first

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.609 
awareness that comes and that first
phase<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.940> then<00:01:34.540> we<00:01:34.660> go<00:01:34.780> from<00:01:34.990> there<00:01:35.260> into

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
phase and then we go from there into

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.740 
phase and then we go from there into
what<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.400> go<00:01:36.520> from<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.820> forest<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.450> trees

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
what it go from the forest of the trees

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.530 
what it go from the forest of the trees
and<00:01:38.140> we<00:01:38.650> start<00:01:38.920> diving<00:01:39.130> into<00:01:39.490> these<00:01:39.880> specific

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
and we start diving into these specific

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.999 
and we start diving into these specific
behavioral<00:01:41.080> areas<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.030> look<00:01:43.030> at<00:01:43.180> those<00:01:43.330> on<00:01:43.630> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
behavioral areas and look at those on a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.889 
behavioral areas and look at those on a
individual<00:01:45.009> basis<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.729> they<00:01:46.300> start<00:01:46.540> to<00:01:46.660> see

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
individual basis and they start to see

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.290 
individual basis and they start to see
that<00:01:47.380> there's<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.710> lot<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.070> difference<00:01:48.759> between

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
that there's a lot of difference between

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.950 
that there's a lot of difference between
people<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.490> difference<00:01:51.490> from<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.850> sense<00:01:52.810> of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
people and difference from the sense of

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.900 
people and difference from the sense of
a<00:01:53.200> positive<00:01:53.710> thing<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.399> if<00:01:54.520> we<00:01:54.640> were<00:01:54.759> all<00:01:54.820> the

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
a positive thing is if we were all the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.200 
a positive thing is if we were all the
same<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.390> would<00:01:55.450> be<00:01:55.540> quite<00:01:55.840> boring<00:01:56.110> right<00:01:57.210> but

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
same it would be quite boring right but

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.780 
same it would be quite boring right but
by<00:01:58.479> understanding<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.070> becoming<00:02:00.369> aware<00:02:00.580> of

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
by understanding and becoming aware of

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.310 
by understanding and becoming aware of
those<00:02:01.030> differences<00:02:01.450> then<00:02:01.960> how<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:02.200> we

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
those differences then how do we

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.450 
those differences then how do we
maximize<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.979> in<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.250> workplace
