00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.170 
new game that they're going to be
showing<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.030> is

hopefully it ties in with Gears war and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
hopefully it ties in with Gears war and
it's<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> show<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.939> there's<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
be another Gears of War or such but you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.890

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
so basically you're gonna be able to do

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.539 
so basically you're gonna be able to do
four<00:03:11.639> level<00:03:11.970> 50s<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.750> get<00:03:13.530> 50<00:03:13.889> first<00:03:14.069> time<00:03:14.400> and

four level 50s and get 50 first time and

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.849 
four level 50s and get 50 first time and
then<00:03:14.639> basically<00:03:15.359> prestige<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.680> it

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
then basically prestige like you like it

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.890 
then basically prestige like you like it
I<00:03:16.950> would<00:03:17.159> say<00:03:17.340> probably<00:03:18.060> call<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.419> three<00:03:18.629> times

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
I would say probably call it three times

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.680 
I would say probably call it three times
and<00:03:19.199> it's<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.400> four<00:03:20.609> times<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:21.060> 50<00:03:21.449> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
and it's so it's four times of 50 and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.710 
and it's so it's four times of 50 and
because<00:03:22.680> there's<00:03:22.919> that<00:03:23.400> many<00:03:23.669> on<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.299> retail

can see on screen which is called

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.589 
can see on screen which is called
survivor<00:03:58.129> completed<00:03:59.129> wave<00:03:59.340> 10<00:03:59.729> on<00:03:59.970> all<00:04:00.269> maps

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
survivor completed wave 10 on all maps

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.629 
survivor completed wave 10 on all maps
in<00:04:00.840> survival<00:04:01.560> mode<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.069> then<00:04:02.280> you've<00:04:02.400> got<00:04:02.519> the

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
in survival mode and then you've got the

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.750 
in survival mode and then you've got the
achievement<00:04:02.989> death<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.379> locust<00:04:04.919> killed<00:04:05.400> with

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
achievement death to locust killed with

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.259 
achievement death to locust killed with
all<00:04:06.000> classes<00:04:06.629> of<00:04:06.659> cog<00:04:07.139> in<00:04:07.349> overrun<00:04:08.040> or

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
all classes of cog in overrun or

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.659 
all classes of cog in overrun or
survival<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:10.199> I<00:04:10.229> think<00:04:10.500> horde<00:04:11.129> has<00:04:11.430> been

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
survival so I think horde has been

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.809 
survival so I think horde has been
renamed<00:04:12.479> with<00:04:12.720> survival<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.650> it's<00:04:14.519> going<00:04:14.729> to

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
renamed with survival and it's going to

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.029 
renamed with survival and it's going to
be<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> wave<00:04:15.479> kind<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.959> like<00:04:16.109> game<00:04:16.470> mode<00:04:16.739> like

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
be a wave kind of like game mode like

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.250 
be a wave kind of like game mode like
horde<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.269> probably<00:04:18.570> feature<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.049> same

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
horde and the probably feature the same

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.839 
horde and the probably feature the same
things<00:04:19.590> where<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:19.829> got<00:04:19.949> fourth<00:04:20.220> occasions

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
things where you got fourth occasions

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.039 
things where you got fourth occasions
and<00:04:21.060> all<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.449> it<00:04:21.539> looks<00:04:21.719> like<00:04:21.779> it's

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and all that and it looks like it's

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.209 
and all that and it looks like it's
going<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.260> be<00:04:22.349> using<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.650> classes<00:04:23.099> from

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
going to be using the classes from

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.519 
going to be using the classes from
overrun<00:04:23.789> so<00:04:24.000> you've<00:04:24.450> got<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> engineer<00:04:25.169> blah

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:25.529 
overrun so you've got the engineer blah

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:26.880 
overrun so you've got the engineer blah
blah<00:04:25.650> blah<00:04:25.860> the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
blah blah the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.390 
blah blah the
the<00:04:27.890> medic<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.550> scout<00:04:29.420> and<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:30.220> was<00:04:31.220> it

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
the medic the scout and the was it

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.500 
the medic the scout and the was it
called<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.850> soldier<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.880> seems<00:04:35.240> like

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
called the soldier and it seems like

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.930 
called the soldier and it seems like
with<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.470> name<00:04:36.620> survival<00:04:37.430> it's<00:04:37.640> kind<00:04:37.850> of

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
with the name survival it's kind of

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.490 
with the name survival it's kind of
giving<00:04:38.180> me<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.330> idea<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.990> it's<00:04:39.170> gonna<00:04:39.290> be

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
giving me the idea that it's gonna be

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.170 
giving me the idea that it's gonna be
turned<00:04:39.770> into<00:04:39.920> like<00:04:40.130> as<00:04:40.250> nazi<00:04:40.670> zombie<00:04:40.970> kinda

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
turned into like as nazi zombie kinda

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.450 
turned into like as nazi zombie kinda
like<00:04:41.330> thing<00:04:41.510> from<00:04:41.690> ecology<00:04:42.140> where<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:43.220> gonna

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
like thing from ecology where it's gonna

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.640 
like thing from ecology where it's gonna
be<00:04:43.550> like<00:04:43.910> horde<00:04:44.270> but<00:04:44.570> there's<00:04:44.720> no<00:04:44.870> ending<00:04:45.380> wave

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
be like horde but there's no ending wave

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.320 
be like horde but there's no ending wave
it's<00:04:46.010> just<00:04:46.220> gonna<00:04:46.400> you're<00:04:46.700> gonna<00:04:46.790> keep<00:04:47.060> them

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
it's just gonna you're gonna keep them

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.550 
it's just gonna you're gonna keep them
going<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.780> going<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.110> going<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.470> going

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
going and going and going and going

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560 
going and going and going and going
until<00:04:48.860> you're<00:04:49.310> all<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.580> teammates<00:04:50.180> are<00:04:50.360> dead

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
until you're all the teammates are dead

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.540 
until you're all the teammates are dead
and<00:04:50.750> that's<00:04:51.320> when<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.620> game<00:04:51.800> will<00:04:52.010> finish<00:04:52.370> and

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
and that's when the game will finish and

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.950 
and that's when the game will finish and
i<00:04:52.580> think<00:04:52.850> that'll<00:04:53.060> probably<00:04:53.090> be<00:04:53.390> a<00:04:53.570> bit<00:04:53.780> better

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
i think that'll probably be a bit better

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.230 
i think that'll probably be a bit better
because<00:04:54.680> on<00:04:55.070> horde<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.580> know<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.790> have<00:04:56.120> to

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
because on horde you know you have to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.150 
because on horde you know you have to
have<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.510> sit<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:56.870> out<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.050> get<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.560> wave<00:04:57.740> fifty

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
have to sit it out and get to wave fifty

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.440 
have to sit it out and get to wave fifty
and<00:04:58.280> once<00:04:58.400> you<00:04:58.520> know<00:04:58.670> you've<00:04:58.850> got<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.030> wait<00:04:59.150> 50

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
and once you know you've got to wait 50

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.020 
and once you know you've got to wait 50
you<00:04:59.540> finished<00:04:59.870> it<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.580> so<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.760> gives<00:05:01.940> that

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
you finished it and so it gives that

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.780 
you finished it and so it gives that
little<00:05:02.240> hardness<00:05:03.220> aspect<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.400> it<00:05:04.430> as<00:05:04.640> well

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
little hardness aspect to it as well

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.520 
little hardness aspect to it as well
making<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.300> harder<00:05:05.600> every<00:05:05.870> round<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.230> get<00:05:06.410> up

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
making it harder every round you get up

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.950 
making it harder every round you get up
and<00:05:06.770> then<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.880> rest<00:05:08.180> of<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.360> achievements

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
and then the rest of the achievements

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.290 
and then the rest of the achievements
are<00:05:09.050> followed<00:05:09.500> by<00:05:09.710> winning<00:05:10.190> matches<00:05:10.670> on<00:05:11.030> the

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
are followed by winning matches on the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.270 
are followed by winning matches on the
different<00:05:11.870> game<00:05:12.050> modes<00:05:12.320> like<00:05:12.830> team

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
different game modes like team

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.700 
different game modes like team
deathmatch<00:05:13.550> overrun<00:05:14.360> freeform<00:05:14.990> domination

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
deathmatch overrun freeform domination

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.130 
deathmatch overrun freeform domination
and<00:05:15.970> then<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.210> wraps<00:05:17.480> up<00:05:17.720> all<00:05:17.900> the

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
and then that wraps up all the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.120 
and then that wraps up all the
achievements<00:05:19.330> so<00:05:20.330> from<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.630> elite<00:05:20.870> guys

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
achievements so from this elite guys

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.740 
achievements so from this elite guys
overall<00:05:22.130> we<00:05:22.310> know<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.790> there's<00:05:23.000> levels<00:05:23.480> and

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
overall we know that there's levels and

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.130 
overall we know that there's levels and
the<00:05:24.320> levels<00:05:24.680> go<00:05:25.040> from<00:05:25.520> 1<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:25.940> 50<00:05:26.300> there's<00:05:26.990> going

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
the levels go from 1 to 50 there's going

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.650 
the levels go from 1 to 50 there's going
to<00:05:27.230> be<00:05:27.350> free<00:05:27.770> apps<00:05:28.220> included<00:05:28.880> with<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.180> retail

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
to be free apps included with the retail

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.650 
to be free apps included with the retail
game<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.350> there's<00:05:30.620> 4<00:05:30.860> chances<00:05:31.280> to<00:05:31.480> reach<00:05:32.480> level

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660
