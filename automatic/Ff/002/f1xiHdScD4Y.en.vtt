00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.480
 Your child Oh 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.710
 A push is Kuramochi to say all other things 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.710
 We introduce in 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.840
 Well then 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.510
 First of all 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.120
 Grab has 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.570
 What 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.850
 This is a comp 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.960
 When 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.960
 Harukyan

 Good a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.899
 Of Matsui Matsuko 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.690
 I'm Pooh 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.690
 What can be provided with it 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.750
 this 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.650
 Kashii is a tree 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.650
 Diary is 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.810
 I bought Sunset today Kashiwagi Maiu 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.970
 Tahara 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.230
 Will hit you 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.980
 Amina 2 sheets 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.980
 Aruka Masuda and Haruka 2 pieces are fine 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.020
 As I was at the executive meeting hand 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.010
 Finally Kashiwagi 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.010
 I was able to leave without trading once 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.510
 That's right 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.020
 Because 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.780
 Once it is worth this tree is 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.890
 What you want as it can provide 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.890
 There is not particularly 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.570
 What is equivalent 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.290
 If you want to put out 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.290
 I can do it 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.490
 so 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.170
 Yesterday 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.530
 Optical Thai opposition festival Gow 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.910
 But I was 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.780
 So I did not see the release of photos in particular, so I went to see the venue as it was close to walking. 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.050
 but 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.290
 Well there were not so many people 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.040
 It looks like it was so crowded 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.069
 It was not 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.680
 Yes 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.720
 I agree 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.400
 This year already 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.810
 That's all 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.160
 There is nothing after that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.250
 Photos from this year 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.290
 And out collected 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.290
 Although it was plus Dan path justified 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.320
 That's right 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.420
 Well 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.730
 the first 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.180
 It was difficult though I did not know how long to trade 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.180
 Yes 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:18.390
 Best part was the feeling I am in the September October 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.470
 I met a national handshake of ske 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.230
 Pareo 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:29.410
 Even if I bought a photo, I bought 3 pieces and got 2 shuris and 1 piece of Tamana Rina 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.460
 Good 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.410
 The other one 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.920
 It was good 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.920
 This 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.830
 This is to 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.390
 Hoshino nmb's cow on the west of Megumi 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.970
 bld is the October issue of whether it this is large 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.050
 This is 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.890
 As I bought blt for the first time and bought one 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.120
 Hikida is called 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.120
 I was very happy 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.409
 I say I play very much in the first sheet 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.870
 I was very glad that I had a sign and it had teeth . 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.990
 so 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.389
 concept 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:23.910
 Well, the line is also the story of next year 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:25.260
 Next year I bought the nmb lucky bag 5,000 yen first 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.400
 Its 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.310
 With the opening video 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.240
 Jack Robinson is 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:39.100
 Lip Esther set list 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:42.630
 But when I bought a quick attack because I think that the release photos will be released 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.760
 Introduction and monthly by January 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.760
 I think it will be an introduction 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.789
 Well then 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.270
 Good year
