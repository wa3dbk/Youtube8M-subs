00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 The skull showed all the marks 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.990
 a smaller lower one 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.820
 face half anatomically 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 This skull could turn into a gray one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.840
 Aliens are just like us 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.840
 imagine gray alien 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.210
 Welcome to exo magazine tv 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.670
 the magazine for freiister ever 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.340
 heard of the star child skull that is 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.350
 a 900 year old strangely shaped one 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.360
 skull about the scientist 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.550
 For many years to break his head 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.739
 a girl had the skull in the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.879
 Found in mexico in the 70s and in 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.610
 brought the usa 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.710
 the american researcher has people 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.089
 a lot of his life with it 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 spent exploring him 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.530
 He left the bone exam and 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.270
 found out neither the dns nor the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.440
 formations suitable for one 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.149
 human skull 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.310
 other scientists turn 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.229
 claim the exact opposite 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.840
 So what's the point here? 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:18.640
 story about the skull of the stars 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:22.190
 kindes the story of the district 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.160
 begins in mexico about 160 kilometers 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.360
 southwest of keywords near the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.179
 copper canyon 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.820
 it is a desert area almost like the one in 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.820
 northern arizona or grand canyon 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:40.039
 around 1930, a family came along 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.840
 Mexican roots for the first time 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.910
 for many years in their hometown 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.920
 back 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.349
 They had several children the oldest 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.539
 was a girl of about 14 years 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.920
 later she could not remember exactly 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.619
 Remember how old she was 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.050
 Anyway, she was a teenager at the time 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:02.780
 and when she in this small village on 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.160
 came there was said to all children that 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.440
 they do not heights in the or 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.110
 mine tunnel should go because of it 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.110
 that was considered too taboo 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.140
 Nevertheless, the girl decided 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.209
 there a bit to see so 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.400
 she took one a few days later 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.440
 basket and told the parents they would go 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.500
 walk a bit and pick berries 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.050
 and pretty far away from your village 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.980
 she found a mine tunnel in which 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.980
 she climbed inside 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.810
 when she got in there she found something 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.579
 15 meters from the exit where you 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.040
 still could see something 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:53.319
 a human skeleton that on the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.319
 Back lay face down 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.760
 she came closer and then just discovered 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.970
 a heap of earth like a grave 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.220
 looked and as she went even closer 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.709
 she noticed something from the grave 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.409
 sticking out something like one 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.079
 deformed hand so she has it 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.180
 expressed and this hand closed 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.400
 the humerus of the human being there 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.349
 was in the dirt 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.349
 It was a very dramatic scene 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.400
 Melanie was 15 years old 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.530
 nurse worked and 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.980
 doing with all sorts of deformities 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.230
 and their assessment is 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.239
 this unusual skull no 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.940
 human malformations as well 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.260
 As he touched him she immediately realized that 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.139
 he was way too easy 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.940
 she saw that his parts drastically 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.260
 from those of a normal human 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.260
 distinguished skulls 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.069
 the symmetry was completely different though 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:11.359
 nevertheless too symmetrical for each kind of 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.909
 Malformations she knew about it 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.370
 addition, they and ray members of the 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.519
 ufo research organization move on in el 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:24.190
 So, you know a lot about aliens 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.190
 and how they supposedly look 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:31.909
 So she said to perhaps the 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.340
 the head of a gray alien 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:37.099
 It carries all the marks of a gray 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.770
 even a fold on the top of the 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.340
 in humans does not occur people 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.230
 Skulls are round at this point 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.970
 women, on the other hand, are supposed to 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.199
 have heart-shaped face 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.940
 with a little speech on this site 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.330
 these enlarged vertebrae bones open 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.330
 every page 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.070
 besides, they should be a lot 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.590
 have smaller lower face 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.419
 The skull showed all the marks 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.389
 a smaller lower one 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.220
 face half anatomically 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.800
 This skull could turn into a gray one 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.240
 Aliens are just like us 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.240
 imagine gray alien 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.930
 when you give me the deformed skull 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.300
 then pressed into the hand because I knew 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.940
 just like melanie, this skull immediately 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.700
 is very unusual too easy 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.860
 much too symmetrical and above all was 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.110
 that's clear in the eye caves 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.729
 my father had been for more than 40 years 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.580
 worked as optician 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.770
 So I knew a lot about eyes and 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.020
 I immediately realized that that was extreme 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.020
 strange and strange eyes were 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.520
 I had it towards the end of this year 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.770
 already 25 major physiological 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.010
 differences between this skull and 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.860
 that of a human being together 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.900
 these 25 differences indicated one 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.550
 significant genetic variation of the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.740
 starts skull down 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.570
 so many hereditary information 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:33.280
 obviously different from those 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:35.770
 of the human genome as he 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.930
 Sequences of the start skull to 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.389
 database of the us health institute 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.979
 sent there came in some of them 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.599
 Feedback that they are in the human 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:46.210
 genotype are available 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:49.000
 one could determine exactly in which 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.099
 go and in which area several 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.240
 dozens of them proved without doubt 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.240
 as human 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.420
 but to the big surprise of the 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.910
 Researcher could at a certain 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.120
 no match in 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.280
 the database can be found 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.020
 that means it does not come from the 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.880
 earth 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.380
 if you are not in the database 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.720
 you can show it off already 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:20.020
 go out that there is no such thing 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.970
 a big part of the star child heritage 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.720
 could not found in the database 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.300
 become 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.250
 that is a strong indication that 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.410
 the paternal component is not of the 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:36.670
 Earth comes from the fact that he is not human 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:38.710
 but alien is 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.660
 So in fact the skull of one 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.850
 gray extraterrestrial that 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.170
 Appearance of the gray lienz dives 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.630
 after all, very early in the 

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:49.060
 Story on how Mario Rang showed 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.770
 but the extraterrestrials could as well 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.990
 in very different shapes and even 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.940
 dimensions exist as we for 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.270
 keeping it possible says the astrophysicist 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.490
 silobrand by ludwiger and what do you say 

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.840
