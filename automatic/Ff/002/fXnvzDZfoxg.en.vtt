compared to those bikes in terms of the
electronics<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.990> sophisticated

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
electronics like is it as sophisticated

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.710 
electronics like is it as sophisticated
as<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.010> MotoGP<00:01:41.430> bike<00:01:41.610> yeah<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.270> me<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> world
