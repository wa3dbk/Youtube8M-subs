00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.950
 what it's all about is that 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.379
 yes I think so too should be gambling 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.940
 this is an interesting device 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.099
 the latest innovation is an in-house development 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.099
 The special thing about it is the combination of one you have 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.659
 buccaneer 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.759
 this is a messie built hardware in combination with the software over theirs 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.509
 Fixing is running in the background 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.529
 and because the system takes care of that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.710
 Around the clock 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.739
 from radio programs 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.930
 but also at the same time if I for example 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.780
 the radio program value 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.780
 During the day, but in the evening when stress Obermann act 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.900
 and you can do that then I can only get it from the radio program 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.230
 extracted from it and listen to and listen to music 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.320
 I think that's very interesting. That's exactly what I want to do for myself 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.560
 Sorry for asking me or because the base here in this case is an iPad 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.690
 but what does it matter today about doing the best for us 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.530
 we have to keep on going in Germany »says Prof Recher 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.120
 our students 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 for us copper consumption it would have some other as well 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.080
 the screen controlled percent can be selected 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.440
 I allow in Marienplatz in a mode and I would like to be the first time 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.950
 Show data 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.619
 First we have to look in the 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.150
 Radio Motors 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.420
 and tried centralized transmitters 1live legroom and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.460
 Antenna Bavaria 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.460
 and I can also change the volume 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.770
 Century the castle in the background of the decline was gripping though 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.820
 Now push down a timer a bit more quietly by clicking on it 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.620
 the screen without circuit on antenna Bavaria 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.750
 I also get to it and displayed what you hear from him or the program 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 is currently running 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.549
 so you can for example during the day because I always like the 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.710
 Want to hear news 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.780
 I want to hear the weather forecast and I do not know what you have so far 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.390
 knows that again a player is on the court 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.560
 you do not hear it improved that maybe I was overdue 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.340
 Interest in the overall program of breathing but denied in the evening my wife 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.630
 for example tested 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.579
 as expected 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.900
 and then I usually switch to the top box mode 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.570
 it's almost deadly and now I'm only in Dürnten 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.489
 means that fits now reason is the whole music 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.909
 that have been set in the last few days over which has started 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.909
 Working day and very nice 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.109
 she can also be great animated here 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.979
 so the old cadres get paid to get the music titles displayed 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.069
 and can now be reintroduced 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.909
 create my own playlists 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.909
 and I have to be a bit louder 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.399
 For example, Nelly Furtado is Karas, but I can also be India and 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.399
 another chance from Twente Enschede 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.699
 now possible accomplices pliers showing them on the system are available 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:50.760
 stand for example 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.169
 even a psychological one 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.879
 logically the settlement Channel CEE Rock for example St 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.159
 and Bock Energy in Schalkau professional victory 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.010
 and already he spreads the whole composer to me 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.639
 and you say title is located at the most beautiful tower 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.949
 the ones that are still running over the radio channel the last few days i can 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.999
 just integrate it here 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.990
 for example, that this pusheritis 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.990
 and he switched to the title 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.370
 and plays in the new title which I have now dug digging who will want 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:19.979
 the whole dream 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.759
 yes, these are very rough features 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.479
 It is aimed specifically at a very special draws 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.489
 namely the target group 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.730
 something quite simple and straightforward 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.279
 nice device 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.760
 I was totally entranced 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.339
 very easy to use and always available 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:39.849
 the future ensures 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.319
 the biggest chances of victory 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.419
 Pannuti takes care of 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.239
 that was actually supposed to be pumped by a radio system but i cook i 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.559
 just to take care of the drink 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:54.239
 I work only with discipline and in principle but that the system as 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.459
 it takes time to work independently 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.989
 it is always available nobody the TuS Nack stayed on the radio for example 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.129
 Manner 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.849
 whether persons placed the devices think Thomas cold naturally also 1 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.379
 stuck in the Sound of Brand 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.909
 but when my wife comes home and make her order here game 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.659
 can be music 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:12.909
 the system is still open
