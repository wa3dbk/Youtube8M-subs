let's take a look at the inside of this

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.110 
let's take a look at the inside of this
one<00:01:38.530> now<00:01:39.530> some<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.520> things<00:01:40.790> that

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
one now some of the things that

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.790 
one now some of the things that
Northwood<00:01:41.810> does<00:01:42.020> when<00:01:42.229> they<00:01:42.380> build<00:01:42.590> these

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
Northwood does when they build these

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.830 
Northwood does when they build these
like<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.490> floors<00:01:43.790> instead<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.360> pressboard

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
like the floors instead of pressboard
