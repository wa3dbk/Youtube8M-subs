through the rubber trim line here
further<00:01:13.080> ventilation<00:01:13.710> down<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> help

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
further ventilation down here to help

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
further ventilation down here to help
draw<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.470> steam<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> heat<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> your

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
draw the steam and heat out of your

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.780 
draw the steam and heat out of your
goggles<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.910> they<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.150> fog<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.670> all<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
goggles so they don't fog and all this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.219 
goggles so they don't fog and all this
air<00:01:21.000> driving<00:01:21.450> into<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.690> helmet<00:01:21.869> you're<00:01:22.110> going

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
air driving into the helmet you're going

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.719 
air driving into the helmet you're going
to<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.680> some<00:01:22.710> exhaust<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:23.550> we<00:01:23.640> have

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
to have to have some exhaust so we have

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.790 
to have to have some exhaust so we have
two<00:01:23.909> large<00:01:24.330> exhaust<00:01:24.750> ports<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.229> back<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
two large exhaust ports in the back that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.279 
two large exhaust ports in the back that
come<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.280> off<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.090> tail<00:01:27.300> which<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
come right off of the tail which is a

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.040 
come right off of the tail which is a
perfect<00:01:28.800> scenario<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.250> draw<00:01:29.789> that<00:01:30.660> tail

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
perfect scenario for draw that tail

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.630 
perfect scenario for draw that tail
helps<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.530> create<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.830> good<00:01:32.009> draw<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.580> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
helps to create a good draw out of the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670 
helps to create a good draw out of the
helmet<00:01:32.940> helps<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.660> pull<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:34.020> heat<00:01:34.320> through

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
helmet helps to pull that heat through

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.639 
helmet helps to pull that heat through
and<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.160> helmet<00:01:36.410> internally<00:01:37.410> on<00:01:37.530> this

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
and out of the helmet internally on this

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.580 
and out of the helmet internally on this
helmet<00:01:37.860> there's<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> whole<00:01:38.550> matrix<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.590> vent

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
helmet there's a whole matrix of vent

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.310 
helmet there's a whole matrix of vent
channels<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.369> holes<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
channels and holes that go from the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.930 
channels and holes that go from the
outside<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> inside<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.670> literally

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
outside of the inside you can literally

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.520 
outside of the inside you can literally
look<00:01:45.270> through<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.600> helmet<00:01:45.990> into<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> light

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
look through this helmet into the light

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.160 
look through this helmet into the light
and<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> holes<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.869> through

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and you can see the holes going through

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.249 
and you can see the holes going through
the<00:01:49.289> entire<00:01:49.590> system<00:01:50.360> those<00:01:51.360> holes<00:01:51.660> basically

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the entire system those holes basically

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.630 
the entire system those holes basically
obviously<00:01:52.890> create<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:54.179> escape<00:01:54.660> for<00:01:54.869> heat<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
obviously create an escape for heat and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.809 
obviously create an escape for heat and
a<00:01:56.640> pathway<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.270> cool<00:01:57.780> air<00:01:57.929> to<00:01:58.080> come<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.610> if<00:01:59.610> one

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
a pathway for cool air to come in if one

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.660 
a pathway for cool air to come in if one
thing<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.209> bothers<00:02:00.599> me<00:02:00.599> is<00:02:00.929> when<00:02:00.959> a<00:02:01.110> helmet

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
thing really bothers me is when a helmet

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
thing really bothers me is when a helmet
shows<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.090> holes<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> outside<00:02:03.810> but

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
collapse into those vent channels and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.040 
collapse into those vent channels and
just<00:02:32.610> block<00:02:32.790> them<00:02:32.910> off<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.630> no<00:02:33.750> matter<00:02:33.840> how

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
just block them off so no matter how

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.990 
just block them off so no matter how
many<00:02:34.170> holes<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> outside<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.849> have<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
many holes you on the outside you have a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.610 
many holes you on the outside you have a
cushion<00:02:36.270> pushing<00:02:36.870> into<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.050> vent<00:02:37.260> channels

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
cushion pushing into the vent channels

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.809 
cushion pushing into the vent channels
and<00:02:37.739> blocking<00:02:38.040> them<00:02:38.160> off<00:02:38.280> you're<00:02:38.489> never<00:02:38.640> going

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
and blocking them off you're never going

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.880 
and blocking them off you're never going
to<00:02:38.849> get<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> benefit<00:02:39.620> that's<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.770> been

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
to get the benefit that's all been

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.740 
to get the benefit that's all been
thought<00:02:41.129> out<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.550> helmet<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.480> liner

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
thought out on this helmet the liner

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.080 
thought out on this helmet the liner
basically<00:02:43.470> works<00:02:43.709> around<00:02:44.010> those<00:02:44.250> channels<00:02:44.520> so

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
basically works around those channels so

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.610 
basically works around those channels so
that<00:02:45.120> nothing<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.020> push<00:02:46.230> into<00:02:46.410> them

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that nothing is going to push into them

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.059 
that nothing is going to push into them
where<00:02:46.860> your<00:02:47.099> head<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.870> pushing<00:02:48.870> against<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
where your head is pushing against it

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.890 
where your head is pushing against it
and<00:02:50.640> you're<00:02:50.969> going<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.180> feel<00:02:51.359> that<00:02:51.510> air<00:02:51.659> flow

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
and you're going to feel that air flow

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.949
