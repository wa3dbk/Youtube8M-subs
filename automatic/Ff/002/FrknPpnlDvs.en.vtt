00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.870
 Did you ever stop to think how it works? 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.180
 the language 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 You are born to install a little baby that does not 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.599
 speech does nothing happens few years you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.030
 knows well anywhere in the world and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.340
 He'll be talking to her in a little while. 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.840
 language of the place where you live, try to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.140
 This with a dog, you'll see that 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.400
 will not work but what makes our 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.820
 language something so special and different 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.070
 animals communicate they talk right 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 whether or not one of the scholars and linguists 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
 The most famous is the name champix 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 defends quite a thesis that there is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 a universal grammar and nata in being 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.170
 human 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.050
 and you see the summer has a limit neither in 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.950
 science and I stop to name a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 nem kinski chimpanzee who supposedly 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.039
 seized 125 words in the form of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.989
 signs of American Sign Language 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.899
 even though some animals even learn 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.879
 to relate words to certain objects 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.189
 at the time they will express themselves and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.619
 build their own sentences most 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.479
 sometimes he phrases that he has not 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.409
 nothing to see and do not make sense 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.119
 which makes scientists believe that 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.670
 they did not actually answer 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.990
 But what in our brains does the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 people having language there in 1863 a guy 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 called drill began to discover where 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.060
 what was the capacity of the people said 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.369
 communicate and more he discovered that you 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.549
 does not need the whole brain to speak 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.090
 language is not so dispersed 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.840
 you have a centers that perform tasks 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.890
 and do every part of what is ours. 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.720
 language 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.159
 in 1861 he received a patient who 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.799
 I just could not talk 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 he had an injury in an area that today 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.549
 in the day it is called a drill area 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 at the time it was his 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.880
 his patient simply did not 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.210
 I could talk 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.160
 I could not express myself but he 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.460
 I could understand everything 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.000
 that is, this lesion affected him 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.040
 his age to articulate speaks but not to 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.560
 ability to understand the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.540
 language, which indicates that there is a 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.340
 area in the brain that is responsible for 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.530
 one thing but the other 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.140
 You know that feeling when you 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.680
 Forget the word you wanted to say. 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.380
 Imagine you stay like this for every word. 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.450
 that you want to talk about is how the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.870
 people who have had to drill 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.060
 feel nowadays already know of several 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.610
 other areas that have several other 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.650
 functions in our brain related to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.480
 most of them were discovered 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.290
 precisely because of people who 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.650
 had head injuries at certain points 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.530
 and had very specific symptoms more 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.350
 crazy for me is wernick 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.590
 where the person can not understand the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.360
 language but she speaks fluently only 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.330
 that meaningless person forms sentences 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.130
 who would have felt that they are 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.970
 grammatically correct but totally 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.380
 decontextualized it simply does not 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.070
 Can understand what the person is 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.290
 talking and it's something else 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.980
 interesting about these injuries is that 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.220
 they were practically always on the side 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.380
 left brain coincidence lesions 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.190
 in the same location only on the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.140
 did not cause problems in the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.970
 This is the language of the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.840
 left the creative side the right side 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.210
 is the most logical side has a background 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.460
 The truth is that we understand our two 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.010
 hemispheres a region full of fibers 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.870
 of axons called the corpus callosum that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.390
 the connection between our two sides of the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.540
 had very serious cases of 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.040
 epilepsy you have to simply 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.870
 this communication between the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.210
 two hemispheres of course the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.370
 scientists are not fools and they 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.080
 opportunity to study the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.880
 capacity of each of the two 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.230
 hemispheres to perform different 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.170
 tasks 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.210
 the result here for some tasks 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.049
 it's as if these people had two 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.780
 brains 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.090
 dependents working there at the same 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.330
 time one side that is the left side is 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.220
 much more apt for language and the other good 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.659
 more capable of performing other functions 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.270
 many different 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:36.650
 if you put for example the word ball 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.780
 on the left side of the field of view 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.240
 person the right side of her brain 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.650
 is processing that 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.340
 She's going to say that she's not worth anything. 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.289
 because of the language side 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.610
 left will not really be received 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.949
 an information that has a word 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.830
 But when you send that same 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.259
 person to pick up such a ball she'll be able to 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.050
 catch with her right hemisphere 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:04.490
 quietly even though he did not read 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.860
 the word but how is it defined that the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.069
 left side will be the speaker the side 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.710
 right will be more logical than everything 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.629
 indicates something biological and very 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.659
 probably genetic for example 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:20.030
 studies with infants of only three months 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:23.240
 the left side of their brains is very 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.509
 more activated when they hear speech 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.430
 than the right side from the 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:31.789
 you are born you already have this division of 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.370
 tasks of the two hemispheres of the brain 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.139
 these studies with the children demonstrated 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.099
 also something that everyone already knew 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:42.620
 that children learn languages ​​with 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.270
 easier than adults but 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.969
 often an adult is almost 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.159
 impossible to learn a language without 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:51.800
 that's because we have 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.229
 a critical age for learning the 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.599
 phonemes of a new language 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.139
 until around the age of 5 your brain 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:02.150
 is open to learning new phonemes 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.370
 after the city ​​starts to look good 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.009
 difficult for you to distinguish phonemes that 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.050
 are similar but not different by 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.979
 what Japanese, for example, do not 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.719
 they can differentiate r dl and speak everything 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:19.159
 than chives 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:19.729
 nalin powers url is the same letter and he 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.360
 stay 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.710
 a kick of which is right and almost 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.969
 always hill 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.939
 another thing that scientists have discovered 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:31.339
 also interesting about how to 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:34.400
 learn a new language is that the 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:37.339
 of social learning 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.889
 there is social contact is very important 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.809
 for you to learn the same class being 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.650
 with the teacher face to face with the 

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:50.569
 student and being passed on to the students 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:53.599
 by TV or just by radio that the radio 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:54.889
 is much more efficient and is given by 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.139
 a teacher 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.460
 so social contact is important 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.649
 also for you to learn the language 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.770
 because it makes sense is not because people 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:05.599
 uses the language to communicate then 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.819
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.009
 I liked this video and I commented 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:12.139
 below which is the greatest difficulty of 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.309
 you when you are trying to learn a 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.689
 new language 

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:17.210
 do not forget to watch the 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:24.370
 my videos on how I learned English 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:24.370
 and everything else about English and bye
