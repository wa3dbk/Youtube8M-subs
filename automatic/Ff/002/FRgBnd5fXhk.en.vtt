00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
measure what does that tell us about the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.840 
measure what does that tell us about the
health<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.410> pond<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.860> that's<00:02:52.310> absolutely

they<00:03:02.480> chose<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:03.020> school<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.380> maybe<00:03:03.560> that's

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
they chose this school so maybe that's

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.960 
they chose this school so maybe that's
part<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.340> know<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.610> was<00:03:04.760> something

Annie<00:03:07.580> it's<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.330> small<00:03:08.660> enough<00:03:08.930> place<00:03:09.170> that

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
Annie it's a small enough place that

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.070 
Annie it's a small enough place that
they<00:03:09.470> think<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.610> horror<00:03:10.880> school<00:03:11.239> and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
they think this is a horror school and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.140 
they think this is a horror school and
you<00:03:12.200> don't<00:03:12.320> get<00:03:12.530> that<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.250> big<00:03:13.459> school<00:03:14.090> of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
you don't get that in in a big school of

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.570 
you don't get that in in a big school of
five<00:03:14.510> hundred<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:14.930> fifty<00:03:15.230> kids<00:03:15.470> many<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
five hundred and fifty kids many of the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.040 
five hundred and fifty kids many of the
activities<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.120> we<00:03:17.330> do<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.720> school<00:03:17.959> of

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
activities that we do in the school of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.650 
activities that we do in the school of
the<00:03:18.140> woods<00:03:18.350> are<00:03:18.590> similar<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.630> activities<00:03:20.630> that

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
the woods are similar to activities that

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.660 
the woods are similar to activities that
are<00:03:20.840> done<00:03:20.989> another<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.470> other<00:03:21.709> schools<00:03:22.130> the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
are done another in other schools the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.970 
are done another in other schools the
difference<00:03:23.030> with<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.390> school<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.560> we

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
difference with this school is that we

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.830 
difference with this school is that we
have<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.370> large<00:03:25.670> piece<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.269> land<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.660> we

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
have this large piece of land that we

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.580 
have this large piece of land that we
can<00:03:26.959> do<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.140> lot<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.500> our<00:03:27.620> activities<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:30.290> try

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
can do a lot of our activities on we try

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.949 
can do a lot of our activities on we try
to<00:03:30.650> learn<00:03:31.010> as<00:03:31.250> much<00:03:31.459> as<00:03:31.519> we<00:03:31.670> can<00:03:32.000> from<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.720> land

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
to learn as much as we can from the land

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.039 
to learn as much as we can from the land
so<00:03:33.890> we<00:03:34.459> may<00:03:34.610> be<00:03:34.670> reading<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.269> our<00:03:35.390> classrooms

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
so we may be reading in our classrooms

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.930 
so we may be reading in our classrooms
or<00:03:36.500> we<00:03:36.680> may<00:03:36.830> be<00:03:36.890> reading<00:03:37.280> outdoors

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
or we may be reading outdoors

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.970 
or we may be reading outdoors
we<00:03:38.360> may<00:03:38.540> be<00:03:38.570> journaling<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.260> our<00:03:39.410> classrooms

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
we may be journaling in our classrooms

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.979 
we may be journaling in our classrooms
but<00:03:40.370> we<00:03:40.430> certainly<00:03:40.970> prefer<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.540> journal<00:03:41.900> as

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
but we certainly prefer to journal as

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.259 
but we certainly prefer to journal as

much time outdoors you go out there we

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.479 
much time outdoors you go out there we

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
asking to do that a lot of the artwork

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.160 
asking to do that a lot of the artwork
comes<00:03:49.640> from<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.120> land<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.600> students<00:03:50.989> learn

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
animal adaptations and one way that we

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.069 
animal adaptations and one way that we
