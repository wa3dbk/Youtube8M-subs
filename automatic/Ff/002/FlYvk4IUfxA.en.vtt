00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the speakers that we will discover in 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.089
 this video complete the range 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.130
 fidelio de philips ie the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.250
 wireless audio system of the brand 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 dutch the fidelio a9 have won 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.190
 the best price without speaker 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 thread awarded by the association 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.900
 European sound and image 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 2012 2013 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.140
 so these are the highest speakers 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.310
 range of the fidelio family that one 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.310
 discover immediately in pictures 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.170
 the idea of ​​the fidelio range is from us 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 offer wireless audio systems that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.660
 it can be controlled via a smartphone or 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.430
 a tablet 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.590
 it starts with docking stations 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.260
 then small speakers and we finish 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.329
 at the top of the scale with léa 9 that we 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.219
 has here 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.170
 so we're at the top of the ladder too 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.149
 well in terms of performance that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.620
 terms of size but also price 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.429
 since it costs a little more 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.609
 500 euros 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.440
 so for that price what is it 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.479
 the system consists of two speakers 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 whose design and finish are 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.530
 particularly neat and who are 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.330
 so perfect to be installed in a 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.189
 living room instead of a hi-fi system 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.930
 traditional there is a first 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.229
 pregnant who is passive and who is going to be 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.729
 connected to the other who she integrates 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.799
 the amplifier a few buttons 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.470
 control as well as all the connectivity 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.140
 so we find a 3.5 stereo input 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.690
 mm an analog audio input a 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.350
 input for coaxial cable and finally a 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.119
 optical input 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.009
 so basically we can relate roughly 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.140
 all we want to its speakers that 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.330
 it's an mp3 player with the input 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 jack a hi-fi element with the go of the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.600
 logical or his television in 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.130
 optical for example what makes 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.110
 the originality of this product is without 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.179
 no doubt the way we control it 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.569
 since everything is done via the application 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.890
 philips air studio available on ios 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.990
 and on android 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.030
 this application it will allow to 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.959
 select the music source to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.119
 which one wants to access 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.369
 the first possibility we have is 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.440
 to read music from any 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.390
 multimedia device with space for 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.019
 storage accessible from its network 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.599
 domesticated 

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.369
 so I can go for example read the 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.879
 music that's on my pc or on a 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.690
 Hard disk 

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:11.269
 by browsing the library I can 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.379
 select a title I go on a 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.280
 added another to the playlist 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.659
 I have access to a pretty interface 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 classic that allows me to precisely 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.610
 control playback pause 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.140
 adjust the volume the volume I can 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.159
 also set them directly from 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.959
 the main enclosure 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.080
 what I can not do on the other hand 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.280
 it's set with the buttons 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.140
 my phone's volume from my 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.640
 smartphone that the application and if it does 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.450
 do not recognize that it's a small 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.190
 negative point anyway I find 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.330
 you see that thanks to the method of 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.090
 drag and drop 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.230
 I change very quickly source and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.680
 I can choose for example my 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.810
 phone 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.799
 oh my tablet let's move on now 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.629
 the services tab 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.209
 this space allows first of all 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.830
 select a service source from 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.920
 the different possibilities we have 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.870
 but also to access a whole bunch of 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.580
 you that are broadcast online which 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.160
 is practical is that we can pre 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.440
 selected these favorite radios for there 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.620
 access faster via the list 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.540
 reset but that can also be called 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.390
 with the five physical buttons located 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.670
 under volume control knob these 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.470
 buttons serve as shortcuts in 6 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.480
 degrees below we find two buttons 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.130
 which allow to select 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.480
 analog sources the jack jack etc 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.819
 fidelio to 9 also allow 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.739
 to access these playlist deezer and 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.540
 spotify that really could have been 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.010
 balls this power link a playlist a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.260
 shortcut buttons for 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.580
 directly to launch it 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.049
 serve as the application 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.120
 what is the case with radios 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.350
 since when the speaker is off a 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.840
 press one of the shortcut buttons 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.690
 turn on the system and start the radio 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.880
 associated if I go back to the application 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.130
 you see that in general but 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.870
 a little time to load between each 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.580
 step what makes navigation not 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.080
 super fluid 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.150
 I also find that navigation in 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.459
 my spotify playlists are not perfect 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.620
 for scrolled for example I am obliged 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.180
 to press a button 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.950
 it's clearly not practical and when 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.450
 I also support it tends to be 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.370
 interpreted as a double click 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.660
 which often makes me launch a 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.730
 song when I had not asked for anything 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.090
 and that then forces me to come back 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.310
 back 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.109
 this is the only real criticism that 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.269
 I have to do compared to these speakers 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.579
 they are quite expensive but on the 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.870
 material and finish is nothing to 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.289
 to say it's perfect we feel it's 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.700
 the quality 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.500
 on the other hand from a point of view of 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.140
 the ergonomics of the air studio application 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.120
 philips must offer us better for this 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.620
 price there the positive point is that as 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.510
 precisely it is an application you can 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.610
 hope for an update that would correct 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.960
 those little worries and would make her a little 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.820
 more user-friendly and ergonomic 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.440
 from the point of view of blood I'm not a 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.270
 expert but I must say that I am not 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.590
 disappointed it is even more than enough to 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.660
 watch a movie for those who want 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.460
 not invest in a home theater and even 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.720
 for a good evening we want to ride the 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.690
 sound and fart a little bass 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.430
 it's more than enough for those who 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.740
 want a little more level details 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.090
 severe acute there it exceeds my skills 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.410
 but I'm sure you'll find 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.220
 more details on sites 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.380
 specialized 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.030
 if you think the price of fidelio to 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.800
 nine is too close toil chuis 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.360
 to agree with you but that's 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.370
 unfortunately the market price of this 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.860
 type in simple be it at sonos 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.240
 or jérôme do we pay right away the 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.310
 wireless concept at all 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.960
 so hopefully more and more 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.030
 of brands offers us this type of 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.430
 product to start to melt 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.080
 prices or so why not that free 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.820
 decides to enter the market for 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.200
 pregnant between examined her if you 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.640

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.960
 joke truce thank you
