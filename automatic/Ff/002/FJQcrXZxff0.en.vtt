00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:11.000
 we continue now yes 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.380
 let's play 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.990
 with the positive clamp towards the red 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.240
 we touch the negative contact 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.990
 remember that the negative 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.990
 he is 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.420
 but I rectified 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.060
 and then it's located 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.060
 when you catch it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.700
 this negative is one of these two 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.430
 points here 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.520
 We will see how to know when 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 then that negative places a touch 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.570
 and I want them to see 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.200
 It's this positive clamp I touch it on 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.200
 negative 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.570
 and I make contact 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.050
 with our exit points 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.050
 This is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.650
 but in a comfortable time and color well 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.650
 here 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.870
 I return to the same 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.229
 in this swing and I have it quietecito 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.429
 that's what a circuit should do 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.939
 oscillate other circuits oscillate from 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.530
 this zero point from here that is 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.869
 soon the ideal as I tell you this 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.969
 circuit is bad the clock presents 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.770
 it is necessary to change it but at least 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.570
 sends his relationship to him what works 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.990
 but it's late 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.440
 there goes touch on a tip right now 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.270
 I play in the other I keep the clamp on 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.800
 in the negative of the stack and I touch the other 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.530
 tip 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.540
 of the output with the coil in both 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.540
 points have to show me the same 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.440
 they are there 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.250
 so then in our appearance 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.250
 circuit is fine 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.170
 these are some wheels press to the circuit 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.330
 mild 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.010
 now later they show us the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.630
 continuity tests that is for 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.210
 verify that if the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.640
 current from one place to another 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.480
 we continue with him 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.480
 armed 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.240
 we do not have when one uses in the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.350
 multimeter is reborn or turns it off 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.160
 because out there for s 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.110
 1k range was giving them 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.240
 energy is not going to close but 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.480
 if it was a little bit more the pile 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.200
 then it comes 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.200
 the wheels 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.640
 sometimes these watches are easier to 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.920
 assemble because the same 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.500
 perforations help us 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.170
 it's not like so complex sometimes in a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.940
 mechanical watch that you have to look down 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.370
 the axis exactly 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.450
 where I am, I think it's our turn 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.450
 the little apple 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.300
 look at that yes what is the way in 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.300
 contact not the gear 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.739
 inside 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.350
 and here we have the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.420
 you sure 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.910
 some of those wheels can be split 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.770
 also be one with the axis in the 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:04.120
 clip usually happens 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.730
 sometimes they are already to be damaged suddenly 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.680
 and asustek this damage to one ready you have to 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.160
 that part as they see practically going 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.750
 coupled 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.750
 what follows 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.660
 the circuit that makes contact with the 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.800
 coil and we go with the main stage 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.860
 or only sorry no protein no 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.449
 is not the one that the ink mine that 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.600
 hold 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.470
 the part of him 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.550
 gear part of the part of the 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.690
 circuit we start to locate points notice 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.800
 I'm accommodated right here we try to see if 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.190
 the wheels stand out 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.860
 we go as giving him touches and like her 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.780
 is accommodating 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.830
 we try to look I'll look towards 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.340
 part with the magnifying glass 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.110
 if they already fit the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.230
 the wheels yes but they fit we go to the 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.040
 I can sometimes according to the position I do not 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.260
 have reach to appreciate here that is the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.970
 holes are already occupied and the 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.920
 Well, look , we would not be 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.390
 nowhere 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.390
 let's see if with this 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.539
 let's notice well 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.430
 slightly some 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.229
 well sporadic that three stand out 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.229
 we go with the screws 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.190
 it's always a little easier this 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.190
 It is the clock system 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.380
 let's go once 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.800
 pressing to continue healing 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:06.500
 there are much more complicated clocks for 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.500
 put a filming too complicated 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.900
 for each one more does not last long for 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.010
 make it fit like the clock case 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.010
 what I told them at the beginning 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.689
 point digit one hour late with 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.689
 other 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.530
 the case that I showed you before a clock 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.530
 Swiss 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.750
 I told them that it bothered him a lot 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.420
 the circuit manages to repair them place a 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.190
 filming that's very complicated with what 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.170
 so many 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.170
 to the shoots
