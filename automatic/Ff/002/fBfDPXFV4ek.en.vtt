00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.270 
quickly get rid of hordes in states of
decay<00:00:10.639> so<00:00:11.690> first<00:00:12.690> things<00:00:12.870> first<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:14.099> got<00:00:14.250> to

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
decay so first things first you got to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.170

equip a grenade or some fire bombs now
these<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.750> quite<00:00:18.930> easily<00:00:19.260> found<00:00:19.680> all<00:00:20.250> quite

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
these are quite easily found all quite

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.210 
these are quite easily found all quite
add<00:00:21.140> basically<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.380> people<00:00:22.800> scattered<00:00:23.130> when

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
add basically as people scattered when

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.560 
add basically as people scattered when
you<00:00:23.340> scavenge<00:00:23.550> about<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.090> phone<00:00:24.330> quite<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
you scavenge about your phone quite a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.620 
you scavenge about your phone quite a
few<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.900> them<00:00:25.910> essentially<00:00:26.910> majority<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.510> them

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
few of them essentially majority of them

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
few of them essentially majority of them
are<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:27.960> rags<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.949> bottle<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.429> booze<00:00:31.130> every

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
are just rags in a bottle of booze every

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.119 
are just rags in a bottle of booze every
so<00:00:32.250> often<00:00:32.460> you'll<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.059> better<00:00:33.210> ones<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> we

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so often you'll get better ones so we

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.910 
so often you'll get better ones so we
need<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> sort<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.450> an<00:00:39.629> infestation<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
need to sort out an infestation in the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
need to sort out an infestation in the
guns<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.430> gun<00:00:41.640> store<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
guns this gun store now one of the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.270 
guns this gun store now one of the
easiest<00:00:43.379> ways<00:00:43.739> I've<00:00:43.950> found<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
easiest ways I've found to do this is

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.479 
easiest ways I've found to do this is
aiming<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> gun<00:00:47.370> store<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:49.219> basically<00:00:50.219> just

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
aiming the gun store and basically just

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.150 
aiming the gun store and basically just
lob<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:50.940> fire<00:00:51.149> bombs<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:55.160> considering

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
lob some fire bombs in there considering

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.240 
lob some fire bombs in there considering
the<00:00:56.280> game<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:59.329> very<00:01:00.329> strange<00:01:01.250> hit

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the game has a very strange hit

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.990 
the game has a very strange hit
detection<00:01:04.220> usually<00:01:05.220> usually<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.729> flames

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
detection usually usually the flames

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.929 
detection usually usually the flames
will<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.360> through<00:01:06.659> various<00:01:07.380> walls<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.700> stuff

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
will go through various walls and stuff

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
will go through various walls and stuff
which<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.780> actually<00:01:09.930> hit<00:01:10.320> enemies<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
which can actually hit enemies so as you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.320 
which can actually hit enemies so as you
can<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.409> Marx<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.549> well<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.970> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
can see Marx is here as well if you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.880 
can see Marx is here as well if you
watch<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.840> earlier<00:01:19.140> videos<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
watch one of my earlier videos on how to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.390 
watch one of my earlier videos on how to
scavenge<00:01:21.259> hay<00:01:22.259> scavenging<00:01:22.799> works<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
scavenge hay scavenging works and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.330 
scavenge hay scavenging works and
collecting<00:01:24.270> resources<00:01:24.740> Marx<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
collecting resources Marx is actually on

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
collecting resources Marx is actually on
his<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> sent<00:01:27.750> him<00:01:27.869> on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
his way back from when I sent him on

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.340 
his way back from when I sent him on
that<00:01:28.020> mission

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that mission

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.859 
that mission
so<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.220> come<00:01:29.460> into<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.329> building<00:01:30.509> if

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so if you come into the building if

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
so if you come into the building if
you've<00:01:30.990> noticed<00:01:31.220> there's<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.340> many<00:01:32.460> things

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you've noticed there's not many things

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
you've noticed there's not many things
in<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> building<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.500> we've

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
in the building that's because we've

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
in the building that's because we've
just<00:01:34.890> basically<00:01:35.579> set<00:01:35.759> fire<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.299> all<00:01:36.420> if

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
just basically set fire to them all if

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.830 
just basically set fire to them all if
you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:38.150> couple<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.180> screamers<00:01:39.689> in

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you can see a couple of screamers in

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.190 
you can see a couple of screamers in
here<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:41.600> have<00:01:42.600> died<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:44.030> well

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
here that have died because well

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.560 
here that have died because well
essentially<00:01:46.200> because<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:50.579> flames<00:01:50.880> from

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
essentially because of the flames from

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.069 
essentially because of the flames from
the<00:01:51.960> molotovs<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.189> through<00:01:53.369> walls<00:01:54.079> so

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the molotovs going through walls so

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.450 
the molotovs going through walls so
that's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.710> well<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that's a good well that's one way to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
that's a good well that's one way to
clear<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> out<00:01:57.149> another<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> using<00:01:57.960> grenade

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
clear it out another is using grenade

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
clear it out another is using grenade
especially<00:01:59.310> because<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> grenades

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
especially because the grenades

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.300 
especially because the grenades
explosion<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:01.079> actually<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> lot<00:02:01.710> better<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.159> lot

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
explosion is actually a lot better a lot

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.190 
explosion is actually a lot better a lot
bigger

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
bigger

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:23.720 
bigger
and<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> hell<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.369> lot<00:02:05.490> more<00:02:05.520> damage<00:02:22.730> so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
and it is a hell of a lot more damage so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.350 
and it is a hell of a lot more damage so
there<00:02:23.880> we<00:02:24.000> go

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
there we go

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.820 
there we go
that's<00:02:24.569> basically<00:02:24.930> one<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.319> most<00:02:25.380> that's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that's basically one of the most that's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.500 
that's basically one of the most that's
one<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.160> most<00:02:26.310> simple<00:02:26.489> ways<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:27.150> doing<00:02:27.270> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
one of the most simple ways of doing it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.670 
one of the most simple ways of doing it
or<00:02:27.750> at<00:02:27.870> least<00:02:28.020> makes<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.440> lot<00:02:28.739> less

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
or at least makes it a lot less

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.800 
or at least makes it a lot less
intimidating<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.830> run<00:02:31.980> into<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.420> building<00:02:33.420> full

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
intimidating to run into a building full

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.240 
intimidating to run into a building full
of<00:02:33.840> zombies<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:36.019> just<00:02:37.019> as<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> recap<00:02:37.350> equip

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
of zombies so just as a recap equip

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.890 
of zombies so just as a recap equip
molotovs<00:02:38.730> or<00:02:39.180> ideally<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> grenade<00:02:41.660> aim<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:42.870> a
