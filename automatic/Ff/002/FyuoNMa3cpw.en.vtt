00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
are the best for galaxies and we're just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.440 
are the best for galaxies and we're just
gonna<00:01:02.520> try<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.059> brush<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.930> a

gonna try and like brush it in like a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.190 
gonna try and like brush it in like a
spin<00:01:06.450> sheet<00:01:06.810> let's<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:08.869> give<00:01:09.869> this

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
spin sheet let's see we can give this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
spin sheet let's see we can give this
kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:14.570> easy<00:01:15.570> okay<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.400> when

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
kind of easy okay so it's like this when

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
kind of easy okay so it's like this when
it<00:01:18.030> actually<00:01:18.540> starts<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> turn<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.619> like

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it actually starts to turn it's like

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.740 
it actually starts to turn it's like
this<00:01:22.700> like<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.159> guess<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.939> don't

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
this like that kind of I guess I don't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.980 
this like that kind of I guess I don't
know<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.080> that's<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.220> book

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
okay let's just start to add in some

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.910 
okay let's just start to add in some
other<00:01:32.640> colors<00:01:33.259> there's<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.439> darker<00:01:34.890> colors

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
what why do those colors look exactly

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.789 
what why do those colors look exactly
the<00:01:37.380> same

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.390 

okay<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.070> go

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
okay there we go

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.230 
okay there we go
and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.210> other<00:01:42.390> colors<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:42.960> go

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
and then some other colors here we go

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
and then some other colors here we go
we'll<00:01:45.240> try<00:01:45.450> keep<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.840> bright<00:01:46.140> colors<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
we'll try keep like bright colors to the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.999 
we'll try keep like bright colors to the
middle<00:01:47.399> because<00:01:47.610> that's<00:01:47.759> where<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:49.009> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
middle because that's where the the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.569 
middle because that's where the the
nebula<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:52.220> okay

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
nebula is okay

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.789 
nebula is okay
um<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:56.090> then<00:01:56.210> let's<00:01:56.390> get<00:01:56.630> some<00:01:56.930> more<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.439> these

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
um and then let's get some more of these

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.670 
um and then let's get some more of these
colors<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.430> think<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:59.030> there<00:01:59.299> just<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.350> make<00:02:00.380> it

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
colors I think in there just to make it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.910 
colors I think in there just to make it
blend<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.070> little<00:02:01.250> bit<00:02:01.369> more<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:03.350> let's<00:02:03.740> get

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
blend a little bit more and let's get

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760 
blend a little bit more and let's get
some<00:02:04.159> blues<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.700> if<00:02:04.820> we<00:02:04.939> can<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:06.409> Blues<00:02:06.649> are

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
some blues in if we can the Blues are

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.229 
some blues in if we can the Blues are
probably<00:02:06.979> gonna<00:02:07.130> be<00:02:07.220> near<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.670> outside<00:02:08.090> I'm

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
probably gonna be near the outside I'm

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.580 
probably gonna be near the outside I'm

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
not a nebula a galaxy kind of actually

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.250 
not a nebula a galaxy kind of actually
if<00:02:41.930> you'd<00:02:42.140> like<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.590> little<00:02:42.680> bit<00:02:44.049> okay<00:02:45.049> let

just hope that people understand that
these<00:02:58.670> are<00:02:58.850> stars<00:02:59.709> I'm<00:03:00.709> sure<00:03:00.890> they<00:03:01.040> will

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
these are stars I'm sure they will

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.949 
these are stars I'm sure they will
I<00:03:01.430> guess<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.060> could<00:03:02.209> kind<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.450> put<00:03:02.600> some<00:03:02.630> other

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
I guess I could kind of put some other

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.539 
I guess I could kind of put some other
things<00:03:03.200> around<00:03:03.470> like<00:03:03.590> some<00:03:03.799> other<00:03:03.980> planets<00:03:04.370> to

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
things around like some other planets to

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.250 
things around like some other planets to
make<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.299> blend<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.660> little<00:03:05.750> bit<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:08.890> can't<00:03:09.890> see

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
make it blend a little bit I can't see

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.110 
make it blend a little bit I can't see
could<00:03:12.260> use<00:03:12.470> some<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:15.640> darker<00:03:16.640> grace<00:03:16.910> to

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
could use some of this darker grace to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.190 
could use some of this darker grace to
make<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.359> blend<00:03:17.600> as<00:03:17.780> well<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.840> then<00:03:20.840> let's<00:03:21.049> get

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
make it blend as well and then let's get

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.979 
make it blend as well and then let's get
some<00:03:21.530> mam<00:03:21.769> about<00:03:22.280> planets<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:22.910> here<00:03:23.239> let's<00:03:23.750> see

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
some mam about planets in here let's see

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.640 
some mam about planets in here let's see
what<00:03:24.139> we<00:03:24.230> got<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:26.810> get<00:03:26.930> some<00:03:27.139> like<00:03:27.319> smaller

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
what we got just get some like smaller

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.979 
what we got just get some like smaller
planets<00:03:28.100> in<00:03:29.170> um<00:03:31.269> it's<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.450> Salton<00:03:32.780> Sea<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
planets in um it's like Salton Sea the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:39.590 
planets in um it's like Salton Sea the
speedo<00:03:33.319> but<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:34.010> um

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.120 

add<00:03:40.600> some<00:03:40.900> shade<00:03:41.170> unto<00:03:41.530> these<00:03:41.680> things<00:03:41.710> and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
add some shade unto these things and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.790 
add some shade unto these things and
let's<00:03:42.370> actually<00:03:43.020> get<00:03:44.020> like<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.200> bright<00:03:44.590> yellow

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.920 
and do like a little thing that's kind
of<00:03:48.220> spraying<00:03:48.640> through<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.210> sky<00:03:54.390> okay<00:03:55.390> and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
of spraying through the sky okay and

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.450 
of spraying through the sky okay and
let's<00:03:56.110> add<00:03:56.260> some<00:03:56.500> shading<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:56.920> these<00:03:57.190> right

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460

mean I guess these guys have kind of

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.800 
mean I guess these guys have kind of
web-like<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.850> inside<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.450> a<00:05:19.510> galaxy<00:05:21.660> kind<00:05:22.660> of

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
web-like the inside of a galaxy kind of

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.170 
web-like the inside of a galaxy kind of
but<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.110> think<00:05:23.530> I<00:05:23.590> got<00:05:23.770> C<00:05:24.010> is<00:05:24.130> like<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.310> cluster<00:05:24.850> of

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
but I think I got C is like a cluster of
