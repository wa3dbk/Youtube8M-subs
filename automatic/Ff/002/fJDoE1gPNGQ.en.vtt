00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.800
 E: Hey James-- JG: Yes? 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.640
 E: Do you remember that mathematical card trick you did last year? 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.480
 JG: The one I did on Pi-day? 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.300
 E: Yes. JG: The one I did with Brian Brushwood from Scam School? 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 E: Yes. JG: The one I did on Twitter? 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.480
 E: Yes, do you remember that? JG: Yes, indeed. 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.620
 E: Well, I have another for you-- I have a math card trick. 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 JG: Oh fantastic, I like that. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.920
 E: But first of all we need someone else to shake the pile. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.380
 JG: Don't worry, I'll ask Beer. Bear? 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.840
 Can you shuffle the cards? 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.780
 Well that's done. 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.200
 E: Oh, great, now I want you, James, to choose five cards, 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.400
 and Beer, you hide one of them. 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.720
 And I leave the room for a minute. 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.340
 JG: All right, let's do that, I'll pick five cards. 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.060
 I choose the hearts king, the clubs six, 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.740
 the clubs four, the diamonds four, 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.840
 and the hearts nine, and Bear, you choose one to hide, 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.240
 so go ahead, choose just one. 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.180
 Ok, oh, this one? Ok, oh, don't worry, I'll help. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.320
 And what? Oh you are going to change them too? OK. 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.580
 We'd better call Eland back into the room. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.720
 Elk, is everything okay? 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 Did you sleep? Everything good? Don't worry, I'll help you. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.280
 E: Yes, now it goes again. 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.480
 It is difficult to know which card you have chosen, is it not? Yes that's right. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.240
 E: But certain types of personalities tend to choose the same type of cards. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.560
 And people who celebrate the clubs, 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.000
 the clubs six, the diamonds four and the hearts nine choose, 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.400
 statistically, they also tend to choose the hearts of the king. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.840
 Is that what you have chosen? 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.780
 B: That's right, that's right! JG: You show them. 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.780
 B: That's what we chose! JG: That's great. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.800
 How did you do that? E: I'm not going to tell you that. 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.260
 But everything will be revealed by Brian Brushwood in a future episode of Scam School. 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.840
 But if you want to know now, you can download the iPhone app that I made. 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.580
 JG: Have you made an iPhone app? 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.600
 E: Indeed, and you can now download it from this web address. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 E: Have a great pi day! B: Have a great pi day!
