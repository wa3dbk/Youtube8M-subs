00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 Planet Aphrodite 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.320
 It is the second largest planet at a distance from the sun. 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.380
 Venus has a size a little smaller than the earth 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.560
 and is continuously covered by dense clouds of clouds 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.240
 because it is shorter in the sun and does not have an atmosphere like the earth 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.500
 the temperatures prevailing in Venus are unbearable for man 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.080
 + 420 ° C per day and below -150 ° C at night 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.660
 There were spacecraft that came near the surface of Aphrodite 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 and the photos they sent us 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 have shown that the surface of Venus is shaped like about the earth 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.960
 with mountains, plains of volcanoes and rocks 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.680
 Only it has no water
