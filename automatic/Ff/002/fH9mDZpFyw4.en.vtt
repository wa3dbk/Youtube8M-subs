00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.429
 band leader boys and welcome to this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.469
 new gameplay are very excited a lot 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.780
 happy with this new black ops two 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.529
 because black ops 1 year must be given life 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.160
 on Youtube 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.840
 I don't know if you follow me in short, from jim 360 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 but at the end of the story of jim 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 pressing at the beginning with this new one 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.560
 history 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.599
 logically jim black ops but given 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 really life on youtube in the sense 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.079
 that I was recording my games 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.329
 I still remember you with the compact 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.800
 girls there you have this compact 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.300
 the sharp camera but you can do 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.649
 also videos etcetera 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.329
 here we record with that put it 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.760
 in front with the 3p of the television and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.140
 centering came the screen and I was 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.360
 precisely the gameplay of black ops with 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.520
 that in fact now when the some 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.840
 youtubers send me videos from 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 to look at etc. that they use 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.899
 maybe still the compact though 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.000
 check the channels I see that they use 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.890
 still the camera and so on 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.980
 I almost feel nostalgic because I think 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.960
 in the past and this makes me do me 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.049
 getting nostalgia is always nice anyway 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 from pass jim between 60 logically gene 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.760
 after I took the first hd pvr 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.110
 apache mix the apache and from there I have 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 just started recording 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.439
 gameplay done well with the pvr with a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960
 acquisition system with i 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.900
 controcazzi but I started to do 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 precisely gameplay of black ops why not 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.229
 I know why I liked it as a game 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.909
 I thought it was better than the series 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.560
 I liked modern warfare 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.960
 mechanics did the upgrading of the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.950
 accessory weapons and various crap e 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 so this game is two black ops 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 very likely to have it maybe so many gives 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.530
 annoyance because black ops always black 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.880
 ops however cod are always the gods and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.939
 I can also by reason since I have 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 always preferred reality style 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.450
 single which has butterfield made of field 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.860
 compared to the modern warfare series 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.659
 compared to all of them 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.070
 however as I said earlier not 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.020
 I would never repeat myself but still black 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.560
 ops born life is black ops two like 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.810
 my child 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.950
 so I want to go back to doing so many 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.320
 gameplay of black ops 2 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.299
 also because I want to evolve into boys 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 I also want to start looking for 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.439
 make beautiful matches anyway is a 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.830
 upgrade weapons to have to show 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.360
 predict died while dying 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.980
 blatantly in some of them 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.150
 hunting trip among the zombies 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.550
 etc. etc. 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.810
 therefore I am very very happy and first 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.580
 of all girl in this field and not 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.290
 I'll talk about the black ops game because 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.910
 however the game that made one of the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.310
 first I don't know I don't even know so much 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.780
 the basics we will talk later about how the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.490
 game of how are the weapons of how the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.270
 feeling of how are the maps ie between 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.160
 etc 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.120
 in this blog I tell you something that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.430
 really really annoys me 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.370
 lately i'm talking about the people that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.340
 unfortunately he does not understand that one works in the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.130
 sense that I started I say a 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.710
 all to ban some users some 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.440
 users who followed me because not only 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.180
 in short, they responded badly in the comments 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.890
 they were also very offensive and so on 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.600
 etc. but because they continued to 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.310
 repeating the 5 millionare disgusts me 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 because if a millionaire does all the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.550
 play in limits but what the fuck you are 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.110
 millionaire in fact to hide why 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.270
 if millionaire fuck's surprise why 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.700
 six millionaire and everything collapses beautiful I 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.500
 I ca n't understand the end of it 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.959
 long ago but when one continues to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.240
 repeat in any case of videos that do not 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.310
 I'm a millionaire I'm not a rich not 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.320
 I am a father's son, I earn my own 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.480
 I spend money on them as fuck as I seem to 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.120
 me and people unfortunately do not understand 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.730
 this thing may be that I am a child 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.200
 because I have children but rather those 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.810
 children there are children who do not 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.950
 they understand exactly an emeritus cock 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.750
 in fact I thank all the people i 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.310
 my users in quotation marks mi 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.530
 they defend even a defense macro 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.200
 however the right reasons are learned 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.430
 of my part they give shit against those 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.470
 bastards who continue in short 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.930
 would you write useless useless comments and 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.610
 efficient and means that many people 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.800
 in fact most of the people I am 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.200
 he realized that by working one he earns 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.970
 gaining a pump on the games ie 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.410
 it is not so difficult to understand and therefore 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.760
 I too get a limit point that I don't 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.709
 so I can keep up with it so I can 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.600
 seriously, also because i 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.400
 guys I wonder, but those stupid people 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.019
 I could call her ignorant but her own 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.670
 stupid is not even ignorant why 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.660
 it's not that he ignores things after stupid 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.980
 who does not understand them 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.769
 I wonder but look at unboxing 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.390
 because he likes it because he likes it 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.610
 game that unbox pac and I'm curious about 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.049
 see what's inside the package or 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.400
 they only watch the gameplay to give 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.410
 of the fucking head billionaire 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.870
 to people, that is to say, to understand 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.579
 this I like willwoosh ios and google 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.049
 books 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.280
 which now also work in radio has 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.530
 did tv series and so on and did you 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.300
 even film is not that I no longer follow 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.159
 why he made the movies is good for him 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.379
 it's just happy for him and if he is 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.969
 I follow him to criticize him I follow him 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.560
 because I like it could also do a 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.000
 video where it shows dwell new of 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.949
 mint or his lamborghini has 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.900
 new giant villa played at home 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.280
 per mega with a plush pool 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.259
 they travel left and right but 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.400
 honestly I would look at it anyway 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.960
 because it's not that I'm interested in what 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.580
 they interest his videos interests 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.840
 because I like it because if you are me 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.129
 writing means that I like but that 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.539
 I'm fucking writing like that 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.979
 so I really don't understand who I am 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.139
 however, the haters give keys 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.940
 Very much and I do n't understand people that are 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.319
 I look at videos to criticize them 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.300
 I will not like it without it either 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.460
 give explanations or in any case criticize 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.800
 insulsamente without even having one 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.240
 motivation behind people like that 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.490
 fucking dog for boys we close with 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.960
 immediately this speech that is not from me 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.509
 in the sense that playing a little too much in the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.509
 melancholy and in the pissing that is not 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.099
 I should not, however, obviously be it 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.659
 I challenge everyone not to be if I don't know if 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.099
 so much if in this stuff there is not 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.409
 I should be but I challenge everyone or not 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.449
 being a hub is the word like that 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.099
 to shit and parrying a bit of the game 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.550
 guys really first impressions 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:30.389
 great there is the free elite there is a 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.860
 obviously fast fantastic gameplay 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.990
 sparkling then kill so many enemies 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.580
 respect however butterfield that too 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.529
 in other words, if it is more real, it is more difficult to do 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.150
 kg at least for me who am not just a 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.800
 expert I always said my videos don't 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.870
 I'm an expert I'm just a regular 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.879
 player like many others in fact 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.860
 in my videos I never do a thousand 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.930
 best kill I do some kill here and 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.830
 there and I die many times blatantly 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:56.289
 with a moron he came out newbie 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.969
 without weapons that ok anyway guys 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.800
 as in the old gameplay of black ops 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.080

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.490
 of black ops two return to so beloved 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.889
 obviously evolved because you continue to 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.629
 ask me question question why 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.729
 because in the old gameplay I put 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.589
 I always asked a question and the best 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.960
 five answers in the comments most 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:16.449

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.069
 so they were put in the next video 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.599
