ends clip out your binding bind to the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.690 
ends clip out your binding bind to the
tails<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.270> braids<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.739> once<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.520> find

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
tails of your braids and once you find

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.729 
tails of your braids and once you find
the<00:00:41.910> tails<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:42.540> braids<00:00:42.719> pulling<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.710> one

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the tails of your braids pulling on one

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.819 
the tails of your braids pulling on one
side<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.399> should<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.110> make<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> unzip

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
side of it should kind of make it unzip

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
side of it should kind of make it unzip
that<00:00:47.039> braid<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> way<00:00:47.820> back<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that braid all the way back up to the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.170 
that braid all the way back up to the
top<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> once<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.399> place<00:00:56.610> we're

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
top so once we have that in place we're

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.860 
top so once we have that in place we're
going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.390> start<00:00:57.629> our<00:00:57.989> comb<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.600> first

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
going to start our comb out the first

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
going to start our comb out the first
step<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.379> our<00:01:01.530> comb<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.129> we're<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
step in our comb out is we're going to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.119 
step in our comb out is we're going to
actually<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.239> come<00:01:03.449> down<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.470> base<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
actually just come down to this base and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
actually just come down to this base and
pull<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> apart<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.600> when<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> have

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pull it apart a little bit when you have

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.100 
pull it apart a little bit when you have
these<00:01:07.770> braids<00:01:08.070> thin<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> long<00:01:09.060> time<00:01:09.330> you're

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
these braids thin for a long time you're

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.990 
these braids thin for a long time you're
going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> start<00:01:10.770> having<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.430> grout<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
going to start having the grout at the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.570 
going to start having the grout at the
base<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.229> braided<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
base not be braided and that is that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.719 
base not be braided and that is that
risk<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.409> tangling<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.619> bit<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.520> want

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
risk for tangling a bit so we just want

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.969 
risk for tangling a bit so we just want
to<00:01:17.759> break<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:19.229> once<00:01:19.619> we've<00:01:19.770> done

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
to break that up now once we've done

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
to break that up now once we've done
that<00:01:20.040> we're<00:01:20.520> gonna<00:01:20.610> come<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.689> ends

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that we're gonna come down to the ends

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.350 
that we're gonna come down to the ends
and<00:01:22.560> we're<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.430> our<00:01:23.670> comb<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.090> from

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and we're gonna start our comb out from

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.749 
and we're gonna start our comb out from
down<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.920> it's<00:01:25.920> important<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> remember

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
down here it's important to remember

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.950 
down here it's important to remember
that<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:28.770> hair<00:01:29.040> grows<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that as your hair grows you are going to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.649 
that as your hair grows you are going to
have<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> natural<00:01:31.680> cycle<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.880> losing<00:01:33.390> about<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
have a natural cycle of losing about a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.289 
have a natural cycle of losing about a
hundred<00:01:34.409> hairs<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.799> day<00:01:34.970> since<00:01:35.970> these<00:01:36.240> have

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
hundred hairs a day since these have

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.140 
hundred hairs a day since these have
been<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.560> about<00:01:37.890> three<00:01:38.189> weeks<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.939> can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
been in for about three weeks we can

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
been in for about three weeks we can
expect<00:01:39.630> roughly<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:41.570> 2100<00:01:42.570> hairs<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.770> have

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
expect roughly about 2100 hairs to have

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.700 
expect roughly about 2100 hairs to have
been<00:01:44.579> bound<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.420> these<00:01:45.750> dreads<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.530> has
