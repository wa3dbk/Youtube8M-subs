00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 and so hello everyone with you again on 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.040
 Autumn eat this is another small 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.110
 speed painting this time i decided 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.759
 do something more unusual by 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.799
 compared to what I did in the last 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.230
 pentin sleeps and decided to try 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.779
 decorate someone's base than not 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 I was engaged for quite a long time 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.859
 so I went to the devin and found the first 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.439
 got me a pretty base and 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.539
 quickly set to work itself 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.689
 I had no idea who I wanted 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.309
 draw so i thought for a long time and even 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.309
 as you noticed first tried to take 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.050
 character green skin well, maybe I 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.079
 too used to drawing monsters and everything 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.329
 but at the end I decided that after all 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.980
 it would be nice to make such a lantern on 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.379
 my lovely lady livnerog 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 and from adventure time so i 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.620
 went to work 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.469
 decided to try to do it in the same 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.899
 the technique itself as the previous one did 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.140
 speed ratings 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.289
 frenki matte and operetta what is the process 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.989
 took in the original somewhere just half an hour 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.820
 principle for me it was normal 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 search what kind of pictures to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.290
 be inspired and draw and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.159
 Interesting paid due 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.860
 Work on this lady I understood a few 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.830
 important aspects of me just 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 enrages small format 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.560
 permission and this database is very 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.360
 was small 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.380
 rather it was a very small resolution 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.270
 just about 300 by 250 or 500 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.590
 In general , something like that and I'm still for myself 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.290
 I realized that I do not really like 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.570
 draw blond characters do not know 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.659
 why but this color is somehow not in me 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.520
 attracts so I honestly don't 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.399
 quite a bit left satisfied with that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.460
 I got it because it seems to me 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.579
 then it 's not mine anyway how not twisted 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.530
 she turned out pretty pretty and 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.630
 funny girl though someone has him 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.450
 wrote on davinci that it looks more like and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.780
 on lady livnerog she rainbow dash or for 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.540
 May little pony what can all be 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.110
 each their own opinion as I said I 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.819
 I love drawings where the viewer appears 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.129
 the ability to determine what he is 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.930
 sees want it be lady livnerog 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.489
 want rainbow dash and maybe 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.489
 some other replacement characters 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.519
 anything can be entertaining if to whom 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.140
 interesting reference to this database, I 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.269
 leave in the description of the video 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.680
 so don't apply take advantage 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.040
 if suddenly you have such 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.989
 opportunity or necessity i wanted 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.299
 so that her dress was so bright 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.519
 but something all the same I honestly 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.310
 left scientific pretty wanted here 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.129
 as original but it turned out all the same 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.819
 something not quite from that series that i 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.099
 conceived it was still interesting 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.819
 boots I also wanted to do that he 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.819
 paid 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.829
 and that's what I did since 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.459
 video for him in my original half an hour 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:00.030
 it means you are watching the accelerated version at 9 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.310
 time yes yes here and so everything is hardcore and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.730
 that's what I basically got 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.609
 some accessories and my lady 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.010
 almost ready here so here it is 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.799
 I got a funny chubby 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.780
 As a girl, I wanted her to do some 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.909
 tails in general to change something in her 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.879
 hairstyle but then I realized that it was not 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.299
 looks so left her with such 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.669
 here is loose hair and slightly 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.199
 rainbow bangled here is mine 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.239
 larger version of copper 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.489
 I hope you enjoyed my video and 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.250
 a little inspired so march draw 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.949
