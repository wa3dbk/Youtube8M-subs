and that was why I watched that film and
what<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.960> made<00:01:25.080> me<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.560> about<00:01:25.770> while<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
what it made me and think about while I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
what it made me and think about while I
was<00:01:26.009> watching<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.540> you

was watching it so that's a lot of you
may<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> reasons

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
may not know that one of the reasons

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.069 
may not know that one of the reasons
that<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.520> started<00:01:29.909> recording<00:01:30.299> videos<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that I started recording videos and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.840 
that I started recording videos and
playing<00:01:31.229> hockey<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.710> skating<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
playing hockey in skating was because of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.120 
playing hockey in skating was because of
that<00:01:32.939> film<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.360> watched<00:01:33.720> The<00:01:34.020> Mighty<00:01:34.290> Ducks<00:01:34.619> d1

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
I think it was in like 91 or 92 and I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.200 
I think it was in like 91 or 92 and I
thought<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.159> amazing<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> time<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
