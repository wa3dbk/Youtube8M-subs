moments will not repeat themselves so I

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.790 
moments will not repeat themselves so I
did<00:02:12.720> exactly<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.379> for

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
did exactly that I for

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.310 
did exactly that I for
myself<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.400> my<00:02:14.610> sleeping<00:02:14.940> bag<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.540> was<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
myself out of my sleeping bag I was in a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320 
myself out of my sleeping bag I was in a
pair<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.530> long<00:02:16.800> underwear<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.640> t-shirt<00:02:18.090> I

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
pair of long underwear and a t-shirt I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.660 
pair of long underwear and a t-shirt I
crept<00:02:18.840> over<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.260> Justin<00:02:19.740> trying<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.250> walk<00:02:20.460> as

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
crept over to Justin trying to walk as

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.120 
crept over to Justin trying to walk as
quietly<00:02:21.090> as<00:02:21.300> possible<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:22.050> looked<00:02:22.740> through<00:02:22.920> my

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
quietly as possible I looked through my

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.430 
quietly as possible I looked through my
camera<00:02:23.460> first<00:02:24.210> thing<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.570> did<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.230> made<00:02:25.260> a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
camera first thing I did was I made a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.470 
camera first thing I did was I made a
guess<00:02:25.740> at<00:02:25.920> exposure<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.430> shooting<00:02:26.910> film<00:02:27.210> right

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
guess at exposure a shooting film right

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.870 
guess at exposure a shooting film right
so<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.870> severe<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:28.980> very<00:02:29.310> dark<00:02:29.610> outside

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
so this is severe it's very dark outside

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.290 
so this is severe it's very dark outside
I'm<00:02:30.510> shooting<00:02:30.960> 50<00:02:31.350> ISO<00:02:31.890> Fuji<00:02:32.520> Velvia<00:02:32.940> at<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
I'm shooting 50 ISO Fuji Velvia at the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.400 
I'm shooting 50 ISO Fuji Velvia at the
time<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.810> took<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> guess<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.250> took<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.520> stab

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
time I took a guess I took a stab

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.090 
time I took a guess I took a stab
sixtieth<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.620> second<00:02:38.040> F<00:02:38.250> 2.8<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.960> 17<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.680> 35

composed<00:02:45.060> my<00:02:45.390> frame<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.740> moment

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
composed my frame and the moment

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.710 
composed my frame and the moment
although<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.730> wasn't<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.210> was<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> fleeting

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
although this wasn't it was a fleeting

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.360 
although this wasn't it was a fleeting
moment<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.350> wasn't<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.890> needed<00:02:50.190> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
moment it wasn't that I needed to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.460 
moment it wasn't that I needed to
capture<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.910> quickly<00:02:51.570> or<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.380> know

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
capture it quickly or that it's you know

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.260 
capture it quickly or that it's you know
an<00:02:52.560> expression<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.640> really<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.150> this

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
an expression it's really just this

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.660 
an expression it's really just this
entire<00:02:54.660> scene<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.740> I've<00:02:55.830> put<00:02:56.040> Justin<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
entire scene so I've put Justin in the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.730 
entire scene so I've put Justin in the
upper<00:02:56.910> half<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.330> my<00:02:57.510> frame<00:02:57.870> I've<00:02:58.410> really

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
upper half of my frame I've really

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.560 
upper half of my frame I've really
filled<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.310> frame<00:02:59.640> with<00:02:59.850> my<00:03:00.060> wide-angle

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
filled that frame with my wide-angle

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.590 
filled that frame with my wide-angle
lens<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.920> squatted<00:03:02.460> down<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.820> found<00:03:03.180> just

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
lens and I squatted down I found just

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.450 
lens and I squatted down I found just
the<00:03:03.660> right<00:03:03.720> elevation<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.710> make<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.040> picture

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
the right elevation to make the picture

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.430 
the right elevation to make the picture
I<00:03:05.640> like<00:03:06.060> what's<00:03:06.330> happening<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> rectangle

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
I like what's happening in the rectangle

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.990 
I like what's happening in the rectangle
I<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.680> my<00:03:07.830> exposure<00:03:08.250> locked

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
I have my exposure locked

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.880 
I have my exposure locked
I<00:03:09.030> think<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.780> right<00:03:09.990> it's<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.290> little<00:03:10.410> tricky

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
I think it's right it's a little tricky

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.160 
I think it's right it's a little tricky
because<00:03:10.920> there's<00:03:11.460> snow<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> scene<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:13.080> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
because there's snow in the scene and I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.800 
because there's snow in the scene and I
depress<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.770> shutter<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.400> frame<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.450> before

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
depress the shutter one frame and before

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.630 
depress the shutter one frame and before
I<00:03:15.840> know<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.080> Justin's<00:03:16.680> arm<00:03:16.890> comes<00:03:17.220> slipping

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
I know it Justin's arm comes slipping

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
I know it Justin's arm comes slipping
out<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> sleeping<00:03:18.180> bag

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
out of the sleeping bag

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.930
