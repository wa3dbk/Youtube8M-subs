00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 good afternoon how are my name is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.790
 gregor mendel and today we will see the laws 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.830
 that I formulated some time ago 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.990
 in this video my ideas are presented 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.210
 fundamentals that start the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 genetic science that studies the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
 transmission of the characters of a 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.260
 generation to the other as well as the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 laws that govern such process for 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.550
 start elaborate my experiments 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.179
 using an easily cultivated plant 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 the pea known as vetch 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.630
 distinguish that certain plants gave 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 beans with yellow seeds and that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.489
 other plants gave green beans with 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.440
 green seeds I immediately wanted 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.180
 check that if all the descendants 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.520
 I saw the plant with seeds 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
 yellows would produce shags with 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.079
 yellow seeds or if they would present 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.809
 another color in the same way with the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.820
 green seed plant then what 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.949
 What I did was cross the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.859
 yellow pea plants with each other 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.050
 and they always gave yellow seeds what 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.449
 same I did with the green peas and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.280
 always they gave the green seeds 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.090
 check that the plants were pure 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.159
 I decided 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 cross the yellow seed plants 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.259
 with the green seed plants I already 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.929
 parental generation to these plants and 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.719
 symbolizes them with the letter p when crossing 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.700
 the two pure races or paternal 1 all 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.890
 the individuals children whom they call 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.829
 subsidiary 1 or first generation subsidiary 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.990
 obtained were yellow denominate the 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.939
 hybrid offspring because they possessed 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.549
 information for both characters 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.340
 yellow and green to the character that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.319
 he manifested what he calls dominant in this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.569
 case the yellow color and the factor 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.959
 hereditary that produced such character 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.969
 represent it with the capital letter 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.149
 and to the character that was hidden I call it 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.280
 recessive in this case the color green and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.130
 symbolize it with the lowercase letter 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.170
 this experiment extracted my first law 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.510
 or uniformity law of the first 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.670
 generation all the individuals that 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.560
 descended from two pure races are 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.869
 equal to each other and one of their 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.790
 progenitors 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.039
 now call phenotype to the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.170
 observable characteristic in this case 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.690
 the color of the seed could be 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.850
 present two possible phenotypes the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.610
 yellow seed color and the color of 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.800
 green seed in the cross that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.070
 represents on the screen the phenotype of 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.920
 subsidiary 1 is 100% descendants with 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.670
 yellow seeds is to say all the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.160
 children present yellow seeds later 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.410
 I called genotype to the cause that originated 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.260
 certain phenotype or characteristic 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.200
 observable and represent it as I said 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.030
 previously with letters the genotype 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.459
 can present three types of 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.640
 variations in the example shown 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.920
 it's first capitalized individuals a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.860
 uppercase are dominant homozygotes 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.730
 second individuals a capital letter to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.740
 lower case 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.380
 they are heterozygous individuals 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.750
 and third individuals to lowercase and to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.750
 tiny that are moix and recessive drops 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.860
 he went on to explain in detail my 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.930
 first law first crosses a 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.569
 individual homo zygote dominant to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.420
 uppercase to uppercase with another individual 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.240
 homo zygote recessive lowercase 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.330
 tiny both plants produce their 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.069
 gambetas or sexual cells the plants 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.380
 of yellow seeds that are 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.360
 dominant homozygotes produce only 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.760
 gametes with the hereditary factor to 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.040
 capital letter and seed plants 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.170
 greens that are moix and recessive drops 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.780
 they produce only gametes with the factor 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.510
 hereditary to lowercase 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.180
 when cookies are merged to uppercase 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.420
 with the lower case an individual is formed 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.250
 uppercase or lowercase that individual will give 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.440
 yellow seeds because the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.540
 dominant character to uppercase 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.970
 manifests staying without 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.700
 manifest the recessive character to 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.890
 tiny these individuals are from 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.690
 heterozygous genotype because they present 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.989
 a dominant character and a character 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.989
 recessive 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.780
 very good friends until here come my 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.360
 conclusions in my first law more 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.830
 forward I will publish my other two laws 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.830
 thanks for your attention
