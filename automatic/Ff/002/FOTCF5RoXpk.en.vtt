00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
fix something to his tree so I should

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.400 
fix something to his tree so I should
stand<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> chance<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.630> being<00:00:18.779> able<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> shoot

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410

the<00:00:19.529> squirrel<00:00:19.800> as<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.580> sitting<00:00:20.880> there

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the squirrel as it's sitting there

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.820 
the squirrel as it's sitting there
feeding<00:00:21.300> rather<00:00:21.900> than<00:00:22.140> having<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.439> get<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.680> on

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
feeding rather than having to get it on

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.429 
feeding rather than having to get it on
the<00:00:22.949> approach<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.630> bit<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.260> edge

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the approach but when it's a bit on edge

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.529 
the approach but when it's a bit on edge
waiting<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.519> trying<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> come<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:28.099> so

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
waiting for I trying to come in so

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.450 
waiting for I trying to come in so
fingers<00:00:30.539> crossed<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> now

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
fingers crossed I get for you now

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.640 
fingers crossed I get for you now
and<00:00:33.970> I<00:00:34.090> didn't<00:00:34.360> have<00:00:34.450> long<00:00:34.570> to<00:00:34.630> wait

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:48.750 

just<00:00:41.250> why

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.510 

this<00:00:49.760> world<00:00:50.180> was<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.330> bit<00:00:50.540> wary<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.050> camera

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.830 

but<00:00:58.520> before<00:00:58.850> long<00:00:59.030> he<00:00:59.270> was<00:00:59.300> sitting<00:00:59.660> on<00:00:59.690> the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
but before long he was sitting on the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.190 
but before long he was sitting on the
platform<00:01:00.020> tucking<00:01:01.010> into<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.310> nuts<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.200> that

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
platform tucking into the nuts and that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:20.930 
platform tucking into the nuts and that
was<00:01:03.380> my<00:01:03.530> chance

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.820 

but<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:21.570> next<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:21.990> preferred<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.440> sit<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
but the next one preferred to sit at the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.620 
but the next one preferred to sit at the
base<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.250> tree<00:01:23.520> picking<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> spilled

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
base of the tree picking up the spilled

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.040 
base of the tree picking up the spilled
nuts

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
nuts

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.500 
nuts
it<00:01:25.740> had<00:01:25.890> its<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.490> me<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> had<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.420> be

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
it had its back to me so I had to be

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.450 
it had its back to me so I had to be
patient<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.080> wait<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> turn<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.430> I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
patient and wait for it to turn so I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:41.100 
patient and wait for it to turn so I
could<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:29.820> clear<00:01:30.120> head<00:01:30.300> shot

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.350 

so<00:01:41.710> that<00:01:41.860> was<00:01:41.980> two<00:01:42.190> down<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.640> half<00:01:43.150> an<00:01:43.270> hour

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
so that was two down and half an hour

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:57.360 
so that was two down and half an hour
later<00:01:43.420> there<00:01:43.870> was<00:01:43.930> another<00:01:43.990> on<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.470> nuts<00:01:56.370> all

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
later there was another on the nuts all

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.850 
later there was another on the nuts all
in<00:01:57.610> all<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.820> good<00:01:58.030> session<00:01:58.480> then<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:59.380> certainly

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
in all a good session then it certainly

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.320 
in all a good session then it certainly
showed<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.310> value<00:02:00.580> of<00:02:00.700> building<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:01.120> simple

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
showed the value of building a simple

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.510 
showed the value of building a simple
feed<00:02:01.720> point<00:02:01.900> in<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.260> woods<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.370> get

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
feed point in the woods so you can get

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.490 
feed point in the woods so you can get
clear<00:02:03.790> head<00:02:04.030> shots<00:02:04.300> at<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.570> squirrels<00:02:04.930> while

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
clear head shots at the squirrels while

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.010 
clear head shots at the squirrels while
they're<00:02:05.620> on<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.830> bait
