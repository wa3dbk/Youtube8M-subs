00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.380 

okay<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.379> cat<00:00:17.160> blaster<00:00:17.609> 2009

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
okay so this is how the cat blaster 2009

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.769 
okay so this is how the cat blaster 2009
works<00:00:18.859> as<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.340> see<00:00:20.490> right<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:20.750> we<00:00:21.750> have

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
works as you can see right here we have

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.370 
works as you can see right here we have
the<00:00:22.199> little<00:00:22.410> IR<00:00:22.800> sensor<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:25.109> got<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the little IR sensor and it's got the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.080 
the little IR sensor and it's got the
four<00:00:25.529> screws<00:00:25.859> hold<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> lid<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.939> just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
four screws hold the lid on you just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790 
four screws hold the lid on you just
remove<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> four<00:00:27.689> screws<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.529> take<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
remove the four screws you can take the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
remove the four screws you can take the
lid<00:00:28.980> right<00:00:29.160> off<00:00:29.220> there<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.449> see<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
lid right off there you can see the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.100 
lid right off there you can see the
circuit<00:00:31.170> board<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:32.420> holds<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.719> IR

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
circuit board that holds all the IR

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.479 
circuit board that holds all the IR
equipment

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
equipment

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.720 
equipment
and<00:00:35.879> inside<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.629> can<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.070> internal

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and inside you can see all the internal

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.910 
and inside you can see all the internal
mechanics<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.690> all

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.630 

here<00:00:43.519> you<00:00:43.670> have<00:00:43.850> your<00:00:44.120> air<00:00:44.750> nozzle<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:46.219> you

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
here you have your air nozzle and you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.939 
here you have your air nozzle and you
have<00:00:46.820> your<00:00:46.969> servo<00:00:47.390> with<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.260> linkage<00:00:48.739> system

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
have your servo with a linkage system

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.599 
have your servo with a linkage system
pulls<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.879> trigger<00:00:50.089> and<00:00:51.050> here's<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:52.219> circuit

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
pulls the trigger and here's the circuit

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.750 
pulls the trigger and here's the circuit
board<00:00:52.820> it's<00:00:53.300> got<00:00:53.479> a<00:00:53.510> pickaxe<00:00:53.960> 0<00:00:54.589> 8m

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
board it's got a pickaxe 0 8m

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.490 
board it's got a pickaxe 0 8m
and<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.780> taken<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.289> our<00:00:58.320> input<00:00:58.949> and<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:01.260> sees

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and just taken out our input and it sees

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.880 
and just taken out our input and it sees
the<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> many<00:01:03.030> command<00:01:03.839> number<00:01:04.199> two<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the so many command number two it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.620 
the so many command number two it
triggers<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> output<00:01:06.180> pin<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> servo

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
triggers the output pin for the servo

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.179 
triggers the output pin for the servo
you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> two<00:01:10.200> batteries<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:11.070> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you can see the two batteries one is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.510 
you can see the two batteries one is
going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> logic<00:01:12.810> IC<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.649> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
going to be for the logic IC and the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
going to be for the logic IC and the
other<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.789> is<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> servo

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
other one is going to be for the servo

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
other one is going to be for the servo
also<00:01:17.190> you've<00:01:17.340> got<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> two<00:01:17.789> wires<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
also you've got the two wires in the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.680 
also you've got the two wires in the
back<00:01:18.539> also<00:01:18.899> fully<00:01:19.530> disconnectable<00:01:20.420> goes<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
back also fully disconnectable goes to

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.499 
back also fully disconnectable goes to
the<00:01:21.869> nice<00:01:22.049> switch<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> we'll<00:01:24.390> go

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the nice switch in the back so we'll go

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.179 
the nice switch in the back so we'll go
ahead<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.720> trigger<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.170> guy<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:25.979> guys

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
ahead and trigger this guy and you guys

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:35.210 
ahead and trigger this guy and you guys
can<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.640> these<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> artworks

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:45.920 

you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 

ah

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 

ah
