00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.280
 is playing through pstc 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 there was where the Coritiba needed 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 left side and it does not ask 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.219
 was playing as a left back 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.010
 I did well in this competition that in the meantime 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.050
 I was curious and it was where I came to Curitiba. 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 Let's go to the votorantim cup. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.279
 Then I went back to Curitiba. I introduced myself. 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.580
 in the selection but still with the player 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.140
 curitiba and this was made the negotiation 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.210
 It was then the time they closed when 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000
 I came back to tsf definitely here in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 coritiba and I mirror myself in my 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.460
 position plus a mirror of the players 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.100
 like willian farias and alex ii that the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.200
 two started the basic category and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 today are here being both great 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320
 one of the best players in the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.649
 Coritiba here is a professional in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.300
 mirror them in the posture they have 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.989
 within the field and also out of field to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.480
 posture that alex has the exemplary face 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.590
 that my coach always gives examples 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 above him 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.910
 I really hope the two players do not 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 be in my position but lost a lot of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.460
 person who is not 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 their 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 the Brazilian team whenever I am 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.840
 summoned and arrives and introduces himself and I 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.110
 I'm going to like it first time. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 in front of the program I can always have 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.220
 ten placements now but always when 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.330
 I go there I always defend myself as if 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.619
 was the first placement because I 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.659
 I have a good sequence in the selection 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.310
 Because I got there, I do not 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.229
 It matters if I have 10 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.970
 I have five but I always showed my 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.380
 work for me that was in 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.150
 on the next vote 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.570
 curitiba is already a lot off the field 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.490
 right is now Coritiba I was very 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 Valued, you 're doing everything to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.579
 have a good structure 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.939
 already in major championships to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.399
 always curious to be remembered because today 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.500
 in curitiba helps me a lot for the field 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.079
 I just have to thank Coritiba 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.790
 for everything that comes I've been doing and 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.399
 If this were not the opportunity for me 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.380
 Today I would not be here to tell 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.380
 You, but I'm very grateful, curitiba.
