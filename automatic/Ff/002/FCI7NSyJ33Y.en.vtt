00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.899 
ditch this tuna can as the primer and
use<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:01.140> bottom<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.649> fosters<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.399> instead

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
use the bottom of a fosters can instead

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.260 
use the bottom of a fosters can instead
you<00:02:03.600> know<00:02:03.750> those<00:02:03.899> big<00:02:04.110> beer<00:02:04.890> cans<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:06.149> would

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you know those big beer cans that would

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
you know those big beer cans that would
be<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> little<00:02:06.600> bit<00:02:06.810> lighter<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.469> weight<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
be a little bit lighter in weight and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.059 
be a little bit lighter in weight and
then<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.479> aluminum<00:02:09.899> flashing<00:02:10.200> comes<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
then the aluminum flashing comes on a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.660 
then the aluminum flashing comes on a
roll

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
roll

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.309 
roll
five<00:02:11.970> inches<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.500> could<00:02:13.830> ditch<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.180> X<00:02:15.720> pot

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
five inches so I could ditch the X pot

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.559 
five inches so I could ditch the X pot
stand<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.520> would<00:02:17.640> come<00:02:17.849> up<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.239> sit

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
stand and it would come up and sit

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.320 
stand and it would come up and sit
underneath<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.170> lid<00:02:19.380> here<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:20.310> basically<00:02:20.819> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
underneath the lid here it's basically a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.479 
underneath the lid here it's basically a
poor<00:02:21.660> man's<00:02:21.870> caldera<00:02:22.380> cone<00:02:22.680> which<00:02:23.340> is

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
poor man's caldera cone which is

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.729 
poor man's caldera cone which is
something<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.090> buy<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.780> then<00:02:25.470> use

something that you can buy and then use

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.160 
something that you can buy and then use
a<00:02:25.770> hole<00:02:26.010> puncher<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.180> drill<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.569> drill<00:02:27.930> some

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
a hole puncher or a drill and drill some

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.010 
a hole puncher or a drill and drill some
holes<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.910> get<00:02:30.270> air<00:02:30.480> flow<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.930> that

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
holes so that you get air flow so that

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.780 
holes so that you get air flow so that
your<00:02:31.170> stove<00:02:31.410> will<00:02:31.560> actually<00:02:31.980> work<00:02:32.790> i<00:02:33.540> am<00:02:34.230> using

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
your stove will actually work i am using

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.960 
your stove will actually work i am using
these<00:02:35.790> sports<00:02:36.750> i<00:02:37.200> got<00:02:37.890> them<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.250> walmart

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that's a 4-pack for about three dollars

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.330 
that's a 4-pack for about three dollars
i<00:02:41.519> think<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.530> i'll<00:02:43.530> have<00:02:43.739> some<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.040> my<00:02:44.069> bounce

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
i think so i'll have some in my bounce

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.930 
i think so i'll have some in my bounce
boxes<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.739> in<00:02:46.739> case<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.040> lose<00:02:47.069> one<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.489> break

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
boxes and in case I lose one or break

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
boxes and in case I lose one or break
one<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.300> something<00:02:48.569> like<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.110> they<00:02:49.260> seem

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
one or something like that but they seem

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.190 
one or something like that but they seem
just<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.799> good<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.360> light<00:02:51.360> my<00:02:51.510> fire<00:02:51.690> spork

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
just as good as a light my fire spork

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.080 
just as good as a light my fire spork
and<00:02:52.440> they<00:02:52.590> weigh<00:02:52.739> nothing<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.790> doesn't

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
and they weigh nothing but it doesn't

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.940 
and they weigh nothing but it doesn't
fit<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.660> here<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.319> there's<00:02:55.620> always<00:02:55.739> the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
fit in here so there's always the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.690 
fit in here so there's always the
problem<00:02:56.130> where<00:02:56.760> does<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.120> thing<00:02:57.420> live<00:02:58.700> what

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
problem where does this thing live what

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.550 
problem where does this thing live what
I<00:02:59.730> used<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.630> past<00:03:00.930> oh<00:03:03.230> yeah<00:03:04.230> there's<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I used in the past oh yeah there's a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.870 
I used in the past oh yeah there's a
little<00:03:04.620> penny<00:03:04.890> goes<00:03:05.130> on<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> stove<00:03:05.580> there's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
little penny goes on the stove there's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.940 
little penny goes on the stove there's
my<00:03:06.000> scrubby<00:03:06.480> my<00:03:07.080> lighter<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.739> there<00:03:07.860> will

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
my scrubby my lighter and there will

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.320 
my scrubby my lighter and there will
probably<00:03:08.130> be<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.370> scrap<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.239> these

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
probably be a scrap of one of these

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.410 
probably be a scrap of one of these
light<00:03:10.260> load<00:03:10.500> towels<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:11.069> there<00:03:11.250> what<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> used

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
light load towels in there what I used

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.460 
light load towels in there what I used
before<00:03:13.880> was<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.060> set<00:03:15.299> up<00:03:15.420> here<00:03:15.900> which<00:03:16.260> was

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
before was this set up here which was

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.160 
before was this set up here which was
clunky<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:18.060> mean<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.299> stove<00:03:18.510> works<00:03:18.840> great

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
clunky and I mean the stove works great

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.569 
clunky and I mean the stove works great
those<00:03:19.380> little<00:03:19.620> alcohol<00:03:19.920> stoves<00:03:20.190> are<00:03:20.370> great

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
those little alcohol stoves are great

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.970 
those little alcohol stoves are great
but<00:03:20.820> um<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.200> too<00:03:22.380> heavy<00:03:22.560> as<00:03:22.950> a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
but um this is just too heavy as a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.670 
but um this is just too heavy as a
windscreen<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:24.000> also<00:03:24.150> big<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.989> didn't

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
windscreen and it's also big I didn't

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.099 
windscreen and it's also big I didn't
like<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.829> shape<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.549> my<00:03:26.700> pack<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.299> this

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
like the shape of it in my pack and this

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.560 
like the shape of it in my pack and this
was<00:03:28.320> my<00:03:28.500> cooking<00:03:29.070> vessel<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.209> one<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.480> those

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
was my cooking vessel it's one of those

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.699 
was my cooking vessel it's one of those
oversized<00:03:31.430> soup<00:03:32.430> cans<00:03:33.260> progresso<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> think

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
oversized soup cans progresso I think

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.729 
oversized soup cans progresso I think
maybe<00:03:34.859> but<00:03:35.760> um<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.989> didn't<00:03:37.230> work<00:03:37.320> out<00:03:37.470> well

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
maybe but um that didn't work out well

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.900 
maybe but um that didn't work out well
for<00:03:37.769> me<00:03:38.010> either<00:03:38.130> because<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.519> really<00:03:38.730> hard

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
for me either because it's really hard

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.960 
for me either because it's really hard
to<00:03:39.030> clean<00:03:39.359> these<00:03:40.049> grooves<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.220> alcohol<00:03:41.640> stove

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
to clean these grooves the alcohol stove

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.250 
to clean these grooves the alcohol stove
doesn't<00:03:42.900> have<00:03:44.750> doesn't<00:03:45.750> have<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> rheostat

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
doesn't have doesn't have a rheostat

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.009 
doesn't have doesn't have a rheostat
it's<00:03:46.709> either<00:03:46.859> on<00:03:46.920> or<00:03:47.040> off<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:48.510> cooking<00:03:48.870> my

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
it's either on or off so in cooking my

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.870 
it's either on or off so in cooking my
food<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.500> would<00:03:49.650> cut<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.040> crap<00:03:50.190> out<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.640> and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
food I would cut the crap out of it and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.120 
food I would cut the crap out of it and
it's<00:03:51.480> pretty<00:03:51.660> well<00:03:51.780> charred<00:03:52.230> down<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:52.950> there

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
it's pretty well charred down in there

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.000 
it's pretty well charred down in there
and<00:03:53.310> also<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.600> wasn't<00:03:54.930> filed<00:03:55.140> down<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.769> cut

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
and also this wasn't filed down so I cut
