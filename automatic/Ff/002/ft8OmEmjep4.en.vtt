00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.840
 it is something serious is the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.990
 third episode of the gta like series 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.849
 of thq that comes out this year end on 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.680
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.270
 so it's a pretty waited game already 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.640
 because we have not had a follow-up since 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.169
 three years and also because after 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880
 really from competitor to grand theft 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.899
 auto this year so for fans of the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.899
 kind it will be the game to watch 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.489
 their sims 3 at the cern one embodies a 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.350
 gang of gangsters the scenes what 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.640
 dominates the whole city and who are going to have 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.710
 to do all kinds of this type 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.120
 of enemy so as in all the gta 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.250
 like we end up with a gameplay 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.460
 action adventure in sight at the third 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.600
 really classic person 1 on this side 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.309
 there the game is pretty classic it's at 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.710
 to say that we have easy gameplay to 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.210
 take control we steal cars on 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.009
 harvesting weapons we buy 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.350
 properties and we walk in a 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.300
 big city filling several types 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.650
 mission in the order we want one 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.479
 mobile phone with which one can 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.340
 join allies who gives you all 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.590
 kinds of missions and we progress as 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.539
 this little by little in the game so this 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.640
 side there the game wants to be big enough 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.560
 fairly traditional audience and 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.810
 paradoxically there are many more 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.970
 aspects that sets it apart from others 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.190
 especially beside really what the fuck 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.990
 really big anything that 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.680
 overflows in every way that is it 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 makes it really enjoyable 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.790
 what really differentiates centro 3d 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.790
 competitors that's really the side 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.130
 anything really chosen and 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.830
 fully assumed by the developers 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.150
 that is, in the gta 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.350
 here we feel a little rogue a 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.240
 little bit rebellious because we can shoot 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.640
 on cops because we steal 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.560
 cars here it's really going really 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.470
 really much further the player 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.570
 is really pushed to fuck the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.860
 brothel in the city ie 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.140
 when we are going to fight gangs 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.300
 in the beginning we will use guns and 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.280
 pump guns very quickly it's going to get 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.320
 turn into a real civil war 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.110
 because we're going to put you in the hands 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.209
 a helicopter a fighter plane 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.500
 radio-controlled missiles of the strikes 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.880
 at the battle field 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.470
 so there is an aspect completely 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.480
 disproportionate like that we also find 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.060
 in vehicles we can drive 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.920
 tanks of hybrid prototype species 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 motorcycle planes flying in the city and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.590
 who shoots everything that moves so 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.330
 here it is very pleasant to play and it 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.209
 makes the game really entertaining because 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.680
 that we also find situations 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.040
 really varied the developers there too 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.850
 wanted to make a species of best-of 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.470
 everything in the games 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.180
 of action there will not be just races 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.540
 prosecution and fighting against 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.519
 gangs 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.590
 we will fight on March we will fight 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.730
 in a wrestling ring we will fight 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.680
 against an army of zombies 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.480
 so here finally yes it's really 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.700
 absolutely no realism and finally 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.550
 the whole side is a game in which he 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.630
 are a lot of sex a lot of violence 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.610
 many things that could 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.600
 shock and finally it's going so much 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.090
 far that it becomes very fast 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.560
 caricature it makes the game almost a 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.210
 little bit because everything is not at all 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.770
 realistically what makes you believe it 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.660
 more but finally it just becomes 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.260
 romping while this requiem 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.260
 scandalizing 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.220
 have opportunities 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.360
 amazing is good and yet in 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.250
 senso is still a few small 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.510
 black spots pretty blatant that's when 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.310
 we are not necessarily in delirium 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.670
 can see that the game already and not very 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.500
 beautiful it reams quite often 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.700
 the aliasing is felt we the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.470
 animations are hilarious but 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.410
 technically the 3d engine not really 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.430
 awesome and also the game is a 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.290
 little bit easy 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.050
 they last about ten hours and that's 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.550
 true when we have such possibilities 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.930
 finally faso face the enemies it's 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.310
 easy to make a call for 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.290
 call a bunch of pals there of his 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.120
 gang that brings you down squarely a time 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.230
 that a helicopter to bomb everything 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.300
 who moves and we quickly made the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.489
 household centro is a game that is 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.110
 wants general public who passes super well 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.880
 realized and that's still pretty 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.420
 easy it's better to know when 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.420
 even before diving 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.080
 centro the third it's a pretty game 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.420
 particular because even though I have some 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.500
 pretty obvious things to blame him and 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.480
 wishing all the young 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.590
 world once we are launched into 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.300
 throw in the game we can more 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.630
 stop simply because because 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.889
 that we have constant access to an arsenal of 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.830
 more and more crazy vehicles 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.290
 incredible we live situations 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.120
 really funny and that's it that's it 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.250
 really the strength of the game is 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.260
 a game that is missing perhaps 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.060
 finishing but at a positioning 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.650
 a mayor bias so 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.210
 delusional is so so 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.310
 shockingly funny I want to say 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.710
 that we finally go through a 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.910
 treats without really forcing it's not 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.460
 this is not the level of finish 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.260
 rockstar games but in the absence of 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.910
 I was real in this end of year 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.270
 it's really a good conscious choice of 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.270
 his creature
