further round we got a nice some my
steps<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.220> plastic

that<00:00:51.540> bit<00:00:51.750> wobbly<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.650> know<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:52.950> not

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that bit wobbly but you know you're not

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.000 
that bit wobbly but you know you're not
really<00:00:53.220> gonna<00:00:53.370> use<00:00:53.640> them<00:00:53.850> too<00:00:54.180> much

really gonna use them too much

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
really gonna use them too much
unfortunately<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:56.760> opinion<00:00:57.239> there<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.450> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
unfortunately in my opinion there are a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.400 
unfortunately in my opinion there are a
couple<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.870> downs<00:00:58.140> from<00:00:58.829> me<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.880> outside

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
couple of downs from me for the outside

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.860 
couple of downs from me for the outside
you've<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:02.160> massive<00:01:03.060> weight<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.660> which

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you've got the massive weight here which

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
you've got the massive weight here which
you<00:01:04.019> can't<00:01:04.350> take<00:01:04.589> off<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.729> you're<00:01:05.909> going

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you can't take off so if you're going

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.180 
you can't take off so if you're going
around<00:01:06.300> tight<00:01:06.690> buildings<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> you're

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
around tight buildings you know you're

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.070 
around tight buildings you know you're
pretty<00:01:08.400> much<00:01:08.580> sure<00:01:09.060> through<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.900> knock

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pretty much sure through it to knock

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.490 
pretty much sure through it to knock
some<00:01:10.320> wall<00:01:10.500> down<00:01:10.800> or<00:01:11.010> something<00:01:11.810> as<00:01:12.810> well<00:01:13.050> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
some wall down or something as well this

kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> links<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.450> turning

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
kind of links in with that the turning

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.300 
kind of links in with that the turning
circle<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.560> big<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.040> tractor

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
circle is pretty big on this tractor

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.700 
circle is pretty big on this tractor
which<00:01:18.120> means<00:01:18.360> you're<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.470> gonna<00:01:19.590> be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
which means you're really not gonna be

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.370 
which means you're really not gonna be
able<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.190> on<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> livestock<00:01:20.820> farm<00:01:21.380> going

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
able to use it on a livestock farm going

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
able to use it on a livestock farm going
around<00:01:22.560> tight<00:01:22.860> buildings<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.580> yard<00:01:23.880> or

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
around tight buildings in your yard or

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.620 
around tight buildings in your yard or
anything<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
anything like that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
anything like that
but<00:01:27.630> apart<00:01:27.840> from<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.020> me<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.740> model<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.130> my

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
but apart from that me the model in my

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.219 
but apart from that me the model in my
opinion<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.420> worth<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> money

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
opinion is really really worth the money

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.940 
opinion is really really worth the money
so<00:01:31.890> we'll<00:01:32.010> now<00:01:32.130> move<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.549> into<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.600> cab<00:01:34.200> well

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

you break it these actually kind of work
but<00:02:51.450> kind<00:02:51.689> of<00:02:51.780> doubt<00:02:52.019> these<00:02:52.260> mirrors<00:02:52.650> they

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.800 
but kind of doubt these mirrors they
they<00:02:53.730> definitely<00:02:53.939> give<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.269> impression<00:02:54.510> that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810

they<00:02:57.599> do<00:02:57.659> come<00:02:58.500> off<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.650> little<00:02:58.889> bit<00:02:59.129> thing<00:03:00.090> but

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
they do come off a little bit thing but

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.020 
they do come off a little bit thing but
you<00:03:00.389> not<00:03:01.019> be<00:03:01.230> able<00:03:01.409> to<00:03:01.469> really<00:03:01.889> use<00:03:01.949> them<00:03:02.310> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
you not be able to really use them to

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
I linked put them link it up with and

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.710 
I linked put them link it up with and
we've<00:03:16.469> got<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.829> master<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.609> trainer<00:03:18.000> here<00:03:18.389> so

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
we've got the master and trainer here so

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.530 
we've got the master and trainer here so
otters<00:03:19.229> look<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.889> up<00:03:19.949> the<00:03:20.069> one<00:03:20.389> poking<00:03:21.389> up

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
otters look it up the one poking up

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.089 
otters look it up the one poking up
could<00:03:21.900> not<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.829> much<00:03:23.009> simpler

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
could not really be much simpler

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.580 
could not really be much simpler
basically<00:03:26.659> lifts<00:03:27.659> up<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.930> down<00:03:28.079> like<00:03:28.259> that<00:03:28.290> so

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
basically lifts up and down like that so

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.879 
basically lifts up and down like that so
you<00:03:28.769> left<00:03:28.919> it<00:03:29.069> down<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.669> then<00:03:30.479> you<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:30.959> slot

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
you left it down and then you can slot

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.490 
you left it down and then you can slot
it<00:03:32.069> in<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.659> push<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:33.810> back<00:03:33.959> up<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.290> away

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it in like that push it back up and away

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.229 
it in like that push it back up and away
you<00:03:34.530> go

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.420 

so<00:03:39.239> really<00:03:39.689> I'm<00:03:39.930> gonna<00:03:40.109> say<00:03:40.409> that<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.919> is<00:03:41.159> an

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
so really I'm gonna say that this is an

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.569 
so really I'm gonna say that this is an
arable<00:03:42.060> farm<00:03:42.389> style<00:03:42.780> tractor<00:03:43.349> simply<00:03:44.310> because

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the turning circle however there are I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.009 
the turning circle however there are I
mean<00:03:47.400> if<00:03:47.669> you're<00:03:47.909> in<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.030> field<00:03:48.239> cultivating

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
you're probably gonna have to turn

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.420 
you're probably gonna have to turn
halfway<00:03:51.060> up<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.269> field<00:03:51.739> not<00:03:52.739> are<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:52.949> joking

but apart from that it's a great model
and<00:03:56.849> for<00:03:57.269> 15<00:03:57.599> pounds<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.169> absolutely

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
and for 15 pounds this is absolutely

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.849 
and for 15 pounds this is absolutely
insane<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.759> detail<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.389> very<00:04:00.599> very<00:04:01.259> very<00:04:01.560> good
