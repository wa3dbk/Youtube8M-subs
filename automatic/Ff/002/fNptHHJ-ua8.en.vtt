so<00:02:17.490> there's<00:02:17.760> one<00:02:17.970> at<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.239> back<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:19.050> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
so there's one at the back just for the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.270 
so there's one at the back just for the
just<00:02:19.800> for<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.069> level<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:21.739> here's<00:02:22.739> what<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.130> did

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
just for the level and here's what I did

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.720 
just for the level and here's what I did
I<00:02:23.640> made<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.910> scroll<00:02:24.510> switch<00:02:25.190> from<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.400> part

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
I made a scroll switch from the part

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.010 
I made a scroll switch from the part
instead<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.810> instead<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:29.069> one<00:02:29.310> part

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
instead of instead of this one part

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.720 
instead of instead of this one part
that's<00:02:31.020> which<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> gear<00:02:32.069> switch<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
that's which is a gear switch I

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.059 
that's which is a gear switch I
disconnected<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> gear<00:02:33.900> switch<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:34.920> I

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
disconnected the gear switch and then I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.270 
disconnected the gear switch and then I
put<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.550> flat<00:02:36.120> switch<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.660> there<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.920> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
put in the flat switch in there so I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.780 
put in the flat switch in there so I
don't<00:02:39.209> have<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.870> screw<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.440> I'm<00:02:40.830> gonna<00:02:41.160> I'm

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
don't have it screw it on I'm gonna I'm

00:02:41.790 --> 00:03:12.890 
don't have it screw it on I'm gonna I'm
going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.180> show<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:47.480> come<00:02:48.480> out<00:02:48.630> your<00:02:48.870> best

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.080 

so<00:03:14.040> about<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.190> antenna<00:03:15.550> first<00:03:16.200> does<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:18.090> does

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
so about the antenna first does a does

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.230 
so about the antenna first does a does
my<00:03:19.360> extend<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.200> thing<00:03:20.440> goes<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
my extend the thing goes to the to the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.460 
my extend the thing goes to the to the
antenna<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:23.020> is<00:03:23.410> because<00:03:24.239> first<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.540> all<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:26.170> I

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
antenna it is because first of all if I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.860 
antenna it is because first of all if I
want<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.860> put<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.220> patch<00:03:27.459> antenna<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.360> one

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
want to put the patch antenna on one

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.500 
want to put the patch antenna on one
it's<00:03:29.100> one<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.250> module<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.790> on<00:03:30.910> at<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.330> back

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it's one the module is on at the back

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.960 
it's one the module is on at the back
the<00:03:31.840> patch<00:03:32.020> antenna<00:03:32.410> doesn't<00:03:32.680> fit<00:03:33.100> because

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
the patch antenna doesn't fit because

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.690 
the patch antenna doesn't fit because
it's<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.650> because<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:35.890> thicker<00:03:36.190> than<00:03:36.370> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it's a because it's thicker than the

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.310 
it's a because it's thicker than the
normal<00:03:37.060> than<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.480> standard<00:03:37.930> whip<00:03:38.110> antenna

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
normal than the standard whip antenna

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.990 
normal than the standard whip antenna
and<00:03:39.600> even<00:03:40.600> even<00:03:41.200> if<00:03:41.350> even<00:03:41.680> if<00:03:42.100> you<00:03:42.250> would<00:03:42.580> fit

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
and even even if even if you would fit

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.150 
and even even if even if you would fit
it<00:03:43.239> would<00:03:43.510> be<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:44.110> would<00:03:44.380> be<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.590> bit<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.010> a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
it would be it would be a bit of a

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.870 
it would be it would be a bit of a
problem<00:03:45.519> for<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:46.030> patch<00:03:46.330> antenna<00:03:46.810> because<00:03:47.880> you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
problem for a patch antenna because you

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.940 
problem for a patch antenna because you
you<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:50.260> cannot

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
you just cannot

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.479 
you just cannot
you<00:03:51.070> just<00:03:51.340> cannot<00:03:51.580> bend<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.180> upwards<00:03:53.489> because

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
you just cannot bend it upwards because

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.370 
you just cannot bend it upwards because
of<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.730> handle<00:03:55.209> so<00:03:55.239> when<00:03:55.870> I'm<00:03:55.989> holding<00:03:56.170> the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
of a handle so when I'm holding the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.930 
of a handle so when I'm holding the
radio<00:03:56.800> ladies<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.370> antenna<00:03:57.640> will<00:03:57.820> be

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
radio ladies the antenna will be

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.229 
radio ladies the antenna will be
pointing<00:03:58.450> down<00:03:59.250> instead<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.459> instead<00:04:01.090> of

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
pointing down instead of instead of

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.420 
pointing down instead of instead of
pointing<00:04:01.720> instead<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.410> pointing<00:04:02.829> up<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:03.070> there

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
pointing instead of pointing up so there

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.080 
pointing instead of pointing up so there
was<00:04:03.610> one<00:04:03.790> reason<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:05.680> put<00:04:05.890> antenna<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.910> put

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
was one reason to to put antenna to put

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.880 
was one reason to to put antenna to put
antenna<00:04:07.420> somewhere<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.049> France<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.560> set<00:04:08.769> up

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
antenna somewhere to France and set up

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.060 
antenna somewhere to France and set up
another<00:04:09.160> on<00:04:09.730> them<00:04:10.060> on<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.720> handle<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.350> just<00:04:11.769> I

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
another on them on the handle I just I

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.819 
another on them on the handle I just I
just<00:04:12.700> put<00:04:13.329> instead<00:04:13.630> of<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.840> pot<00:04:14.049> now<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.860> parts

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
just put instead of a pot now the parts

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.520 
just put instead of a pot now the parts
there's<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.950> extended<00:04:18.880> leads<00:04:19.180> for<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.140> scroll

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
there's a extended leads for the scroll

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.360 
there's a extended leads for the scroll
part<00:04:21.600> connected<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.870> servo<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.950> servo

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
part connected to the servo to the servo

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.219 
part connected to the servo to the servo
connector<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:25.240> make<00:04:25.419> sure<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.630> can<00:04:25.870> take<00:04:26.050> out

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
connector to make sure I can take out

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.159 
connector to make sure I can take out
the<00:04:26.410> back<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.820> there's<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.450> there's<00:04:28.479> a

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
the back and there's a and there's a

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.030 
the back and there's a and there's a
lead<00:04:29.440> also<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.880> jxt<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:32.169> think<00:04:32.560> whatever<00:04:32.890> you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
lead also to jxt I think whatever you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.670 
lead also to jxt I think whatever you
call<00:04:33.220> them<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.720> connector<00:04:34.720> from<00:04:35.050> from<00:04:35.560> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
call them the connector from from the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.909 
call them the connector from from the
gear<00:04:35.919> switch<00:04:38.010> right<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.520> took<00:04:39.580> out<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
gear switch right so I took out the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.340 
gear switch right so I took out the
Roland<00:04:41.919> does<00:04:42.100> does<00:04:43.090> my<00:04:43.300> switch<00:04:43.539> just<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.990> normal

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
Roland does does my switch just a normal

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.500 
Roland does does my switch just a normal
normal<00:04:44.620> flat<00:04:45.070> switch<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.640> took<00:04:45.789> out<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.270> took

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
normal flat switch so I took out I took

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.400 
normal flat switch so I took out I took
out<00:04:46.630> my<00:04:46.660> part<00:04:47.200> I<00:04:47.940> disassembly<00:04:48.940> there's<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:49.660> it's

out my part I disassembly there's a it's

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.200 
out my part I disassembly there's a it's
