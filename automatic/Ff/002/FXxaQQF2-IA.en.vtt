more<00:00:20.640> TD<00:00:21.150> no<00:00:21.660> way<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:21.990> they<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.350> more

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
teeny we have more powerful TD and then

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.640 
teeny we have more powerful TD and then
the<00:00:25.439> same<00:00:25.710> cross<00:00:26.160> branches<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.439> same

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the same cross branches we have the same

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.110 
the same cross branches we have the same
amount<00:00:28.859> RT<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.730> barely<00:00:30.390> even<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:31.399> guess<00:00:32.399> plot

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
amount RT it's barely even I guess plot

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.020 
amount RT it's barely even I guess plot
it's<00:00:35.899> on<00:00:36.899> top<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.530> himmelsdorf<00:00:38.030> the

Maryland<00:00:43.020> women<00:00:44.870> like<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.170> got<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
Maryland women like if they got a I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.520 
Maryland women like if they got a I
think<00:00:47.789> um<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.719> i<00:00:48.809> remember<00:00:48.989> correctly<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
think um if i remember correctly this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.819 
think um if i remember correctly this
when<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.219> were<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.149> arm

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.440 

frenched<00:00:54.829> guns<00:00:55.399> most<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:55.940> French<00:00:56.180> tanks

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
frenched guns most of the French tanks

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.869 
frenched guns most of the French tanks
have<00:00:56.719> very<00:00:57.320> high<00:00:57.410> elevation<00:00:58.370> angles<00:00:58.730> which

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
have very high elevation angles which

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.760 
have very high elevation angles which
basically<00:00:59.149> means<00:00:59.390> their<00:00:59.870> bullets<00:01:00.230> travel

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
basically means their bullets travel

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.600 
basically means their bullets travel
very<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.730> very<00:01:01.760> high<00:01:02.239> arc<00:01:02.600> which<00:01:02.840> means<00:01:03.050> they

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
very in a very high arc which means they

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.980 
very in a very high arc which means they
maybe<00:01:04.610> would<00:01:04.940> be<00:01:05.180> able<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.479> shoot<00:01:05.600> over<00:01:05.750> these

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
maybe would be able to shoot over these

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.010 
maybe would be able to shoot over these
buildings<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:06.590> little<00:01:07.220> difficulty<00:01:07.610> um<00:01:08.020> they

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
buildings with little difficulty um they

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.960 
buildings with little difficulty um they
don't<00:01:09.290> have<00:01:09.470> much<00:01:09.650> range<00:01:09.979> though<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:10.759> that's

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
don't have much range though so that's

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.240 
don't have much range though so that's
going<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.210> be<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.330> good<00:01:11.540> offset<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:13.070> funny

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
going to be a good offset the funny

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.280 
going to be a good offset the funny
thing<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.460> most<00:01:13.729> of<00:01:13.880> these<00:01:13.970> gun<00:01:14.450> most<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.229> our

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
thing is most of these gun most of our

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.990 
thing is most of these gun most of our
artillery<00:01:15.560> pieces<00:01:15.920> in<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.280> game<00:01:16.700> actually

got<00:06:23.340> one<00:06:23.669> person<00:06:23.910> left<00:06:24.270> one<00:06:25.110> on<00:06:25.260> one<00:06:25.530> come<00:06:25.860> on

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.580 

you<00:06:29.669> must<00:06:29.850> have<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.120> 90<00:06:30.539> better<00:06:31.169> he's<00:06:31.320> a<00:06:31.350> good

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
you must have the 90 better he's a good

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.340 
you must have the 90 better he's a good
shot<00:06:31.800> I<00:06:32.180> think<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.300> Glacial<00:06:33.630> plates<00:06:33.930> are<00:06:34.289> a

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
shot I think the Glacial plates are a

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.060 
shot I think the Glacial plates are a
lot<00:06:34.710> weaker<00:06:35.250> on<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:36.680> 152<00:06:37.680> than<00:06:37.889> there<00:06:38.039> are

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
lot weaker on the 152 than there are

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.580 
lot weaker on the 152 than there are
most<00:06:38.490> other<00:06:38.669> tanks<00:06:39.180> but<00:06:39.419> I<00:06:39.720> need<00:06:40.169> something<00:06:40.380> to

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
most other tanks but I need something to

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.340 
most other tanks but I need something to
confirm<00:06:40.949> that<00:06:41.210> and<00:06:42.210> I'd<00:06:42.930> have<00:06:43.080> to<00:06:43.229> actually

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
confirm that and I'd have to actually

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.810 
confirm that and I'd have to actually
know<00:06:43.620> where<00:06:43.740> it<00:06:43.860> kind<00:06:44.310> of<00:06:44.430> looked<00:06:44.580> like<00:06:44.639> you

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
know where it kind of looked like you

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.540 
know where it kind of looked like you
went<00:06:45.000> to<00:06:45.120> hit<00:06:45.389> the<00:06:45.539> Glacial<00:06:45.960> plate<00:06:46.169> I<00:06:46.550> don't

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
went to hit the Glacial plate I don't

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.200 
went to hit the Glacial plate I don't
really<00:06:47.940> know

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
really know

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.420 
really know
at<00:06:49.750> this<00:06:49.990> point<00:06:50.289> in<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.620> game<00:06:50.650> when<00:06:51.160> it's<00:06:51.280> one

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
at this point in the game when it's one

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.710 
at this point in the game when it's one
on<00:06:51.460> one<00:06:51.610> like<00:06:51.970> this<00:06:52.120> I<00:06:52.270> think<00:06:52.449> they<00:06:52.539> should

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
on one like this I think they should

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.180 
on one like this I think they should
surrender<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.410> spotting<00:06:53.740> system<00:06:54.009> and

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
surrender the spotting system and

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.439 
surrender the spotting system and
everyone<00:06:54.460> can<00:06:54.580> see<00:06:54.729> everything<00:06:55.090> one<00:06:57.270> okay<00:06:58.270> he

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
everyone can see everything one okay he

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:07.920 
everyone can see everything one okay he
hit<00:06:58.569> something<00:07:05.400> soon<00:07:06.400> maybe<00:07:07.030> hopefully<00:07:07.360> I

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
hit something soon maybe hopefully I

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.170 
hit something soon maybe hopefully I
think<00:07:08.800> he's<00:07:08.889> got<00:07:09.039> the<00:07:09.160> 90<00:07:09.430> millimeter<00:07:09.819> person

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
think he's got the 90 millimeter person

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.700 
think he's got the 90 millimeter person
shooting<00:07:10.509> yeah<00:07:11.139> he's<00:07:11.289> shooting<00:07:11.530> at<00:07:11.620> the

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
shooting yeah he's shooting at the

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:18.390 
shooting yeah he's shooting at the
Glacial<00:07:12.069> plate<00:07:15.300> ran<00:07:16.300> him<00:07:17.009> if<00:07:18.009> you<00:07:18.099> get<00:07:18.250> close

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
Glacial plate ran him if you get close

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:26.370 
Glacial plate ran him if you get close
enough<00:07:18.699> aiming<00:07:19.210> de<00:07:19.360> isn't<00:07:19.660> a<00:07:19.720> factor

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.020
