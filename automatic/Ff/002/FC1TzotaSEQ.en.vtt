to change or Ilana BMW e39 which is a 5

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.820 
to change or Ilana BMW e39 which is a 5
Series<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.019> case<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.590> 99<00:00:11.540> 528i<00:00:12.830> with

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
Series in this case it's a 99 528i with

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.550 
Series in this case it's a 99 528i with
a<00:00:13.860> inline<00:00:16.130> 6-cylinder<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:19.080> is

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
a inline 6-cylinder and this one is

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
a inline 6-cylinder and this one is
similar<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.400> other<00:00:20.430> models<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.240> 97<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
similar to the other models from 97 to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.730 
similar to the other models from 97 to
2003<00:00:22.619> all<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.640> them<00:00:23.760> are<00:00:23.910> saying<00:00:24.150> 525<00:00:25.310> 530<00:00:26.310> 528

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
2003 all of them are saying 525 530 528

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.900 
2003 all of them are saying 525 530 528
540<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.130> probably<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:30.000> different<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
540 is up probably a bit different so I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.520 
540 is up probably a bit different so I
did<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.950> video<00:00:34.950> earlier<00:00:35.160> about<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.600> e46<00:00:37.170> oil

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
did a video earlier about the e46 oil

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.950 
did a video earlier about the e46 oil
change<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.920> almost<00:00:38.640> exactly<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> same<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
change it's almost exactly the same you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560 
change it's almost exactly the same you
can<00:00:40.140> say<00:00:40.730> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
can say so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.060 
can say so
you're<00:00:43.530> probably<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> need<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:46.070> first

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
job which I lost it in the oil pan the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.550 
job which I lost it in the oil pan the
it<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.329> right<00:03:07.600> there<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:07.959> can<00:03:08.139> see<00:03:08.350> how

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
it it is right there you can see how

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.870 
it it is right there you can see how
it's<00:03:08.769> draining<00:03:09.340> from<00:03:09.519> there<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:11.489> if<00:03:12.489> you're<00:03:12.700> at

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
it's draining from there so if you're at

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.670 
it's draining from there so if you're at
the<00:03:13.000> front<00:03:13.299> of<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.859> front<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.069> car<00:03:15.310> go<00:03:16.120> down

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
the front of it front of the car go down

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.490 
the front of it front of the car go down
underneath<00:03:19.810> right<00:03:20.810> after<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.610> plastic

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
underneath right after that plastic

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.740 
underneath right after that plastic
cover<00:03:27.730> there<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:28.760> only<00:03:29.030> one<00:03:29.330> open<00:03:29.690> section

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
cover there is only one open section

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.720 
cover there is only one open section
where<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:35.210> can<00:03:35.360> see<00:03:35.600> right<00:03:35.840> there

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
where that you can see right there

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.380 
where that you can see right there
seventeen<00:03:37.730> millimeter<00:03:39.610> take<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.730> off<00:03:40.880> put<00:03:41.330> a

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
seventeen millimeter take it off put a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.860 
seventeen millimeter take it off put a
drain<00:03:41.600> pan<00:03:41.870> let<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.380> oil<00:03:42.530> drain<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:43.870> then

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
drain pan let the oil drain and then

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.770 
drain pan let the oil drain and then
when<00:03:45.080> it's<00:03:45.230> done<00:03:45.350> almost<00:03:45.920> done<00:03:46.510> then<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.630> can

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
when it's done almost done then you can

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.570 
when it's done almost done then you can
go<00:03:47.960> ahead<00:03:48.050> remove<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.740> filter<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:49.370> well

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
go ahead remove this filter as well

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.560 
go ahead remove this filter as well
because<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.730> need<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.030> change<00:03:53.210> it<00:03:53.420> anyway<00:03:54.190> so

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
because you need to change it anyway so

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.010 
because you need to change it anyway so
I'm<00:03:56.570> going<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.840> take<00:03:57.050> it<00:03:57.200> off<00:03:58.720> should<00:03:59.720> be

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
I'm going to take it off should be

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.040 
I'm going to take it off should be
simple

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:14.920 

okay<00:04:08.290> sorry<00:04:09.290> goodbye<00:04:09.740> one<00:04:10.160> hand

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.800 

take<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.709> rest<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.280> pressure<00:04:16.549> off<00:04:19.810> still

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
take the rest of the pressure off still

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:29.090 
take the rest of the pressure off still
a<00:04:20.840> lot<00:04:21.139> of<00:04:21.169> oil<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.919> drain<00:04:22.160> up

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.180 

I'm<00:04:29.790> gonna<00:04:29.910> let<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.300> sit<00:04:30.480> there<00:04:30.660> for<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.930> bit

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.700 

put<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:39.430> basically<00:04:39.610> this<00:04:40.500> engine<00:04:41.500> takes

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
put it so basically this engine takes

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.620 
put it so basically this engine takes
six<00:04:42.010> point<00:04:42.220> nine<00:04:42.310> fourths<00:04:42.730> of<00:04:42.910> oil<00:04:45.630> BMW

for brand-new cars this car has almost
150,000<00:04:57.760> miles<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.710> have<00:05:00.430> been<00:05:00.610> using<00:05:00.850> on<00:05:01.090> my

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
150,000 miles so I have been using on my

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.300 
150,000 miles so I have been using on my
e46<00:05:02.670> 5w30<00:05:03.670> I<00:05:04.150> know<00:05:04.990> it's<00:05:05.350> not<00:05:05.500> recommended<00:05:06.100> but

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
e46 5w30 I know it's not recommended but

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.570 
e46 5w30 I know it's not recommended but
this<00:05:07.300> one's<00:05:07.540> mileage<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.260> have<00:05:08.890> been<00:05:09.100> using<00:05:09.280> it

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
this one's mileage I have been using it

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.510 
this one's mileage I have been using it
I<00:05:09.730> don't<00:05:10.180> I'm<00:05:11.080> not<00:05:11.440> saying<00:05:11.740> that<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.310> should

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
I don't I'm not saying that you should

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.470 
I don't I'm not saying that you should
use<00:05:12.760> it<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:13.990> use<00:05:14.500> 5w30<00:05:15.250> when<00:05:15.820> it's<00:05:16.030> cold

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
use it but I use 5w30 when it's cold

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.830 
use it but I use 5w30 when it's cold
10w30<00:05:17.200> when<00:05:17.650> it's<00:05:17.830> really<00:05:18.400> warm<00:05:18.780> right<00:05:19.780> now

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
10w30 when it's really warm right now

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.230 
10w30 when it's really warm right now
it's<00:05:20.140> kind<00:05:20.350> of<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.500> winter<00:05:20.980> wintry<00:05:21.640> situation

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
it's kind of a winter wintry situation

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.170 
it's kind of a winter wintry situation
so<00:05:22.860> I'm<00:05:23.860> using<00:05:24.250> 5w30

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
so I'm using 5w30

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.800 
so I'm using 5w30
and<00:05:25.530> I'm<00:05:26.530> using<00:05:27.990> mobile<00:05:28.990> one<00:05:30.540> full<00:05:31.540> synthetic

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
and I'm using mobile one full synthetic

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.960 
and I'm using mobile one full synthetic
right<00:05:32.290> here<00:05:35.910> extended<00:05:36.910> performance<00:05:37.830> so

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
right here extended performance so

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:50.709 
right here extended performance so
that's<00:05:39.970> what<00:05:40.180> I<00:05:40.210> am

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.920 

the<00:05:50.990> filter<00:05:51.409> is<00:05:51.529> a<00:05:51.559> bit<00:05:51.800> trickier<00:05:52.279> too<00:05:52.930> because

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
the filter is a bit trickier too because

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.059 
the filter is a bit trickier too because
you<00:05:54.229> have<00:05:54.259> to<00:05:54.589> pull<00:05:54.800> it<00:05:54.919> out<00:05:55.009> from<00:05:57.069> this

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
you have to pull it out from this

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.939 
you have to pull it out from this
chamber<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:59.539> new<00:05:59.719> filter<00:06:00.229> comes<00:06:00.649> with

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
chamber and the new filter comes with

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.670 
chamber and the new filter comes with
the<00:06:01.219> washer<00:06:02.180> right<00:06:02.360> here<00:06:02.749> there's<00:06:03.409> a<00:06:03.499> rubber

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
the washer right here there's a rubber

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.459 
the washer right here there's a rubber
washer<00:06:03.949> you<00:06:04.490> can<00:06:04.520> see<00:06:04.909> new<00:06:05.659> filter<00:06:06.050> comes<00:06:06.259> with

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
washer you can see new filter comes with

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.469 
washer you can see new filter comes with
that<00:06:06.649> so<00:06:07.009> make<00:06:07.339> sure<00:06:07.369> you<00:06:07.729> take<00:06:07.909> the<00:06:08.059> old<00:06:08.240> one

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
that so make sure you take the old one

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.510 
that so make sure you take the old one
out<00:06:08.509> put<00:06:08.869> the<00:06:08.990> new<00:06:09.020> one<00:06:09.319> in<00:06:09.349> oil<00:06:09.619> it<00:06:10.279> up<00:06:10.399> a<00:06:10.430> bit

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
out put the new one in oil it up a bit

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.239 
out put the new one in oil it up a bit
so<00:06:11.240> that<00:06:11.270> it<00:06:11.569> doesn't<00:06:11.930> you<00:06:12.619> know<00:06:12.740> break<00:06:13.039> or

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:13.249 
so that it doesn't you know break or

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:15.730 
so that it doesn't you know break or
something<00:06:13.610> and<00:06:13.789> then<00:06:14.569> this<00:06:14.930> filter<00:06:15.439> comes

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
something and then this filter comes

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.790 
something and then this filter comes
pops<00:06:16.219> out<00:06:16.550> and<00:06:16.819> then<00:06:17.659> you<00:06:17.809> have<00:06:18.050> to<00:06:18.259> pop<00:06:18.529> the

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
pops out and then you have to pop the

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.950 
pops out and then you have to pop the
one<00:06:18.979> back<00:06:19.249> in<00:06:19.460> you're<00:06:19.669> gonna<00:06:19.849> hear<00:06:22.419> pop<00:06:23.419> sound

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
one back in you're gonna hear pop sound
