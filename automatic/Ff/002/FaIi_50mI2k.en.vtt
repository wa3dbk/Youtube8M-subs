00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.050 
all right so this is where your changes
a<00:04:23.960> bit<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:25.010> I'll<00:04:25.490> play<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:25.790> from<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.970> beginning

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
a bit so I'll play it from the beginning

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.640 
a bit so I'll play it from the beginning
again<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.810> then<00:04:26.990> I'll<00:04:27.110> tell<00:04:27.260> you<00:04:27.410> how<00:04:27.530> it

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
again and then I'll tell you how it

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:44.570 
again and then I'll tell you how it
changes<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.070> bit<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:28.730> here<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.390> is

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:05:00.170 

so<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.700> can<00:04:45.790> play<00:04:47.670> an<00:04:48.670> F<00:04:49.000> sharp<00:04:49.030> then<00:04:49.990> fit<00:04:50.410> so

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.760 

so<00:05:01.180> that's<00:05:01.330> a<00:05:01.390> bit<00:05:01.540> complicated<00:05:02.110> but

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
so that's a bit complicated but

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.740 
so that's a bit complicated but
basically<00:05:03.010> it's<00:05:03.850> going<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.030> be<00:05:06.630> F<00:05:07.630> sharp<00:05:07.680> hey

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
basically it's going to be F sharp hey

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.990 
basically it's going to be F sharp hey
hey<00:05:10.750> that's<00:05:11.080> our<00:05:11.320> thing<00:05:11.740> t<00:05:11.950> sharp<00:05:12.280> then

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
t-shirt back down to F sharp then back

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.010 
t-shirt back down to F sharp then back
up<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.420> G<00:05:16.570> sharp<00:05:16.800> then<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:19.300> Nano<00:05:19.540> G<00:05:19.780> sharp

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
up to G sharp then a the Nano G sharp

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.120 
up to G sharp then a the Nano G sharp
then<00:05:20.860> F<00:05:21.130> sharp<00:05:21.690> then<00:05:22.920> back<00:05:23.920> up<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.190> G<00:05:24.370> sharp<00:05:24.640> a

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
then F sharp then back up the G sharp a

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:33.870 
then F sharp then back up the G sharp a
C<00:05:27.130> sharp<00:05:27.700> F<00:05:28.330> sharp<00:05:29.080> then<00:05:29.920> P<00:05:30.540> F<00:05:32.520> here<00:05:33.520> I'll<00:05:33.700> play

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
C sharp F sharp then P F here I'll play

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.330 
C sharp F sharp then P F here I'll play
that<00:05:34.180> really<00:05:34.690> really<00:05:35.140> slow<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.920> you<00:05:35.950> can<00:05:36.070> get

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
that really really slow so you can get

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.040 
that really really slow so you can get
that<00:05:36.550> cuz<00:05:36.790> even<00:05:37.210> for<00:05:37.450> me<00:05:37.540> that's<00:05:37.690> so<00:05:37.840> kind<00:05:37.960> of

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
that cuz even for me that's so kind of

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:48.980 
that cuz even for me that's so kind of
difficult<00:05:38.440> so<00:05:39.280> basically<00:05:39.730> it's

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.239 

so<00:05:49.990> for<00:05:50.139> this<00:05:50.199> one<00:05:50.379> you<00:05:50.409> have<00:05:50.559> to<00:05:50.649> use<00:05:50.830> your<00:05:51.009> ear

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:51.249 
so for this one you have to use your ear

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:53.129 
so for this one you have to use your ear
of<00:05:51.459> a<00:05:51.580> tortoise<00:05:51.969> watch<00:05:52.240> my<00:05:52.449> fingers<00:05:52.869> a<00:05:52.899> lot
