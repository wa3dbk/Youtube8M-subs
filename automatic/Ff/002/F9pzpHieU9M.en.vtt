so this is our they won the fights of
the<00:00:05.279> fifth<00:00:05.609> version<00:00:05.910> and

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.379 

what<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:09.810> have<00:00:10.730> introduced<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.120> version

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
what we have introduced in this version

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.110 
what we have introduced in this version
is<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.469> optimized<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> application<00:00:14.790> for

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
is we have optimized the application for

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.560 
is we have optimized the application for
iphone<00:00:15.990> 4<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.560> iphone<00:00:16.920> 4<00:00:17.190> has<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:18.060> better<00:00:18.240> cpu

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
iphone 4 so iphone 4 has the better cpu

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.950 
iphone 4 so iphone 4 has the better cpu
has<00:00:20.840> resolution<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:23.690> in<00:00:24.690> a<00:00:24.810> better<00:00:25.020> gps

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
has resolution and in a better gps

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.690 
has resolution and in a better gps
location<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.290> with<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.650> application<00:00:28.920> what

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
location so with this application what

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.089 
location so with this application what
it<00:00:29.850> is<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.120> we<00:00:30.240> actually<00:00:30.270> enhance<00:00:31.099> enhance

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
it is that we actually enhance enhance

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
it is that we actually enhance enhance
the<00:00:32.640> performance<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.329> our<00:00:33.480> application<00:00:34.140> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the performance of our application so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.040 
the performance of our application so
it's<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.620> responsive<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:36.149> quicker<00:00:36.690> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's more responsive it's quicker this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.569 
it's more responsive it's quicker this
starts<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:37.980> quicker<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.720> menus<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.290> more

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
responsive also the graphics in that

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.810 
responsive also the graphics in that
the<00:00:44.739> sharper<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.570> press

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
the sharper and press

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.400 
the sharper and press
the<00:00:49.820> second<00:00:50.390> thing<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:50.750> we<00:00:51.200> also

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
the second thing is that we also

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.910 
the second thing is that we also
introduced<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.489> new<00:00:52.700> way<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:53.739> enter<00:00:54.739> an<00:00:54.829> address
