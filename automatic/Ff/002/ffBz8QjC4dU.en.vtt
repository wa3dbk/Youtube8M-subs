00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.450
 Come to places you've only dreamed of 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.360
 Once around the world, far away from Germany Far away from Europe, far away from your sofa 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.369
 far away from everything, let us go 'into the wide world because no one stops us 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.210
 Hit us through, if need be, even with small money 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.439
 Always looking ahead, go take my hand come on 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.780
 from Rio to Beijing to Dehli to Bankok yo we start through, Istambul to Montreal 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.809
 to those places where we still do not warn today 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 From Honkong to Dubai it can only be good, you know we are 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.449
 easy to fly Australia, New Zealand 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.839
 The distance is not an enemy Even if it is quite nice here 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.800
 we need dis times 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.720

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.359
 Travel around the world, sometimes around the world, 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.279

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.649
 New places, new people, certainly new friends 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.170
 Every day a new adventure that accompanies us today 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.869
 Whether it is cold or warm, we always stay there 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.090
 whether it is raining or snowing, ey life is so nice 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.490
 Far away, wake up flying, and wake up the dream, no 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.430
 if or else, we live for the moment 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.540
 Because today our home is here
