00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello everyone, I left you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.890
 and before starting the review let's 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.599
 say thank you for 700 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.120
 subscribers yes thank you 701 is needed and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.570
 by the way today we are without music because 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.289
 but I wanted to without music and so 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 our review on the girl herself to know 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.340
 homemade is not very well because how would 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.960
 I am pure as a cult such mediocre 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 I wanted to make a base 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.070
 Consider the minifigures and the first here. 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.620
 this plumber you are such a cunning dude 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:55.020
 a blond man with a scar here and with a drill he must 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.859
 all repair and this is a plumber in 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.789
 we go further we are those who are pretty 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 far shoots it we have a jock crow with 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.840
 not a lithuanian gun immediately say here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 behind the blue arrows basically jock I know 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.229
 the fact that some not so much further 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.100
 taste further here it is too 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.610
 gunshot he has a shotgun protection well 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.040
 in principle have such a refusal to and he in 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 glasses here 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.180
 but also focusing here so here they are 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.530
 look in troy 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.530
 so on we have firepower again 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:52.610
 Here is such a boy and rushes to heavy 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:56.670
 infantry such a tone pasha gun and a fairy tale 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.939
 such a kid docked and by the way instead 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.939
 put heads like this 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.539
 the same applies to heavy infantry to 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.220
 firearm it in such a robot dash 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.070
 officer why is he not 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.930
 why heavy infantry because it 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.870
 lived experience impenetrable how would 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.360
 Craze here for those who did not know where 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.360
 I attach him a hat so that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.540
 cut opponents let's also 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.540
 we still need our 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.070
 trucker trucker yes damn and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.780
 by the way plumbing save here 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.980
 all focused on the so purely in 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.989
 us heavy infantry 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.840
 we have such a bearded little man 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 fairy tale and here pumpkin too and also there 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.290
 hammer here you can them well so 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:03:01.180
 wield as it was in the frame like this 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:05.330
 But beyond it so bad to where 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.049
 next we have this page dude from 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.010
 the hobbit head and the word is lurking skeletons 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.290
 such armor 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.440
 and bare hands he also has a spear 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.580
 forget to say heavy infantry has either 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:28.130
 how would either such cold already or 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:34.460
 all sorts of advice everything is such 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:37.190
 the tone of ourselves set and see this one 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.280
 already more pumped though no armor he 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.830
 all the same to heavy infantry 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.170
 because he had firstly 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.930
 helmet and secondly he has to call on 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:54.670
 one help fez broke from one 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:59.020
 he has a walkie talkie here with the help of which 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.020
 cause help from rolled 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:14.030
 put the majority so one second 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:20.470
 here are two well worth it and focus 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:23.120
 Here I suck us a general of heavy infantry 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.610
 actually a nostalgic detail 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.480
 even though he knows how to close yours 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:34.940
 the most that thing like this one 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.310
 Nostalgic details. Very manual. 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.120
 rare here he goes suits 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.640
 a very big spear and a vintage team 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.390
 what is the dissatisfied face of men 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:51.350
 silly let's say so try 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.419
 put it fine somehow that's all 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.460
 In the frame I have put together the principle of this 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.080
 all plumber combat heavy infantry 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.320
 Heavy Infantry heavy infantry heavy 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.660
 the transition is heavy infantry and long-range shooting 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.060
 cheeks heavy infantry or real 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.220
 legally shoot plumbing cheeks already 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.590
 We were talking about such things. 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.290
 so generally as far as you know i don't 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.110
 I love so much less war just 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.650
 I wanted to review this 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.150
 homemade and create i don't know why 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:33.220
 or degrees some kind of game there 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.949
 Well, here we go to the very 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.430
 main part 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:42.669
 we have this tower 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.889
 important which is also a sword here 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.940
 we can supply let's say yes and we are three 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.789
 box, in principle, I, and not particularly so 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.100
 They say that I do homemade 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:57.280
 superskaya covered me fine so 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:01.120
 ok and big move you want to make 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:06.639
 gobble it up so here we can assume 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:13.780
 Now put it on the guard that's well 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:17.830
 let's here and so do here where 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:24.820
 a plumber and they Brigade 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:28.419
 this here such here also such here 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.660
 and such 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:34.539
 they have not fixed as if they 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.060
 just stand for an hour I did it like this 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:41.800
 very comfortable new case with it 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:46.000
 I can show you a lot that we 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.470
 do and like that here and here and we plant 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.840
 for these barricades 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.360
 as a matter of fact, marines certainly not 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:59.979
 very good we can land 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:07:04.090
 Well, from the heavy in general, unlike the bonds 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:06.639
 when will be in general with the machine gun also 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.419
 This can for this barricade he plant 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.520
 here it flaunts and it's just here 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:17.380
 is that he is as bulletproof as 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:20.860
 the tank turns out let's focus samurai here 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:25.110
 so my homemade turned out so 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.110
 here we will tell mini army at once so 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.330
 but what do I want to say 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:35.000
 subscribe to my channel link in 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.580
 description of my live-channel sense yes 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.490
 reference in the description well on the famous 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.789
 like subscribe like 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:47.569
 put it there I know yesterday did not miss 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:51.889
 review on cuma these models from creators 

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:54.800
 but somehow they will promise here but 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:57.190
 whether everything was lined up 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.190
 see you soon
