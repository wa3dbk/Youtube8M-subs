at short ranges the mp7 s magazine size

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.670 
at short ranges the mp7 s magazine size
is<00:01:16.350> 40<00:01:16.770> without<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.250> extended<00:01:17.790> clip<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.680> 54

with<00:01:19.950> extended<00:01:20.520> clip<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.560> would<00:01:22.560> say<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
with extended clip on I would say that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.530 
with extended clip on I would say that
the<00:01:23.009> magazine<00:01:23.460> size<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> pretty<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the magazine size is pretty good for a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
the magazine size is pretty good for a
submachine<00:01:25.140> gun<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.860> between<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
submachine gun because it is between the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.240 
submachine gun because it is between the
magazine<00:01:26.880> size<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.869> pdw-57<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.700> MSMC

magazine size of the pdw-57 and the MSMC

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.920 
magazine size of the pdw-57 and the MSMC
next<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> reload<00:01:32.700> time<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> mp7<00:01:33.570> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
next the reload time on the mp7 is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.780 
next the reload time on the mp7 is
pretty<00:01:34.320> fast<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.860> many<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> submachine

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
pretty fast for many of the submachine

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.289 
pretty fast for many of the submachine
guns<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.119> black<00:01:36.329> ops<00:01:36.570> 2<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.530> reload<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:37.920> is

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
guns in black ops 2 the reload time is

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.020 
guns in black ops 2 the reload time is
1.72<00:01:39.299> seconds<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> loaded<00:01:40.380> clip<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
1.72 seconds with the loaded clip and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.200 
1.72 seconds with the loaded clip and
2.4<00:01:42.030> seconds<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.600> an<00:01:42.750> empty<00:01:43.140> magazine<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
2.4 seconds with an empty magazine and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.139 
2.4 seconds with an empty magazine and
finally<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> mp7<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:45.960> rate<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> fire<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.740> about

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
finally the mp7 is rate of fire is about

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.749 
finally the mp7 is rate of fire is about
937<00:01:48.149> rounds<00:01:48.659> per<00:01:48.810> minute<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.200> 14<00:01:50.159> 20<00:01:50.490> hours

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
937 rounds per minute and 14 20 hours

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.380 
937 rounds per minute and 14 20 hours
per<00:01:50.909> minute<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.509> rapid<00:01:51.930> fire<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.970> now<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> will

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
per minute with rapid fire on now I will

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.069 
per minute with rapid fire on now I will
show<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> guys<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> recoil<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> mp7<00:01:57.079> from

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
show you guys the recoil of the mp7 from

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
show you guys the recoil of the mp7 from
this<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> mp7<00:01:59.340> has<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> lot

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this we can see that the mp7 has a lot

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600 
this we can see that the mp7 has a lot
of<00:02:00.180> vertical<00:02:00.689> recoil<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.439> close<00:02:02.070> range<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
of vertical recoil at close range of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.609 
of vertical recoil at close range of
spread<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.000> minimal<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.689> at<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> distance<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
spread is minimal but at a distance the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.920 
spread is minimal but at a distance the
bullets<00:02:04.920> shoot<00:02:05.130> randomly<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.909> I've<00:02:06.719> said

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
bullets shoot randomly as I've said

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.650 
bullets shoot randomly as I've said
previously<00:02:07.610> vertical<00:02:08.610> recoil<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.090> very<00:02:09.149> easy

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
previously vertical recoil is very easy

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.320 
previously vertical recoil is very easy
to<00:02:09.810> control<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> very<00:02:10.649> predictable<00:02:11.150> for<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
to control and very predictable for this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.860 
to control and very predictable for this
reason<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.810> recommend<00:02:13.020> using<00:02:13.530> this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
reason I recommend using this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.650 
reason I recommend using this
only<00:02:14.349> in<00:02:14.440> short-range<00:02:15.010> battles<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
only in short-range battles the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.240 
only in short-range battles the
attachments<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.379> would<00:02:17.560> recommend<00:02:18.010> using

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
attachments that I would recommend using

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.160 
attachments that I would recommend using
on<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> mp7<00:02:18.819> are<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.480> foregrip<00:02:19.989> and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
on the mp7 are the foregrip and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.250 
on the mp7 are the foregrip and
suppressor<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.760> mp7<00:02:22.000> has<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> lot<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.810> recoil

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
suppressor the mp7 has a lot of recoil

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.110 
suppressor the mp7 has a lot of recoil
which<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.620> why<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.800> fore<00:02:24.129> grip<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.550> be<00:02:24.700> useful

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
which is why the fore grip can be useful

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.940 
which is why the fore grip can be useful
as<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.720> will<00:02:25.840> make<00:02:26.019> it<00:02:26.140> easier<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.860> to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
as it will make it easier for you to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.890 
as it will make it easier for you to
kill<00:02:27.129> your<00:02:27.220> enemies<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.879> can<00:02:28.300> reduce<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
kill your enemies and can reduce the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.380 
kill your enemies and can reduce the
recoil<00:02:29.050> significantly<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.879> suppressor<00:02:31.360> is

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
recoil significantly the suppressor is

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.240 
recoil significantly the suppressor is
very<00:02:31.660> useful<00:02:32.049> also<00:02:32.290> because<00:02:32.830> they<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.069> keep

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
very useful also because they can keep

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.000 
very useful also because they can keep
you<00:02:33.400> off<00:02:33.549> enemy<00:02:33.940> radars<00:02:34.410> all<00:02:35.410> right<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:35.860> hope

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
you off enemy radars all right so I hope

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.559 
you off enemy radars all right so I hope
