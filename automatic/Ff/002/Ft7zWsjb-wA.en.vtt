00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello and welcome to all for your little farmhouse 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.330
 today prefer in the small favorite farmhouse 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.920
 we will offer you a kind of ode unpacking presentation 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.039
 remains more than during the masters the last fan in the program 10 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.589
 meters of color masters 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.180
 a fan that comes in a plexi pixies box 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.730
 that it shines on all sides 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 with of course a fan inside not yet 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.860
 to watch a little bit respected that masters colors we give so we have 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.280
 a fan counts 120 millimeters which tournament 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.850
 at 800 rpm that will move 35 'cfm 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.329
 whose noise level will be tomorrow 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.499
 13 83 'db to 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.300
 so far we can say that it's only good% and especially that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.770
 the 800 dry towers directly in 12 volts 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180
 what should give us before the rather silent author but who does not 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.230
 will not necessarily exceed many mayors 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.080
 we will open the box 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.080
 it's made of the military their purpose 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.250
 unpacking the wild group 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.910
 it's a little complicated 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 on behalf of the heels all over the box and first 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.840
 we discover the club 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960
 in the code of 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.950
 there are small rubber washers for lying 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.270
 separations 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.390
 small rubber rods to make a fixation 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.909
 without fan vibration two albums nollet rather consistent well 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.420
 sure specific destinations since the said level that awaits him 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.550
 is specific 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.510
 then we have an adapter 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.880
 for the expert believes that m 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.340
 which is pretty good 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.440
 especially for top 5 of this ranking 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.810
 we'll go classic vista to screw the fan to the motive 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.090
 and finally we do not have a little cap a master drop point 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.090
 fan so they have more style 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.790
 the fan for himself 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.990
 he is entitled to a cable 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.829
 show these 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.609
 which in money key rather very very long that will allow you to reach 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.560
 so he 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.670
 here it is 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.930
 kyaw will wait a little near every year you want with luc 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.159
 the fan 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.219
 so we can everything is dense and say that during German he can 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:28.530
 in order to attract 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.769
 but not here 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.929
 to be able to exceed 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.579
 I am here 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.330
 this is done it's a little wild it includes beaches 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.659
 the wild and that's not the case 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.829
 to the four corners of the country the most expensive that is the most expensive around the return 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.479
 things like that it also creates a good idea so why so much more 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.640
 more frequently we will put all that in place 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.079
 ap the clip 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.450
 and over badly the little cap story that the fan pretty evening 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.449
 pretty 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.439
 That's what happens 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.689
 so all we are going to do is plug in the room 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.129
 on our small food and we will make a small variation 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.739
 from 50 to 12 million to test this fan very quickly 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.680
 we hooked up to our food and see what this we 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.569
 dad then of course their departure right away 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.569
 2 and so the top 14 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.069
 at full speed 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.599
 at full speed in a case it means per minute 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.239
 very clearly 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.120
 can be described as fan 2 very quiet we heard a slight breath 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.209
 but from the moment when the fan will be in a housing 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.739
 will be very difficult to be able to long at the level of the blower 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.359
 note that with our hand 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.289
 slightly to reach what bad luck and I'm pretty quickly this 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.259
 which indicates that the airflow 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.750
 hubwoo but it's not so huge you have to know that some fan 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.870
 in 12 volts 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.239
 it's something it's done if you want 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.360
 35 it's done m so we're on a bitrate 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.049
 which is less but which can be very interesting 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.370
 a potter who is trying to make silent we will go down a little bit 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.370
 voltage level 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.180
 we can say that 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.779
 from crude oils 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.539
 the fan becomes totally inaudible against the airflow 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.740
 drastically reduced 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.749
 to the point of seeming what is speed 2 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:29.710
 symbol 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.870
 worry-free 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.629
 but not from that moment 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.689
 the blades note more really very very fast since all the heads 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.349
 can you take against 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.349
 in the image we see them almost 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.529
 anyway 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:49.009
 not sure zero 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.069
 and like this wedding dress 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.069
 see in 5 volts it's hard to leave 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.020
 strong point it's a little bit more voltage for to do it 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.740
 to restart 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.940
 dockers mainly to do with walk and pareo boot bust in 5 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.990
 volts surely very problematic 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.990
 so rather fan rarely used 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.550
 on a rheobus 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.129
 from nine to 12 volt flying hours eight flights that will be very quiet with a 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.279
 ample airflow for a machine that will be searched r 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.170
 silent 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.890
 at the level of the tariff 12 euros 90 not enough excessive for a fan case a 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.120
 little bit of style 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.339
 eqType ...% 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:34.719
 a different head and especially not in fans who wants to be silent 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.810
 of course after this little video we'll see you soon soon 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:40.589
 side 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:41.490
 for later 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.240
 next video
