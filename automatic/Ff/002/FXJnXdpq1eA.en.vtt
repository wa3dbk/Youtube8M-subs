00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and in all of the games we've put

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
and in all of the games we've put
ourselves<00:00:37.309> into<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> position<00:00:38.399> where<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
ourselves into a position where we you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
ourselves into a position where we you
know<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.809> could<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.110> easily<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> probably

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
know we could have easily and probably

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.010 
know we could have easily and probably
should<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.520> won<00:00:41.790> games<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.719> could<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.960> an

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
should have won games and it could be an

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.069 
should have won games and it could be an
entirely<00:00:43.379> different<00:00:43.800> situation<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:45.480> again<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
entirely different situation so again I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
entirely different situation so again I
think<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.829> perspective<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
think from my perspective it's the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
think from my perspective it's the
important<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.440> look<00:00:49.620> logically

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
important thing is to to look logically

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.939 
important thing is to to look logically
our<00:00:50.820> performances<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.199> look<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.500> things<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
our performances to look at things that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.029 
our performances to look at things that
we<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.820> rectify<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:55.379> look<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.620> ways<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
we do need to rectify to look at ways to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430 
we do need to rectify to look at ways to
do<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.570> move<00:00:57.719> forward<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.170> here

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
do that and to move forward from here

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.670 
do that and to move forward from here
but<00:00:58.710> yeah<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.289> been<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
but yeah it's been a very it's been a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
but yeah it's been a very it's been a
very<00:01:01.859> strange<00:01:02.219> tournament<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.270> mean<00:01:04.170> obviously

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
very strange tournament I mean obviously

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.800 
very strange tournament I mean obviously
we<00:01:04.530> haven't<00:01:04.739> gotten<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> results<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.640> yes<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
we haven't gotten the results and yes it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.690 
we haven't gotten the results and yes it
was<00:01:06.900> pretty<00:01:07.049> brutal<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
was pretty brutal you know I think as a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.270 
was pretty brutal you know I think as a
team<00:01:08.939> giving<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.630> five<00:01:09.780> goals<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.680> mean<00:01:11.189> I've

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
team giving up five goals is I mean I've

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.440 
team giving up five goals is I mean I've
never<00:01:11.430> done<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.760> since<00:01:11.909> I've<00:01:12.030> been<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.270> so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
never done that since I've been here so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030 
never done that since I've been here so
that's<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:13.110> tough<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.680> there's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that's that's tough but I think there's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
that's that's tough but I think there's
there's<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.790> good<00:01:14.970> things<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> go

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
there's some good things that we can go

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.410 
there's some good things that we can go
forward<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.759> moving<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> North

difficult<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.990> us<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.409> gonna<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.619> great

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
difficult for us but it's gonna be great

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.780 
difficult for us but it's gonna be great
to<00:01:53.360> step<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.680> go<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.399> with

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to step up and you know go off with with

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789 
to step up and you know go off with with
a<00:01:56.820> win<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.450> leave<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> tournament<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
a win and leave the tournament on a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.370 
a win and leave the tournament on a
positive<00:01:59.369> note<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.000> never<00:02:00.869> quite<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.259> what

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
positive note you never quite know what

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.289 
positive note you never quite know what
to<00:02:01.439> expect<00:02:01.799> from<00:02:02.130> North<00:02:02.399> Korea<00:02:02.640> except<00:02:03.119> that

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to expect from North Korea except that

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.130 
to expect from North Korea except that
they're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.689> very<00:02:03.899> focused

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
they're going to be very focused

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.580 
they're going to be very focused
particularly<00:02:04.860> against<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> US<00:02:05.909> team<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.590> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
particularly against the US team and it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
particularly against the US team and it
gives<00:02:07.799> us<00:02:07.890> another<00:02:07.950> balance<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.270> know

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
gives us another balance of you know

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780 
gives us another balance of you know
have<00:02:09.959> an<00:02:10.140> Asian<00:02:10.440> opposition<00:02:11.009> we've<00:02:11.190> had<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
have an Asian opposition we've had a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.910 
have an Asian opposition we've had a
couple<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.270> European<00:02:12.720> teams<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.470> know<00:02:13.590> we've

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
couple of European teams and know we've

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
couple of European teams and know we've
two<00:02:14.130> Asian<00:02:14.520> teams<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> tournament<00:02:15.120> so

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
two Asian teams in the tournament so

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.400 
two Asian teams in the tournament so
that's<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.650> think<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:17.280> benefit<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
that's I think a benefit in the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.260 
that's I think a benefit in the
diversity<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.800> opposition<00:02:20.340> we've<00:02:21.030> played

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
diversity of the opposition we've played

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.699 
diversity of the opposition we've played
some<00:02:21.390> good<00:02:21.540> football<00:02:21.750> we've<00:02:22.050> we've<00:02:22.380> kept<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
some good football we've we've kept the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.170 
some good football we've we've kept the
ball<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.160> we've<00:02:23.280> created<00:02:23.670> quite<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> bit

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
ball and we've created quite a bit

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.360 
ball and we've created quite a bit
chances<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.569> ourselves<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.860> mean<00:02:26.130> obviously

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
chances for ourselves I mean obviously

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.160 
chances for ourselves I mean obviously
it<00:02:26.610> was<00:02:26.700> good<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.599> get<00:02:27.750> three<00:02:27.959> goals

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
it was good to to get three goals

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.510 
it was good to to get three goals
yesterday<00:02:28.650> those<00:02:28.860> most<00:02:29.099> goals<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.400> we

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
yesterday those most goals that we

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.010 
yesterday those most goals that we
scored

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
scored

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.090 
scored
unfortunately<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.380> gave<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:31.680> two<00:02:31.830> more<00:02:31.980> than

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
unfortunately we gave up two more than

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220 
unfortunately we gave up two more than
that<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:33.239> think<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.720> there's<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.989> lot<00:02:34.110> of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that but I think that there's a lot of

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.720 
that but I think that there's a lot of
good<00:02:34.319> things<00:02:34.440> from<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.860> we're<00:02:34.980> playing

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
good things from it and we're playing

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.970 
good things from it and we're playing
some<00:02:36.060> decent<00:02:36.660> football<00:02:36.840> not<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:37.709> good<00:02:37.860> as<00:02:37.920> we

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
some decent football not as good as we

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.770 
some decent football not as good as we
like<00:02:38.160> not<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.520> good<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:38.880> we're<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.600> need

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
like not as good as we're going to need

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.229 
like not as good as we're going to need
to<00:02:39.959> play<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.459> qualify<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> win

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
to play you know to qualify and to win

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.520 
to play you know to qualify and to win
the<00:02:42.300> World<00:02:42.450> Cup<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.080> think<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.440> we're

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
the World Cup but I think that we're

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.190 
the World Cup but I think that we're
getting<00:02:43.590> there<00:02:43.920> well<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.790> think<00:02:45.360> that's<00:02:45.569> a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
getting there well I think that's a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.300 
getting there well I think that's a
great<00:02:46.319> test<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:47.630> individual<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> team's
