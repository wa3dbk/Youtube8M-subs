collection<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.289> this<00:01:20.500> liquid<00:01:21.429> foundation

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
collection is this liquid foundation

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.999 
collection is this liquid foundation
which<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:24.479> 202<00:01:25.950> vanilla<00:01:27.450> natural<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.600> news

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
which is 202 vanilla natural the news

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.139 
which is 202 vanilla natural the news
and<00:01:30.009> i<00:01:30.069> think<00:01:30.280> it's<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.460> thing<00:01:30.670> about<00:01:30.789> this<00:01:31.090> is

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
and i think it's a thing about this is

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.419 
and i think it's a thing about this is
because<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.689> it's<00:01:32.200> like<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.799> has<00:01:32.950> an<00:01:33.100> interval

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
because it it's like it has an interval

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.870 
because it it's like it has an interval
obviously<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.840> also<00:01:34.990> has<00:01:35.140> Marilla<00:01:35.710> oil<00:01:36.009> so

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
obviously and it also has Marilla oil so

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.249 
obviously and it also has Marilla oil so
it's<00:01:37.030> really<00:01:37.360> highly<00:01:37.719> recommend<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.229> to

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
it's really highly recommend it to

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.529 
it's really highly recommend it to
people<00:01:38.380> who<00:01:38.710> have<00:01:38.740> dry<00:01:39.069> combination<00:01:39.700> skin<00:01:40.299> to

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
people who have dry combination skin to

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.630 
people who have dry combination skin to
keep<00:01:40.899> their<00:01:41.110> skin<00:01:41.340> wait<00:01:42.420> give<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.569> a<00:01:43.600> try<00:01:44.640> so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
keep their skin wait give it a try so

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.370 
keep their skin wait give it a try so
this<00:01:45.819> is<00:01:45.849> actually<00:01:46.179> not<00:01:46.420> my<00:01:46.959> skin<00:01:47.679> tone<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:50.110> I

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
this is actually not my skin tone but I

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.419 
this is actually not my skin tone but I
think<00:01:50.799> I'll<00:01:50.920> neutralize<00:01:51.459> it<00:01:51.640> later<00:01:52.920> okay<00:01:53.920> so

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
think I'll neutralize it later okay so

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.219 
think I'll neutralize it later okay so
I'll<00:01:54.579> just<00:01:54.610> pretend<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.539> need<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.899> go<00:01:56.049> out

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.300 
there's some of that foundations I use
is<00:02:44.990> feel<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.050> little<00:02:46.290> bit<00:02:46.440> warm<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.130> one

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
is feel a little bit warm and this one

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.310 
is feel a little bit warm and this one
has<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> little<00:02:48.090> playing<00:02:48.450> effects<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.110> like

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
has a little playing effects of like

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.820 
has a little playing effects of like
moves<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.160> skin<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:52.770> it

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
moves on my skin so if you can see it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.920 
moves on my skin so if you can see it
closer<00:02:53.750> I'm<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.960> blending<00:02:55.200> bizarre

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.500 

it's<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.200> easy<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> blend<00:03:02.030> because<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
it's very easy to blend because of the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.930 
it's very easy to blend because of the
oil<00:03:03.540> content<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.970> maybe<00:03:06.150> we<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.570> oily<00:03:06.930> skin

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
oil content so maybe we have oily skin

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:17.760 
oil content so maybe we have oily skin
you<00:03:08.940> want<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.270> use<00:03:09.480> less<00:03:09.840> product

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.260 

so<00:03:18.460> as<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.820> can<00:03:18.970> see<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:21.100> has<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.520> like<00:03:21.730> very

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
so as you can see it has this like very

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.160 
so as you can see it has this like very
luminous<00:03:22.980> finish<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.510> didn't<00:03:25.780> even<00:03:25.960> use

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
luminous finish and I didn't even use

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.360 
luminous finish and I didn't even use
concealer<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.490> would<00:03:28.450> say<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.720> this

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
concealer so I would say that this

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.640 
concealer so I would say that this
foundation<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.570> buildable<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.960> you<00:03:32.470> can

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
foundation is buildable and you can

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.570 
foundation is buildable and you can
actually<00:03:32.830> layer<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:34.540> me<00:03:34.750> like<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.830> know<00:03:35.980> to

actually layer it to me like you know to

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.980 
actually layer it to me like you know to
not<00:03:36.760> use<00:03:37.000> concealer

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.460

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.320 
for this this powder so I think probably
it's<00:05:32.139> more<00:05:32.380> expensive<00:05:32.650> cuz<00:05:33.070> it's<00:05:33.250> mike<00:05:33.970> has

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
it's more expensive cuz it's mike has

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.070 
it's more expensive cuz it's mike has
mineral<00:05:34.979> foundation<00:05:36.150> makeup<00:05:37.150> inside<00:05:37.780> so

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
mineral foundation makeup inside so

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.830 
mineral foundation makeup inside so
which<00:05:38.979> is<00:05:39.010> good<00:05:39.310> for<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.580> skin<00:05:39.840> lesser

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
which is good for the skin lesser

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.920 
which is good for the skin lesser

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.270
