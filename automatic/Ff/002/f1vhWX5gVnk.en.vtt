think of Gary as a restoration

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
think of Gary as a restoration
specialist<00:01:34.350> we've<00:01:34.979> been<00:01:35.130> able<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.400> buy

several<00:01:36.180> different<00:01:37.049> farms<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.650> joined<00:01:37.950> us

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
several different farms that joined us

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.819 
several different farms that joined us
and<00:01:38.640> he<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> possibility<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and he could see the possibility that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
and he could see the possibility that
the<00:01:41.430> land<00:01:41.670> had<00:01:42.229> range<00:01:43.229> management<00:01:44.090> my<00:01:45.090> dad

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the land had range management my dad

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
the land had range management my dad
I<00:01:45.720> think<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:46.439> he<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.130> kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> has<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
I think that's he just kind of has a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.749 
I think that's he just kind of has a
knack<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.270> he's<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> natural<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:49.979> one

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
knack for it he's a natural at it one

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.630 
knack for it he's a natural at it one
thing<00:01:51.000> he<00:01:51.180> always<00:01:51.210> told<00:01:51.990> me<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.100> always<00:01:53.310> go

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.660 
paid off big in 2011 when the price
family<00:02:03.329> faced<00:02:03.630> extreme<00:02:04.409> drought<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:05.549> was

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
family faced extreme drought there was

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
family faced extreme drought there was
really<00:02:05.969> nothing<00:02:06.180> green<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.869> all<00:02:06.960> throughout

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
really nothing green at all throughout

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.160 
really nothing green at all throughout
the<00:02:07.649> summer<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.360> were<00:02:09.479> able<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:09.929> along

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the summer but we were able to get along

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.130 
the summer but we were able to get along
and<00:02:10.200> not<00:02:10.590> call<00:02:10.860> anything

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
and not call anything

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.200 
and not call anything
and<00:02:12.230> again<00:02:12.740> we're<00:02:12.890> able<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.190> wean<00:02:13.790> all<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.090> our

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
and again we're able to wean all of our

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.150 
and again we're able to wean all of our
calves<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.750> schedule<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.470> precondition

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
calves on schedule and precondition

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280 
calves on schedule and precondition
those<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.670> then<00:02:16.790> sell<00:02:17.030> them<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.360> an

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
those and then sell them and an

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.040 
those and then sell them and an
improving<00:02:18.860> market<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.550> helped<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
improving market so that helped but it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.710 
improving market so that helped but it
just<00:02:21.200> showed<00:02:21.440> us<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.800> value<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.310> range<00:02:23.300> health

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
just showed us the value of range health

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.420 
just showed us the value of range health
I<00:02:23.990> think<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.530> main<00:02:24.740> reason<00:02:25.100> they<00:02:25.220> came

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
I think the main reason they came

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.390 
I think the main reason they came
through<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.730> drop<00:02:26.650> strongly<00:02:27.650> was<00:02:28.010> because

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
through that drop strongly was because

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.540 
through that drop strongly was because
they<00:02:28.610> left<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.240> lot<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.020> grass<00:02:30.260> here<00:02:30.620> when

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
they left a lot of grass here when

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.520 
they left a lot of grass here when
things<00:02:31.820> were<00:02:32.030> good<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.630> they<00:02:33.050> didn't<00:02:33.320> try<00:02:33.470> to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
things were good and they didn't try to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.290 
things were good and they didn't try to
take<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.980> all<00:02:34.160> they<00:02:34.370> didn't<00:02:34.610> try<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.790> mine<00:02:35.090> all

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
take it all they didn't try to mine all

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.480 
take it all they didn't try to mine all
