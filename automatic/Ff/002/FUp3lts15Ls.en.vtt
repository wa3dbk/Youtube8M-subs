00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.820
 The first thing we will need in 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:23.210
 our base of these molds I took them 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.460
 of the play doh codes of leds 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.259
 plasticine play doh here is the base 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.540
 the cupcake then let's take a 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.989
 little these these molds are rigid 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.809
 then for the now unmold we're going to 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.110
 help us with a little bit of female 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.390
 this is small dante cream 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 and when they start let's do it 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 by all the little 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.519
 so that the figures come out with greater 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:56.170
 ease in case you do not 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.370
 have overflowing cream can use 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.260
 vaseline 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.260
 Now let's take our dough 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.339
 let's knead well 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.180
 and we are going to put it in the part here for 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.050
 take 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050
 to the base 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.260
 to remove it we will use the same 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.010
 mass let's make pressure 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.330
 and our base will come out 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.330
 This is how our base will be 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.140
 now with another one with another one and here we go 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.140
 to 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.700
 to you with one of these three forms 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.700
 I'm going to take the little heart 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.860
 let's crush 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.350
 that fits well so that the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.890
 parties and with this one 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.650
 with this little piece of dough 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.470
 we are also going to withdraw 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.500
 after we already have this part 7 and 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.760
 the one below we are going to join the ones in this 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.420
 way 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.420
 I dont know 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.830
 but in the mold then what are we going 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.930
 do 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.570
 let's take a little white mark yo 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.640
 I'm working with cold porcelain but 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.800
 they can do it with fire with my 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.490
 forgive with polymer clay 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.580
 or what you want to work with 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.700
 let's catch and let's stretch let's go 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.280
 make a washer those who have doubt 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.070
 they can use yours that is not easy 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.070
 but the ones that do not like it this way 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.110
 let's cut here 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.230
 not that 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.560
 another ass of more and it's going let's go to 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.560
 do the same 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.220
 unless 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.200
 and now what are we going to do with the 3 2 and 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.200
 3 we are going to enter talks 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.850
 so that it has been more or less than 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.850
 this way 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.090
 so after having this we return with 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:04.590
 We cut our base we were going 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.590
 putting in this way 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.120
 and we are going to go putting ourselves blocking 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.120
 more or less like that 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.930
 after 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:34.789
 with a 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.789
 more green 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.410
 let's make the foundations 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.410
 we take our base 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:49.560
 the crest 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.560
 and we are going to make a small leaf 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 thus 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.090
 and we do the same thing to get two 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.090
 leaflets 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.130
 in this way 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.340
 and with a little bit more we're going to 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.980
 do 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.550
 teacher 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.550
 you are 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.130
 that we now use it a 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.520
 little bit of another dough to be able 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.830
 remove 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.830
 and we're going to put it in the middle 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.370
 as we are using a 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.370
 mass is a little 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.360
 here he had 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.999
 fresquita we can erase the lines 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.139
 then with a stick just 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:04.889
 retouch 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:08.950
 the lines of our leaves 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:14.569
 damaged position or something like that 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:18.889
 and so we have our 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.990
 It is very small and we can use 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:25.620
 several styles as we had already 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:30.919
 mentioned we can put it like that 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.919
 or a little more Christmas can be this 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.860
 or it can be like that 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.069
 if we do not have many believe that all 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.830
 these models get the most out with 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.750
 the toys of the play doh them in their 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.970
 in their 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.490
 in their base appointments they have logos here 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.160
 molds and with that you also pull out 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.730
 uses in the same way they are put 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.280
 in front and it is removed and it is very easy to take 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.290
 the forms but if they liked this 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.230
 video please like with mind and 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:15.030
 subscribe see you in our order the 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.030
 another next occasion bye bye
