limited to four gigabytes of memory it's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.510 
limited to four gigabytes of memory it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
got a 500 gigabyte hard drive actually

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.029 
got a 500 gigabyte hard drive actually
it's<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.909> 250<00:02:03.749> gigabyte<00:02:03.929> hard<00:02:04.200> drives<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.619> raid

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
it's to 250 gigabyte hard drives in raid

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.770 
it's to 250 gigabyte hard drives in raid
which<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:05.670> nice<00:02:05.850> gives<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> lot<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
which is really nice gives you a lot of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.690 
which is really nice gives you a lot of
storage<00:02:07.320> options<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.190> good<00:02:08.310> stuff<00:02:08.519> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
storage options really good stuff you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.780 
storage options really good stuff you
get<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> super<00:02:09.509> multi<00:02:09.840> dvd-rw<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.519> over

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
get a super multi dvd-rw so that's over

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.430 
get a super multi dvd-rw so that's over
here<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.330> side<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
here on this side you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
here on this side you
see<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.890> does<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.070> lightscribe<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.570> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
see that it does have lightscribe and it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.630 
see that it does have lightscribe and it
is<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> super<00:02:16.260> multi<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.740> it'll<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:17.010> ours<00:02:17.280> plus

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
is a super multi so it'll do ours plus

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.420 
is a super multi so it'll do ours plus
RS<00:02:17.910> minus<00:02:18.030> RS<00:02:18.420> Rams<00:02:18.720> roms<00:02:19.160> pretty<00:02:20.160> much<00:02:20.280> you

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
RS minus RS Rams roms pretty much you

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.400 
RS minus RS Rams roms pretty much you
name<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.730> it'll<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.210> CDs<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.690> DVDs<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:22.170> was

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
name it it'll do it CDs and DVDs as was

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.070 
name it it'll do it CDs and DVDs as was
dual<00:02:22.740> layers<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.310> 4x<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.390> it's<00:02:24.540> very<00:02:24.690> fast

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
dual layers up to 4x so it's very fast

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
dual layers up to 4x so it's very fast
as<00:02:25.320> well<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.830> there's<00:02:26.610> still<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> lot<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.090> as

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
as well and there's still a lot more as

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.880 
as well and there's still a lot more as
you<00:02:27.690> noticed<00:02:28.140> probably<00:02:28.470> when<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.590> told<00:02:28.770> you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
you noticed probably when I told you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.280 
you noticed probably when I told you
earlier<00:02:28.950> about<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.310> Torreon<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.930> actually

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
earlier about the Torreon you actually

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.260 
earlier about the Torreon you actually
have<00:02:31.470> nvidia<00:02:32.430> graphics<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.120> which<00:02:33.210> is

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
have nvidia graphics on here which is

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.060 
have nvidia graphics on here which is
really<00:02:33.390> nice<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:34.320> not<00:02:34.470> super<00:02:34.830> duper

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
really nice so it's not super duper

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.500 
really nice so it's not super duper
gaming<00:02:35.550> graphics<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.060> are<00:02:36.120> awesome<00:02:36.300> for

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
gaming graphics that are awesome for

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.730 
gaming graphics that are awesome for
video<00:02:36.780> games<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.380> good<00:02:37.590> enough

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
video games but it is good enough

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.610 
video games but it is good enough
definitely<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.450> 1080p<00:02:39.450> videos<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.110> stream

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
definitely to do 1080p videos to stream

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.530 
definitely to do 1080p videos to stream
