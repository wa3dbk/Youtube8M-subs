bowing so now the recent patch they did
the<00:03:47.400> only<00:03:47.489> thing<00:03:47.610> they<00:03:47.790> did<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.150> thing

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
the only thing they did to this thing

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.850 
the only thing they did to this thing
was<00:03:48.510> they<00:03:48.630> increase<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.140> stability<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.620> little

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
was they increase the stability a little

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.039 
was they increase the stability a little
bit<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.250> does<00:03:50.730> solar<00:03:50.970> damage<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.720> what<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:51.959> do

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
bit so does solar damage and what I do

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.449 
bit so does solar damage and what I do
is<00:03:52.200> for<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.470> first<00:03:52.680> tree<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> go<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.220> C<00:03:53.340> could

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
is for the first tree I go with C could

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.680 
is for the first tree I go with C could
be<00:03:53.580> ballistics<00:03:54.030> you're<00:03:54.180> going<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.360> reduce<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
be ballistics you're going to reduce the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.390 
be ballistics you're going to reduce the
recoil<00:03:54.810> even<00:03:55.260> more<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.130> do<00:03:56.220> take<00:03:56.370> a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
recoil even more but you do take a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.830 
recoil even more but you do take a
little<00:03:56.580> hit<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.120> range<00:03:57.360> but<00:03:57.570> don't<00:03:57.750> worry

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
little hit on the range but don't worry

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.150 
little hit on the range but don't worry
about<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.110> we<00:03:58.170> got<00:03:58.290> another<00:03:58.500> perk<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.980> will

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
about it we got another perk that will

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.949 
about it we got another perk that will
help<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.700> range<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.000> little<00:04:00.030> bit<00:04:00.299> crowd<00:04:00.780> control

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
help it range a little bit crowd control

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.680 
help it range a little bit crowd control
that's<00:04:01.350> another<00:04:01.560> really<00:04:02.250> good<00:04:02.519> PVE<00:04:03.030> type<00:04:03.480> /

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
that's another really good PVE type /

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.660 
that's another really good PVE type /
not<00:04:03.930> PvP<00:04:04.380> kills<00:04:04.950> its<00:04:05.100> as<00:04:05.160> weapon<00:04:05.430> give<00:04:05.580> you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
not PvP kills its as weapon give you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.610 
not PvP kills its as weapon give you
some<00:04:05.850> bonus<00:04:06.150> damage<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.900> go<00:04:07.290> with<00:04:07.440> hand

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
some bonus damage so I go with hand

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.750 
some bonus damage so I go with hand
loaded<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.100> not<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.340> other<00:04:08.459> two<00:04:08.549> because

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
loaded and not the other two because

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.310 
loaded and not the other two because
hand<00:04:09.000> load<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.299> going<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.570> increase<00:04:10.080> the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
hand load it's going to increase the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.199 
hand load it's going to increase the
effective<00:04:10.709> range<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.640> other<00:04:11.790> two<00:04:11.910> you're

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
effective range so the other two you're

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.400 
effective range so the other two you're
gonna<00:04:12.299> take<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.510> hit<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.900> range<00:04:13.110> but

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
gonna take a hit on the range but

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.199 
gonna take a hit on the range but
increase<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.890> reload<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.820> know<00:04:14.910> what<00:04:15.060> don't

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
increase that reload you know what don't

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.670 
increase that reload you know what don't
even<00:04:15.299> worry<00:04:15.420> about<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.750> super<00:04:16.380> good<00:04:16.500> advice

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
even worry about it super good advice

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.469 
even worry about it super good advice
