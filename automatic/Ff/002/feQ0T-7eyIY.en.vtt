Christine firsta and in the weeks since
I've<00:00:18.240> done<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> Gault<00:00:19.020> transition<00:00:19.740> tutorial

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
I've done the Gault transition tutorial

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
I've done the Gault transition tutorial
I<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:21.029> asked<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> couple<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.779> times<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.529> was

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
I was asked a couple of times if it was

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
I was asked a couple of times if it was
possible<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.250> achieve<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.699> same<00:00:23.939> result

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
possible to achieve the same result

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.109 
possible to achieve the same result
without<00:00:24.600> Baris<00:00:25.230> effect<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> while<00:00:26.789> not<00:00:26.939> being

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
without Baris effect and while not being

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.630 
without Baris effect and while not being
exactly<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> same<00:00:28.109> thing<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:29.010> know<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
exactly the same thing I do know of a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.060 
exactly the same thing I do know of a
way<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> achieve<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> similar<00:00:31.140> effect<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.679> won't

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
way to achieve a similar effect I won't

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.340 
way to achieve a similar effect I won't
call<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.399> goal<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> isn't<00:00:33.960> but

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
call the goal because it isn't but

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
call the goal because it isn't but
rather<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.800> film<00:00:35.100> flash<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
rather a film flash and this is what it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.240 
rather a film flash and this is what it
looks<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.980> it's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
looks like so you can see it's it's it's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
looks like so you can see it's it's it's
similar<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.940> glow<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:45.960> it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
similar to a glow but it's but it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.220 
similar to a glow but it's but it's
definitely<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> same<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> let's<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
definitely not the same so let's do it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.799 
definitely not the same so let's do it
and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.579> first<00:00:50.820> thing<00:00:51.059> we'll<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.420> very

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and the first thing we'll do is very

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.040 
and the first thing we'll do is very
simple<00:00:52.170> we'll<00:00:52.739> create<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.100> quick<00:00:53.610> transition

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
simple we'll create a quick transition

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
simple we'll create a quick transition
that<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.170> 12<00:00:55.530> frames<00:00:55.800> long<00:00:56.100> centered<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that is 12 frames long centered that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.250 
that is 12 frames long centered that
it's<00:00:57.420> exactly<00:00:57.629> right

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it's exactly right

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.580 
it's exactly right
so<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.670> now<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> very<00:01:00.600> simple

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
so what we have now is a very simple

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.119 
so what we have now is a very simple
transition<00:01:03.320> now<00:01:04.320> I'll<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.100> whole

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
transition now I'll make the whole

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.710 
transition now I'll make the whole
transition<00:01:05.580> 20<00:01:06.479> frames<00:01:06.990> long<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> course

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
transition 20 frames long but of course

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
transition 20 frames long but of course
you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.960> alter<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.470> any<00:01:10.799> way<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.010> like

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you can alter that any way you like

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.800 
you can alter that any way you like
so<00:01:11.850> I'll<00:01:12.240> add<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.930> edit<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.380> video<00:01:14.100> track<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.810> 10

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
so I'll add an edit on video track to 10

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.370 
so I'll add an edit on video track to 10
frames<00:01:16.200> before<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.070> cut<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.240> ten<00:01:19.049> frames

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
frames before the cut and ten frames

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.289 
frames before the cut and ten frames
after<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> cut<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:23.790> thing<00:01:24.090> we'll

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
after the cut now the first thing we'll

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.289 
after the cut now the first thing we'll
do<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.720> blur<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.040> image<00:01:26.150> within<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
do is blur the image within the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.539 
do is blur the image within the
transition<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> tools<00:01:29.869> effect<00:01:30.869> Polad

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
transition so go to tools effect Polad

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.740 
transition so go to tools effect Polad
image<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.150> drag<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> blur<00:01:34.500> effect<00:01:35.270> onto<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
image and drag the blur effect onto the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.280 
image and drag the blur effect onto the
empty<00:01:36.869> video<00:01:37.290> track<00:01:39.140> there<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:42.140> can<00:01:43.140> go

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
empty video track there it is I can go

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.210 
empty video track there it is I can go
into<00:01:43.470> effect<00:01:43.920> editor<00:01:47.750> zoom<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.950> image

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
into effect editor zoom out of the image

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
into effect editor zoom out of the image
and<00:01:51.740> draw<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> rectangular<00:01:53.399> shape<00:01:54.259> across<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and draw a rectangular shape across the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.130 
and draw a rectangular shape across the
whole<00:01:55.710> image<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:59.100> they're<00:01:59.340> exploring<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
whole image now they're exploring the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
whole image now they're exploring the
whole<00:02:01.259> image<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:03.270> want

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
whole image we don't want that we want

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.980 
whole image we don't want that we want
to<00:02:03.540> start<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:05.280> blur<00:02:05.670> amount<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.299> 0<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
to start with a blur amount of 0 and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.040 
to start with a blur amount of 0 and
we'll<00:02:07.560> end<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.970> blur<00:02:09.209> amount<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.660> 0<00:02:09.869> as

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
we'll end with a blur amount of 0 as

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.640 
we'll end with a blur amount of 0 as
well<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:11.000> we'll<00:02:12.050> add<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.319> key

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
well and we'll add a key

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.550 
well and we'll add a key
frame<00:02:14.030> at<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.209> center<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.750> transition<00:02:16.260> so

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
frame at the center of the transition so

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.619 
frame at the center of the transition so
at<00:02:16.709> ten<00:02:16.980> frames<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.849> case<00:02:18.409> and<00:02:20.629> create

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
at ten frames in this case and create

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.509 
at ten frames in this case and create
some<00:02:21.870> blur<00:02:22.079> say<00:02:22.650> 15<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.439> decent<00:02:26.250> amount

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
some blur say 15 that is a decent amount

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:33.559 
some blur say 15 that is a decent amount
of<00:02:26.819> blur<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.599> what's<00:02:31.349> happening<00:02:31.680> now<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:32.569> we

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
of blur so what's happening now is we

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.630 
of blur so what's happening now is we
blur<00:02:33.780> into<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.680> transition<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.400> we'll

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
blur into the transition and we'll

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.500 
blur into the transition and we'll
blurring<00:02:36.090> out<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.840> transition<00:02:38.239> why<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.299> we

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
blurring out of the transition why do we

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.319 
blurring out of the transition why do we
do<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.930> blurring<00:02:40.439> well<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.670> next<00:02:41.819> step<00:02:42.120> we'll

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
do the blurring well the next step we'll

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.080 
do the blurring well the next step we'll
do<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.750> burning<00:02:43.709> out<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.890> image<00:02:44.430> basically

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
do is burning out the image basically

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.920 
do is burning out the image basically
overcranking<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.319> exposure<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:47.250> lot<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.940> with

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
overcranking the exposure a lot and with

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.240 
overcranking the exposure a lot and with
a<00:02:48.959> blur<00:02:49.230> will<00:02:50.069> create<00:02:50.639> you<00:02:51.299> know<00:02:51.329> larger<00:02:52.319> more

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
a blur will create you know larger more

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.030 
a blur will create you know larger more
soft<00:02:53.609> shapes<00:02:54.170> with<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:56.310> overexposing<00:02:57.030> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
soft shapes with the overexposing and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.460 
soft shapes with the overexposing and
that<00:02:59.040> just<00:02:59.430> looks<00:02:59.670> nicer<00:03:00.000> then<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.230> hard

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that just looks nicer then the hard

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.140 
that just looks nicer then the hard
edges<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:02.370> we'd<00:03:02.639> get<00:03:02.879> if<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.569> didn't<00:03:03.840> blur<00:03:05.150> so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
edges that we'd get if we didn't blur so

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.569 
edges that we'd get if we didn't blur so
how<00:03:06.299> do<00:03:06.359> we<00:03:06.510> over<00:03:06.780> expose<00:03:07.139> very<00:03:07.799> very<00:03:08.040> simply

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
how do we over expose very very simply

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.619 
how do we over expose very very simply
we'll<00:03:09.299> just<00:03:09.689> add<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.409> color<00:03:11.129> effect<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:12.120> top<00:03:12.450> of

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
we'll just add a color effect on top of

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.399 
we'll just add a color effect on top of
the<00:03:12.810> blur<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.340> again<00:03:14.939> go<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.180> tools<00:03:15.480> effect

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
the blur so again go to tools effect

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.050 
the blur so again go to tools effect
plaid<00:03:16.940> image<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.590> alt<00:03:19.590> or<00:03:19.949> option<00:03:20.310> drag<00:03:20.699> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
plaid image and alt or option drag the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.159 
plaid image and alt or option drag the
color<00:03:21.359> effect<00:03:22.010> onto<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.160> blur<00:03:26.690> again<00:03:27.690> go<00:03:28.109> to

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
color effect onto the blur again go to

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.610 
color effect onto the blur again go to
effect<00:03:28.620> editor<00:03:29.239> go<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.569> center<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.139> the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
effect editor go to the center of the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.619 
effect editor go to the center of the
transition<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.609> add<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> keyframe<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.730> what

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
transition and add a keyframe and what

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.420 
transition and add a keyframe and what
we'll<00:03:36.900> use<00:03:37.319> now<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.609> luma<00:03:38.970> range<00:03:40.340> there<00:03:41.340> we

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
we'll use now is the luma range there we

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.640 
we'll use now is the luma range there we
go<00:03:41.579> there's<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> luma<00:03:42.479> range<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.079> just<00:03:43.379> drag

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
go there's the luma range and just drag

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.559 
go there's the luma range and just drag
the<00:03:44.010> white<00:03:44.220> point<00:03:45.829> way<00:03:46.829> way<00:03:47.340> down<00:03:50.569> maybe

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
the white point way way down maybe

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.740 
the white point way way down maybe
something<00:03:52.349> like<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.129> can<00:03:53.639> see<00:03:53.879> it's<00:03:54.449> blown

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
something like this I can see it's blown

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:05.469 
something like this I can see it's blown
out<00:03:55.099> very<00:03:56.099> much<00:03:58.909> now<00:03:59.909> we<00:03:59.970> have<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.389> render<00:04:00.690> this

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:05.479 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.610 

and<00:04:07.159> we're<00:04:08.159> basically<00:04:08.519> done<00:04:09.260> but<00:04:10.260> I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
and we're basically done but I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.159 
and we're basically done but I
personally<00:04:11.190> think<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.609> looks<00:04:11.790> nicer<00:04:12.209> if<00:04:12.479> the

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
personally think it looks nicer if the

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.110 
personally think it looks nicer if the
color<00:04:13.409> effect<00:04:13.590> animation<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.549> not<00:04:14.579> straight

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
color effect animation is not straight

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.279 
color effect animation is not straight
but<00:04:15.389> rather<00:04:16.320> done<00:04:17.190> with<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.459> Bezier<00:04:17.820> curve<00:04:18.289> so

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
but rather done with a Bezier curve so

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.190 
but rather done with a Bezier curve so
let's<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.479> get<00:04:21.479> back<00:04:21.659> into<00:04:21.840> effect

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
let's do that get back into effect

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.610 
let's do that get back into effect
editor<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:24.529> from

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
editor and from

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.570 
editor and from
the<00:04:25.889> color<00:04:26.130> effect<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:27.060> advance<00:04:27.419> keyframes

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.020 

now<00:04:32.580> let's<00:04:32.790> get<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.150> our<00:04:34.130> white<00:04:35.130> point<00:04:35.490> slider

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.330 

and<00:04:39.199> there<00:04:40.199> we<00:04:40.320> have<00:04:40.440> our<00:04:40.470> key<00:04:40.770> frames<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.190> as

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
and there we have our key frames and as

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.740 
and there we have our key frames and as
you<00:04:41.460> can<00:04:41.580> see<00:04:41.639> now<00:04:41.940> there<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.389> straight<00:04:42.750> line

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
you can see now there is a straight line

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:56.180 
you can see now there is a straight line
and<00:04:45.750> we<00:04:46.410> could<00:04:47.330> use<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.660> spline<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.919> that

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
and we could use the spline and that

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.760 
and we could use the spline and that
gives<00:04:56.430> us<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:57.030> much<00:04:57.780> softer<00:04:59.810> animation<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:01.710> can

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
gives us a much softer animation you can

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.950 
gives us a much softer animation you can
also<00:05:02.040> use<00:05:03.000> bezzie<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:04.700> and<00:05:05.750> change<00:05:06.750> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
also use bezzie a and change the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960 
also use bezzie a and change the
animation<00:05:07.440> curve<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.860> your<00:05:08.010> liking<00:05:08.400> but<00:05:08.910> I

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
animation curve to your liking but I

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.510 
animation curve to your liking but I
think<00:05:09.270> in<00:05:09.419> this<00:05:09.540> case<00:05:09.950> spline<00:05:10.950> is<00:05:11.160> totally

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
think in this case spline is totally

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.500 
think in this case spline is totally
sufficient<00:05:12.770> get<00:05:13.770> out<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.070> effect<00:05:14.370> over<00:05:14.700> so

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
sufficient get out of effect over so

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.150 
sufficient get out of effect over so
let's<00:05:15.720> look<00:05:15.840> at<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.050> again<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:18.710> think<00:05:19.710> that

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
let's look at that again I think that

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.689 
let's look at that again I think that
looks<00:05:20.430> quite<00:05:21.330> decent<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.130> of<00:05:23.130> course<00:05:23.400> what

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
looks quite decent and of course what

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.110 
looks quite decent and of course what
you<00:05:23.789> can<00:05:23.910> do<00:05:24.060> is<00:05:24.419> save<00:05:24.930> those<00:05:25.229> effects<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:27.090> a

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
you can do is save those effects to a

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.570 
you can do is save those effects to a
bin<00:05:27.389> by<00:05:28.199> just<00:05:28.650> dragging<00:05:28.830> this<00:05:29.160> little<00:05:29.490> icon

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
bin by just dragging this little icon

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.550 
bin by just dragging this little icon
from<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.330> effect<00:05:30.570> editor<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:31.139> a<00:05:31.169> bin<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:34.440> know

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
from the effect editor to a bin you know

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.060 
from the effect editor to a bin you know
name<00:05:35.160> them<00:05:37.160> do<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.340> same<00:05:38.580> thing<00:05:38.820> with<00:05:40.070> the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
name them do the same thing with the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.459 
name them do the same thing with the
blur

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.749 

and<00:05:48.469> now<00:05:48.589> you<00:05:48.679> can<00:05:48.800> simply<00:05:49.069> reuse<00:05:49.279> them

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
and now you can simply reuse them

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.359 
and now you can simply reuse them
whenever<00:05:50.149> you<00:05:50.330> like<00:05:50.629> and<00:05:50.929> this<00:05:51.800> is<00:05:51.979> a<00:05:52.009> very

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:52.369 
whenever you like and this is a very

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:56.589 
whenever you like and this is a very
simple<00:05:52.999> quickly<00:05:53.719> rendering<00:05:54.289> effect<00:05:55.099> and<00:05:55.599> I

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
simple quickly rendering effect and I

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.989 
simple quickly rendering effect and I
think<00:05:56.839> it<00:05:56.929> looks<00:05:57.110> very<00:05:57.199> very<00:05:57.559> decent<00:05:58.009> alright

00:05:58.989 --> 00:05:58.999 
think it looks very very decent alright

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.909 
think it looks very very decent alright
