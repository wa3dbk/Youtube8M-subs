copters<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.580> think<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.880> decided<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> show

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
copters and I think we decided to show

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.210 
copters and I think we decided to show
up<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.570> camp<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> lot<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> game<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.160> if

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
up with camp for a lot of the game so if

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.470 
up with camp for a lot of the game so if
we<00:00:17.279> carried<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.699> more<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> could<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.390> easily

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
we carried on more I could have easily

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.700 
we carried on more I could have easily
gotten<00:00:18.810> some<00:00:18.990> more<00:00:19.109> kills<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:19.650> I

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
gotten some more kills and I think I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.170 
gotten some more kills and I think I
even<00:00:19.890> had<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> black<00:00:20.490> print<00:00:20.699> shop<00:00:20.939> we're<00:00:21.060> gonna

using a lot of burst fire guns like the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.840 
using a lot of burst fire guns like the
m16<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.029> mostly<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.779> g11<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:32.399> switching<00:00:32.820> over

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
m16 or mostly the g11 and switching over

m16 or mostly the g11 and switching over
to<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.090> guns<00:00:33.300> weird<00:00:33.570> especially<00:00:34.559> because

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to this guns weird especially because

famas<00:00:36.719> chirag<00:00:37.190> because<00:00:38.190> gun<00:00:38.370> guns<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
famas chirag because gun guns like that

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.690 
famas chirag because gun guns like that
the<00:00:39.450> recoil<00:00:39.960> tends<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> kick<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the recoil tends to kick up and to the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.630 
the recoil tends to kick up and to the
left<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.809> gun<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.860> ak-47

of<00:00:46.559> weird<00:00:46.770> weird<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> hit<00:00:47.550> people<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
of weird weird to hit people in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.229 
of weird weird to hit people in
long-range<00:00:48.350> ranges<00:00:49.670> but<00:00:50.670> yeah<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.910> game<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
long-range ranges but yeah this game is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.360 
long-range ranges but yeah this game is
a<00:00:51.329> great<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:51.899> medium<00:00:52.320> range<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.890> starts<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a great at medium range it starts a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.880 
a great at medium range it starts a
lacking<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.000> long<00:00:54.180> range<00:00:54.449> obviously<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
lacking at long range obviously and I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.840 
lacking at long range obviously and I
right<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> thought<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> die

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
right here I thought was going to die

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.920 
right here I thought was going to die
because<00:00:56.879> they<00:00:57.120> both<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.750> started

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
because they both would have started

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.029 
because they both would have started
shooting<00:00:58.230> me<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> same<00:00:58.590> time<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:58.949> would

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
shooting me at the same time they would

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
shooting me at the same time they would
have<00:00:59.160> killed<00:00:59.280> me<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> got<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> decided<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
have killed me but I got a decided to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.060 
have killed me but I got a decided to

let's say even the mp5k it to be right
next<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> him<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.509> pretty<00:01:24.990> much<00:01:25.080> kill<00:01:25.140> them

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
next to him to pretty much kill them

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.600 
next to him to pretty much kill them
when<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> closer<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
when that's and the closer you are to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.789 
when that's and the closer you are to
them<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.060> easier<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> show

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
them the easier it is for them to show

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.260 
them the easier it is for them to show
you<00:01:28.860> back<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:29.340> might<00:01:29.700> actually<00:01:29.909> kill

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you back and they might actually kill

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
you back and they might actually kill
you<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.619> further<00:01:31.770> away<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.009> am<00:01:32.310> from

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you so the further away I am from

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.179 
you so the further away I am from
somebody<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> more<00:01:33.390> confident<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.930> feel<00:01:34.189> no

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
somebody the more confident I feel no

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.450 
somebody the more confident I feel no
but<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> guess<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> loser<00:01:36.930> say<00:01:37.259> too

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
but I guess that's what a loser say too

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.999 
but I guess that's what a loser say too
but<00:01:38.460> anyways<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.970> am<00:01:39.630> fast<00:01:39.960> boring<00:01:40.290> forwarding

don't<00:04:28.680> say<00:04:28.980> crying<00:04:29.220> because<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.430> makes<00:04:29.640> me

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
don't say crying because that makes me

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.240

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
painful and it was all because of the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.430 
painful and it was all because of the
eggs<00:04:34.950> that<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:36.180> grew<00:04:36.750> an<00:04:36.870> allergy<00:04:37.290> to
