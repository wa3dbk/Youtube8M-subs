actually no I do I think it actually
comes<00:01:28.920> from<00:01:28.979> when<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> baby<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.729> my<00:01:29.850> first

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
comes from when I was a baby on my first

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.399 
comes from when I was a baby on my first
birthday<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.600> mom<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.869> me<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.110> stuffed

tiger toy and I had a really fluffy tail
and<00:01:33.420> apparently<00:01:33.810> ever<00:01:33.990> since<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> baby<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and apparently ever since I was a baby I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.230 
and apparently ever since I was a baby I
just<00:01:35.130> used<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> take<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> tiger<00:01:35.850> tail<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
just used to take the tiger tail and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.749 
just used to take the tiger tail and
just<00:01:36.439> stick<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.710> my<00:01:37.860> ear<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.490> strange

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
just stick it in my ear for some strange

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
just stick it in my ear for some strange
reason<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.390> now<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:39.659> i<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> q-tip<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
reason so now when i get a q-tip and I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.770 
reason so now when i get a q-tip and I
put<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.189> my<00:01:41.250> ear<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.420> feels<00:01:42.540> really

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
put it in my ear it just feels really

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.060 
put it in my ear it just feels really
good<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.500> reminds<00:01:43.829> me<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
good and I think it reminds me of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.760 
good and I think it reminds me of the
fluffy<00:01:44.399> tiger<00:01:44.729> tail<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> feeling<00:01:45.720> safe<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fluffy tiger tail and feeling safe and I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.800 
fluffy tiger tail and feeling safe and I

don't know I should talk to a therapist
about<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.680> might<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.130> too

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
about that one it might be a bit too

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.929 
about that one it might be a bit too
deep<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.420> me<00:01:55.070> next<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> last<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.850> is

only two options i'm given but to be
honest<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.259> sexual<00:02:04.560> orientation<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> bit<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
honest my sexual orientation is a bit of

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.069 
honest my sexual orientation is a bit of
a<00:02:05.520> mystery<00:02:05.850> even<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.149> myself<00:02:06.329> because<00:02:06.810> it's

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
a mystery even to myself because it's

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.180 
a mystery even to myself because it's
just<00:02:07.259> not<00:02:07.380> something<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.770> i<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:07.860> think

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
just not something that i really think

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.350 
just not something that i really think
about<00:02:08.340> too<00:02:08.640> often<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.209> had<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
about too often but if I had to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.940 
about too often but if I had to

out<00:02:23.650> story<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:24.160> get<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.310> lot<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.460> views<00:02:24.670> but<00:02:24.790> I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
out story to get a lot of views but I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.970 
out story to get a lot of views but I
really<00:02:25.060> didn't<00:02:25.270> think<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.750> that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
really didn't think that it was that

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.590 
really didn't think that it was that
interesting<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.160> be<00:02:27.280> honest<00:02:27.550> because<00:02:28.330> it's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
interesting to be honest because it's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.300 
interesting to be honest because it's
not<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.870> answer<00:02:29.020> people<00:02:29.500> want<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.890> don't<00:02:29.950> think

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
not the answer people want I don't think

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.860 
not the answer people want I don't think
anyway<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.820> was<00:02:30.850> for<00:02:30.940> things<00:02:31.300> about<00:02:31.450> me<00:02:31.660> yes

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
anyway that was for things about me yes

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.030 
anyway that was for things about me yes
I<00:02:31.990> know<00:02:32.020> some<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.380> them<00:02:32.560> are<00:02:32.650> quite<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.860> bit

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
I know some of them are quite a bit

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.260 
I know some of them are quite a bit
stranger<00:02:33.340> than<00:02:33.490> others<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.120> what

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
stranger than others but that's what

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.580 
stranger than others but that's what
makes<00:02:34.420> me<00:02:34.510> up<00:02:34.630> as<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.810> person<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.320> think<00:02:35.500> it's

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
makes me up as a person and I think it's

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.900 
makes me up as a person and I think it's
really<00:02:35.830> important<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.280> remember<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.610> the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
really important to remember that the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.220

and I don't know what that is yet i'm

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.630 
and I don't know what that is yet i'm
not<00:03:11.320> going<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.500> use<00:03:11.590> my<00:03:11.620> usual<00:03:12.280> sign<00:03:12.489> off

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640
