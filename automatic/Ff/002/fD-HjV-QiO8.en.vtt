00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
the development of muscle mass like i

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.370 
the development of muscle mass like i
said<00:01:46.789> earlier<00:01:46.819> strength<00:01:47.630> or<00:01:47.899> like<00:01:48.049> this<00:01:48.200> shit

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
said earlier strength or like this shit

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.990 
said earlier strength or like this shit
right<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:48.649> without<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.979> starts<00:01:49.250> wrong<00:01:49.429> you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
right so without the starts wrong you

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
right so without the starts wrong you
pretty<00:01:50.450> much<00:01:50.539> fucked<00:01:50.899> right<00:01:51.170> because<00:01:51.439> women

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
pretty much fucked right because women

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.109 
pretty much fucked right because women
have<00:01:51.740> growth<00:01:52.039> hormone<00:01:52.429> women<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.819> answered

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
have growth hormone women have answered

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.429 
have growth hormone women have answered
women<00:01:53.299> have<00:01:53.450> all<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.600> other<00:01:53.780> hormones<00:01:54.200> that

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
women have all the other hormones that

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.370 
women have all the other hormones that
we<00:01:55.249> must<00:01:55.459> have<00:01:55.789> but<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:56.719> biggest<00:01:56.929> difference

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
we must have but the biggest difference

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.580 
we must have but the biggest difference
is<00:01:57.530> they<00:01:57.740> have<00:01:57.859> a<00:01:57.890> lot<00:01:58.869> less<00:01:59.869> testosterone<00:02:00.079> in

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
is they have a lot less testosterone in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.959 
is they have a lot less testosterone in
us<00:02:00.709> and<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.039> makes<00:02:01.219> a<00:02:01.280> big<00:02:01.310> difference<00:02:01.520> right

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
us and that makes a big difference right

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.069 
us and that makes a big difference right
so<00:02:02.209> even<00:02:02.390> if<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.509> have<00:02:02.599> a<00:02:02.630> lot<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:02.899> growth

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
so even if you have a lot of growth

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.830 
so even if you have a lot of growth
hormone<00:02:03.409> your<00:02:03.920> Chi<00:02:04.099> levels<00:02:04.399> are<00:02:04.490> not<00:02:04.609> there<00:02:04.880> he

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
hormone your Chi levels are not there he

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.929 
hormone your Chi levels are not there he
pretty<00:02:06.020> much<00:02:06.109> fuck<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:07.159> also<00:02:07.549> surprised<00:02:07.819> the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
pretty much fuck and also surprised the

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.279 
pretty much fuck and also surprised the
three<00:02:08.149> ways<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.450> increase<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.869> obviously<00:02:09.170> no

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
three ways to increase it obviously no

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.350
