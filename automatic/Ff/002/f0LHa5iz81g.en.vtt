from buh-bye and this is the YJ link on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.939 
from buh-bye and this is the YJ link on
the<00:00:13.740> cube<00:00:14.009> with<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.429> round<00:00:16.310> is<00:00:17.310> around<00:00:18.890> how<00:00:19.890> do

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the cube with the round is around how do

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.929 
the cube with the round is around how do
you<00:00:20.100> call<00:00:20.310> these<00:00:20.430> things<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:22.640> want<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> say

sticker<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.960> called<00:00:25.230> stickers

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.679 

interesting

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
interesting

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.340 
interesting
I<00:00:30.920> bought<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> cube<00:00:32.510> not<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I bought this cube not because I want to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
I bought this cube not because I want to
speed<00:00:34.770> cube<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.340> anything<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.940> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
speed cube with anything like this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
speed cube with anything like this
because<00:00:36.950> there<00:00:37.950> isn't<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.850> logical<00:00:39.800> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
because there isn't it's not logical but

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.139 
because there isn't it's not logical but
I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.090> might<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.750> interesting<00:00:42.930> for

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
I think this might be interesting for

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.430 
I think this might be interesting for
for<00:00:46.129> learning<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.430> look<00:00:47.670> ahead<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.440> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
for learning to look ahead because you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
for learning to look ahead because you
have<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> focus<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.219> hard<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.910> what

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
have to focus really hard to see what

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.389 
have to focus really hard to see what
you're<00:00:51.480> doing

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
you're doing

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
you're doing
let's<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.660> size<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:59.690> she

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
let's look at the size this is a she

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.609 
let's look at the size this is a she
long<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.370> it's<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.609> same<00:01:03.000> size<00:01:03.329> only<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
long and it's about same size only the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
long and it's about same size only the
tiles<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:07.040> making<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.430> cube<00:01:08.700> larger<00:01:09.830> yeah<00:01:11.840> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
tiles are making the cube larger yeah I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
tiles are making the cube larger yeah I
believe<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.159> box<00:01:14.369> says<00:01:14.640> 58<00:01:15.570> millimeters<00:01:19.520> no

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
believe the box says 58 millimeters no

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
believe the box says 58 millimeters no
it<00:01:20.640> doesn't<00:01:20.939> say<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.540> has<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.990> picture<00:01:22.470> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it doesn't say it has the picture of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.010 
it doesn't say it has the picture of
Felix<00:01:24.200> pretty<00:01:25.200> cool<00:01:26.570> normally<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.630> throw<00:01:27.930> away

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
Felix pretty cool normally I throw away

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
Felix pretty cool normally I throw away
the<00:01:28.229> boxes<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.100> gonna<00:01:29.310> keep<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.700> one

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the boxes but I'm gonna keep this one

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.920 
the boxes but I'm gonna keep this one
because<00:01:30.210> Felix<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> let's<00:01:33.600> take<00:01:33.689> a

because Felix is on it so let's take a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
because Felix is on it so let's take a
look<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.420> play

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
look at the play

indent<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:34.510> speed<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.650> oolong<00:02:36.040> doesn't

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
indent for speed this oolong doesn't

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.260 
indent for speed this oolong doesn't
have<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:38.160> yatch<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.400> about<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.880> same

yeah
well<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.900> my<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.410> long<00:02:47.650> very<00:02:48.069> very<00:02:48.190> much<00:02:48.640> so

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
well I like my so long very very much so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.210 
well I like my so long very very much so
I<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:52.030> high<00:02:52.780> hopes<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.680> cube<00:02:54.010> will

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
I have high hopes that this cube will

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:03.120 
I have high hopes that this cube will
turn<00:02:54.430> very<00:02:54.970> well<00:02:56.250> yeah<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.670> dry<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:02.560> feels<00:03:02.890> so

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
turn very well yeah it's dry it feels so

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.500 
turn very well yeah it's dry it feels so
funny<00:03:03.370> because<00:03:03.640> they're<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.480> rounded<00:03:05.370> pieces

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
funny because they're the rounded pieces

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.340 
funny because they're the rounded pieces
on<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.660> cube<00:03:08.910> makes<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.180> feel<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:10.989> if<00:03:11.200> you

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
on the cube makes it feel as if you

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.900 
on the cube makes it feel as if you
don't<00:03:11.560> have<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.830> cube<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.340> your<00:03:12.489> hand<00:03:12.670> but

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
don't have a cube in your hand but

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.490 
don't have a cube in your hand but
something<00:03:13.480> completely<00:03:13.959> different

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
something completely different

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:24.660 
something completely different
so<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.280> don't<00:03:16.239> know<00:03:16.360> how<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.540> describe<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:23.670> it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
so I don't know how to describe it it

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.590 
so I don't know how to describe it it
turns<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.330> same<00:03:25.540> as<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:30.120> need<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.420> loop

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
turns the same as so on I need to loop

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:46.920 
turns the same as so on I need to loop
this<00:03:31.810> thing<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:33.430> very<00:03:33.640> dry

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:58.770 

let<00:03:47.709> me<00:03:47.829> get<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.129> timer<00:03:48.640> on<00:03:50.819> start<00:03:51.819> my<00:03:51.970> computer

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:52.140 

let's<00:04:41.750> start<00:04:42.020> over

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:33.930 

yeah<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:53.449> is<00:04:53.599> fun<00:04:54.190> one<00:04:55.190> more

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.189 

man<00:05:34.940> this<00:05:35.180> is<00:05:35.330> tough<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:37.720> simply<00:05:38.720> do<00:05:38.990> not

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
man this is tough I simply do not

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.820 
man this is tough I simply do not
recognize<00:05:39.800> which<00:05:40.550> oli<00:05:41.120> have<00:05:41.539> for<00:05:41.810> which<00:05:42.080> PLL<00:05:42.680> I

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
recognize which oli have for which PLL I

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:54.540 
recognize which oli have for which PLL I
have<00:05:43.690> I'm<00:05:44.690> just<00:05:44.780> doing<00:05:45.319> something<00:05:51.880> 35<00:05:52.880> seconds

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
have I'm just doing something 35 seconds

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.790 
have I'm just doing something 35 seconds
well<00:05:55.550> this<00:05:55.789> cube<00:05:56.030> is<00:05:56.150> fun<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.630> can<00:05:57.020> tell<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:57.470> it

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
well this cube is fun I can tell and it

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.070 
well this cube is fun I can tell and it
really<00:05:58.009> will<00:05:58.580> help<00:05:58.639> me<00:05:58.970> training<00:05:59.780> look<00:05:59.930> ahead

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
really will help me training look ahead

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.790 
really will help me training look ahead
because<00:06:01.000> it's<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:02.180> hard<00:06:02.419> to<00:06:02.690> identify<00:06:03.440> the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
because it's so hard to identify the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.260 
because it's so hard to identify the
colors<00:06:04.900> so<00:06:05.900> yeah<00:06:06.560> for<00:06:07.009> this<00:06:07.340> this<00:06:07.520> cube<00:06:08.030> cost

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
colors so yeah for this this cube cost

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.439 
colors so yeah for this this cube cost
maybe<00:06:08.479> $5<00:06:09.129> so<00:06:10.129> I<00:06:10.159> think<00:06:10.490> it's<00:06:10.819> well<00:06:11.030> spent<00:06:11.360> for

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
maybe $5 so I think it's well spent for

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.330 
maybe $5 so I think it's well spent for
training<00:06:12.319> cube<00:06:13.060> so<00:06:14.440> that's<00:06:15.440> all<00:06:15.620> thanks<00:06:16.280> for

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
training cube so that's all thanks for

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.729 
training cube so that's all thanks for
watching
