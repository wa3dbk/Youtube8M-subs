one so with all that mixture you're
going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> need<00:01:06.539> to<00:01:06.690> whisk<00:01:06.929> that<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.289> now<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
going to need to whisk that up now I

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.620 
going to need to whisk that up now I
would<00:01:07.890> fold<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.399> in<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> spoon<00:01:08.940> firstly<00:01:09.509> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
would fold it in with a spoon firstly so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.960 
would fold it in with a spoon firstly so
you<00:01:09.690> don't<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:09.990> cocoa<00:01:10.410> powder<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
you don't get cocoa powder and

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.999 
you don't get cocoa powder and
granulated<00:01:11.970> sugar<00:01:12.000> flying<00:01:12.539> everywhere<00:01:13.009> and

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
granulated sugar flying everywhere and

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.980 
granulated sugar flying everywhere and
once<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.700> mixture<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.060> sort<00:01:15.300> of<00:01:15.390> moist<00:01:15.720> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
once the mixture is sort of moist you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
once the mixture is sort of moist you
can<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.410> in<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.709> the<00:01:16.800> whisk<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.250> will<00:01:17.490> be

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
can then go in with the whisk it will be

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.980 
can then go in with the whisk it will be
quite<00:01:18.000> firm<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.420> solid<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.990> don't

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
quite firm and solid but do not don't

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.510 
quite firm and solid but do not don't
worry<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.319> that<00:01:22.649> too<00:01:22.830> much<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.190> will<00:01:23.340> come

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
worry about that too much it will come

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
worry about that too much it will come
together<00:01:23.700> eventually<00:01:24.179> we<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.660> it<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.899> be

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
together eventually we want it to be

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
together eventually we want it to be
quite<00:01:25.229> gooey<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.670> would<00:01:26.819> recommend<00:01:26.970> doing

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
quite gooey and I would recommend doing

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
quite gooey and I would recommend doing
on<00:01:27.630> your<00:01:27.780> lowest<00:01:28.080> setting<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.739> your<00:01:28.800> whisk

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
on your lowest setting on your whisk

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.559 
on your lowest setting on your whisk
because<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.429> can<00:01:29.580> see<00:01:29.789> here<00:01:30.030> we've<00:01:30.179> got<00:01:30.330> ours

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
because you can see here we've got ours

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.139 
because you can see here we've got ours
on<00:01:30.690> number<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.550> be<00:01:32.700> scared<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.000> add

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
on number one so don't be scared to add

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.910 
on number one so don't be scared to add
a<00:01:33.179> little<00:01:33.420> water<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:34.110> ten<00:01:34.410> mil<00:01:34.649> to<00:01:34.800> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
a little water about ten mil to the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
a little water about ten mil to the
mixture<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.489> the<00:01:35.610> whisk<00:01:35.819> becomes<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.899> firm

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
mixture if the whisk becomes so firm

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.559 
mixture if the whisk becomes so firm
that<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> won't<00:01:37.709> turn<00:01:37.950> anymore<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
that it won't turn anymore and you

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:40.760 
that it won't turn anymore and you
should<00:01:39.720> end<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.929> with<00:01:39.989> a<00:01:40.110> mixture<00:01:40.410> that<00:01:40.619> looks

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
should end up with a mixture that looks

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.979 
should end up with a mixture that looks
like<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.300> course<00:01:42.360> you've<00:01:42.780> got

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:42.989 
like this and then of course you've got

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:45.650 
like this and then of course you've got
your<00:01:43.229> white<00:01:43.709> fluffy<00:01:44.160> egg<00:01:44.459> whites<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.119> we're

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
your white fluffy egg whites and we're

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.380 
your white fluffy egg whites and we're
now<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> spoon<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.800> bit<00:01:47.550> by<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:47.759> into

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
now going to spoon this bit by bit into

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
now going to spoon this bit by bit into
the<00:01:48.509> mixture<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.170> we're<00:01:49.349> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> fold<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
the mixture and we're going to fold it
in<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.489> it<00:01:50.940> all<00:01:51.119> combines<00:01:51.360> together<00:01:53.569> so<00:01:54.569> as<00:01:54.690> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
in so it all combines together so as you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.290 
in so it all combines together so as you
can<00:01:54.959> see<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.190> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.700> doubled<00:01:57.179> in

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
can see there it's kind of doubled in

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.859 
can see there it's kind of doubled in
quantity<00:01:58.129> it's<00:01:59.129> become<00:01:59.580> quite<00:02:00.119> mousse<00:02:00.509> like

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
in texture and it's just a bit of a

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.600 
in texture and it's just a bit of a
labor<00:02:03.929> of<00:02:04.080> love<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.679> know<00:02:04.800> just<00:02:05.069> gently

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.160 
folding the mixture in so as not to
knock<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.679> air<00:02:07.830> out<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.280> egg<00:02:08.369> whites<00:02:09.170> and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
knock the air out of the egg whites and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.750 
knock the air out of the egg whites and
this<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.500> what's<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.190> make<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.550> really

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
this is what's going to make it really

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.930 
this is what's going to make it really
sort<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.980> rise<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.879> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
sort of rise up and then you're going to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.580 
sort of rise up and then you're going to
have<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.239> gooeyness<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.810> all<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.110> chocolate

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
have the gooeyness of all that chocolate

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.589 
have the gooeyness of all that chocolate
mixture<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:17.550> mixed<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.360> well

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
mixture that we mixed in there as well

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.780 
mixture that we mixed in there as well
so<00:02:19.410> we're<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:19.859> continue<00:02:20.040> folding

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so we're just going to continue folding

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.369 
so we're just going to continue folding
that<00:02:20.879> in<00:02:21.000> until<00:02:21.269> we<00:02:21.359> can<00:02:21.540> see<00:02:21.719> no<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:22.140> wife
