maturing<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:46.280> individual<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.820> thought

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
maturing as individual and I thought

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.590 
maturing as individual and I thought
honestly<00:01:48.480> it<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.460> best<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.150> done

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
honestly it was best to get that done

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.380 
honestly it was best to get that done
and<00:01:51.840> out<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.470> way<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.090> didn't<00:01:54.300> have

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and out of the way so they didn't have

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.050 
and out of the way so they didn't have
to<00:01:54.540> play<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.050> contract<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:56.610> him<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.940> be

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to play for a contract I want him to be

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.680 
to play for a contract I want him to be
a<00:01:57.510> great<00:01:58.080> player<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:59.490> really<00:01:59.820> fit<00:02:00.180> within<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
a great player to really fit within a

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.720 
a great player to really fit within a
team<00:02:00.930> environment<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.010> I<00:02:02.100> think<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
team environment and I think that was a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.330 
team environment and I think that was a
smart<00:02:03.060> move<00:02:03.650> kearney<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:06.830> xrd<00:02:07.830> couple<00:02:08.220> has
