I<00:05:03.180> think<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.860> think<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:06.070> works<00:05:06.280> so<00:05:06.640> we<00:05:06.760> found

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
I think I think that works so we found

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.540 
I think I think that works so we found
the<00:05:08.470> beer<00:05:09.720> he<00:05:10.720> was<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.350> little<00:05:11.710> over<00:05:11.920> 50<00:05:12.280> yards

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
away a little bit a little bit worse for

away a little bit a little bit worse for
the<00:05:16.240> wear<00:05:16.440> but<00:05:17.440> all<00:05:18.130> in<00:05:18.310> all<00:05:18.430> I<00:05:18.700> i<00:05:18.820> think<00:05:19.360> the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
the wear but all in all I i think the

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.330 
the wear but all in all I i think the
bail<00:05:19.600> lives<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.050> mean<00:05:20.290> it's<00:05:20.440> all<00:05:20.590> still<00:05:20.860> pretty

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340
