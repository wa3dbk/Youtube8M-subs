is the precision and prestige he brought

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.980 
is the precision and prestige he brought
to<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.200> hacker<00:01:31.090> they<00:01:32.090> used<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.360> do<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.840> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
to the hacker they used to do it in the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.840 
to the hacker they used to do it in the
olden<00:01:33.320> days<00:01:33.350> back<00:01:33.740> in<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.920> seventies<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.730> and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
olden days back in the seventies and and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.420 
olden days back in the seventies and and
years<00:01:35.390> before<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.070> think<00:01:37.280> they'd

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
years before that and I think they'd

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.760 
years before that and I think they'd
done<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.730> half<00:01:38.210> pie<00:01:38.510> as<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.230> say<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.680> they

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
done a half pie as you say and they

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.930 
done a half pie as you say and they
didn't<00:01:40.100> really<00:01:40.280> know<00:01:40.490> what<00:01:40.610> they<00:01:40.790> were<00:01:40.850> doing

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
didn't really know what they were doing

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.220 
didn't really know what they were doing
and<00:01:41.480> I<00:01:42.070> think<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.820> know<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.780> didn't<00:01:45.110> look

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
and I think that you know it didn't look

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.820 
and I think that you know it didn't look
good<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:47.510> education<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:48.320> many<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.710> our

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
good but the education to many of our

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.520 
good but the education to many of our
European<00:01:49.540> mates<00:01:50.540> in<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.810> team<00:01:51.110> was<00:01:51.500> just

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
European mates in the team was just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.770 
European mates in the team was just
educating<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:52.640> what<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.910> was<00:01:53.030> all<00:01:53.150> about<00:01:53.300> and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
educating and what it was all about and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.230 
educating and what it was all about and
to<00:01:53.990> know<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.140> little<00:01:54.350> bit<00:01:54.440> more<00:01:54.680> about<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.280> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
to know a little bit more about it and I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.000 
to know a little bit more about it and I
think<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.050> just<00:01:57.140> one<00:01:57.350> growing<00:01:57.800> bigger

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
think that it's just one growing bigger

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.160 
think that it's just one growing bigger
and<00:01:58.190> bigger<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.760> it's<00:01:59.060> something<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.510> we

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
