00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.610
 health and dear friends and well Spaziogames 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.150
 find yourself on our calendar 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.820
 of advent today is December 16 sant 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.980
 adelaide empress we had obviously 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.449
 thought of the Roman emperors but ne 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.390
 we talked a lot recently therefore 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.150
 we had to change the subject 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.730
 medieval emperors this leads us to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.630
 advise you cibali medieval warfare 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.780
 title that was born as a mode for half 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.020
 life 2 with the title of age of chivalry 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.420
 and after that it became a title in itself 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.610
 therefore disconnected from the world of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.309
 mod of half life 2 is the result 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.370
 was quite interesting first 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.739
 what fathers there goes is a game in which 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.989
 you play a knight and get caught 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.930
 kill other knights in first 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.480
 multiplayer person exclusively 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.420
 multiplayer and mainly focused 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.460
 on mini fighting then with swords 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.070
 maces and anything else obviously there are 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.720
 even remote weapons there is the possibility 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.060
 to throw the boiling oil to use the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.890
 catapults however we say in general the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.470
 core of the experience and the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.470
 close combat the title is 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.720
 very very much fun for various 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.909
 reasons both amusement fighting is 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.830
 a physical combat in the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.100
 which clashes a lot you push yourself 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.290
 so let's say this component is 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.650
 one of the one of the elements one of the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.130
 But the founding pillars of the game are there 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.960
 amuses also because of disagreements 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.509
 created in the development phase because the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 title is far from perfect there are 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.500
 of the bugs that were very successful 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.040
 hilarious and have not been corrected 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.990
 this repeat is part of the experience e 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.049
 we laugh so much it's not a game 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.490
 born and raised to be ridiculous 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.310
 quite another game that it also maintains 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.399
 let us say a certain tone of seriousness 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.950
 that these problems have helped us 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.350
 to make it even more fun 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.280
 so it's a game we often recommend 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.140
 we find it 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:15.400
 in discount on the various online retailers such as 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.590
 steam also the old paradox plaza can 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.660
 very often offer this game of gods 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.300
 really ridiculous prices experience 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.280
 multiplayer that offers repeat is a lot 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.670
 very fun then a game 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.680
 recommended with the saint of the day is 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.180
