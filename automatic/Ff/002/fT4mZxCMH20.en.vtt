lack of grip to knowing since we're us

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.120 
lack of grip to knowing since we're us
we're<00:02:28.660> trying<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.049> pull<00:02:29.260> out<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.650> stand-ups

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
we're trying to pull out like stand-ups

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.130 
we're trying to pull out like stand-ups
on<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.459> thing<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.880> your<00:02:31.420> feet<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:31.840> kind<00:02:32.110> of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
on this thing and your feet just kind of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.380 
on this thing and your feet just kind of
slip<00:02:32.410> off<00:02:32.590> if<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.980> get<00:02:33.130> more<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.670> wheelers

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
slip off if you get more the wheelers

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.660 
slip off if you get more the wheelers
grip<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.750> hell<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.130> kind<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.430> get<00:02:36.519> more

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
grip like hell so you kind of get more

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.460 
grip like hell so you kind of get more
traction<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.180> row<00:02:37.360> than<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.720> do

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
traction on a row than you do

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.550 
traction on a row than you do
yeah<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.820> one<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> great<00:02:41.200> things<00:02:41.470> about

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
yeah the one of the great things about

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.250 
yeah the one of the great things about
it<00:02:41.800> being<00:02:41.950> plastic<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.090> since<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.110> is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
it being plastic is that since it is

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.710 
it being plastic is that since it is
plastic<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.250> know<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.820> can<00:02:46.090> take<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.330> huge

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
plastic and you know it can take a huge

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320 
plastic and you know it can take a huge
breathing<00:02:47.200> you're<00:02:47.380> not<00:02:47.560> as<00:02:47.710> afraid<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.340> try<00:02:49.270> to

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
breathing you're not as afraid to try to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.860 
breathing you're not as afraid to try to
learn<00:02:49.570> new<00:02:49.810> stuff<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.410> because<00:02:50.770> it's<00:02:50.980> not

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
learn new stuff on it because it's not

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.210 
learn new stuff on it because it's not
you<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.990> you're<00:02:53.020> not<00:02:53.290> afraid<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.680> beating<00:02:54.100> it

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
you know you're not afraid of beating it

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
you know you're not afraid of beating it
up<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.460> much<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:57.430> yeah<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.790> lack<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.000> the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
up as much the yeah the lack of the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.450 
up as much the yeah the lack of the
group<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.600> definitely<00:02:59.140> kind<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.440> an<00:02:59.500> issue<00:02:59.650> one

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
group is definitely kind of an issue one

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.700 
group is definitely kind of an issue one
of<00:03:00.580> my<00:03:00.730> favorite<00:03:01.420> parts<00:03:01.720> about<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.200> though<00:03:02.440> is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
of my favorite parts about it though is

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.420 
of my favorite parts about it though is
is<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.780> grip<00:03:04.990> of<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.170> wheels<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:05.770> Mac<00:03:06.010> said

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
is the grip of the wheels like Mac said

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.620 
is the grip of the wheels like Mac said
because<00:03:07.360> um<00:03:08.250> since<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.400> got<00:03:09.550> 3-inch<00:03:09.970> trucks

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
because um since it's got 3-inch trucks

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.720 
because um since it's got 3-inch trucks
and<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.740> really<00:03:11.950> soft<00:03:12.370> bushings<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:15.310> super

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
and just really soft bushings it's super

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.500 
and just really soft bushings it's super
nimble<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.940> grip<00:03:19.240> from<00:03:19.450> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
nimble and the just a grip from the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.390 
nimble and the just a grip from the
wheels<00:03:19.870> give<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.380> gives<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> confidence

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
wheels give you gives you the confidence

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.580 
wheels give you gives you the confidence
you<00:03:21.790> need<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.120> ride<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.510> super<00:03:23.020> aggressively

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
you need to ride it super aggressively

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.880 
you need to ride it super aggressively
and<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.940> it's<00:03:25.240> just<00:03:25.570> it's<00:03:25.990> an<00:03:26.140> awesome<00:03:26.320> order

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
and so it's just it's an awesome order

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.740 
and so it's just it's an awesome order
just<00:03:27.070> riding<00:03:27.459> really<00:03:27.760> really<00:03:28.180> aggressively

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
just riding really really aggressively

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.030 
just riding really really aggressively
my<00:03:29.650> least<00:03:29.950> favorite<00:03:30.490> part<00:03:31.650> I'll<00:03:32.650> probably

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
my least favorite part I'll probably

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.550 
my least favorite part I'll probably
have<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.580> say<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.330> either<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.640> bearings

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.539 

wynberg<00:03:44.200> probably<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.290> bearings<00:03:45.769> simply

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
wynberg probably the bearings simply

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.420 
wynberg probably the bearings simply
because<00:03:46.849> they're<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.180> back<00:03:47.450> threes<00:03:47.870> which

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
because they're a back threes which

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.509 
because they're a back threes which
isn't<00:03:49.430> bad<00:03:49.489> but<00:03:49.999> it<00:03:50.420> stopped<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:52.219> you

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
isn't bad but it stopped you just you

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.619 
isn't bad but it stopped you just you
don't<00:03:52.549> hold<00:03:52.879> out<00:03:53.060> your<00:03:53.120> speed<00:03:53.569> is<00:03:53.599> on<00:03:53.900> but<00:03:54.290> I

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
don't hold out your speed is on but I

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.759 
don't hold out your speed is on but I
don't<00:03:56.629> think<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:57.079> board<00:03:57.379> could<00:03:57.560> really

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
don't think this board could really

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.530 
don't think this board could really
handle<00:03:57.980> anything<00:03:58.430> more<00:03:58.879> than<00:03:59.030> an<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.299> back

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
handle anything more than an a back

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.959 
handle anything more than an a back
three<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:03.530> got<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.739> be<00:04:03.799> really<00:04:04.099> aware<00:04:04.219> of<00:04:04.489> like

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:04.969 
three you got to be really aware of like

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.199 
three you got to be really aware of like
your<00:04:05.299> balance<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.049> footing<00:04:06.760> otherwise<00:04:07.760> he'll

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
your balance and footing otherwise he'll

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.720 
your balance and footing otherwise he'll
off<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:09.829> don't<00:04:10.010> know<00:04:10.129> where<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.459> could<00:04:10.609> be

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
off you don't know where you could be

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.990 
off you don't know where you could be
going<00:04:10.939> with<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:12.069> what<00:04:13.069> happens<00:04:13.400> lives<00:04:13.669> like

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
going with it what happens lives like

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.779 
going with it what happens lives like
you'll<00:04:14.329> jump<00:04:14.359> on<00:04:14.900> they<00:04:15.769> notice<00:04:16.130> miss<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.579> tail

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
you'll jump on they notice miss the tail

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.689 
you'll jump on they notice miss the tail
completely<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.349> let<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:18.979> jump<00:04:19.220> on<00:04:19.430> your

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
completely and so let you jump on your

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.159 
completely and so let you jump on your
back<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:20.090> just<00:04:20.239> hits<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.509> ground<00:04:20.720> your<00:04:20.959> front

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
back it just hits the ground your front

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.420 
back it just hits the ground your front
puts<00:04:21.320> on<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.530> board<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:21.979> get<00:04:22.099> like<00:04:22.130> these

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
puts on the board and you get like these

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.370 
puts on the board and you get like these
really<00:04:22.580> bad<00:04:22.789> splits<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.449> before<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.139> Ryan

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
really bad splits and before the Ryan

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.620 
really bad splits and before the Ryan
off<00:04:24.590> um<00:04:24.919> yeah<00:04:25.580> one<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.090> things<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.449> don't

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
off um yeah one of the things I don't

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.939 
off um yeah one of the things I don't
think<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.900> lot<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.080> people<00:04:27.229> know<00:04:27.560> about<00:04:27.590> the

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
think a lot of people know about the

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.400 
think a lot of people know about the
board<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.780> you're<00:04:29.780> supposed<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.110> put<00:04:30.229> one

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
board is that you're supposed to put one

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.990 
board is that you're supposed to put one
foot<00:04:30.650> up<00:04:30.800> here<00:04:31.039> but<00:04:31.190> then<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.430> other<00:04:31.610> one<00:04:31.699> goes

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
foot up here but then the other one goes

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.900 
foot up here but then the other one goes
on<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.449> tail<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.199> that<00:04:34.009> just<00:04:34.220> allows<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.789> to

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
on the tail and that just allows you to

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.089 
on the tail and that just allows you to
apply<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.449> lot<00:04:35.840> more<00:04:36.050> leverage<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.919> back

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
apply a lot more leverage to the back

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.909 
apply a lot more leverage to the back
end<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:37.610> it's<00:04:37.840> just<00:04:38.840> super<00:04:39.139> nimble<00:04:39.470> yeah<00:04:39.800> and

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
end so it's just super nimble yeah and

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.680 
end so it's just super nimble yeah and
it<00:04:40.009> feels<00:04:40.039> a<00:04:40.250> lot<00:04:40.340> more<00:04:40.400> surfy<00:04:41.270> when<00:04:41.449> you<00:04:41.539> write

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
it feels a lot more surfy when you write
