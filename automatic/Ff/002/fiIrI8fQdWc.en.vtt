burn what we'll do is let it burn all
the<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.669> when<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> bottom<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the way when we get to the bottom and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.940 
the way when we get to the bottom and
I'll<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.110> why<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.890> second

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
I'll show you why here in just a second

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.440 
I'll show you why here in just a second
the<00:00:37.950> stove<00:00:38.160> begins<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.550> ran<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> fuel<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the stove begins we ran out of fuel the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.069 
the stove begins we ran out of fuel the
layer<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.920> plastic<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> outside<00:00:42.180> begins

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
layer of plastic on the outside begins

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.840 
layer of plastic on the outside begins
to<00:00:43.290> turn<00:00:43.590> soft<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> good<00:00:44.550> thing<00:00:44.610> we

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to turn soft and that's a good thing we

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.069 
to turn soft and that's a good thing we
need<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> out<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:45.989> I'll

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
need to get that out of there so I'll

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
need to get that out of there so I'll
just<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> small<00:00:46.860> screwdriver<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.789> pry<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
just use a small screwdriver to pry that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.940 
just use a small screwdriver to pry that
out<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> that'll<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.320> give<00:00:49.620> us<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
out and that'll actually give us just a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
out and that'll actually give us just a
little<00:00:49.980> bit<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.460> room<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:51.000> fuel<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
little bit more room for fuel in the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
little bit more room for fuel in the
future

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.609 

so<00:01:04.420> this<00:01:04.570> little<00:01:04.869> small<00:01:05.080> stud<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.439> we'll<00:01:05.560> be

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
so this little small stud that we'll be

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.980 
so this little small stud that we'll be
using<00:01:05.799> is<00:01:06.100> gonna<00:01:06.250> need<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.759> stand<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.689> put<00:01:07.869> the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
using is gonna need a stand to put the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.389 
using is gonna need a stand to put the
pot<00:01:08.290> on<00:01:08.320> or<00:01:08.649> whatever<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:09.009> is<00:01:09.100> you<00:01:09.220> have<00:01:09.310> the

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
pot on or whatever it is you have the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.560 
pot on or whatever it is you have the
cup<00:01:09.580> or<00:01:09.729> whatever<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:10.060> is<00:01:10.149> you're<00:01:10.299> placing

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
cup or whatever it is you're placing

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.850 
cup or whatever it is you're placing
over<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.810> flame<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.229> I<00:01:11.259> just<00:01:11.439> use<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.619> couple

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
over the flame so I just use a couple

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.070 
over the flame so I just use a couple
bottle<00:01:12.670> tops<00:01:12.909> here<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.330> I<00:01:13.360> have<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.570> mason

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
bottle tops here and then I have a mason

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.649 
bottle tops here and then I have a mason
jar<00:01:14.110> lid<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:15.159> drilled<00:01:15.909> holes<00:01:16.090> into<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.479> side

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
jar lid that drilled holes into the side

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.749 
jar lid that drilled holes into the side
and<00:01:17.439> that<00:01:17.710> allow<00:01:17.920> even<00:01:18.250> more<00:01:18.430> air<00:01:18.610> to

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
and that allow even more air to

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.370 
and that allow even more air to
circulate<00:01:18.970> around<00:01:19.240> there<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.020> come<00:01:20.229> up

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
circulate around there and to come up

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.800 
circulate around there and to come up
underneath<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:21.180> bottle<00:01:22.180> caps<00:01:22.360> additional

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
underneath the bottle caps additional

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.179 
underneath the bottle caps additional
bottle<00:01:23.020> caps<00:01:23.200> will<00:01:23.380> allow<00:01:23.530> air<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.860> come<00:01:24.039> up

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
bottle caps will allow air to come up

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.260 
bottle caps will allow air to come up
underneath<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.759> make<00:01:24.789> sure<00:01:24.970> there's<00:01:25.210> plenty

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
underneath to make sure there's plenty

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.670 
underneath to make sure there's plenty
of<00:01:25.450> oxygen<00:01:25.960> for<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.170> flame<00:01:26.380> because<00:01:26.590> it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
of oxygen for the flame because it's

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.740 
of oxygen for the flame because it's
gonna<00:01:26.830> pick<00:01:27.430> up<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.610> lot<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.759> oxygen<00:01:27.970> consider

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
gonna pick up a lot of oxygen consider

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.570 
gonna pick up a lot of oxygen consider
and<00:01:28.899> how<00:01:29.140> small<00:01:29.679> of<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.860> space<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.310> in

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
and how small of a space that is in

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.340 
and how small of a space that is in
there<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:31.240> know<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.539> can<00:01:31.750> use<00:01:31.869> anything<00:01:32.110> for

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
there you know you can use anything for

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.109 
there you know you can use anything for
the<00:01:32.439> stand<00:01:32.710> just<00:01:32.979> let<00:01:33.130> your<00:01:33.280> imagination<00:01:33.880> go

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
the stand just let your imagination go

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:42.529 
the stand just let your imagination go
out<00:01:38.880> fill<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.030> all<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.270> way<00:01:40.360> up<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.780> top

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
out fill it all the way up to the top

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.789 
out fill it all the way up to the top
I'm<00:01:43.539> just<00:01:43.690> gonna<00:01:43.840> place<00:01:43.959> a<00:01:43.990> cup<00:01:44.259> of<00:01:44.380> water<00:01:44.530> over

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
I'm just gonna place a cup of water over

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.370 
I'm just gonna place a cup of water over
the<00:01:44.979> flame<00:01:48.810> another<00:01:49.810> thing<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.110> could<00:01:50.229> do<00:01:50.350> to

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
the flame another thing you could do to

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.559 
the flame another thing you could do to
decrease<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:51.130> burn<00:01:51.280> time<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.789> if<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.119> were<00:01:52.420> to

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
decrease the burn time is if you were to

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.149 
decrease the burn time is if you were to
actually<00:01:52.659> use<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.020> same<00:01:53.200> approaches<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.890> flip

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
actually use the same approaches to flip

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.430 
actually use the same approaches to flip
these<00:01:54.490> bottle<00:01:54.880> caps<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.330> are<00:01:55.390> as<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.750> stand<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
these bottle caps that are as a stand to

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.469 
these bottle caps that are as a stand to
turn<00:01:56.649> them<00:01:56.830> around<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:58.179> way<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.330> could

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
turn them around and that way you could

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.499 
turn them around and that way you could
fill<00:01:58.690> up<00:01:58.810> all<00:01:58.959> of<00:01:59.080> them<00:01:59.200> as<00:01:59.319> once<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.770> thereby

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
fill up all of them as once and thereby

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.639 
fill up all of them as once and thereby
increasing<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.810> amount<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.229> fuel<00:02:02.439> going

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
increasing the amount of fuel going

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.620 
increasing the amount of fuel going
straight<00:02:03.039> up<00:02:03.159> into<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.459> pot<00:02:04.179> did<00:02:04.420> whatever

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
straight up into the pot did whatever

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.380 
straight up into the pot did whatever
pot<00:02:04.929> you<00:02:05.080> decide<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.500> cook<00:02:05.649> on<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:10.030> just<00:02:10.060> had

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
pot you decide to cook on and I just had

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.630 
pot you decide to cook on and I just had
to<00:02:10.569> refill<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.620> bottle<00:02:11.890> cap<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.250> that's<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
to refill the bottle cap so that's the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.520 
to refill the bottle cap so that's the
second<00:02:13.030> time<00:02:13.120> it's<00:02:13.330> been<00:02:13.480> full<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.080> far<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.410> so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
second time it's been full so far and so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.020 
second time it's been full so far and so
far<00:02:14.709> about<00:02:14.890> maybe<00:02:15.220> three<00:02:15.489> or<00:02:15.550> four<00:02:15.760> minutes

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
far about maybe three or four minutes

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.940 
far about maybe three or four minutes
into<00:02:16.530> when<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:17.560> first<00:02:17.830> started

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.830 

the<00:02:24.950> whole<00:02:25.070> process<00:02:25.490> took<00:02:25.730> about<00:02:25.970> eight

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the whole process took about eight

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.370 
the whole process took about eight
minutes<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:28.160> bottle<00:02:29.120> cap<00:02:29.300> tops<00:02:29.660> not<00:02:30.170> too

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
minutes and for bottle cap tops not too

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.620 
minutes and for bottle cap tops not too
