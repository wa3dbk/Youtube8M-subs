there are two versions of the pink one
and<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> green<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.170> really<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
and the green one and I really like the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.990 
and the green one and I really like the
pink<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.389> rose<00:00:16.379> petals<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.850> it's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
pink one like the rose petals so it's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.050 
pink one like the rose petals so it's
the<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.930> got<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.890> album<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.760> book

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the one that I got this album is in book

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.529 
the one that I got this album is in book
form<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.289> front<00:00:22.830> has<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.130> title<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.789> boss

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
form the front has the title and boss

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.390 
form the front has the title and boss
it's<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.900> part<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.920> guess<00:00:26.160> there's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's just part one so I guess there's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.150 
it's just part one so I guess there's
another<00:00:26.699> mini<00:00:27.029> album<00:00:27.390> coming<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.109> soon<00:00:28.380> the
