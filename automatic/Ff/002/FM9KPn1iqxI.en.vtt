00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.697
Soon I'll arrive at Sam's house.

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:38.899
Looking at the scenery, you'd never
imagine that you're entering

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.694
one of the most important cities
in the world, London.

00:00:46.128 --> 00:00:48.259
And for a couple of days
I'll be seeing it from the inside,

00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:49.461
just as a Londoner sees it.

00:00:58.077 --> 00:01:00.443
The weather in London,
can change from rain to shine,

00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:02.884
several times a day,
and that's no joke.

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.326
Sam has invited me into his home
to live his life.

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.341
He's the editor of Breaks Magazine,

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:15.204
an online magazine 
about urban culture, skating and music.

00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:25.237
Oh, it looks like
he's left me a list.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.209
So what's he got lined up for me?

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:37.331
I'll pop into Pages of Hackney,

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.783
a mythical bookshop, where
you can get any book you want.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.618
I've bough one about benches,
which I've wanted for a while now:

00:01:42.653 --> 00:01:43.959
We Sit Together.

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:06.231
At last, I get to meet Sam's mates
from Breaks Magazine.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:10.721
This is Nate, a well-known musician
from the city's hip-hop scene.

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:12.811
And, the lads are preparing
an article about it.

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:21.280
They asked me if I could give them
a hand 

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:24.024
and take a few shots for the magazine.
How cool is that!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.797
As I've arranged to meet the guys
from Breaksmag for a barbecue,

00:02:32.832 --> 00:02:35.081
I'm off to Broadway Market
to do some shopping.

00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:40.960
Here you can find food
from all around the world,

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:43.026
and everything looks incredible.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.072
Everywhere you go, you find
something special to surprise you.

00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:53.665
London Fields is the only park
where you're allowed to barbecue.

00:03:03.237 --> 00:03:04.933
Off to the London Fields Brewery,

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:07.234
a place with a huge selection
of real ales.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.088
There's so much to try here,
that I don't know where to start.

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.741
I've spent one day in London,
and it feels like a week.

00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:42.857
And now I realise
how many different things

00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:44.309
you can do
in just one day

00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:47.416
working at a magazine like Breaks.
These guys are just the business.
