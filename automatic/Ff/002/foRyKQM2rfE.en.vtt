it moves into the fayetteville area now
this<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.969> latest<00:03:12.150> future<00:03:12.750> track<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.379> I

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
this is the latest future track and I

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.229 
this is the latest future track and I
think<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.919> is<00:03:13.980> under<00:03:14.669> doing<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
think this is under doing the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.719 
think this is under doing the
precipitation<00:03:15.989> sometimes<00:03:16.709> computer<00:03:17.340> models

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
precipitation sometimes computer models

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.580 
precipitation sometimes computer models
do<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.180> where<00:03:18.419> they<00:03:18.540> take<00:03:18.810> out<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.260> amount

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
do this where they take out the amount

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.009 
do this where they take out the amount
of<00:03:19.709> precipitation<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.419> is<00:03:21.599> definitely

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
of precipitation and that is definitely

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.140 
of precipitation and that is definitely
the<00:03:22.199> case<00:03:22.409> with<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:22.889> latest<00:03:23.129> computer<00:03:23.669> model

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
the case with this latest computer model

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.659 
the case with this latest computer model
I<00:03:24.329> don't<00:03:24.599> necessarily<00:03:24.810> believe<00:03:25.470> all<00:03:26.159> this<00:03:26.400> you

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
I don't necessarily believe all this you

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.909 
I don't necessarily believe all this you
can<00:03:26.819> see<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.120> lack<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.870> precip<00:03:28.650> through

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
can see this lack of precip through

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.189 
can see this lack of precip through
Northwest<00:03:29.250> Arkansas<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:30.599> just<00:03:30.959> doesn't
