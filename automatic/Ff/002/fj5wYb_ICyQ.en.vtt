00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.250 
more readily accessible bolt action
sniper<00:00:41.309> rifle<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> actually<00:00:43.110> more

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
sniper rifle and is it is actually more

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.430 
sniper rifle and is it is actually more
powerful<00:00:43.829> than<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.640> psu<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.719> jump<00:00:46.200> into

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
powerful than the psu one so jump into

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.290 
powerful than the psu one so jump into
the<00:00:46.559> statistics<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the statistics here because this is the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
the statistics here because this is the
sniper<00:00:48.600> rifle<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.440> game<00:00:49.620> doesn't<00:00:49.829> really

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sniper rifle this game doesn't really

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.760 
sniper rifle this game doesn't really
consider<00:00:50.460> recoil<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.090> fire<00:00:51.360> rate<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> be

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
consider recoil or fire rate to be

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.810 
consider recoil or fire rate to be
significant<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.890> sniper<00:00:53.160> rifles<00:00:53.489> apparently

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
significant on sniper rifles apparently

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630 
significant on sniper rifles apparently
so<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.510> damage<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> 93<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.460> five

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
so the damage is a 93 so this is five

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.880 
so the damage is a 93 so this is five
points<00:00:56.969> higher<00:00:57.120> than<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> psu<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.590> HK

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
points higher than the psu one or the HK

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.340 
points higher than the psu one or the HK
marksman<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.940> retains<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.660> perfect<00:01:01.020> one

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
marksman and it retains the perfect one

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950 
marksman and it retains the perfect one
100%<00:01:02.280> accuracy<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> sniper

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
100% accuracy because it's a sniper

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
100% accuracy because it's a sniper
rifle<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> same<00:01:05.610> animation

that though you can't get one shot it's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.139 
that though you can't get one shot it's
kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.829> strange<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.460> game<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.850> don't

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
kind of strange in this game I don't

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.300 
kind of strange in this game I don't
know<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.509> did<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.869> never<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.409> slept<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
know I did I never really slept all that

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.399 
know I did I never really slept all that
often<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> soldier's<00:01:51.600> front<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
often in a soldier's front one so I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.840 
often in a soldier's front one so I
can't<00:01:52.680> really<00:01:52.799> say<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.009> sure<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
can't really say for sure but in this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
can't really say for sure but in this
game<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.270> closed<00:01:54.720> beta<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.140> soldier<00:01:55.380> front<00:01:55.560> 2

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
game in closed beta of soldier front 2

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.310 
game in closed beta of soldier front 2
it<00:01:56.100> seems<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.520> most<00:01:57.119> all<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.630> sniper<00:01:57.930> rifles

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it seems like most all the sniper rifles

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440 
it seems like most all the sniper rifles
are<00:01:58.409> definitely<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.820> don't<00:02:00.030> know<00:02:00.149> about<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
are definitely or I don't know about the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.780 
are definitely or I don't know about the
cd-rom<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.140> definitely<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.710> psg-1<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
cd-rom but definitely the psg-1 and the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.810 
cd-rom but definitely the psg-1 and the
ACCC's<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.829> shot<00:02:05.100> kills<00:02:05.369> at<00:02:05.579> all

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
ACCC's are are not one shot kills at all

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.249 
ACCC's are are not one shot kills at all
but<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.240> can't<00:02:06.509> assume<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.869> they're<00:02:07.229> just

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
but you can't assume that they're just

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.529 
but you can't assume that they're just
straight-up<00:02:08.250> one-shot<00:02:08.789> kills<00:02:09.090> because

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
straight-up one-shot kills because

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.240 
straight-up one-shot kills because
they're<00:02:09.959> not<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> kill<00:02:10.590> people<00:02:10.709> but

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
they're not going to kill people but

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.800 
they're not going to kill people but
with<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.580> shy<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.819> their<00:02:12.000> full<00:02:12.180> HP<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:12.629> you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
with one shy of their full HP if you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.320 
with one shy of their full HP if you
shoot<00:02:12.989> them

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
shoot them

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.810 
shoot them
the<00:02:13.510> foot<00:02:13.720> or<00:02:13.960> leg<00:02:14.170> or<00:02:14.350> even<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> upper<00:02:15.550> at<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
the foot or leg or even the upper at the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.810 
the foot or leg or even the upper at the
lower<00:02:16.030> body<00:02:16.330> region<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:18.400> need<00:02:18.640> to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
lower body region so you need to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.880 
lower body region so you need to
maintain<00:02:18.970> accuracy<00:02:19.600> in<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.770> that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
maintain accuracy in this I think that

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.860 
maintain accuracy in this I think that
sniping<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.640> game<00:02:21.910> requires<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.630> lot<00:02:22.840> more

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
sniping in this game requires a lot more

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.290 
sniping in this game requires a lot more
skill<00:02:23.500> because<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.610> fact<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.270> know

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
skill because of the fact that you know

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.820 
skill because of the fact that you know
you're<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.170> kill<00:02:26.320> someone<00:02:26.650> one

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
you're not going to kill someone one

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.220 
you're not going to kill someone one
shot<00:02:27.220> if<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.820> don't<00:02:28.000> shoot<00:02:28.210> them<00:02:28.450> like<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.050> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
shot if you don't shoot them like in the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.520 
shot if you don't shoot them like in the
upper<00:02:29.500> chest<00:02:29.770> or<00:02:29.980> up<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.760> um<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.960> that<00:02:32.380> what

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
that being said I do feel like the sea

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.530 
that being said I do feel like the sea
at<00:02:35.350> least<00:02:35.560> eight<00:02:35.980> sixty<00:02:36.340> sila<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.880> still<00:02:37.450> an

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
at least eight sixty sila is still an

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.150 
at least eight sixty sila is still an
excellent<00:02:37.960> sniper<00:02:38.170> rifle<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.770> more

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
excellent sniper rifle it's more

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.860 
excellent sniper rifle it's more
forgiving<00:02:39.640> than<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.910> PS<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.420> want<00:02:40.600> anyway

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
forgiving than the PS you want anyway

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.170 
forgiving than the PS you want anyway
because<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.350> has<00:02:41.440> more<00:02:41.590> damage<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.220> yeah<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.970> is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
because it has more damage so yeah it is

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.790 
because it has more damage so yeah it is
an<00:02:43.330> excellent<00:02:43.750> sniper<00:02:43.990> rifle<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.620> bolt

an excellent sniper rifle and it is bolt
action<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.520> guys<00:02:45.640> prefer<00:02:45.940> bolt-action

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
action so if you guys prefer bolt-action

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.170 
action so if you guys prefer bolt-action
sniper<00:02:46.600> rifles<00:02:47.080> then<00:02:47.260> there<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:47.950> go<00:02:48.180> one

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
sniper rifles then there you go one

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.750 
sniper rifles then there you go one
thing<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.420> note<00:02:49.810> about<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.800> 60<00:02:51.220> season<00:02:51.640> is

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
thing to note about the a 60 season is

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910 
thing to note about the a 60 season is
the<00:02:52.060> fact<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.810> has<00:02:52.990> a<00:02:53.020> double<00:02:53.410> zoom<00:02:53.590> scope

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the fact that it has a double zoom scope

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.130 
the fact that it has a double zoom scope
unlike<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.490> psg1<00:02:55.270> which<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> only<00:02:55.840> sniper

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
unlike the psg1 which is the only sniper

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.410 
unlike the psg1 which is the only sniper
rifle<00:02:56.440> in<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.650> game<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.130> far<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.880> only<00:02:58.180> has

the intervention both have a double zoom

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.080 
the intervention both have a double zoom
scopes<00:03:06.130> what<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.400> means<00:03:06.580> for<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.000> that

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
guys know how the double scope zoom

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.130 
guys know how the double scope zoom
works<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.280> combat<00:03:18.970> arms<00:03:19.180> then<00:03:19.600> or<00:03:20.019> the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
works in combat arms then or the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.630 
works in combat arms then or the
variable<00:03:20.470> zoom<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.830> call<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.160> duty<00:03:21.370> for<00:03:21.519> that

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
variable zoom and call of duty for that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.050 
variable zoom and call of duty for that
matter<00:03:21.870> then<00:03:22.870> it's<00:03:23.290> not<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:24.070> second<00:03:24.459> layer<00:03:24.850> of

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
matter then it's not the second layer of

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.960 
matter then it's not the second layer of
zoom<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.510> not<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.560> deep<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.550> still<00:03:27.910> a

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
zoom is not that deep but it's still a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.430 
zoom is not that deep but it's still a
little<00:03:28.209> bit<00:03:28.420> deeper<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.080> little

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
little bit deeper so you have a little

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.290 
little bit deeper so you have a little
bit<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.830> clear<00:03:30.040> picture<00:03:30.310> on<00:03:30.640> your<00:03:30.670> target

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
bit of a clear picture on your target

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.120 
bit of a clear picture on your target
and<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.480> becomes<00:03:31.720> very<00:03:31.840> handy<00:03:32.530> when<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:33.100> need

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
and it becomes very handy when you need

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.130 
and it becomes very handy when you need
to<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.670> know<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.090> feel<00:03:34.570> like<00:03:34.720> your<00:03:34.900> first

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
to you know you feel like your first

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.040 
to you know you feel like your first
layer<00:03:35.380> zoom<00:03:35.739> isn't<00:03:36.280> quite<00:03:36.489> enough<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:37.090> kind<00:03:37.959> of

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
layer zoom isn't quite enough to kind of

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.110 
layer zoom isn't quite enough to kind of
get<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.230> good<00:03:38.470> shot<00:03:38.500> on<00:03:38.980> your<00:03:39.459> on<00:03:39.730> your<00:03:39.760> enemy

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
get a good shot on your on your enemy

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.430 
get a good shot on your on your enemy
especially<00:03:40.420> if<00:03:40.480> they're<00:03:40.630> really<00:03:41.019> really<00:03:41.140> far

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
especially if they're really really far

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.229 
especially if they're really really far
away<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:41.709> having<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.489> double<00:03:42.880> zoom<00:03:43.030> feature

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
away so having that double zoom feature

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.259 
away so having that double zoom feature
is<00:03:43.510> very<00:03:43.900> good<00:03:44.500> on<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.830> season<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.280> 60<00:03:45.880> season

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
is very good on the season a 60 season

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.110 
is very good on the season a 60 season
and<00:03:46.500> what<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.620> 60<00:03:47.980> sila<00:03:48.190> act<00:03:48.489> is<00:03:48.700> these<00:03:49.000> are

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
and what the a 60 sila act is these are

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.060 
and what the a 60 sila act is these are
actually<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:50.290> it's<00:03:50.620> actually<00:03:50.950> pretty

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
actually it's a it's actually pretty

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.740 
actually it's a it's actually pretty
good<00:03:51.310> because<00:03:51.850> once<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.209> fire<00:03:52.510> it

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
good because once you fire it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.229 
good because once you fire it
automatically<00:03:53.500> takes<00:03:54.100> you<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.790> zoom

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
automatically takes you out of the zoom

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.350 
automatically takes you out of the zoom
of<00:03:55.780> your<00:03:56.019> zoom<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.310> don't<00:03:57.730> know<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:58.180> me

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
of your zoom so you I don't know for me

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.180 
of your zoom so you I don't know for me
I<00:03:58.510> prefer<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.050> way<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.890> have<00:04:00.160> a

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
I prefer it that way so that I have a

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.270 
I prefer it that way so that I have a
clear<00:04:00.610> peripheral<00:04:01.090> view<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.540> my<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.709> my<00:04:02.920> you

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
clear peripheral view of my of my you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.800 
clear peripheral view of my of my you
know<00:04:03.310> surrounding<00:04:03.940> area<00:04:04.239> surrounding

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
know surrounding area surrounding

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.509 
know surrounding area surrounding
vicinity<00:04:05.200> because<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.950> know<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.250> snipe

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
vicinity because you know if you snipe

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.370 
vicinity because you know if you snipe
then<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.209> know<00:04:07.330> most<00:04:07.510> likely<00:04:07.600> you're<00:04:07.989> you're

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
then you know most likely you're you're

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.020 
then you know most likely you're you're
going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.620> vulnerable<00:04:08.769> for<00:04:09.250> us<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.790> little

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
going to be vulnerable for us a little

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.000 
going to be vulnerable for us a little
bit<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:10.510> having<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:10.930> kind<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.590> zoom<00:04:11.860> out

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
bit so having that kind of zoom out

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.800 
bit so having that kind of zoom out
feature<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.940> automatically<00:04:13.390> mouth<00:04:13.600> feature

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
feature that automatically mouth feature

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.810 
feature that automatically mouth feature
after<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.440> take<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> shot<00:04:14.890> while<00:04:15.160> scoped<00:04:15.459> in<00:04:15.640> is

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
after you take a shot while scoped in is

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.080 
after you take a shot while scoped in is
very<00:04:16.209> nice<00:04:16.419> in<00:04:16.630> my<00:04:16.690> opinion<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:18.580> and<00:04:18.880> when

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
very nice in my opinion that and when

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.759 
very nice in my opinion that and when
your<00:04:19.239> scope<00:04:19.510> in<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.989> also<00:04:20.169> works<00:04:20.380> with<00:04:20.590> any

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
your scope in this also works with any

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.400 
your scope in this also works with any
sniper<00:04:21.040> rifle<00:04:21.400> not<00:04:22.300> just<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:22.660> htc's<00:04:23.140> up<00:04:23.260> but

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
sniper rifle not just the htc's up but

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.870 
sniper rifle not just the htc's up but
when<00:04:23.470> your<00:04:23.620> scoped<00:04:23.890> in<00:04:24.039> no<00:04:24.190> matter<00:04:24.340> which<00:04:24.580> zoom

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
when your scoped in no matter which zoom

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.909 
when your scoped in no matter which zoom
layer<00:04:25.120> you're<00:04:25.330> in<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.780> when<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.350> sprint<00:04:26.680> for

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
layer you're in that when you sprint for

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:27.190 
layer you're in that when you sprint for
it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.630 
it
Oh break<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.590> immediately<00:04:28.130> out<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.550> your

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
Oh break you immediately out of your

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.190 
Oh break you immediately out of your
scope<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.240> know<00:04:29.420> it's<00:04:29.630> not<00:04:29.780> like<00:04:29.840> some

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
scope so you know it's not like some

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.230 
scope so you know it's not like some
call<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.710> duty<00:04:31.010> stuff<00:04:31.250> where<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.940> know<00:04:32.030> or

combat arm stuff for that matter where

combat arm stuff for that matter where
if<00:04:33.770> your<00:04:33.890> zoom<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:34.580> have<00:04:34.850> to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
if your zoom that you have to

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.880 
if your zoom that you have to
right-click<00:04:35.510> or<00:04:35.750> take<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.140> out<00:04:36.320> take<00:04:36.500> yourself

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
right-click or take it out take yourself

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.620 
right-click or take it out take yourself
out<00:04:36.980> of<00:04:37.040> aiming<00:04:37.610> down<00:04:37.700> sights<00:04:37.760> in<00:04:38.300> order<00:04:38.510> to

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
out of aiming down sights in order to

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.090 
out of aiming down sights in order to
you<00:04:38.870> know<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.230> something<00:04:39.410> else<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.770> such<00:04:39.950> as

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
you know do something else like such as

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.740 
you know do something else like such as
sprinting<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:40.700> this<00:04:41.090> game<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.450> can<00:04:41.570> just

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
sprinting so this game you can just

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.570 
sprinting so this game you can just
sprint<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.170> I'll<00:04:42.290> break<00:04:42.580> automatically

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
sprint and I'll break automatically

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.620 
sprint and I'll break automatically
without<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:43.940> having<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.210> right<00:04:44.420> click<00:04:44.540> again
