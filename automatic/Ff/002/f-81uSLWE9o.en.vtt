really a little bit too hand-holding
with<00:00:48.660> gamers<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.530> gamers<00:00:49.829> they

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
with gamers and I think gamers they

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
don't need they're smart they don't need

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.110 
don't need they're smart they don't need

to be handled the best examples like a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
to be handled the best examples like a
mainstream<00:00:54.539> difficult<00:00:55.079> game<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.410> something

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
mainstream difficult game is something

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.209 
mainstream difficult game is something
like<00:00:55.800> demon<00:00:56.129> souls<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:58.190> compared<00:00:59.190> to

like demon souls and compared to

you know all this I just wanted out that

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.260 
you know all this I just wanted out that
the<00:01:18.330> widest<00:01:18.689> audience<00:01:18.900> appeal<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.270> guess

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the widest audience appeal so I guess

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.719 
the widest audience appeal so I guess
maybe<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.990> case<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.619> maybe<00:01:23.100> trying<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> get

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
maybe this case of maybe trying to get

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.120 
maybe this case of maybe trying to get
the<00:01:23.909> lowest<00:01:24.240> common<00:01:25.200> denominator<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.009> know

the lowest common denominator you know

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
the lowest common denominator you know
there's<00:01:26.640> some<00:01:26.880> suggestion<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.869> desire

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
there's some suggestion that the desire

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.109 
there's some suggestion that the desire

carefully to secure the non hardcore

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730 
carefully to secure the non hardcore
audience<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:36.960> around<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> we'd

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740

actually<00:01:38.130> things<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.689> down<00:01:39.900> even<00:01:40.380> more

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
actually things got them down even more

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.249 
actually things got them down even more
like<00:01:40.979> where<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:42.299> need<00:01:42.450> everybody

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

like where it was like we need everybody

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
to make sure that I'm gonna come up with

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.430 
to make sure that I'm gonna come up with
your<00:04:21.489> game<00:04:21.730> so<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.540> further<00:04:22.750> afield<00:04:23.080> on

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
your game so that you further afield on

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.670 
your game so that you further afield on
mass<00:04:23.620> audience<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.970> guess<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:26.020> view<00:04:26.530> right

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
mass audience and I guess the view right

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.440 
mass audience and I guess the view right
now<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.340> if<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.700> make<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:27.910> game<00:04:28.180> easy

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
now is that if you make the game easy

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.890 
now is that if you make the game easy
enough<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.080> open<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:30.150> players<00:04:31.150> for

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
enough and you open the players for

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.210 
enough and you open the players for
whatever<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.320> reason<00:04:32.620> may<00:04:32.770> be<00:04:32.800> the

whatever the reason may be the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.280 
whatever the reason may be the
phenomenon<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.970> game<00:04:34.150> simplification<00:04:34.990> seems

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.020 
phenomenon of game simplification seems
to<00:04:35.440> be<00:04:35.560> affecting<00:04:35.950> genres<00:04:36.280> across<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.790> board

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030

it<00:05:01.660> was<00:05:02.220> mind-numbingly<00:05:03.220> dull<00:05:03.630> because<00:05:04.630> of

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
how easy it was now they could bypass

this<00:05:07.570> by<00:05:07.780> allowing<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.260> to<00:05:08.350> choose<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> higher

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
this by allowing you to choose a higher

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.529 
this by allowing you to choose a higher
difficulty<00:05:09.220> when<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.610> started<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.419> would

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
difficulty when you started that would

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.630 
difficulty when you started that would
have<00:05:10.630> been<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.840> easiest<00:05:11.260> fix<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.830> world<00:05:12.340> and

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
have been the easiest fix and world and

I would have probably enjoyed the game
much<00:05:13.930> more<00:05:13.960> but<00:05:14.770> that's<00:05:14.979> one<00:05:15.850> of<00:05:15.970> them<00:05:16.120> one<00:05:16.360> of

much more but that's one of them one of

the main downfalls when it comes to the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
higher difficulty because then once they

higher difficulty then they get
