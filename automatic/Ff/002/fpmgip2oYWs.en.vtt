the next one is in pizzazz this is very
similar<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.400> one<00:02:06.640> julieg<00:02:07.060> has<00:02:07.480> out<00:02:07.750> and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
similar to one julieg has out and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.780 
similar to one julieg has out and
another<00:02:08.140> one<00:02:08.320> that<00:02:08.440> OPI<00:02:08.800> has<00:02:09.100> out<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.580> think

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
another one that OPI has out and I think

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.400 
another one that OPI has out and I think
another<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.390> somebody<00:02:10.780> else<00:02:10.930> has<00:02:11.170> out

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
another one that somebody else has out

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.530 
another one that somebody else has out
the<00:02:11.650> deborah<00:02:12.070> lippmann<00:02:12.490> there's<00:02:13.150> many

pizzazz<00:02:16.030> de<00:02:16.390> glitter<00:02:16.720> polish<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.680> looks

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
pizzazz de glitter polish and it looks

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.440 
pizzazz de glitter polish and it looks
like<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.670> bunch<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:19.000> different

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
like that just a bunch of different

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.390 
like that just a bunch of different
color<00:02:19.660> glitters<00:02:20.190> really<00:02:21.190> pretty<00:02:21.520> polish

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.089 

next<00:02:26.329> is<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.510> blue<00:02:26.989> in<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.379> collection<00:02:27.950> this

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
next is the blue in the collection this

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.179
