could say it's it's baked or hoax but

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.000 
could say it's it's baked or hoax but
they<00:00:47.430> happen<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.730> approve<00:00:48.379> it's<00:00:49.379> easy<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.860> just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
they happen to approve it's easy to just

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
they happen to approve it's easy to just
write<00:00:50.070> something<00:00:50.670> off<00:00:51.199> but<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.590> no

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
write something off but if you have no

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
write something off but if you have no
proof<00:00:53.129> somebody<00:00:53.760> doesn't<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> video<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
proof somebody doesn't do a video and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.799 
proof somebody doesn't do a video and
show<00:00:54.960> proof<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.789> been<00:00:57.090> made<00:00:57.510> fake

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
show proof that this has been made fake

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
show proof that this has been made fake
well<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.829> still<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> air<00:01:01.250> but

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
well then it's still up in the air but

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.289 
well then it's still up in the air but
it's<00:01:02.430> still<00:01:02.670> possibility<00:01:04.850> what<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.970> also<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's still possibility what is also a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's still possibility what is also a
possibility<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.320> real<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
possibility is that it's real and if it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.800 
possibility is that it's real and if it
is<00:01:08.700> real<00:01:11.060> how<00:01:12.060> did<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> happen

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is real how did it happen

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.030 
is real how did it happen
now<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:14.850> talk<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.990> being<00:01:16.650> able<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
now this is where talk of being able to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800 
now this is where talk of being able to
manipulate<00:01:17.310> energies<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.240> frequencies

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
manipulate energies and frequencies

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
manipulate energies and frequencies
comes<00:01:19.799> into<00:01:20.040> play<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.420> not<00:01:22.229> only<00:01:22.500> by<00:01:23.369> man

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
comes into play and not only by man

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
comes into play and not only by man
that<00:01:24.390> has<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> technology<00:01:24.990> which<00:01:25.770> I'm<00:01:25.920> going

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that has the technology which I'm going

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
that has the technology which I'm going
to<00:01:26.100> talk<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.790> another<00:01:26.880> big<00:01:27.420> video

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

coming up so keep an eye out for it
really<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> biggest<00:01:31.650> videos<00:01:31.890> I've

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
really one of the biggest videos I've

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.600 
really one of the biggest videos I've
ever<00:01:32.490> done<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.299> ever<00:01:33.570> will<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.590> coming<00:01:35.460> up

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
ever done or ever will do is coming up

and it pertains to all of this the
energies<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> frequencies<00:01:42.110> what<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.290> are<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
energies the frequencies what we are and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
energies the frequencies what we are and

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that you can truly be instead of being

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.179 
that you can truly be instead of being

I think you're gonna like the video I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.860 
I think you're gonna like the video I
have<00:02:21.250> coming<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.760> lot<00:02:22.120> because<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:22.689> going<00:02:22.810> to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
have coming a lot because it's going to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.110 
have coming a lot because it's going to
open<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.230> lot<00:02:23.379> of<00:02:23.409> minds<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.069> it's<00:02:24.819> just<00:02:24.970> gonna

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
open a lot of minds and it's just gonna

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
open a lot of minds and it's just gonna
lay<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.299> all<00:02:25.450> out<00:02:25.480> there<00:02:25.659> and<00:02:26.220> some<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
lay it all out there and some of the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.699 
lay it all out there and some of the
information<00:02:27.939> is<00:02:28.060> dangerous<00:02:28.510> info<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.530> that's

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
information is dangerous info but that's

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.649 
information is dangerous info but that's
why<00:02:32.950> they<00:02:33.129> keep<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.489> secret<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:37.480> gonna

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
why they keep it secret and just gonna

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.780 
why they keep it secret and just gonna
continue<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> touch<00:02:38.829> on<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.189> in<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.400> video

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
continue to touch on that in that video

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.250 
continue to touch on that in that video
but<00:02:40.209> as<00:02:40.420> far<00:02:40.689> as<00:02:40.720> this<00:02:41.109> goes<00:02:41.349> for<00:02:41.920> me<00:02:42.069> could<00:02:42.489> be

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
but as far as this goes for me could be

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.960 
but as far as this goes for me could be
one<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.379> many<00:02:44.500> things<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.579> said<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.790> don't
