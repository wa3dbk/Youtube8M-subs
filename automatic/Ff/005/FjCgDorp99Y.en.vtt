00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.600
 hello everyone welcome let's open 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.969
 the tutorial today giving a special 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.990
 I remember a friend who has made me a 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:20.350
 consult and is the one that I will try to 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.970
 respond theme tutorial is that 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.509
 this friend who follows the new 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.830
 tutorials I wanted to make an album that your 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:35.620
 ouija and with an editing program 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.720
 photograph gave the retro filter or of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.210
 60s 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.090
 got very well the color that came out in 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.890
 that time of the photographs and he 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 made the rounded corners 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.960
 then his problem and his surprise was 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.200
 what 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.360
 when trying to paste in the album the 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 Photography 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.070
 to work with only copy when trying 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.920
 paste it on the album it happened what 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.930
 following 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.930
 true as a new layer 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.829
 well here we see it in the photograph with 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:19.100
 the rounded corners but with a 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:22.240
 but the corners a white triangular 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.200
 this happens because 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.450
 the image consists of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.950
 the background canvas and several layers 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.079
 alliances as if outside 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.320
 the role of peat photography and 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.299
 always always always be square and 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.130
 then the different layers are the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.659
 layers in which the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.939
 colors and joints 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.909
 this the friend of this one could have 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.380
 solve very easy 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.380
 going to 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.640
 opening the image in order from a 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.310
 then I should have Iraqi principle 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.550
 it's layer 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 transparency add alpha channel and this 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.420
 what it does is to form or transform 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.200
 the canvas on a transparent canvas that 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.640
 instead of having the background color 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.459
 the color of the canvases 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.500
 assigned by the program gives you a 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 transparency 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.470
 let's now create the corners 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.140
 rounded 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.100
 to select 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.380
 the rectangular section 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.060
 we create here we give you corners 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.770
 rounded so that the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.390
 effect 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.920
 we will give you a generous radio and 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.920
 we will work on this same photo 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.739
 let's go here 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.819
 It 's perfect, you see how it's marked 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.720
 all 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:00.330
 in all corners 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.640
 we accept and now we have 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.770
 selected everything that is inside the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.970
 inner area of the square 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.160
 then sir invest and when investing 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.190
 we have selected only the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.600
 four triangles to eliminate what 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.250
 there we give it to suppress and we see that it 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.070
 has put this kind of grid 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.690
 gray and this grid tells us 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.280
 precisely here we have an area 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.800
 transparent 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.910
 Well now let's do something so 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.910
 simple as a file 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.350
 and win as 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.790
 here in credits we look for the same 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:48.319
 name but instead of recording it as 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:53.420
 jpg we recorded it as from m &amp; g why 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 because png the png extension saves us 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.319
 the transparencies 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.220
 the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.439
 the jpg extension can not handle 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.140
 transparencies with which it becomes 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.319
 the canvas to the original color of the canvas 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.100
 and when we paste we paste the 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.030
 transparencies with color 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:23.140
 well we already have here that this 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.140
 we select everything 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.569
 edit copy we go to the page of the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.560
 something edit 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:40.500
 peel as a new layer 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.820
 and we move it to where we want to have it 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.100
 as you can see here there is no more 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.680
 no color more transparency in the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.770
 corners the corners are transparent 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.260
 and let us see what is below and in 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.689
 opposed to the initial image in 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.279
 That had been 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:04.949
 saved as jpg and we had arrived 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:08.069
 some triangles of color more I hope 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:11.849
 with this having answered the question 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:14.189
 of my friend and then I'm going to make a 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.380
 clarification as you see here is the face 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.440
 pixilated 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.900
 you know what I said several times 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.540
 you have to 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.360
 the pictures that people leave 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.220
 you have to safeguard the privacy of 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.810
 these people and much more if they are 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.450
 minors 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.450
 in the end I hope you found it useful 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.580
 this tutorial that you have interesting and 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.050
 I say goodbye until the next many 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.050
 thanks for following my records
