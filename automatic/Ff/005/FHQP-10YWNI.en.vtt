has been once again this has been a

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.910 
has been once again this has been a
great<00:01:04.629> case<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.110> far<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.770> definitely

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
great case so far and I definitely

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.670 
great case so far and I definitely
recommend<00:01:06.190> it<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.580> anyone<00:01:06.850> looking<00:01:07.090> for<00:01:07.270> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
recommend it to anyone looking for a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.600 
recommend it to anyone looking for a
protective<00:01:08.680> case<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:11.470> relatively<00:01:12.220> little

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
protective case as relatively little

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.320 
protective case as relatively little
bulk<00:01:13.230> while<00:01:14.310> still<00:01:15.310> maintaining<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:15.970> kind

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
bulk while still maintaining that kind

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.580 
bulk while still maintaining that kind
of<00:01:16.450> ease<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.840> sliding<00:01:17.080> in<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.290> out<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.440> the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
of ease of sliding in and out of the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.910 
of ease of sliding in and out of the
pocket<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:19.810> only<00:01:19.960> complaint<00:01:20.170> about<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.740> case

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
pocket my only complaint about this case

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.900 
pocket my only complaint about this case
so<00:01:21.160> far<00:01:21.930> would<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.590> rubber<00:01:24.220> peeling<00:01:24.790> on

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
so far would be the rubber peeling on

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.180 
so far would be the rubber peeling on
the<00:01:25.660> sides<00:01:25.870> here<00:01:26.200> I've<00:01:26.590> been<00:01:26.740> using<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.040> for<00:01:27.070> a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
the sides here I've been using it for a

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.650 
the sides here I've been using it for a
couple<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.460> weeks<00:01:27.550> now<00:01:27.730> and<00:01:27.850> as<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.510> can<00:01:28.630> see

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
couple of weeks now and as you can see

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.260 
couple of weeks now and as you can see
it's<00:01:28.990> already<00:01:29.140> starting<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.800> peel<00:01:30.010> up<00:01:30.270> all

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
it's already starting to peel up all

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.470 
it's already starting to peel up all
around<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.780> rubber<00:01:31.960> here<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:34.240> can't

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
around the rubber here and I can't

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.970 
around the rubber here and I can't
imagine<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:35.230> would<00:01:35.320> get<00:01:35.500> anything<00:01:35.680> but

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
imagine that would get anything but

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.110 
imagine that would get anything but
worse<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.820> look<00:01:36.970> all<00:01:37.150> around<00:01:37.240> here<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:39.640> that's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
worse you look all around here if that's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.880 
worse you look all around here if that's
if<00:01:40.510> you're<00:01:40.780> really<00:01:40.960> particular<00:01:41.470> about<00:01:41.530> that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
if you're really particular about that

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.370 
if you're really particular about that
kind<00:01:42.070> of<00:01:42.160> thing<00:01:42.220> then<00:01:42.850> I'd<00:01:43.780> probably

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
kind of thing then I'd probably

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.930 
kind of thing then I'd probably
recommend<00:01:44.680> finding<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.340> different<00:01:45.460> option

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
recommend finding a different option

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.070 
recommend finding a different option
because<00:01:46.120> there's<00:01:46.300> really<00:01:46.450> no<00:01:46.660> way<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.810> keep

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
because there's really no way to keep

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.140 
because there's really no way to keep
that<00:01:47.200> from<00:01:47.410> happening<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.910> just<00:01:49.090> a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
that from happening because it's just a

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.710 
that from happening because it's just a
result<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.630> its<00:01:49.810> sliding<00:01:50.020> out<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.440> your<00:01:50.560> pocket

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
result of its sliding out of your pocket

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.240 
result of its sliding out of your pocket
one<00:01:52.720> nice<00:01:52.870> thing<00:01:52.900> about<00:01:53.080> this<00:01:53.320> case<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.920> that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
one nice thing about this case is that

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.250 
one nice thing about this case is that
it<00:01:54.670> actually<00:01:54.850> comes<00:01:55.240> off<00:01:55.450> relatively<00:01:55.930> easily

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
it actually comes off relatively easily

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.950 
it actually comes off relatively easily
you<00:01:56.890> can<00:01:56.980> just<00:01:57.160> kind<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.630> pop<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.750> off<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
you can just kind of pop it off the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.730 
you can just kind of pop it off the
corners<00:01:59.260> here

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 

and<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:03.060> complaint<00:02:03.509> with
