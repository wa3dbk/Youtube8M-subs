opposed<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.939> original<00:01:54.390> Sims<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> you

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
opposed the original Sims is that you

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.530 
opposed the original Sims is that you
can<00:01:55.259> choose<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.369> color<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> want<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.210> almost

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.730 
on a slightly more expensive range so
put<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.579> there

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740
