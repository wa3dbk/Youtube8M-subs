00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello, how are you? Jose Miguel de 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.780
 I want to play guitar dotcom today 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.750
 we have 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.890
 from YouTube 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.180
 it's very simple they are four short 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 the oldest 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.660
 those over 21 third rope second 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.450
 space of the first two rope 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.170
 second space and 13 second string 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.170
 third space 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.200
 then the biggest one comes for quite 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:43.350
 give away we run finger 3 and the second 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.630
 space of the second string and we put 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.860
 the rest then would remain finger 1 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.500
 how much rope second space of the two 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.680
 third rope second space of 2 3 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.680
 second string 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.409
 then comes if less capo squeezing 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.250
 all the strings in the second space 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:14.180
 of all second rope third space 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.850
 of 24 third rope fourth space 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.850
 23 fourth rope fourth space 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.360
 do not 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.360
 and then comes I'm older 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.729
 finger 115 second space agreement of 22 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.330
 sixth string third space of 23 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.979
 second rope third space and 24 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.979
 first second string 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170
 to me 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.610
 in May 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:52.930
 then all the new major re 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.909
 the biggest 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.990
 if not 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.369
 there is only now 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.369
 well then 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.430
 the difficult here 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.050
 the chords are all the same all the 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.640
 song are the same four chords 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.920
 that repeat the difficult thing here is to vary 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.770
 what is the same thing all the time 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:27.060
 changing the song is very difficult 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.060
 version of it fell sharply 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.620
 plus 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.019
 you can attend to that try to do it 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.780
 can a little percuss on the guitar 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.900
 that is the grace 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.989
 then you can do 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.989
 i 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.560
 ah 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.069
 i 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.069
 Y 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.080
 I'm doing with this part of the hand 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.390
 I'm shutting the strings a bit 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.390
 so it sounds like that, it's called 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.290
 then I play the rest as if 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.290
 I was scared 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.490
 i 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.070
 the chords are relatively simple there are 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.110
 a simple that can cost you a 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.520
 bit but if you have already mastered the 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.919
 in advance followed will be simple 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.960
 try to vary that is important 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.350
 then as you go singing the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.100
 topic 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.820
 and try to give different intensities 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.120
 different rhythms in the background always in 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.140
 the propeller but varying then 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.140
 electro fa you can do it 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.080
 bathed 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.229
 I gave you several options try the all 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.380
 It is very good to try different options 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.510
 thus its growth as vitalist is 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.670
 higher 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.710
 practice a lot practice the chords 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.560
 practice the different types of region 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.190
 and try to get together and change when you 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.520
 you want that is important 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.130
 that more of the athlete 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.220
 It is also good that you accompany the 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.920
 original track youtube with or 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.930
 without you and you start accompanying 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.449
 Guitar 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.500
 it would be two learn nothing well practice 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.500
 much success
