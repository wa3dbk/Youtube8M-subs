00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.150
 for centuries astronomers had accumulated scientific evidence of life 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.009
 In mars 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.579
 now in 1897 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.649
 a new science fiction writer offered his own interpretation 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.269
 spooky 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.569
 if our telescopes had not allowed us 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.670
 we would have seen the problems that were already coming in the 19th century men 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.069
 whatever for hiv they observed the red planet 

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.899
 but they failed to interpret the variations in the brands they illustrated 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.899
 on maps the Martians must have been preparing 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.710
 gerber me eight played 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.710
 was born into a middle class family in southern England 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.120
 for that reason Juarez had a vast scientific experience was 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 interested in human evolution and the process of evolution 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.110
 after graduating he was a school teacher who showed little interest in 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.840
 his work 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.160
 then in 1895 at the age of 29 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.500
 played he moved to a quiet suburb near london that was called wakim 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.690
 there he showed interest in writing 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.760
 in his first two novels 'the time machine' and the invisible man 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.080
 he combined his interest in science with social criticism what established him 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 as one of the most popular writers of the time 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.429
 great good hg things were expected 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.239
 with two years his third novel in 1897 the public was not disappointed 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.570
 besides the emotion of the alien invasions 'the war of the worlds' 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.670
 hinted at the vulnerability of the empire 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.909
 when Thursday wrote 'the war of the worlds' the British empire was 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.620
 in his heyday he had conquered every country he had arrived at was a 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.619
 shepard superpower 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.680
 flights he did a warning to an impressive 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.570
 the war is an allegory anyway since the Martians had given wrong 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.960
 use to their technology they had great military might perished misuse of 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 that is why they come down because he wanted to say that what could happen to us 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.409
 same that we should be more responsible in using our power 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.579
 this superior force arrived in a spectacular way 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.319
 Several hollow cylinders fell into a park just minutes from the department 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.319
 of flights 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:36.099
 the fascinated readers wanted to know what the Martians looked like they did not look 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.409
 how they thought 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 the cylinder cap fell precipitously 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.389
 a gray mole was made and round the size of a bear 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.969
 I crawled out of the cylinder slowly 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.759
 when he gave it the light he peeled as if it were wet leather 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.759
 two big black eyes stared at me 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:05.789
 He showed the Murcians as highly evolved children who dared their 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:07.130
 advanced technology 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.709
 to make war on humanity 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 and what was worse the creatures were vampires 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.239
 that would be another good social criticism 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.859
 Huawei wanted to make analogies between how we treat supposed animals 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:22.910
 lower 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.000
 and how the Martians contrasted to us the Martians fed on 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.100
 blood one thought if they are so revolutionized why they feed on 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.100
 blood but analyze history we see that we are not different 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.209
 even in this era people are fascinated by the theory of evolution 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.179
 these creatures will be a future generation of humans 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.999
 but we will go the representation that assure them of the Martians we can see 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.799
 which is perfectly valid since it tries to extrapolate the address 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.079
 that could take evolution in the case of an intelligent species 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.329
 this superior race mobilize gigantic war machines with 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.660
 chilling weapons 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.660
 that discharge fury against the crowd 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.899
 one dedicated to / left 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:15.359
 a ghostly bolt seemed to come out of her 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.579
 all the men started to become flames 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.579
 all began to wobble and fall due to fire 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.860
 the heat rays of the Martians made the great weapons of the 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.499
 humans will be useless 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.280
 while the Martians marched on London they revealed a new weapon still 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.360
 more deadly and neutralizing the British army in an instant 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.949
 every Martian had pulled out a huge mechanical arm 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.580
 that hit the floor 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.610
 and that it released a lot of dark vapor that its well spiral like a cloud 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.050
 of ebony 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.099
 at contact the caustic blade was death for everything that breathes yes 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.999
 the crude style of the novel if they united the terrible facts of history 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.509
 this scary book was translated into dozens of languages â€‹â€‹and sold 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.849
 worldwide 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.269
 the interest in Mars as fiction and as a scientific object commented 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.150
 the question we ask is if we are alone I guess the answer 

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:24.909
 is no we are not alone there are other things in space the next question 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.710
 serious they are dangerous 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.990
 what they think about us obviously survival is our first 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.990
 worry about it fear is the great motivator 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.530
 in 1910 until the pioneer scientist thomas edison speculated on how 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.530
 we would be Martians 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.760
 the vision that Edison had about the red planet was completely opposite to 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.759
 your traditional rational thinking 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.940
 blatantly despised contemporary scientific notions in favor of 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:03.110
 a crazy fantasy of his own imagination 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.919
 in 1926 russia showed a new face of the red planet when it premiered to avoid 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.169
 queen of mars 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.259
 written by a cousin of lion tolstoi 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.099
 again tuesday a metaphor for evil 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.610
 the first cosmonauts of the earth arrive on a planet where it was propitious 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.610
 forbidden by a crushing capitalism 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.660
 the three space travelers arrive at Mars colson to lie in the Russian 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.960
 where the revolution had happened they used that opportunity to help 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.029
 the Martians to improve their quality 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.959
 they quickly taught them the blessings of communism and returned to 

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:44.369
 the sovietic Union 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:47.809
 they did not want to make a film that was only about the revolution 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:50.809
 it was also fun 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.050
 but soon the fun turned into a robbery 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.650
 When Mars prepared to invest the United States
