bye so this is the first bit now if you
come<00:00:03.629> round<00:00:03.780> Jade<00:00:04.110> will<00:00:04.290> look<00:00:04.410> for<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.680> other

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
come round Jade will look for the other

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.320 
come round Jade will look for the other
section<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.210> beginner<00:00:06.509> start<00:00:07.760> now<00:00:08.760> we're

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
section the beginner start now we're

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.530 
section the beginner start now we're
going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.950> take<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.010> lateral<00:00:11.880> flexion<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:13.460> too

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
going to take a lateral flexion here too

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.920 
going to take a lateral flexion here too
again<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.719> way<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.900> hair<00:00:16.350> grows<00:00:17.690> this<00:00:18.690> hair

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
again the way the hair grows this hair

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.480 
again the way the hair grows this hair
wants<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.439> over<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.680> way<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.279> cut

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
wants to go over that way so if we cut

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.179 
wants to go over that way so if we cut
this<00:00:20.640> hair<00:00:20.850> short<00:00:21.240> next<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.980> will

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
this hair short next to it then it will

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.230 
this hair short next to it then it will
leave<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> line<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.820> then<00:00:27.060> we're

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
leave this is the line so and then we're

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.019 
leave this is the line so and then we're
going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> decide<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:28.250> deep<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.880> line

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
going to decide how deep to do the line

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.600 
going to decide how deep to do the line
underneath<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.750> first<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.199> all<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.500> cut<00:00:32.489> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
underneath but first of all we cut this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.060 
underneath but first of all we cut this
off<00:00:32.820> again<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> number<00:00:33.630> 5<00:00:33.840> clipper<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
off again with the number 5 clipper and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.319 
off again with the number 5 clipper and
then<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.399> all<00:00:37.969> accomplished<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> first

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
then it's all accomplished the first

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.930 
then it's all accomplished the first
section<00:00:39.660> oh<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:41.010> always<00:00:41.160> best<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.760> up

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
section oh it's always best to put up

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.030 
section oh it's always best to put up
less<00:00:42.180> than<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.510> think

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.390 

so<00:00:49.490> do<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:50.950> section<00:00:51.950> 12

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
so do we section 12

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.540 
so do we section 12
making<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> brush<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:56.010> hair<00:00:56.220> underneath<00:00:56.550> is

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
making a brush the hair underneath is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.120 
making a brush the hair underneath is
not<00:00:59.550> any<00:00:59.730> shorter<00:01:00.330> than<00:01:01.170> another<00:01:01.500> five<00:01:01.770> so

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
not any shorter than another five so

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.230 
not any shorter than another five so
they<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.660> not<00:01:03.660> worry<00:01:03.840> about<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:06.590> right<00:01:08.240> we've

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
they can not worry about it right we've

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
they can not worry about it right we've
done<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.450> roughly<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.230> well<00:01:10.650> maybe<00:01:11.040> need

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
done that roughly but well maybe need

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.180 
done that roughly but well maybe need
that<00:01:12.060> section<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> bed<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:14.040> we've

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
that section in the bed and then we've

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.760 
that section in the bed and then we've
got<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.730> write<00:01:14.910> really<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.510> choose<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:16.230> angle

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
got to write really then choose an angle

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
got to write really then choose an angle
to<00:01:17.010> come<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.810> it'd<00:01:19.050> be<00:01:19.230> nice

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to come down here because it'd be nice

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.080 
to come down here because it'd be nice
to<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.770> another<00:01:20.070> zigzagging<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.910> well<00:01:21.860> so

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.950 

probably<00:01:28.670> think<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.330> need<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.690> sort

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
probably think about it we need to sort

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.060 
probably think about it we need to sort
of<00:01:31.110> create<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.130> line<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.440> then<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
of create a line here and then that the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.560 
of create a line here and then that the
hair<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.210> we'll<00:01:36.330> be<00:01:36.479> able

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
hair will be here and then we'll be able

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
hair will be here and then we'll be able
to<00:01:36.690> carve<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.260> section<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
to carve a section out here to be the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:50.730 
to carve a section out here to be the
final<00:01:38.880> point<00:01:39.350> so

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.219 

so<00:01:51.740> that's<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.070> next<00:01:52.219> section<00:01:53.229> they're

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
so that's the next section they're

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.529 
so that's the next section they're
always<00:01:54.979> take<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> bit<00:01:55.579> more<00:01:55.729> after<00:01:56.060> addition

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
always take a bit more after addition

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:17.880 
always take a bit more after addition
SSU<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:59.630> passionate<00:02:00.140> kiss

then<00:02:18.890> we'll<00:02:19.010> go<00:02:19.190> over<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.569> yeah<00:02:20.569> be<00:02:20.870> very

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.210 
then we'll go over that yeah be very
careful<00:02:21.590> not<00:02:21.680> to

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.350 

any<00:02:24.520> wider<00:02:24.880> than
