sense 2.1 but with three point o things

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.880 
sense 2.1 but with three point o things
added<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> sense<00:00:47.910> lock<00:00:48.210> screen

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
added like you get the sense lock screen

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.260 
added like you get the sense lock screen
which<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.039> course<00:00:50.070> everyone's<00:00:50.789> clamoring

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
which of course everyone's clamoring

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.420 
which of course everyone's clamoring
about<00:00:51.440> killing<00:00:52.440> themselves<00:00:52.559> trying<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> get

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.740 

if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.449> adds

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
if you don't know about it it just adds

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.340 
if you don't know about it it just adds
functionality<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.739> where<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:01:00.350> pull

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
functionality to where you can pull

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.759 
functionality to where you can pull
items<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.850> ring<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.719> directly<00:01:04.439> start

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
items into the ring and directly start

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.289 
items into the ring and directly start
it<00:01:04.979> kind<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> had<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:07.040> on<00:01:08.119> galaxy<00:01:09.119> s

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
it kind of like if you had a on galaxy s

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.780 
it kind of like if you had a on galaxy s
with<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> puzzle<00:01:10.229> pieces<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.790> reminiscent

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
with the puzzle pieces it's reminiscent

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
with the puzzle pieces it's reminiscent
of<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.720> looks<00:01:12.930> way<00:01:13.140> better<00:01:15.049> like<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of that but this looks way better like I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.649 
of that but this looks way better like I
said<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> full<00:01:16.890> sense<00:01:17.159> rom<00:01:18.799> it<00:01:19.799> has

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
said this is a full sense rom it has

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.420 
said this is a full sense rom it has
everything<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.290> packed<00:01:22.619> full<00:01:22.950> you're

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
everything in it it's packed full you're

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.399 
everything in it it's packed full you're
not<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.880> much<00:01:24.090> free<00:01:24.450> ram<00:01:24.720> when

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
not going to get much free ram when

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.410 
not going to get much free ram when
you're<00:01:25.530> running<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.240> see

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you're running this but as you can see

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
you're running this but as you can see
it<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:27.630> doesn't<00:01:28.020> seem<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.740> bogging

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it really doesn't seem like it's bogging

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940 
it really doesn't seem like it's bogging
it<00:01:29.100> down<00:01:29.159> too<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:30.049> I'm<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.409> overclocked

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it down too much I'm not overclocked

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.090 
it down too much I'm not overclocked
right<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.290> can<00:01:34.290> imagine<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.770> you'll

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
right now so you can imagine that you'll

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
right now so you can imagine that you'll
get<00:01:35.310> better<00:01:36.210> performance<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> then

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
get better performance out of it then

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.510 
get better performance out of it then
but<00:01:37.880> really<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.210> even<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.810> you'll

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
but really I don't even see that you'll

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.219 
but really I don't even see that you'll
that<00:01:41.520> you'd<00:01:41.670> even<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.240> need<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:42.720> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that you'd even really need it because I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.130 
that you'd even really need it because I
don't<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.860> why<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.159> did<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
don't know why I just did that but I

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
don't know why I just did that but I
mean<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.409> already<00:01:46.680> runs<00:01:46.890> smooth<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.430> already

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
mean it already runs smooth you already

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.940 
mean it already runs smooth you already
have<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.119> quick<00:01:48.990> settings<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> everything

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
have the quick settings and everything

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.730 
have the quick settings and everything
just<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> newer<00:01:51.960> versions<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.500> sense

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
just like the newer versions of sense

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.219 
just like the newer versions of sense
have<00:01:56.149> everything<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.630> good<00:01:57.659> working<00:01:57.840> order

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
have everything is in good working order

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.289 
have everything is in good working order
except<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:58.920> the<00:02:00.680> rotating<00:02:01.680> rosy<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.700> do

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
except for the rotating rosy and then do

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.670 
except for the rotating rosy and then do
yourself<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.689> favor<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.170> bring<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.530> up

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.150 
for it there's a few fixes for the
different<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.380> whatever<00:02:19.650> little<00:02:19.800> issues

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
different for whatever little issues

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.500 
different for whatever little issues
there<00:02:20.310> are<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:20.940> most<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.240> them<00:02:21.360> that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
there are but I think most of them that

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.030 
there are but I think most of them that
have<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:21.840> been<00:02:22.140> implemented<00:02:22.680> into<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
have actually been implemented into the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.770 
have actually been implemented into the
version<00:02:23.370> 1.4<00:02:23.940> which<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.330> what<00:02:24.480> I'm<00:02:24.569> running

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
version 1.4 which is what I'm running

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.580 
version 1.4 which is what I'm running
right<00:02:24.930> now<00:02:29.420> everything<00:02:31.280> does<00:02:32.280> seem<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.610> work

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
right now everything does seem to work

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.910 
right now everything does seem to work
there<00:02:34.590> was<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.800> problem<00:02:35.130> with<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
runs really quick just if you're on the

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.880 
runs really quick just if you're on the
fence<00:02:46.110> about<00:02:46.910> about<00:02:47.989> flashing<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.080> from<00:02:49.350> go

fence about about flashing this from go

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.850 
fence about about flashing this from go
ahead<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:52.650> really

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
ahead and just do it because it's really

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.400 
ahead and just do it because it's really
good<00:02:53.010> stuff<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:54.090> don't<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.630> anything<00:02:54.810> sync<00:02:55.260> to
