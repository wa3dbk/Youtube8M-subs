00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
string which is a lot of be okay so

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.190 
string which is a lot of be okay so
we'll<00:04:59.360> call<00:04:59.510> this<00:04:59.570> e<00:05:00.070> 7<00:05:01.070> over<00:05:01.430> B<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.200> because

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
we'll call this e 7 over B and because

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.710 
we'll call this e 7 over B and because
it<00:05:03.320> is<00:05:03.410> still<00:05:03.530> effectively<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:05.510> toll
