00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.609
 so offered glass 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.669
 how to do 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.599
 the coming of these rather foreign characters the reward of ten years 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 working in this museum traditions behind the city 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.399
 this new statue superposition of translucent plates to ask tomorrow 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.089
 detailed working day at the hammer a minute and precious end that 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.059
 the artist jean-luc l'ambre practiced for 18 years the know-how 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.949
 it is 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.159
 7 the hammer blow that count the 18 years are 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.250
 without wearing every piece of maintenance board 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.470
 oddly 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.260
 caÃ¯la per hour working day 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.240
 but if you are not 18 years old the work behind 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.670
 we can not do it 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.900
 the other star of the day is another glassblower 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.260
 the mythical and born citizens to murano he plunged into the making of the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 glass for five years 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.960
 today to offer the public demonstrations for the pleasure of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.400
 big and small 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.160
 the history of this museum is rather original an exhibition is planned in 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.100
 1997 and faced with this success the municipality wished to perpetuate it 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.980
 the program is an immersion in the evolution of warlike techniques 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.280
 which is proposed so we will take this day there are only some 3 4 million 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.760
 before our era and we end up on automatic machines nowadays that 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 can find a year 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.580
 also percent thank you bars and it is adimi notice the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.080
 others this is the principle of this museum here is an original machine and the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.590
 machine to make a childhood pile you have to know that at the sea town hall 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130
 are too early until twenty years ago 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 when we hear we made tickets or the famous jewels gifts 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.630
 for the children but the debt and in seine-maritime it is of course the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.290
 flotation a salvo of these missiles it is consecrated 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.700
 the bottle is really my specialty of the valley of tavannes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.369
 you should know that 75 to 80% of the perfume bottles in the world are 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.940
 manufactured in our region 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.210
 so it deserved 3 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.390
 the Museum of Traditions elsewhere of the city had to do everything from March to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.180
 November guided tours are offered to the public
