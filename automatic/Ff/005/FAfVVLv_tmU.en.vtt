00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.400
 this for what mother has been a great moment for you 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.119
 first I wanted to 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.389
 from feyenoord 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.619
 yes it was 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.619
 a nice sandwich open ma mère I have experienced 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.139
 it went much more difficult but you than expected today 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.480
 i think you'll be the first anp one to find out alone 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.609
 and in the second half we converted the year 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.730
 10 yes the bm 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.640
 but i saw psv yesterday ajax you it too difficult but we are already happy with 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.460
 the 4 0 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.380
 what is that then all those who actually have the biggest clubs in the country 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.130
 all also struggling all together with all due respect the little ones 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.809
 amateurs 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 make daily 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.290
 and then yesterday and thereby first bother yourself 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.320
 yes that's possible it's just that ma 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.650
 the cup football stagnates appart 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.650
 it is a disaster the team year gives everything 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.160
 we have to get through the football player and the first half did not succeed 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.930
 just about finally in the second team too big a difference in quality 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.550
 Yes I think so 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.059
 as jamal they first make a huge difference themselves in what is completely different 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.790
 but I think so I think the second half and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.530
 went on to play soccer 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.960
 this was also a law so that we have some players who are not always insured 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.750
 are from a base place get a chance of training yes you are one 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.100
 of which your players 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.150
 I had a chance for your hobby 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.250
 well i think i can do a lot better than what i showed today 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.630
 but 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 exactly to be further in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.550
 yes i hope so 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.380
 do you have after how there is one of the competitors of kelvin leerdam then hear 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.710
 you the news that he does not renew his contract you also hear especially the response 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.219
 of your trainings and how 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.819
 do you react as a competitor of the young to that news of means to you 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.179
 maybe new possibilities too yes it is the football world that works that way 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.649
 but yes growers do not extend contract to training 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.200
 make your choice 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.009
 and that he therefore not only has the best perspective for where else 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.610
 midfielders 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.030
 but we are going to see it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.320
 what have you done about the daughter yes built much more expensive 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.909
 as well as being able to subdue soccer, also always initially 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.060
 you so with other expectations but fine with its yes of course 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.059
 roda plays every week 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.439
 we are on the rise in the game you play every match in a year 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.329
 are you comfortable in it and now and then you don't play 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.199
 well that is indeed getting used to proxies again but the first year at roda 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.989
 experienced exactly the same 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.679
 the shoes stood master mails to opposition 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:33.159
 yes we have to be patient and show you knokke yes that the come 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.029
 preferably with the draws that the last cliché question of each 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.009
 child's hour took the cup match 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.519
 for that we offer see it 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.519
 did you leak a bit of a good cause 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.089
 I thought that from Hanegem it went already I day and Stefan the free 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.909
 to make life both of you all bart of bastia therefore it does not matter 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.539
 but we are going later I am curious no thank you
