 Internet Dmitry cuff in Anapa 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.270
 Dmitry I do not know anything about Internet 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.050
 dancing 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.130
 but we know everything about youth dances 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.890
 Vadim Kolganov 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.000
 let him tell you, and we 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.000
 let's see the proof 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.829
 Dmitry thank you for your question and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.670
 you mikhail for trusting the origins of tectonics 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.440
 you need to look for belgium for about 13 years 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 back in this wonderful country on 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.329
 Cuba parties was fashionable to dance 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.649
 jump style 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.660
 similar parties already then 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.440
 We give a reminder to the modern wall 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.270
 Tectonics September 15th, 2007 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.559
 tectonics goes to the general public he 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 debuted in Paris those in parade 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.320
 every time it was empty 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.899
 attended by at least 8,000 spectators and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.129
 professional dancers 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.530
 then tectonics quickly broke out for 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.729
 limits paris happened this thanks 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 Internet and since in 1 not Internet 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.070
 also there are our dancers not left then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.070
 not so what is the type here 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 this is a mixed dance style in 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.000
 The basis of which includes hip-hop techno and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.090
 many other modern styles frames but 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.180
 correctly call this style electro 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.180
 dance 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.460
 by the way now there are a lot 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.620
 music in this style and even your 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.060
 own dress 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.030
 electro dance or should look like 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.010
 send meet this sam zaharov one 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.510
 of the best dancers in this style by the way 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.010
 he owns his own new 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.010
 style did not resist electro 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.019
 first electro dance he wore shoes 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.269
 on a flat sole and white gloves with 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.760
 Over time, this style has changed 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:26.340
 due to the fact that each 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 wanted to be better than everyone else now 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.590
 show me some movements i 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.590
 I will try to repeat 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.870
 I understand this style is different that your 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.870
 hands have to move a lot 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.710
 out 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.420
 Yes 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 voices 5 dance direction tom 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.780
 to light their energy mom 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.880
 now danced guys lih of course 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.600
 it turns out much better but caught myself 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.350
 on the thought that 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.380
 25-30 years ago and this style has already tried 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.130
 because of what often we need our school 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.100
 discotheques 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.840
 or in the area that there were no problems for me 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.350
 had a date because I was dancing 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.750
 not like those 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.750
 but it's great this freedom 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 The main highlight of this style is that 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.310
 it is still networked 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.320
 phenomena through the Internet is carried out 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.460
 master class and learn new 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.470
 movements and ligaments 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.330
 on the network are discussed wei no 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.700
 distributed music is not clothes for 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.019
 dancers of this style and even festival 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.799
 are largely due to 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.060
 network community 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.630
 so electro dance really 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.910
 is a 21st century dance 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.420
 traditional dance art and 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.420
 modern cyber technology 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:46.229
 that a goat tells me that our time 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.020
 the transfer came to an end 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.059
 Well, I have to obey everything to you 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.059
 goodbye to new meetings yet
