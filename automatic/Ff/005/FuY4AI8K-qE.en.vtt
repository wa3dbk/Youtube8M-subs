accelerometers and everything there's

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.730 
accelerometers and everything there's
some<00:01:47.279> screenshots<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.119> basically<00:01:48.740> it

comes up when you launch the application
it<00:01:52.049> looks<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.469> computer<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.389> to

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
it looks for a computer you have to

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.440 
it looks for a computer you have to
install<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.889> simulate<00:01:56.579> SDK<00:01:57.179> in<00:01:57.329> your

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
install the I simulate SDK in your

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
install the I simulate SDK in your
application<00:01:57.959> it<00:01:58.079> literally<00:01:58.439> takes<00:01:58.709> about<00:01:58.920> 30

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
application it literally takes about 30

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.739 
application it literally takes about 30
seconds<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.789> have<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> great<00:02:00.090> tutorial<00:02:00.359> on<00:02:00.630> their

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
seconds I have a great tutorial on their

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:01.849 
seconds I have a great tutorial on their
website<00:02:01.109> which<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.319> show<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.529> in<00:02:01.619> two

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
website which will show you in two

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.489 
website which will show you in two
seconds<00:02:02.249> so<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.479> find<00:02:04.289> your

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
seconds so basically you just find your

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.169 
seconds so basically you just find your
computer<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.159> it'll<00:02:05.310> come<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.999> list

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
computer here it'll come up in the list

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.550 
computer here it'll come up in the list
once<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.599> application<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:07.139> launched<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.499> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
once your application is launched in the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.930 
once your application is launched in the
simulator<00:02:07.919> you<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.220> select<00:02:08.340> your<00:02:08.520> computer

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
simulator you just select your computer

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
simulator you just select your computer
then<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.690> bring<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> window

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
then it will bring you to this window

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
then it will bring you to this window
here<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> it'll<00:02:11.400> actually<00:02:11.550> show<00:02:11.880> your

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
here and it'll actually show your

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
here and it'll actually show your
accelerometer<00:02:12.660> graphs<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.410> all<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:14.130> all

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
accelerometer graphs and all this all

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.930 
accelerometer graphs and all this all
your<00:02:14.520> information

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
your information

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.490 
your information
here<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.360> your<00:02:15.390> computer<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.080> on<00:02:16.290> there

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
here for your computer right on there

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.290 
here for your computer right on there
and<00:02:16.770> then<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.370> go<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> options<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
and then you can go to the options and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.170 
and then you can go to the options and
set<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> GPS<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.620> actual<00:02:19.950> gps<00:02:20.190> or<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.820> fake

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
set the GPS to your actual gps or a fake

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.410 
set the GPS to your actual gps or a fake
address<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.960> all<00:02:22.410> kinds<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.680> stuff<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
address and all kinds of stuff like that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.140 
address and all kinds of stuff like that
so<00:02:24.420> let's<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.650> get<00:02:26.100> rid<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.580> I'll<00:02:26.910> show

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
so let's just get rid of this I'll show

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
the I simulate tab so here it is I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.420 
the I simulate tab so here it is I
simulate<00:02:36.960> multi-touch<00:02:37.560> accelerometers<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
simulate multi-touch accelerometers and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.700 
simulate multi-touch accelerometers and
a<00:02:38.730> lot<00:02:38.970> more<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.990> iPhone<00:02:40.410> simulator

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
a lot more all on the iPhone simulator

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
video and I added up and running in

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.460 
video and I added up and running in
about<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.850> minute<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.660> even<00:03:27.840> kidding<00:03:28.170> it's

my iphone here so let's try a current
current<00:03:52.950> address<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> went<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.030> my<00:03:54.150> settings

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
current address I I went to my settings

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.680 
current address I I went to my settings
and<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.440> changed<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> fake<00:03:57.030> address<00:03:57.300> so

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
and I changed it to a fake address so

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.330 
and I changed it to a fake address so
the<00:03:57.780> address<00:03:57.900> are<00:03:58.230> going<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.590> here<00:03:58.800> isn't

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
the address are going to see here isn't

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.729 
the address are going to see here isn't
my<00:03:59.459> actual<00:03:59.580> address<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.300> don't<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.050> don't<00:04:01.080> try

won't be able to find me so if I watched
the<00:04:05.280> current<00:04:05.550> address<00:04:05.910> sample<00:04:06.300> code<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.810> as

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
the current address sample code and as

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.560 
the current address sample code and as
you<00:04:07.860> can<00:04:08.010> see<00:04:08.040> here<00:04:08.340> my<00:04:08.519> laptop<00:04:09.239> has<00:04:09.330> come<00:04:09.480> up

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
ways up this is an accelerometer demo so

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.430 
ways up this is an accelerometer demo so
it<00:04:55.699> says<00:04:55.849> this<00:04:56.060> side<00:04:56.240> up<00:04:56.389> do<00:04:56.539> not<00:04:56.690> drop<00:04:56.960> I'll

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
you can't really see this one but if i

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.589 
you can't really see this one but if i
turn<00:05:07.250> my<00:05:07.490> phone<00:05:07.669> into<00:05:07.849> different<00:05:08.090> orientation

like<00:05:08.720> that<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.470> iphone<00:05:09.740> simulator<00:05:09.979> has

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
like that the iphone simulator has

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.149 
like that the iphone simulator has
flipped<00:05:10.699> I<00:05:10.970> flip<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.229> way<00:05:12.409> it'll<00:05:12.889> flip

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
flipped I flip it this way it'll flip

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.330 
flipped I flip it this way it'll flip
again<00:05:13.490> if<00:05:14.270> I<00:05:14.539> go<00:05:14.870> up<00:05:14.900> like<00:05:15.259> this<00:05:15.530> it'll<00:05:16.009> do<00:05:16.159> that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
again if I go up like this it'll do that

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.490 
again if I go up like this it'll do that
if<00:05:16.520> I<00:05:16.610> go<00:05:16.639> upside<00:05:17.060> down<00:05:17.300> it'll<00:05:17.659> do<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.050> it's

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
if I go upside down it'll do that it's

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.830 
if I go upside down it'll do that it's
it's<00:05:18.949> a<00:05:19.069> fully<00:05:19.430> functional<00:05:20.090> accelerometer

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
it's a fully functional accelerometer

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.870 
it's a fully functional accelerometer
it's<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:21.500> neat<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:21.860> even<00:05:22.099> turns<00:05:22.610> the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
it's so neat it even turns the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.300 
it's so neat it even turns the
orientation<00:05:23.570> on<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.990> simulator<00:05:24.259> and<00:05:25.009> this<00:05:25.159> is

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
orientation on the simulator and this is

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.439 
orientation on the simulator and this is
another<00:05:25.520> sample<00:05:25.849> that<00:05:26.030> I<00:05:26.150> got<00:05:26.300> off<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
another sample that I got off the

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.200 
another sample that I got off the
internet<00:05:26.659> it<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:27.349> it's<00:05:27.949> a<00:05:28.009> rolling<00:05:28.370> marble<00:05:28.789> so

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
internet it so it's a rolling marble so

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.870 
internet it so it's a rolling marble so
I'll<00:05:29.659> just<00:05:29.720> connect<00:05:30.139> again<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.830> as<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.729> can

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
I'll just connect again and as you can

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.580 
I'll just connect again and as you can
see<00:05:31.909> I<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.360> actually<00:05:32.630> roll<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:33.349> marble

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
see I can actually roll the marble

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.399 
see I can actually roll the marble
around<00:05:34.009> on<00:05:34.219> my<00:05:34.550> screen<00:05:35.259> using<00:05:36.259> the

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
around on my screen using the

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.499 
around on my screen using the
accelerometers<00:05:37.190> and<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.789> is<00:05:38.120> really

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
accelerometers and that is really

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.870 
accelerometers and that is really
amazing<00:05:39.020> like<00:05:40.449> honey<00:05:41.449> that's<00:05:41.719> so<00:05:41.930> cool<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:43.610> as
