London which was so hot it was
ridiculous<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.810> because<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.870> can't<00:03:19.049> have

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
ridiculous and because you can't have

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.240 
ridiculous and because you can't have
the<00:03:19.260> air<00:03:19.380> conditioning<00:03:19.829> on<00:03:19.889> when<00:03:20.100> this

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
cameras filming because it picks up all

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.110 
cameras filming because it picks up all
the<00:03:21.720> sound<00:03:22.220> but<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.340> didn't<00:03:23.549> finish<00:03:23.730> filming

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120

might be the glue because some people

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.700 
might be the glue because some people
are<00:05:28.790> allergic<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.240> latex<00:05:29.540> nick<00:05:29.900> is<00:05:30.080> so<00:05:30.650> you

brand<00:06:11.870> it<00:06:12.560> would<00:06:12.740> possibly<00:06:13.340> be<00:06:13.460> Becca<00:06:13.850> because

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
brand it would possibly be Becca because

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.530 
brand it would possibly be Becca because
