shoot propels you forward and I felt

shoot propels you forward and I felt
like<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> did<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.659> running<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> do

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
like it did when I was running in it do

you<00:01:28.650> watched<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.189> my<00:01:29.280> reviews<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you watched in my reviews you know that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.230 
you watched in my reviews you know that
I<00:01:30.630> am<00:01:31.140> pretty<00:01:31.439> much<00:01:31.530> 100%<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.490> stability<00:01:32.670> shoot

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
I am pretty much 100% of stability shoot

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.710 
I am pretty much 100% of stability shoot
runner<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.770> shoe<00:01:35.040> has<00:01:35.340> been<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.180> only

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
runner and this shoe has been the only

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.539 
runner and this shoe has been the only
one<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.290> could<00:01:37.439> even<00:01:37.920> tolerate<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
one that I could even tolerate and the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
one that I could even tolerate and the
reason<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.680> she<00:01:40.890> was

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
reason for that is because the she was

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.010 
reason for that is because the she was
very<00:01:41.310> torsionally<00:01:41.970> stable<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.720> plastic

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
very torsionally stable all this plastic

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350 
very torsionally stable all this plastic
right<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:43.439> adds<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.490> pretty<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
right here adds up to a really pretty a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.109 
right here adds up to a really pretty a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
pretty firm and stiff shoe which I found

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.690 
pretty firm and stiff shoe which I found
was<00:01:48.360> good<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.409> shoe<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.920> has<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> high<00:01:50.399> arch

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
was good the shoe also has a high arch

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
was good the shoe also has a high arch
the<00:01:50.970> arch<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.270> located<00:01:51.810> near<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.049> heel<00:01:52.350> which

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the arch is located near the heel which

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.639 
the arch is located near the heel which
is<00:01:52.770> exactly<00:01:53.280> where<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.180> issue<00:01:54.649> and
