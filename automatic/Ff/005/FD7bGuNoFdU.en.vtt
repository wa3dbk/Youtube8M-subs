even though in team deathmatch you
cannot<00:02:34.950> spawn<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.520> your<00:02:35.700> squad<00:02:36.030> mates<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.750> can

what I'm thinking so he's gonna get one
more<00:03:50.370> kill<00:03:50.700> on<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.060> way<00:03:51.209> there<00:03:51.570> we<00:03:52.200> do<00:03:52.440> know

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
that there's an enemy behind there

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.360

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
because we did see that math take off

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.370
