 to move with agility and speed 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.600
 we depend on a brilliant invention in the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.489
 that we rarely fall back but that has 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.420
 played a very important role in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.860
 build the modern world

 [Music] 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.990
 and making tires means a lot 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.140
 work must be resistant and 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.090
 Durable must be able to travel

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.090
 they should provide a comfortable ride

 [Music] 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.430
 how they get it is a story 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.430
 fantastic chemistry and engineering

 [Music] 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.119
 the work starts here at the plant 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.280
 hi-tech pirelli with some 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.050
 of the most modern industrial robots 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.039
 and an ingenious intelligent technology 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.659
 [Music] 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.469
 the tires are made up of four 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.569
 fundamental parts the shell is born with 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.110
 a double layer of rubber called napas 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.110
 hatched 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.970
 The layers are a mixture of rubber and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.360
 a synthetic fiber that is often 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.240
 associates rayon with home furniture 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.860
 Rayon makes it more resistant the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.860
 tire will need it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.800
 then come the side bands 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.450
 you will absorb the weight and pressure 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.460
 that the tire will have to endure 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.100
 to transport by road a 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.050
 vehicle that weighs a ton for 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.700
 Do your work the walls need 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.470
 of another component that is not usually 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.570
 associated with a steel tire 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.520
 this robot is inserting some 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.440
 steel reinforcements to hold the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.819
 tire interior 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.579
 [Music] 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.060
 in a row the robot joins the carcass in 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.189
 intelligent technology sidebands 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.499
 means that these machines do not just 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.130
 they do their job but they know when 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:45.869
 they have finished 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.869

 [Music] 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.340
 once the inner sections and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.950
 exteriors have been joined stretches a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.660
 thick layer of bombs so it ends what 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.430
 that in the business is known as 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.859
 green tire 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 the green tires look a lot like 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.049
 the tires that your car carries but 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.159
 they lack a fundamental characteristic 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.159
 Rotature band 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.769
 The design of the tread is 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.049
 essential for the behavior of 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.269
 tire but also has a function 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.140
 very surprising has to do the 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.480
 adequate noise 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.000
 If it makes too much noise the tire does not 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.350
 will get the industry certificate and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.350
 will not be sold 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.220
 in the laboratory pirelli this tire 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.040
 is about to undergo a test 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.510
 very unusual a round of tests that 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.310
 Normally they have to pass 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.189
 tires once they are finished 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.739
 if they listen carefully they will hear something 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.129
 incredibly strange the sound of 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.129
 silence 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.570
 This camera has been designed 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.570
 especially to be noise proof 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.040
 a tire has to go through the 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.600
 noise test if you want to get to 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.430
 stepping on a road 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.190
 if the technician believes that the housing is 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.070
 too noisy we intervene the wheel 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.070
 to reduce acoustic emissions 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.530
 the wheel is placed on a walker that 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.389
 simulates driving on a highway 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.370
 ultra sensitive microphones surround 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.620
 the wheel and send the data to a 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.169
 computer where the signal becomes 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.120
 lucky sound waves for this 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.169
 tire seems that its sound will end 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.169
 overcoming the test 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.580
 but there is something else much more difficult 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.580
 waiting for you when you turn the corner 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.669
 this is a normal road tire 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.229
 but is about to be treated as if 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.229
 it was a racing tire 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.500
 once the tire has been fixed 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.150
 firmly the technicians apply the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.150
 weight of a conventional crane 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.020
 and then they begin to increase the 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.020
 speed 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.480
 the idea is to see how the 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.050
 tire in extreme conditions 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.599
 [Music] 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.270
 at first glance it would be impossible to see what 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.129
 is what is happening to the tire 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.110
 even at a lower speed so 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.840
 the pirelli technicians have found a 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.240
 very ingenious solution to trigger a 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.259
 switch the camera lights up with 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.259
 strobe lights 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.509
 when they are regulated at the frequency 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.060
 correct the lights seem to show that 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.070
 the wheel has stopped moving this 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.889
 allows technicians to inspect the 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.530
 wheel while it is spinning 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.300
 but now the test team is 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.360
 point of trying something they do not 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.879
 they are usually going to make this wheel 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.800
 go faster than normal the wheel 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:21.960
 reaches the impressive speed of 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.960
 350 kilometers per hour 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.639
 that's a speed greater than that of a 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.639
 airplane in full takeoff 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:38.039
 surprisingly the wheel is intact 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.039
 has passed the test 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.810
 the new wheels have to overcome 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.480
 several tests first you have to 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:52.440
 add the tread to make 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.050
 that takes a little bit of baking this 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.419
 it's a healing furnace your brain's 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.880
 robot requests another green tire to 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:02.460
 half finished 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.650
 when the jaws of the mighty are opened 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.960
 oven we can see what that 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.720
 healing process 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.390
 [Music] 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.910
 each oven has a large bladder 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.460
 inflatable expands as the 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.590
 bladder pushes the wheel against the mold 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.230
 [Music] 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.980
 then the bladders are filled with steam 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.590
 and the wheel is cooked at a temperature of 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:30.060
 135 degrees centigrade 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.060
 [Music] 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:39.870
 this is the mold with which it is made in 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:43.650
 the tread of the green tire 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:46.130
 pressed against the mold and printed

 the band 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:52.270
 in just 12 minutes the wheel will be 

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:54.760
 completed 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.120
 when the wheel is opened in the machine 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.899
 comes out gently from its mold
