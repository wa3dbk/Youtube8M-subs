00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.030 
really good tutorial so you can go that
route<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> could<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.079> show<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.409> what's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040

route or I could just show you what's
going<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.420> multiple<00:01:54.930> levels

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
going on so we have multiple levels

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
going on so we have multiple levels
we're<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> pass<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.000> are

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
we're going to have to pass and you are

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
we're going to have to pass and you are
this<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.899> guy<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.219> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
catapult and year to protect whatever

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
catapult and year to protect whatever
each<00:02:02.520> level<00:02:02.820> explains<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.899> need<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> protect

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
each level explains you need to protect

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
each level explains you need to protect
so<00:02:04.799> we're<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.759> first<00:02:06.479> level<00:02:06.750> which<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
so we're on this first level which is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.469 
so we're on this first level which is
easy<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.580> says<00:02:08.700> another<00:02:09.000> day<00:02:09.179> taking
