00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
and I really want to blame it on the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.110 
and I really want to blame it on the
protein<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:07.910> next<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.489> curling<00:02:11.489> jelly

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
just don't really see a purpose for it

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.000 
just don't really see a purpose for it
since<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.560> rest<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.040> line<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:58.590> wealth
