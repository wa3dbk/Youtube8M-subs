hello and welcome back to part two of
the<00:00:04.040> medieval<00:00:05.040> moves<00:00:05.370> wall<00:00:05.790> true<00:00:06.290> we'll

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
the medieval moves wall true we'll

the medieval moves wall true we'll
continue<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.700> where<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.090> last<00:00:09.480> left<00:00:09.750> off

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
continue on where we last left off

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.299 
continue on where we last left off
killing<00:00:11.460> those<00:00:11.730> two<00:00:12.000> guys<00:00:12.769> it's<00:00:13.769> pretty<00:00:14.070> good

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
killing those two guys it's pretty good

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.880 
killing those two guys it's pretty good
I<00:00:14.700> suppose<00:00:15.920> another<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.390> take<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.480> mr.<00:00:18.869> oh<00:00:19.050> well

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
I suppose another to take a mr. oh well

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.640 
I suppose another to take a mr. oh well
see<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.699> restart<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.359> stars<00:00:21.900> don't<00:00:22.109> really

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
see it's restart the stars don't really

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.220 
see it's restart the stars don't really
do<00:00:23.580> much<00:00:23.609> damage<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.779> any<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.890> stand<00:00:26.760> them

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
do much damage if any to just stand them

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.099 
do much damage if any to just stand them
not<00:00:28.230> exactly<00:00:28.500> sure<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.869> easy

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
not exactly sure but that was easy

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.190 
not exactly sure but that was easy
enough<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:32.090> yeah<00:00:33.090> shoot<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
enough think yeah shoot this one and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 
enough think yeah shoot this one and
just<00:00:34.350> sort<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.239> enough<00:00:36.390> this

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
just sort that one it's good enough this

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470 
just sort that one it's good enough this
is<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> minigame<00:00:37.829> where<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.000> rotate<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
is a minigame where I have to rotate the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.619 
is a minigame where I have to rotate the
controller<00:00:39.870> until<00:00:40.739> those<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.309> lights<00:00:42.300> match

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
controller until those two lights match

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
controller until those two lights match
and<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.559> move<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.280> another<00:00:44.370> one

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and then just move on to another one

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
and then just move on to another one
it's<00:00:45.600> pretty<00:00:45.960> straightforward<00:00:46.289> really

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it's pretty straightforward really

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.040 
it's pretty straightforward really
simple<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.210> sort<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> minigames

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
simple but this is the sort of minigames

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.450 
simple but this is the sort of minigames
you<00:00:49.260> suppose<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.399> expect<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> full<00:00:51.660> game

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
you suppose to expect from the full game

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
you suppose to expect from the full game
this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> easy<00:00:53.910> enough<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:56.090> rotating<00:00:57.559> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
this is easy enough just rotating the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.389 
this is easy enough just rotating the
controller<00:00:59.370> which<00:01:00.050> Itsuki<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> game

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
controller which Itsuki in the game

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.579 
controller which Itsuki in the game
again<00:01:02.399> getting<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.120> loose<00:01:03.510> shooting<00:01:04.379> some

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
again getting some loose shooting some

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.940 
again getting some loose shooting some
barrels<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> boxes<00:01:05.570> two<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.920> which<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
barrels and boxes two in one which is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.789 
barrels and boxes two in one which is
not<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.670> used<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> demo<00:01:09.530> but<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
not going to be used in the demo but you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
not going to be used in the demo but you
know<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> game<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.299> guess

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
know it's just part of the game I guess

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.660 
know it's just part of the game I guess
so<00:01:13.439> they<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.549> keep<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.270> there

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
so they do you have to keep it in there

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.200 
so they do you have to keep it in there
so<00:01:17.670> pretty<00:01:18.000> straightforward<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.689> far<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.110> good

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
so pretty straightforward so far so good

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
so pretty straightforward so far so good
let's<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:24.049> Catherine<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> lever<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
let's see Catherine in the lever down is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.760 
let's see Catherine in the lever down is
just<00:01:26.189> again<00:01:27.259> pushing<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> controller<00:01:28.650> down

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
just again pushing the controller down

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.050 
just again pushing the controller down
as<00:01:29.130> well<00:01:30.049> she's<00:01:31.049> pretty<00:01:31.610> feels<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.820> you're

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
as well she's pretty feels like you're

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.880 
as well she's pretty feels like you're
doing<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> yeah<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.380> comes<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
doing it yeah so I think it comes to the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.880 
doing it yeah so I think it comes to the
coupling<00:01:38.490> per<00:01:38.700> envelope<00:01:39.000> game<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.619> there's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
coupling per envelope game and there's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
coupling per envelope game and there's
some<00:01:41.070> sort<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.670> mini<00:01:41.909> games<00:01:42.150> where<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
some sort of like mini games where you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.870 
some sort of like mini games where you
have<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:44.000> shoot<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.299> grapple<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:47.670> pass

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
have to shoot and grapple to pass

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.440 
have to shoot and grapple to pass
through<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.210> part<00:01:49.040> yeah<00:01:50.040> killing<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.119> few

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
through this part yeah killing a few

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.219 
through this part yeah killing a few
more<00:01:51.869> enemies<00:01:53.540> without<00:01:54.540> drinking<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.049> health

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
more enemies without drinking a health

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.300 
more enemies without drinking a health
potion<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.159> keep<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.610> helpful

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
potion just to you know keep my helpful

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
potion just to you know keep my helpful
in<00:01:59.310> erroring<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.090> guy<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:00.780> another

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
in erroring this guy and there's another

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.560 
in erroring this guy and there's another
one<00:02:01.170> coming<00:02:01.320> yeah<00:02:01.770> yes<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.790> file<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:04.219> big<00:02:05.219> miss

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
so yeah sweating them with the source

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.770 
so yeah sweating them with the source
it's<00:02:09.970> pretty<00:02:10.239> easy<00:02:10.360> enough<00:02:12.239> yes<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.569> didn't

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780

here comes the grappling part after the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.430 
here comes the grappling part after the
game<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:35.680> just<00:02:35.830> crap<00:02:36.160> all<00:02:36.310> there<00:02:36.810> shoot<00:02:37.810> that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
game we just crap all there shoot that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.259 
game we just crap all there shoot that
green<00:02:38.620> arrow<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.190> think<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.519> got<00:02:39.670> f2<00:02:40.030> should<00:02:40.180> be

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
green arrow I think you got f2 should be

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.789 
green arrow I think you got f2 should be
twice<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.810> grapple<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:42.400> stop<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:44.370> cranks<00:02:46.799> LC

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
twice to grapple to stop the cranks LC

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.030 
twice to grapple to stop the cranks LC
shoot<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.310> once<00:02:49.019> yep<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.319> only<00:02:50.470> stops<00:02:50.830> it

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
shoot it once yep it only stops it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.340 
shoot it once yep it only stops it
doesn't<00:02:51.459> move<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.150> away<00:02:52.239> if<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.080> should<00:02:53.260> it

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
doesn't move it away if I should it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.770 
doesn't move it away if I should it
again<00:02:53.769> on<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.670> pace<00:02:55.319> basically<00:02:56.319> yeah<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
again on this pace basically yeah now I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.000 
again on this pace basically yeah now I
can<00:02:59.140> just<00:03:00.420> grapple<00:03:01.420> there<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.780> move<00:03:01.959> on<00:03:02.200> so

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
can just grapple there and move on so

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.800 
can just grapple there and move on so
it's<00:03:03.130> pretty<00:03:03.390> straightforward<00:03:04.390> pretty

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it's pretty straightforward pretty

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.949 
it's pretty straightforward pretty
simple<00:03:05.110> as<00:03:05.200> well<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.760> climbing<00:03:07.690> up<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.900> stairs

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
simple as well so climbing up the stairs

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.559 
simple as well so climbing up the stairs
and<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.440> think<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:09.239> coming<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.360> an<00:03:10.450> end

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
and I think this is coming to an end

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.880 
and I think this is coming to an end
unfortunately<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:12.660> think<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.750> is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
unfortunately just think this is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.000 
unfortunately just think this is
fighting<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.010> guy<00:03:15.250> off<00:03:15.430> attacking<00:03:17.010> defends

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
fighting this guy off attacking defends

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.440 
fighting this guy off attacking defends
attack<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:20.400> defend<00:03:21.400> all<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.820> hit<00:03:22.030> me<00:03:22.180> still

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
attack and defend all you hit me still

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.020 
attack and defend all you hit me still
what<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.079> defended<00:03:23.440> though<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.040> it's<00:03:24.459> down

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
what I defended though and it's down

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.190 
what I defended though and it's down
again<00:03:25.799> shooting<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:28.390> pass<00:03:28.600> through<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.930> crank

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
again shooting to pass through the crank

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.470 
again shooting to pass through the crank
so<00:03:29.410> they<00:03:29.560> think<00:03:29.980> only<00:03:30.340> have<00:03:30.609> to<00:03:31.030> shoot<00:03:31.299> down

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
so they think only have to shoot down

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.539 
so they think only have to shoot down
once<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.950> when<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.670> fire<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:33.910> not<00:03:34.150> there

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
once just when the fire is not there

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.229 
once just when the fire is not there
should<00:03:36.549> give<00:03:36.730> me<00:03:36.880> plenty<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.630> time<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.049> move<00:03:38.170> on

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
should give me plenty of time to move on

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.819 
should give me plenty of time to move on
this<00:03:40.239> part<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:40.600> is<00:03:40.780> very<00:03:41.139> interesting<00:03:41.680> you

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
this part here is very interesting you

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.890 
this part here is very interesting you
have<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.130> straighten<00:03:42.519> your<00:03:42.700> arms<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.180> do<00:03:43.389> F

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
have to straighten your arms and do F

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.509 
have to straighten your arms and do F
tested<00:03:44.440> out<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:44.799> like<00:03:44.950> three<00:03:45.130> or<00:03:45.220> four<00:03:45.280> times

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
tested out this like three or four times

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.569 
tested out this like three or four times
on<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:45.819> part<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.989> adds<00:03:47.739> kind<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.310> like<00:03:48.459> to

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
on this part it adds kind of like to

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.360 
on this part it adds kind of like to
connect<00:03:48.970> where<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.079> detects<00:03:50.620> your<00:03:50.769> arms<00:03:51.130> not
