anyway<00:00:48.360> here's<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.930> works<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.680> have

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
anyway here's how it works if you have

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:57.350 
anyway here's how it works if you have
an<00:00:50.370> outer<00:00:50.580> shell<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.130> have<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
an outer shell and then you have the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.670 
an outer shell and then you have the
actual<00:00:57.540> filter<00:00:58.230> element<00:00:58.650> inside<00:00:59.390> this

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
actual filter element inside this

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.260 
actual filter element inside this
element<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.860> unique<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.820> what<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.150> are

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
element is unique this is what we are

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.920 
element is unique this is what we are
happy<00:01:04.520> inside<00:01:05.520> this<00:01:05.850> filter<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.720> see

that is a sweet that's created and the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.650 
that is a sweet that's created and the
sea<00:01:29.759> lion<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> treated<00:01:30.690> with<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:33.000> surface

so<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.360> happens<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.250> it's<00:01:41.250> what's<00:01:41.580> called<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
so what happens is it's what's called a

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.290 
so what happens is it's what's called a
molecular<00:01:42.180> sphere<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.490> on<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.729> surface<00:01:45.150> of

fiber here is also service treated with
what's<00:03:08.420> called<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.840> high<00:03:09.080> Zeta<00:03:09.790> treatment<00:03:10.790> and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
what's called a high Zeta treatment and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.360 
what's called a high Zeta treatment and
highs<00:03:11.750> data<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.380> symptoms<00:03:12.830> means<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.280> it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
highs data and symptoms means that it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.580 
highs data and symptoms means that it
has<00:03:13.520> a<00:03:13.580> very<00:03:13.760> strong<00:03:14.510> electro<00:03:15.320> positive

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
has a very strong electro positive

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.740 
has a very strong electro positive
charge<00:03:16.840> most<00:03:18.400> most<00:03:19.400> organisms<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.600> will

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
charge most most organisms that you will

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.190 
charge most most organisms that you will
find<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> negative<00:03:23.030> charge<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.720> an<00:03:23.840> actual

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
find have a negative charge of an actual

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.950 
find have a negative charge of an actual
negative<00:03:24.800> charge<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.270> high<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.900> the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
negative charge and so the high is a the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.010 
negative charge and so the high is a the
material<00:03:27.500> works<00:03:27.770> like<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.340> magnet<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.480> it

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
material works like a magnet and it

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.070 
material works like a magnet and it
actually<00:03:30.500> will<00:03:30.860> pull<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:32.210> contaminants<00:03:32.930> out

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
actually will pull the contaminants out

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.460 
actually will pull the contaminants out
of<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.410> stream<00:03:33.910> they<00:03:34.910> will<00:03:35.060> attach<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
of the stream they will attach to the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.490 
of the stream they will attach to the
the<00:03:37.370> glass<00:03:37.640> fiber

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the glass fiber

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.699 
the glass fiber
like<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> difference<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> shark<00:03:42.319> by<00:03:43.319> doing

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
like a difference in the shark by doing

first<00:03:47.099> engineering

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
first engineering

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.160 
first engineering
by<00:03:50.340> doing<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.240> have<00:03:51.480> very<00:03:51.900> large

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
by doing this you can have very large

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.400 
by doing this you can have very large
bowls<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.390> remove<00:03:55.380> very<00:03:55.860> small

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
bowls that you can remove very small

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.950 
bowls that you can remove very small
partner<00:03:58.460> so<00:03:59.460> when<00:03:59.880> you<00:03:59.970> have<00:04:00.210> larger<00:04:00.690> holes

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
partner so when you have larger holes

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.470 
partner so when you have larger holes
that<00:04:01.440> means<00:04:01.770> that<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.370> don't<00:04:02.490> have<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.910> pop

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
that means that you don't have to pop

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.010 
that means that you don't have to pop
your<00:04:03.660> eyeballs<00:04:03.870> out<00:04:04.320> trying<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.920> see<00:04:05.460> water

they tried to refit a filter Bob then

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.569 
they tried to refit a filter Bob then
and<00:04:16.770> was<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.310> depressor<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.060> experience

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
and was the depressor you experience

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.080 
and was the depressor you experience
today<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:21.169> reason<00:04:21.349> for<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.859> is<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.669> the

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
today the reason for that is that the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.809 
today the reason for that is that the
holes<00:04:23.300> have<00:04:23.599> to<00:04:23.629> be<00:04:23.780> very<00:04:24.080> small<00:04:24.470> in<00:04:25.340> order<00:04:25.610> to

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
holes have to be very small in order to

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.770 
holes have to be very small in order to
capture<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.440> story<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:28.310> saw<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.550> picture<00:04:29.000> I

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
capture the story you saw the picture I

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.210 
capture the story you saw the picture I
can<00:04:30.409> give<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.770> a<00:04:30.800> kind<00:04:31.159> a<00:04:31.220> little<00:04:31.370> bit<00:04:31.610> of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
can give you a kind a little bit of

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.990 
can give you a kind a little bit of
example<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:36.050> hear<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:37.159> human<00:04:37.490> hair<00:04:37.699> is

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
example here you hear the human hair is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.260 
example here you hear the human hair is
100<00:04:38.569> microns<00:04:39.080> in<00:04:40.009> diameter<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.879> if<00:04:40.970> you're<00:04:41.150> at

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
100 microns in diameter so if you're at

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.809 
100 microns in diameter so if you're at
cut<00:04:41.509> a<00:04:41.539> human<00:04:41.840> hair<00:04:42.020> in<00:04:42.139> half<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:43.430> look<00:04:43.580> at<00:04:43.729> it

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
cut a human hair in half and look at it

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.480 
cut a human hair in half and look at it
in<00:04:43.940> microscope<00:04:44.650> from<00:04:45.650> one<00:04:45.979> side<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.430> the

in Cryptosporidium or Giardia which are

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.409 
in Cryptosporidium or Giardia which are
the<00:04:53.900> two<00:04:54.110> major<00:04:54.440> causes<00:04:56.710> waterborne<00:04:57.710> illness

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
the two major causes waterborne illness

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.830 
the two major causes waterborne illness

between 3 microns by a bacteria like
e-coli<00:05:10.159> which<00:05:10.879> was<00:05:11.090> shown<00:05:11.659> on<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.990> screen<00:05:12.430> is

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
e-coli which was shown on the screen is

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.999 
e-coli which was shown on the screen is
an<00:05:13.580> average<00:05:13.940> size<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.599> the<00:05:14.719> point<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.740> my

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
an average size that the point to my

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.800 
an average size that the point to my
curls<00:05:16.370> which<00:05:16.580> means<00:05:16.849> they're<00:05:17.539> 10<00:05:17.780> times

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
curls which means they're 10 times

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.450 
curls which means they're 10 times
smaller<00:05:18.409> than<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.860> protozoa<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:21.050> then<00:05:21.889> the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
smaller than the protozoa and then the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.909 
smaller than the protozoa and then the
virus<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.449> I'm<00:05:23.659> excited<00:05:24.050> virus<00:05:24.860> are<00:05:25.520> in<00:05:26.270> the

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
virus and I'm excited virus are in the

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.850 
virus and I'm excited virus are in the
20<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.340> 40<00:05:28.880> nanometer<00:05:29.630> range

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
20 to 40 nanometer range

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.720 
20 to 40 nanometer range
means<00:05:31.040> they<00:05:31.790> are<00:05:32.800> about<00:05:33.800> a<00:05:33.830> hundred<00:05:34.220> times

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
means they are about a hundred times

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.620 
means they are about a hundred times
smaller<00:05:35.120> than<00:05:35.360> bacteria<00:05:36.610> so<00:05:37.610> you<00:05:38.060> start<00:05:38.510> to

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
smaller than bacteria so you start to

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.620 
smaller than bacteria so you start to
get<00:05:38.750> an<00:05:38.870> idea<00:05:38.990> of<00:05:39.380> how<00:05:39.860> small<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:41.180> holes<00:05:41.390> have

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
get an idea of how small the holes have

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.870 
get an idea of how small the holes have
to<00:05:41.660> be<00:05:41.840> in<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.080> filter<00:05:42.500> in<00:05:43.280> order<00:05:43.400> to<00:05:43.700> protect

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
to be in the filter in order to protect

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.010 
to be in the filter in order to protect
you<00:05:44.270> but<00:05:45.140> by<00:05:45.350> using<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.950> highest<00:05:46.340> data

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
you but by using the highest data

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.320 
you but by using the highest data
principle<00:05:48.020> we<00:05:48.860> can<00:05:49.040> have<00:05:49.190> larger<00:05:49.670> holes<00:05:49.880> and

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
principle we can have larger holes and

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.990 
principle we can have larger holes and
still<00:05:50.780> pull<00:05:51.080> those<00:05:51.580> particles<00:05:52.580> out<00:05:52.760> of<00:05:52.910> the

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
still pull those particles out of the

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.219 
still pull those particles out of the
water

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
water

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.490 
water
you<00:05:55.229> suck<00:05:56.220> so<00:05:56.250> hard
