00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
hey it's Briggs our and today on Lego

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.310 
hey it's Briggs our and today on Lego
element<00:00:13.559> daily<00:00:14.089> we<00:00:15.089> are<00:00:15.330> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.990> look<00:00:16.139> at

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
element daily we are going to look at

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.859 
element daily we are going to look at
another<00:00:17.270> 2x4<00:00:18.270> red<00:00:18.750> brick<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:20.520> time<00:00:20.869> it

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
another 2x4 red brick and this time it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.660 
another 2x4 red brick and this time it
is<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> different<00:00:22.199> type<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.130> red<00:00:23.430> brick

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
is a different type of red brick

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.570 
is a different type of red brick
although<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.240> kind<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.689> looks<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.050> DUPLO<00:00:25.740> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
although it kind of looks like DUPLO it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.900 
although it kind of looks like DUPLO it
is<00:00:26.760> not<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.359> DUPLO<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.980> brick<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.519> produced

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
is not a DUPLO this brick was produced

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.450 
is not a DUPLO this brick was produced
between<00:00:30.260> 2004<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:32.660> 2006<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.219> gonna

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
between 2004 and 2006 and I'm gonna

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.350 
between 2004 and 2006 and I'm gonna
compare<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.239> now<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.750> DUPLO<00:00:37.290> brick

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
compare it right now to a DUPLO brick

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.600 
compare it right now to a DUPLO brick
that<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:40.230> DUPLO<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> minifigure

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
that is DUPLO and this is a minifigure

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.799 
that is DUPLO and this is a minifigure
so<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.120> quite<00:00:48.530> larger<00:00:49.530> than<00:00:50.129> DUPLO<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
so this is quite larger than DUPLO it is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.790 
so this is quite larger than DUPLO it is
Quatro

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
Quatro

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.069 
Quatro
that's<00:00:53.309> qu<00:00:53.969> ATR<00:00:54.930> oh<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.079> much

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that's qu ATR oh and this was a much

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.229 
that's qu ATR oh and this was a much
larger<00:00:58.649> than<00:00:58.680> DUPLO<00:00:59.219> brick<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.820> was<00:01:00.000> made

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
larger than DUPLO brick that was made

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.650 
larger than DUPLO brick that was made
between<00:01:00.449> 2004<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.350> 2006<00:01:02.190> part<00:01:02.789> four<00:01:03.510> eight

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
between 2004 and 2006 part four eight

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320 
between 2004 and 2006 part four eight
two<00:01:03.899> zero<00:01:03.930> one<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.580> guess<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.150> really

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
two zero one and I guess it's for really

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 
two zero one and I guess it's for really
big<00:01:06.540> babies<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.170> don't<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
big babies I don't know it was just a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.560 
big babies I don't know it was just a
massive<00:01:09.030> massive<00:01:09.570> brick<00:01:10.970> alright<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
massive massive brick alright here it is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.219 
massive massive brick alright here it is
compared<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.290> regular<00:01:14.060> 2x4<00:01:15.060> brick<00:01:15.659> part

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
compared to a regular 2x4 brick part

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.530 
compared to a regular 2x4 brick part
three<00:01:16.409> thousand<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:18.000> when<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> get

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
three thousand and one and when I get

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
three thousand and one and when I get
done<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.259> different<00:01:19.530> bricks

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
done with all these different bricks

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280 
done with all these different bricks
we'll<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> comparison<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.659> show<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
we'll do a comparison and show all of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130 
we'll do a comparison and show all of
them<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.820> another<00:01:24.240> variety<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
them this is just another variety so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219 
them this is just another variety so
we've<00:01:25.290> seen<00:01:26.180> two<00:01:27.180> by<00:01:27.299> four<00:01:27.540> red<00:01:27.750> bricks<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
we've seen two by four red bricks and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.710 
we've seen two by four red bricks and
all<00:01:28.579> kinds<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> sizes<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.479> have

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
