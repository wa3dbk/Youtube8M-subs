00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 Ah 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.530
 This repair is for a minute 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.010
 You won't get tired even if you play hard and get in on the card 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.110
 That big 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.830
 This cushion 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 Showing off in minutes containing material 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.000
 To reduce 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.850
 I think I'm connected and I'm still big here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 Since it is not the Tteyuu elapsed shoes even such a place 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.490
 I feel that I'm getting support well 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.810
 It is good to say quite stand firm opportunity in selling physical 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.550
 Because there are many 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 Feet in the muff round to spike 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:07.110
 Really Well I'd had a lot that I or got caught Toka or chat Play 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.740
 From it is allowed to want to published to conceal Mr. 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.850
 Well that kind of thing is gone and that my play style 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.150
 I think it's a spike that will make the most of that, so open it 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.260
 Say this 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.930
 I am so glad that I was told that now the Emperor 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.170
 Arm long from now 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.290

 Had 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.810

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.180
 th 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:18.099
 I used to feel like kneeling 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.120
 I heard that this spy has cushioning, so it's daddy's burden on the knee 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.750
 But I thought it would be better 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.770
 I thought it was good 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:32.620
 Because there was a cushion and there was less pressure on the foot at the time of the stop 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.870
 I was able to move with the amount of energy I asked for a lightness in the spikes after all 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:42.030
 Character appearance 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:45.170
 Then I felt it was pretty heavy and I thought it was quite heavy, but it was quite light and worn 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.170
 There was no discomfort 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:55.740
 There was a feeling of fit, and it was hard to grow even when the turn was skipped and it was great. 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.569
 A university student's other good even if it takes to parent 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.530
 After all long-lasting spikes are better 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.530
 I think it's good 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:12.159
 I was worried I would not slip if the points were short, but surprisingly bite 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.299
 Tan Detsu soul was good can without slipping 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.720
 That is a place to back it and go to the approach was easy to do so step A 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.720
 There is 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.470
 Great
