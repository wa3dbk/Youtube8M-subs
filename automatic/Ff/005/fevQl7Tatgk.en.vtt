we'll go through it together here is the
one<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> snow<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.220> snow

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
one that I think this is snow is snow

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.950 
one that I think this is snow is snow
white<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
white this is the first one this is the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.330 
white this is the first one this is the
one<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.710> I'm<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
one that I think I'm really going to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.010 
one that I think I'm really going to
like<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> much<00:01:54.030> darker<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.950> them

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
like it's a much darker of all of them

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.850 
like it's a much darker of all of them
right<00:01:58.020> there<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.750> color<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.619> had

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
right there that color right there I had

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.170 
right there that color right there I had
to<00:02:01.950> make<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.310> course<00:02:02.520> difficult<00:02:03.030> for

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
to make it of course difficult for

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.010 
to make it of course difficult for
myself<00:02:03.299> why<00:02:04.170> couldn't<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.770> this

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
myself why couldn't just do this

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.690 
myself why couldn't just do this
so<00:02:05.500> that's<00:02:05.950> snow<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:09.099> don't<00:02:09.250> have<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> smell

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
so that's snow they don't have a smell

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.050 
so that's snow they don't have a smell
to<00:02:09.849> them<00:02:10.230> whatever<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:12.040> next<00:02:12.190> round<00:02:12.459> lipstick

color right there comes out like almost
pinkish<00:02:25.720> red<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.459> that's<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.819> little<00:02:27.940> right

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
pinkish red so that's a little right

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
consistency and it almost has like a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.330 
consistency and it almost has like a
gloss<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:36.790> um<00:03:37.590> choice<00:03:38.590> right<00:03:39.130> there

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340

so<00:03:40.299> if<00:03:40.359> you<00:03:40.480> guys<00:03:40.630> can<00:03:40.930> see<00:03:41.200> all<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
so if you guys can see all the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.979 
so if you guys can see all the
differences<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.970> darkest<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.569> obviously

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
differences the darkest is obviously

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.220 
differences the darkest is obviously
Snow<00:03:44.349> White<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.709> lightest<00:03:45.069> is<00:03:45.280> eros<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.660> then

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
Snow White the lightest is eros and then

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.400 
Snow White the lightest is eros and then
these<00:03:47.680> two<00:03:47.739> are<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.450> best<00:03:49.660> true<00:03:50.169> Reds

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
these two are the the best true Reds

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.000 
these two are the the best true Reds
which<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:50.980> choice<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:52.769> electra<00:03:53.769> and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
which is the choice and the electra and

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.009 
which is the choice and the electra and
then<00:03:54.459> fires<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.239> one<00:03:55.389> in<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.599> middle<00:03:55.720> which

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
then fires the one in the middle which

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.759 
then fires the one in the middle which
is<00:03:56.139> almost<00:03:56.319> like<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.450> off<00:03:58.450> kind<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.870> red<00:03:59.019> so

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
is almost like a and off kind of red so

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.720 
is almost like a and off kind of red so
we're<00:03:59.889> going<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.069> figure<00:04:00.280> out<00:04:00.400> which<00:04:00.489> one<00:04:00.669> I

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
we're going to figure out which one I

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.370 
we're going to figure out which one I
like<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.120> that's<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.480> first<00:04:01.750> thing<00:04:01.840> this<00:04:02.200> is

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
like so that's the first thing this is

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:12.490 
like so that's the first thing this is
from<00:04:02.680> there<00:04:03.609> as<00:04:03.819> well

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.560 

you
