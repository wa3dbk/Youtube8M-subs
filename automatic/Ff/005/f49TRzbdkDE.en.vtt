00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.720
 There were several other types by Daiso 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.560
 There were a lot of types 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.200
 There were many other than these three. Heart-shaped 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.500
 Isn't this pretty easy to use? 

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:11.092
 Opening and closing is like this 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.020
 Well, I think it is a simple and easy to use type 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.180
 It is such a feeling when you make a flower pattern up 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.620
 I can not paste well, not at all 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.800
 I also like this dot pattern 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.140
 I can not stick well after all 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.180
 I am not familiar with it 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.480
 Well, in this 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.580
 After all it is this that it was pasted well first 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.640
 Flag type, it is good 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.500
 There is a sample picture 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.900
 The corner looks like this 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.500
 There is a picture attached 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.040
 It is NO.3 but also this 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.780
 About three types. Was there about four in all? 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.740
 It was quite 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.860
 Because it is a product that has been sold before 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.520
