00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 or the p that only he has tempered 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.290
 welcome to the channel of the things of the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.470
 lola today I bring you a trick of the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.590
 that I use a lot of work for myself 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.200
 sawdust paste a product 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.400
 wonderful that can give us a lot 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.619
 of service so we started to do 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.960
 this mass we are only going to need 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.609
 two basic ingredients 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.160
 sawdust and carpenter's tail I repeat 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.720
 always in my pastries and in my more to the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.360
 carpenter's school must be of 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.460
 good quality has to have a thickness 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.680
 well that is not very liquid so that 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.680
 have good grip and above all 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.740
 quite hard 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.470
 the sebin you have to do it you have to put it 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.930
 in a cho dinner or in a colander and have it 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.450
 so that it is as fine as possible 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.290
 because if not then at the time of throwing it 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.980
 in hose 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.870
 in pastry bag or in a chair there is no 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.010
 how it has to be then 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.250
 I start by queuing 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 in a container that then close 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.200
 airtight 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.350
 since all the pastas if left 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.440
 open we take the risk of course 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.100
 that I do not know what I'm going to put up 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.250
 that saturated we are moving moving this 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.370
 pasta is very good and is very light 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.050
 It is usually used to make 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.620
 relief 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.150
 and I also used it for one thing 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.740
 for when for example restored some 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.140
 furniture or something and I want me to stay 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.360
 that wood look because ultimately 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.560
 I make the pasta this and I put the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.990
 crack and is perfectly integrated 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.360
 inside the like a wooden putty 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.650
 like a wood paste but made 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.860
 homemade 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.110
 is a little more cow than the pasta 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.600
 of wood but then passing a sandpaper 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.270
 above that was your pearl clear how 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.430
 it is mixed depending on how the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.290
 Then you want the work that 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.740
 you want to do it you have to leave more or 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.230
 less 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.230
 hard stays hold on the stick 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.990
 perfectly so it's great 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.890
 to do highlight work take the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.480
 dyes very very very well and I want the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.840
 I'm going to do it because we're also going 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.320
 to start doing work with her 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.140
 besides that the sawdust is the product 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.930
 most common that can be found in 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.890
 any place like that with this texture 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.740
 fix it does not fall pretty lightly good 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.590
 It has no weight and we can use it 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.580
 in a lot of work, look, I'm 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.100
 painting it so you can see the power of 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.950
 associating the painting that I have what 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.070
 I'm doing with liquid watercolor and 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.710
 see how good this is painted can 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.320
 serve very well to make the floor of 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.930
 your nativity scenes that takes you there 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.700
 how is it 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.310
 the super thickness if you go and the board 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.500
 and on the ground and doing so 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.750
 It is leaving as if it were boiling chair 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.640
 air thrown which was liquid but 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.230
 see if I put an acrylic paint 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.620
 water -based paints for school use the same 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.690
 he also takes me perfectly and I can 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.190
 make the tone that I want 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.440
 you will see how good 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.300
 that is painting it therefore you can 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.670
 make mass of all colors that 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.590
 you want 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.470
 and have them ready for you 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.260
 relief pictures for the floor of 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:55.110
 Bethlehem Doll House online tourism 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.110
 for model you can use it for 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.909
 countless things so preparing the 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.329
 mass having it and ready because we're going 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.840
 to do super super super work 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.150
 nice with it a great texture 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.269
 to create volumes and to do 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.410
 many things I hope that I have 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.889
 liked that the work deserved the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.469
 pain 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.749
 put it into practice and that for 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:25.860
 course when we start working with 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:29.129
 they send me photos their result 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.060
 a command kiss I kiss kisses and up 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.060
