you

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.200 

in<00:00:09.890> this<00:00:10.890> video<00:00:11.130> I'll<00:00:11.460> explore<00:00:11.940> multiple

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
in this video I'll explore multiple

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.660 
in this video I'll explore multiple
occlusion<00:00:12.870> passes<00:00:13.320> as<00:00:13.470> different<00:00:14.309> ways<00:00:14.460> of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
occlusion passes as different ways of

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.609 
occlusion passes as different ways of
dealing<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.030> dirt<00:00:15.420> I've<00:00:15.600> got<00:00:16.230> my<00:00:16.350> shipping

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
dealing with dirt I've got my shipping

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.130 
dealing with dirt I've got my shipping
container<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.220> well<00:00:17.550> half<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> anyway<00:00:18.570> I've

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
container or well half of it anyway I've

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.929 
container or well half of it anyway I've
done<00:00:19.380> some<00:00:19.529> optimization<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> occlusion

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
done some optimization so the occlusion

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.120 
done some optimization so the occlusion
bakes<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.360> cleanly<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.080> want<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.860> go<00:00:22.950> through

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
bakes out cleanly I want to go through

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.740 
bakes out cleanly I want to go through
and<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.520> more<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.880> some<00:00:24.119> point<00:00:24.390> but

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and do a little more at some point but

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.150 
and do a little more at some point but
now<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.200> bake<00:00:25.380> out<00:00:25.560> multiple

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
now I'm going to bake out multiple

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.760 
now I'm going to bake out multiple
occlusion<00:00:26.610> passes<00:00:27.169> sometimes<00:00:28.169> we<00:00:28.320> want<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
occlusion passes sometimes we want to

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.859 
occlusion passes sometimes we want to
different<00:00:29.070> parts<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> occlusion<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.599> want

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
different parts to the occlusion we want

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900 
different parts to the occlusion we want
local<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.800> tight<00:00:32.070> occlusion<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
local very tight occlusion in all the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.910 
local very tight occlusion in all the
corners<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.110> those<00:00:34.290> details<00:00:34.649> pop

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
corners to really make those details pop

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
corners to really make those details pop
out<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.000> bigger<00:00:36.329> more<00:00:36.810> spread

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
out and then a bigger more spread

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.900 
out and then a bigger more spread
occlusion<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.829> things<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.160> dirt<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.730> rust

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910

that<00:00:39.210> creeps<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.780> surfaces<00:00:40.320> I'll<00:00:40.920> press<00:00:41.250> 0<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that creeps up surfaces I'll press 0 and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
that creeps up surfaces I'll press 0 and
pull<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> render<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.750> texture<00:00:43.050> dialogue

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pull up the render to texture dialogue

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.410 
pull up the render to texture dialogue
again<00:00:43.650> I'm<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.970> to<00:00:45.030> leave<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.300> the

again I'm going to leave all the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
again I'm going to leave all the

occlusion image but i'm going to rename
this<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.900> right<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.800> I've<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.010> an<00:00:53.250> occlusion

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this one right now I've got an occlusion

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.100 
this one right now I've got an occlusion

in here I'm going to render this out as

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
in here I'm going to render this out as
a<00:01:03.360> Targa<00:01:03.810> as<00:01:03.960> an<00:01:04.650> important<00:01:05.040> note<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.369> you're

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
a Targa as an important note when you're

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
a Targa as an important note when you're
rendering<00:01:05.729> intermediate<00:01:06.659> textures<00:01:07.110> like

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
rendering intermediate textures like

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
rendering intermediate textures like
this<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> format<00:01:09.000> that's<00:01:09.030> uncompressed

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
this use a format that's uncompressed

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.100 
this use a format that's uncompressed
disk<00:01:10.439> space<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.979> relatively<00:01:11.400> cheap<00:01:11.759> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
disk space is relatively cheap and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.719 
disk space is relatively cheap and
losing<00:01:13.110> data<00:01:13.259> by<00:01:13.649> compressing<00:01:14.130> such<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.609> with

losing data by compressing such as with
a<00:01:14.759> JPEG<00:01:15.270> means<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.780> may<00:01:15.899> have<00:01:16.079> artifacts<00:01:16.590> in

a JPEG means you may have artifacts in
your<00:01:16.859> texture<00:01:17.249> so<00:01:17.999> for<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> intermediate

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509

your texture so for the intermediate
files<00:01:19.079> that<00:01:19.380> you're<00:01:19.469> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> render<00:01:20.249> use

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
files that you're going to render use

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.029 
files that you're going to render use
and<00:01:21.149> then<00:01:21.270> throw<00:01:21.810> away<00:01:21.990> render<00:01:22.920> them

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
and then throw away render them

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.679 
and then throw away render them
uncompressed<00:01:23.609> so<00:01:23.819> you<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.179> full<00:01:24.420> data

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
uncompressed so you get your full data

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.639 
uncompressed so you get your full data
there<00:01:24.929> I'll<00:01:25.170> click<00:01:25.859> Save<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.399> okay<00:01:27.389> in<00:01:27.649> this

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
there I'll click Save and okay in this

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.889 
there I'll click Save and okay in this
case<00:01:28.859> what<00:01:29.069> I'm<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.399> do<00:01:29.609> is<00:01:29.789> very<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
case what I'm going to do is very that

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.870 
case what I'm going to do is very that
distance<00:01:31.289> of<00:01:31.409> occlusion<00:01:31.889> the<00:01:32.490> original

distance of occlusion the original
distance<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.329> had<00:01:33.450> done<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.109> 18<00:01:34.499> and<00:01:34.710> that

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
distance I had done was at 18 and that

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.010 
distance I had done was at 18 and that
really<00:01:35.189> let<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.549> occlusion<00:01:35.999> spread<00:01:36.359> decently

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
really let the occlusion spread decently

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.109 
really let the occlusion spread decently
in<00:01:37.229> local<00:01:37.590> areas<00:01:37.759> now<00:01:38.759> i'm<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:38.999> to<00:01:39.060> push

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
in local areas now i'm going to push

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.029 
in local areas now i'm going to push
that<00:01:39.420> max<00:01:39.689> distance<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.289> little<00:01:40.499> farther<00:01:40.770> out

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
that max distance a little farther out

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.239 
that max distance a little farther out
i'll<00:01:41.310> push<00:01:41.969> it<00:01:41.999> out<00:01:42.209> to<00:01:42.240> 48<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.380> i'm<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
i'll push it out to 48 and i'm going to

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.340 
i'll push it out to 48 and i'm going to
play<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.789> spread<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.389> bit<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
play with the spread a little bit this

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.809

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
how well it worked it's not bad I can

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
see places where i should probably

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.420 
see places where i should probably
render<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.720> higher<00:04:10.989> resolution<00:04:11.320> but<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.280> nice

render a higher resolution but the nice

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.160 
render a higher resolution but the nice
thing<00:04:12.459> with<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.090> i'm<00:04:13.239> getting<00:04:13.570> all<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
thing with it is i'm getting all the

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.900 
thing with it is i'm getting all the
detail<00:04:14.560> in<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.799> corrugations<00:04:15.370> popping<00:04:15.790> out

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.090 
detail in the corrugations popping out
here<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.330> it's<00:04:17.140> getting<00:04:17.320> me<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.680> shading

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
here and it's getting me the shading

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.430 
here and it's getting me the shading
along<00:04:18.400> those<00:04:18.580> corrugations<00:04:19.299> correctly<00:04:19.810> this

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
along those corrugations correctly this

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.870 
along those corrugations correctly this
is<00:04:20.620> really<00:04:20.769> going<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.100> add<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:21.459> model

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
is really going to add to that model

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.090 
is really going to add to that model
what<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.660> can<00:04:22.870> do<00:04:23.020> now<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.229> on<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.860> layer

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
what I can do now is on this layer

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.820 
what I can do now is on this layer
actually<00:04:24.760> paint<00:04:25.000> in<00:04:25.150> white<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.740> start<00:04:26.740> to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
actually paint in white and start to

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.030 
actually paint in white and start to
erode<00:04:26.979> or<00:04:27.520> erase<00:04:28.120> some<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.390> that<00:04:28.600> rust

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
erode or erase some of that rust

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.260 
erode or erase some of that rust
alternately<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.310> can<00:04:30.610> paint<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:31.060> same

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
alternately I can paint in that same

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.330 
alternately I can paint in that same

rust color on the occlusion and further

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.520 
rust color on the occlusion and further
enhance<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.940> as<00:04:34.060> if<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.570> rust<00:04:34.780> had<00:04:34.960> started<00:04:35.440> up

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
enhance it as if the rust had started up

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.740 
enhance it as if the rust had started up
here<00:04:35.680> at<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.770> top<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.190> drip
