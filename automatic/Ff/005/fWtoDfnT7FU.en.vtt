creates labels on how sugar avoid all
cost<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:05.309> makes<00:01:05.580> us<00:01:05.790> gain

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
cost because it just makes us gain

weight<00:01:06.780> yeah<00:01:07.080> definitely<00:01:07.530> yeah<00:01:07.860> makes<00:01:08.159> us

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
weight yeah definitely yeah makes us

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.969 
weight yeah definitely yeah makes us
blurt<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> makes<00:01:09.090> us<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:10.020> inflamed<00:01:10.590> if

blurt it it makes us really inflamed if

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.360 
blurt it it makes us really inflamed if
it's<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.120> terrible<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.810> us<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> people

it's just so terrible for us so people

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.040 
it's just so terrible for us so people
can<00:01:14.490> replace<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.090> natural<00:01:15.210> sugars<00:01:15.780> sure

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
can replace it with natural sugars sure

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.570 
can replace it with natural sugars sure
like<00:01:16.380> maple<00:01:16.740> syrup<00:01:16.770> honey

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
like maple syrup honey

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.240 
like maple syrup honey
yeah<00:01:18.000> even<00:01:18.150> raw<00:01:18.780> cane<00:01:19.080> sugar<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.770> upgrade

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
yeah even raw cane sugar is an upgrade

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.380 
yeah even raw cane sugar is an upgrade
okay<00:01:21.170> yeah<00:01:22.170> okay<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:22.980> then<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> second<00:01:23.940> usual

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
okay yeah okay and then the second usual

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.080 
okay yeah okay and then the second usual
suspect<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> avoid<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> gluten<00:01:25.860> Road<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:26.940> we

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
suspect to avoid is gluten Road so we

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.340 
suspect to avoid is gluten Road so we
hear<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.570> time<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.080> I'm

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
hear this all the time you know I'm

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.810 
hear this all the time you know I'm
gluten<00:01:28.620> free<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.370> actually<00:01:29.670> easier

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
gluten free and it's actually easier

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.330 
gluten free and it's actually easier
than<00:01:30.240> people<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.780> once<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
than people think once you get the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.690 
than people think once you get the
staples<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.180> how<00:01:33.870> to<00:01:33.930> eat<00:01:34.530> clean<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.070> yeah<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
staples of how to eat clean up yeah and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520 
staples of how to eat clean up yeah and
so<00:01:35.850> gluten<00:01:36.240> using<00:01:36.510> a<00:01:36.600> lot<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> things<00:01:37.170> also

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
so gluten using a lot of things also

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530 
so gluten using a lot of things also
could<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.370> just<00:01:38.520> list<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> things<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.330> for

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
could you just list the things that for

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.730 
could you just list the things that for
gluten<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:39.930> obvious<00:01:40.230> things<00:01:40.440> because

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
gluten the obvious things because

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.930 
gluten the obvious things because
something<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.160> confused<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.640> what's

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
something will get confused about what's

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.310 
something will get confused about what's
wheat<00:01:42.150> free<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.510> what's<00:01:42.660> good<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.050> what's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
wheat free and what's good and what's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.399 
wheat free and what's good and what's
good<00:01:43.500> since<00:01:43.890> Gibson<00:01:44.880> okay<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.480> gluten<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
good since Gibson okay so gluten is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.989 
good since Gibson okay so gluten is
naturally<00:01:46.859> occurring<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.310> nature<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
naturally occurring in nature it is a

as soon as people give up gluten they

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.319 
as soon as people give up gluten they
usually<00:02:24.900> find<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.500> their<00:02:25.680> energy

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
okay and the fourth usual suspect is

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.629 
okay and the fourth usual suspect is
chemicals<00:03:37.169> right<00:03:37.560> so

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
products so we a consumer you so many

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.570 
products so we a consumer you so many
chemicals<00:03:50.480> every<00:03:51.470> day<00:03:51.620> without<00:03:51.830> even<00:03:52.280> knowing

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
chemicals every day without even knowing

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.850 
chemicals every day without even knowing
it<00:03:52.790> yeah<00:03:52.970> so<00:03:53.570> we<00:03:54.080> could<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.350> experiencing

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
it yeah so we could be experiencing

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.000 
it yeah so we could be experiencing
depression<00:03:55.040> anxiety<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.860> feeling<00:03:57.860> really

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
depression anxiety and feeling really

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.130 
depression anxiety and feeling really
tired<00:03:58.100> yeah<00:03:59.000> because<00:03:59.180> we're<00:03:59.570> having<00:03:59.870> all

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
tired yeah because we're having all

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.320 
tired yeah because we're having all
these<00:04:00.290> chemicals<00:04:00.890> it's<00:04:01.640> very<00:04:01.820> hard<00:04:02.090> for<00:04:02.270> our

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
these chemicals it's very hard for our

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.860 
these chemicals it's very hard for our
immune<00:04:02.660> system<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.410> keep<00:04:03.890> up<00:04:04.100> with<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.459> absent

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
immune system to keep up with the absent

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.949 
immune system to keep up with the absent
digest<00:04:05.870> about<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.670> have<00:04:08.000> less<00:04:08.330> chemicals

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
digest about so to have less chemicals

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.370 
digest about so to have less chemicals
just<00:04:09.230> think<00:04:10.180> how<00:04:11.180> much<00:04:11.330> nutrition<00:04:11.810> am<00:04:12.260> i

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
just think how much nutrition am i

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.470 
just think how much nutrition am i
getting<00:04:12.770> from<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:13.130> meal<00:04:13.370> or<00:04:13.670> this<00:04:13.850> drink<00:04:14.209> and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
getting from this meal or this drink and

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.420 
getting from this meal or this drink and
so<00:04:15.050> we<00:04:15.170> want<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.530> be<00:04:15.620> getting<00:04:15.890> nutrition<00:04:16.340> at

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
so we want to be getting nutrition at

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.699 
so we want to be getting nutrition at
every<00:04:16.640> meal<00:04:16.820> instead<00:04:17.329> of<00:04:17.450> chemicals<00:04:18.079> yeah<00:04:18.410> and

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
every meal instead of chemicals yeah and

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.680 
every meal instead of chemicals yeah and
chemicals<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.609> things<00:04:19.820> like<00:04:20.120> additives

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
chemicals of things like additives

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.290 
chemicals of things like additives
preservatives<00:04:21.910> genetically<00:04:22.910> modified

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
preservatives genetically modified

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.190 
preservatives genetically modified
organisms<00:04:24.250> flavorings<00:04:25.250> colorings<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.510> any

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
organisms flavorings colorings and any

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.310 
organisms flavorings colorings and any
ingredient<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:27.919> is<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.040> number<00:04:28.520> yes

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
ingredient that is a number yes

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.520 
ingredient that is a number yes
so<00:04:30.320> ingredient<00:04:31.190> two<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.580> zero<00:04:32.000> yeah<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:32.840> not<00:04:33.410> an

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
so ingredient two to zero yeah is not an

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.710 
so ingredient two to zero yeah is not an
actual<00:04:33.770> food<00:04:34.040> it's<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.520> chemical<00:04:34.820> created<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:35.630> a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
actual food it's a chemical created in a

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.170 
actual food it's a chemical created in a
lab<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.320> often<00:04:36.620> times<00:04:36.860> they're<00:04:37.580> born<00:04:37.850> from

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
lab and often times they're born from

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.220 
lab and often times they're born from
petrol<00:04:38.690> gas<00:04:39.500> really<00:04:40.280> toxic<00:04:40.960> products<00:04:41.960> so

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
petrol gas really toxic products so

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.070 
petrol gas really toxic products so
avoid<00:04:42.770> chemicals<00:04:43.610> at<00:04:43.760> all<00:04:43.850> costs<00:04:44.270> yes<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:44.810> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
avoid chemicals at all costs yes and the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.530 
avoid chemicals at all costs yes and the
fifth<00:04:45.320> usual<00:04:45.650> suspect<00:04:46.130> is<00:04:46.340> quick-fix<00:04:47.120> foods

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
fifth usual suspect is quick-fix foods
