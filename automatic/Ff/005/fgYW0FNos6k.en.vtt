the size of tile based on which of these
fall<00:02:16.970> off<00:02:17.150> yeah<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.540> large<00:02:17.780> falls<00:02:18.260> off

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
fall off yeah if a large falls off

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.490 
fall off yeah if a large falls off
so<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.709> we

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
so that we

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.740 
so that we
just<00:02:23.100> keep<00:02:23.340> having<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.150> sometimes

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
just keep having to do this sometimes

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.290 
just keep having to do this sometimes
just<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> arcade<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.490> guess<00:02:26.850> like<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
just like the arcade I guess like the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.360 
just like the arcade I guess like the
arcade

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.460 

there<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.030> go<00:02:31.150> there<00:02:31.390> we<00:02:31.420> go<00:02:31.629> get<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.080> large<00:02:32.290> one

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
there we go there we go get a large one

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.979 
there we go there we go get a large one
off<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.220> now<00:02:33.400> we<00:02:33.459> can<00:02:33.849> then<00:02:34.269> choose<00:02:34.629> either

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
off and now we can then choose either

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.899 
off and now we can then choose either
the<00:02:35.140> large<00:02:35.440> file<00:02:35.680> or<00:02:35.890> one<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.370> lesser<00:02:36.760> value

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
the large file or one of lesser value

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.510 
the large file or one of lesser value
okay

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
okay

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.540 
okay
so<00:02:40.090> once<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.630> are<00:02:41.230> laying<00:02:41.470> tile<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.370> lay

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
so once you are laying tile you can lay

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.010 
so once you are laying tile you can lay
one<00:02:42.820> or<00:02:43.120> two<00:02:43.450> tile<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:45.010> road<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:46.600> fourth

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
one or two tile on the road the fourth

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.810 
one or two tile on the road the fourth
thing<00:02:47.110> forth<00:02:47.830> action<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.700> this

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
thing forth action you can do in this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.850 
thing forth action you can do in this
game<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.510> can<00:02:49.660> move<00:02:49.750> your<00:02:49.930> travelers<00:02:50.440> the

goal is to get your traveler down to

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.990 
goal is to get your traveler down to
Brundisium<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.680> way<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.040> works<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.550> there's

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
Brundisium the way that works is there's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.140 
Brundisium the way that works is there's
a<00:02:58.060> cheat<00:02:58.330> sheet<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.930> back<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.350> score

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
a cheat sheet on the back of the score

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.000 
a cheat sheet on the back of the score
where<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.240> tells<00:03:01.420> us<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.410> move<00:03:02.560> one<00:03:02.800> tile

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
where it tells us that to move one tile

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.640 
where it tells us that to move one tile
you<00:03:03.250> cost<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.760> one<00:03:03.970> coin<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.810> move<00:03:04.960> two<00:03:05.380> tiles

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
you cost you one coin to move two tiles

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.710 
you cost you one coin to move two tiles
it<00:03:05.890> costs<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.310> three<00:03:06.520> coin<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.570> move

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
it costs you three coin and to move

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.520 
it costs you three coin and to move
three<00:03:08.110> tiles<00:03:08.350> that<00:03:08.470> cost<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.860> six<00:03:09.400> coin<00:03:09.670> okay

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
three tiles that cost you six coin okay

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.500 
three tiles that cost you six coin okay
so<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.650> can<00:03:11.800> only<00:03:12.010> move<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.370> built<00:03:12.640> Road<00:03:12.850> make

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
so you can only move on built Road make

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.720 
so you can only move on built Road make
sense<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.380> as<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> road<00:03:14.800> becomes<00:03:15.160> built<00:03:15.610> you

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
sense so as the road becomes built you

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.970 
sense so as the road becomes built you
have<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.940> follow<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.420> segment<00:03:16.900> your<00:03:17.710> then

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
have to follow the segment your then

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.850 
have to follow the segment your then
you're<00:03:18.100> going<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.280> take<00:03:18.490> your<00:03:18.990> man<00:03:19.990> and<00:03:20.290> move

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
you're going to take your man and move

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.680 
you're going to take your man and move
it<00:03:21.070> towards<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.730> city

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
it towards the city

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.870 
it towards the city
once<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.470> stop<00:03:24.770> in<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.070> city<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> have<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.670> stop

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
once you stop in a city you have to stop

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.910 
once you stop in a city you have to stop
in<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> city<00:03:26.270> there's<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.230> little<00:03:27.320> bonus<00:03:27.590> for

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
in a city there's a little bonus for

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.260 
in a city there's a little bonus for
whoever<00:03:28.130> gets<00:03:28.340> there<00:03:28.490> first<00:03:28.520> stay<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.060> shape

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
whoever gets there first stay in shape

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.680 
whoever gets there first stay in shape
so<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:30.200> bonus<00:03:30.530> happens<00:03:30.920> when<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.700> take<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
so the bonus happens when you take the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.480 
so the bonus happens when you take the
top<00:03:32.930> tile<00:03:33.230> which<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.620> worth<00:03:33.770> six<00:03:34.070> points<00:03:34.130> at

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
top tile which is worth six points at

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.559 
top tile which is worth six points at
the<00:03:34.520> end<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.820> game<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.270> got<00:03:36.050> there<00:03:36.230> first

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
the end of the game I got there first

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.349 
the end of the game I got there first
I<00:03:37.659> symbolize<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.799> by<00:03:38.950> putting<00:03:39.129> that<00:03:39.400> token

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
I symbolize it by putting that token

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.920 
I symbolize it by putting that token
down<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.920> also<00:03:42.310> represents<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:43.030> now<00:03:43.239> it's

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
down that also represents that now it's

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.679 
down that also represents that now it's
one<00:03:44.290> coin<00:03:44.739> cheaper<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.909> move<00:03:46.090> along<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.510> road

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
one coin cheaper to move along the road

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.929 
one coin cheaper to move along the road
for<00:03:46.930> everybody<00:03:47.349> else<00:03:47.499> behind<00:03:47.769> ah<00:03:48.129> so<00:03:48.730> allows

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
for everybody else behind ah so allows

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.180 
for everybody else behind ah so allows
everybody<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.359> catch<00:03:49.599> up<00:03:49.780> okay

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
everybody to catch up okay

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.850 
everybody to catch up okay
so<00:03:51.820> yeah<00:03:51.970> again<00:03:52.270> that<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.080> one<00:03:53.440> action

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
so yeah again that is it so one action

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.940 
so yeah again that is it so one action
to<00:03:54.670> action<00:03:55.150> building<00:03:56.020> Road<00:03:56.200> three<00:03:56.470> action<00:03:56.800> or

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
to action building Road three action or

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.050 
to action building Road three action or
moving<00:03:57.220> your<00:03:57.310> traveler<00:03:57.670> you're<00:03:57.760> going<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.000> do

moving your traveler you're going to do

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.460 
moving your traveler you're going to do

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
one of those per turn so it's pretty

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.230 
one of those per turn so it's pretty
fast<00:03:59.740> paced<00:04:00.040> moving<00:04:00.370> game<00:04:00.520> for<00:04:00.730> four<00:04:00.910> people
