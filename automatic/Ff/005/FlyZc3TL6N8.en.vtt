this doesn't have a clutch just an

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.980 
this doesn't have a clutch just an

miles on the freeways obviously if you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.709 
miles on the freeways obviously if you
need<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> break<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.549> got<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> break<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
need a break you got a break but got to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.030 
need a break you got a break but got to
be<00:01:57.810> light<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> brakes<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
be light on the brakes if you can and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.530 
be light on the brakes if you can and
then<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> engine<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.119> don't<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
then for the engine you don't want to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
then for the engine you don't want to
drive<00:02:00.750> fast<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> first<00:02:01.740> thousand<00:02:02.280> miles

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
drive fast for the first thousand miles

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.870 
drive fast for the first thousand miles
so<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.360> consider<00:02:03.899> fast<00:02:04.290> over<00:02:04.710> 65<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> other

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so I consider fast over 65 and the other

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.429 
so I consider fast over 65 and the other
thing<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.450> change<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:07.049> speeds

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
thing is you want to change your speeds

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.320 
thing is you want to change your speeds
you<00:02:08.099> don't<00:02:08.280> want<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> road<00:02:09.300> trip

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330

right<00:02:09.720> away<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.959> don't<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.590> stay<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
right away you don't want to stay on the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.979 
right away you don't want to stay on the
highway<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.700> stay<00:02:12.000> at<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> same<00:02:12.330> speed<00:02:12.750> for

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
highway and stay at the same speed for

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.750 
highway and stay at the same speed for
more<00:02:13.200> than

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
more than

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.729 
more than
minute<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.150> minute<00:02:14.360> 30<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.290> want<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.560> adjust

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
minute a minute 30 you want to adjust

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.500 
minute a minute 30 you want to adjust
your<00:02:16.069> speeds<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.670> pretty<00:02:16.849> much<00:02:17.000> what<00:02:17.360> it's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
your speeds and pretty much what it's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
your speeds and pretty much what it's
saying<00:02:17.689> is<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.110> don't<00:02:18.349> want<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:19.280> the

saying is you don't want to have the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.300 
saying is you don't want to have the
RPMs<00:02:20.180> at<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> constant<00:02:20.900> spot<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.099> don't

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
RPMs at a constant spot so you don't

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.949 
RPMs at a constant spot so you don't
want<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.579> stay<00:02:22.730> at<00:02:22.849> 2,000<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.569> don't<00:02:23.750> want<00:02:23.870> to

want to stay at 2,000 you don't want to

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.350 
want to stay at 2,000 you don't want to
stay<00:02:24.140> at<00:02:24.290> 3,000<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.310> want<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.579> vary<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:25.939> up<00:02:26.180> it

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
stay at 3,000 you want to vary it up it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.839 
stay at 3,000 you want to vary it up it
says<00:02:26.689> don't<00:02:26.870> labor<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.349> engine<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:28.340> when

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
says don't labor the engine so when

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.149 
says don't labor the engine so when
you're<00:02:29.000> accelerating<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.379> don't<00:02:30.620> want<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.010> go

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
you're accelerating you don't want to go

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.160 
you're accelerating you don't want to go
slow<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.879> want<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.120> accelerate<00:02:32.659> at<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> decent

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
slow you want to accelerate at a decent

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.619 
slow you want to accelerate at a decent
pace<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.430> gets<00:02:34.610> into<00:02:34.849> top<00:02:35.030> gear<00:02:35.060> right

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
pace so that it gets into top gear right

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.030 
pace so that it gets into top gear right
away<00:02:35.900> now<00:02:36.379> this<00:02:36.530> might<00:02:36.709> seem<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.950> little

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
away now this might seem a little

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.259 
away now this might seem a little
complicated<00:02:37.340> but<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:37.849> really<00:02:37.940> not<00:02:38.120> that

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
complicated but it's really not that

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.550 
complicated but it's really not that
difficult<00:02:38.629> I'm<00:02:38.930> about<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:39.200> show<00:02:39.349> you<00:02:39.440> right

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
difficult I'm about to show you right

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.530 
difficult I'm about to show you right
now<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.129> after<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.459> start<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.819> engine<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.329> it

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
now so after you start the engine and it

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.960 
now so after you start the engine and it
runs<00:02:41.720> for<00:02:41.959> about<00:02:41.989> 1530<00:02:42.829> seconds<00:02:43.370> you're<00:02:43.760> good

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
runs for about 1530 seconds you're good

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.670 
runs for about 1530 seconds you're good
to<00:02:44.120> go<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.510> can<00:02:44.540> start<00:02:44.840> driving<00:02:47.590> well<00:02:48.590> it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
to go and you can start driving well it

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.349 
to go and you can start driving well it

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
says don't press on the brakes hard you

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.420 
says don't press on the brakes hard you
don't<00:02:50.540> want<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.810> ride<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.109> brakes<00:02:51.349> either<00:02:51.530> you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
don't want to ride the brakes either you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.830 
don't want to ride the brakes either you
want<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.639> make<00:02:52.730> sure<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.329> drive

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
want to make sure that you drive

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.690 
want to make sure that you drive
normally<00:02:54.109> so<00:02:54.680> while<00:02:54.859> you<00:02:54.980> drive<00:02:55.190> make<00:02:55.549> sure

normally so while you drive make sure

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.309 
normally so while you drive make sure
that<00:02:55.879> you're<00:02:56.090> changing<00:02:56.569> your<00:02:56.870> speed<00:02:57.139> up

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
that you're changing your speed up

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.660 
that you're changing your speed up
changing<00:02:57.889> your<00:02:58.010> rpms

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
changing your rpms
