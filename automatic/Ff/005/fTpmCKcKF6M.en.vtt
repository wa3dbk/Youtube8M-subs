it's a very quick setup put those

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.479 
it's a very quick setup put those
together<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.220> then<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.470> either<00:02:29.590> if<00:02:30.280> it's

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
and this is how he did it at the ends of

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.319 
and this is how he did it at the ends of
these<00:03:05.069> even<00:03:05.640> our<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.450> he<00:03:06.569> found<00:03:06.930> their<00:03:07.200> pain

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
these even our that he found their pain

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
what mark one mark to that look over

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.750 
what mark one mark to that look over
those<00:03:12.239> tank

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.190 

i<00:03:21.790> hook<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.480> over<00:03:22.659> there<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:23.080> secure<00:03:25.200> you

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.619 

it's<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.409> easy

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.380 

obviously<00:03:44.500> needs<00:03:45.010> more<00:03:45.280> work<00:03:45.430> putting<00:03:46.269> this

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
obviously needs more work putting this

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.170 
obviously needs more work putting this
fully<00:03:46.750> dry<00:03:47.260> pulling<00:03:47.709> setup<00:03:48.069> if<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.790> want<00:03:48.969> to<00:03:49.120> I
