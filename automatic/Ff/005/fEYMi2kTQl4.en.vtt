00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.190
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.680
 of trailer in reviews I am mario 60 of the 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.670
 Nathan house hunting your steam backpack 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.250
 cloud a backpack as you see light very 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.160
 competed mib leos taught it and that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.689
 vest is designed is a vest model 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.669
 to distribute the weight between the part 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.529
 front the back as you see 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.509
 padded behind to make us feel 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 comfortable is to say a backpack type 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.099
 vest was by cloud let's go 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.140
 watching it we started front 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 we have a first pocket part 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.780
 top set big enough 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.240
 ability we can stretch and it is elastic 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.980
 on the outside with this part of 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.230
 side zip we access another 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850
 pocket where we can carry then 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.310
 some band something we need 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.560
 here that goes dry we take advantage of the 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.230
 part is of perspiration so that 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.990
 go perspiring better also incorporates 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.540
 this system to finish holding things 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.600
 on the outside a tape that we 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.060
 tense fixes us also the content but 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.829
 to fix the content in the part 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.289
 internal and this is going to cost you to see it 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.980
 I'm going to teach it here, I do not know if you see 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.170
 these threads 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.480
 these straps here blue I do not know if 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.250
 they are able to catch it to know not 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.780
 try to open to the maximum we will see 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.120
 check here is worth these straps here 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.220
 what they do is compress the content 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.350
 internal is pulling around here is to say 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.860
 low belt is crossed in the part 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.230
 internal and on both sides goes out 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
 here at the bottom and tensed 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.590
 here is to say that as we go 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.660
 drinking or that we are releasing or 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.390
 putting content we go 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.070
 thinking or relaxing the content here 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.370
 whereupon what this backpack is looking for 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.900
 It is always to bring as compact as possible 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.670
 that we carry within the amount of 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.290
 liquid and the amount of objects e 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.720
 trying in this way to avoid 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.760
 maximum the bounce also carries a 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.860
 second tensor that leaves by the part 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.260
 superior and that we end up tensing 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.420
 here to fix, it is worth saying that we have 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.670
 we tensed over here crosses tensed by 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.850
 here and also it crosses us to finish 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.380
 to fix the entire fastener then take the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.209
 hydration system here home and 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.050
 drapac we hold on top 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.910
 fixes it goes up 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.280
 and then I show you how to get hooked 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.110
 when I put it last here 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.750
 Take a second layer to fix this 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.270
 here we see a mesh 3 of a mesh 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.740
 that isolates us that creates a component that 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.930
 makes the backpack part a little 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.610
 but giving us comfort and carries this 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.160
 pocket they tell him was hidden 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.400
 it's worth this pocket here is thought 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.380
 to be able to put ice is to say that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.840
 let's go running we put a layer of 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.120
 ice here and we 're going to run with her 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.580
 ok then this has double function 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.400
 first that separates us and isolates us what 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.980
 which is the content of the hydration of 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.870
 our back and if not if we do not carry 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.450
 nothing what makes us is a double layer 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.540
 to get even more insulator tell you 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.580
 that you are isolating the part where 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 We took the hydra pack fijaros here and 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.360
 already has an insulating component 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.070
 but incorporates in this second pocket 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.260
 that has this double functionality that 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.030
 we can end up putting ice when 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.740
 let's try let's tell you how it works when 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.020
 when we put ice on it so we have 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.410
 as I told you a big pocket a lot 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.600
 capacity is worth where we then tighten to 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.150
 go closing and that we have much more 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.880
 subject an outer pocket this 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.200
 small pocket and the handle for 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.500
 finish holding things in the part 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.160
 outside he put it on me, it's worth telling you that 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.230
 of this maquila we go there is worth we have 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.030
 here the tensioner 1 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.659
 we thought the second two is worth this what 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.150
 we can regulate finish closing close 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:56.190
 ok and then the hydration system 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.580
 was lost is held by a magnet 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.620
 here 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.510
 to avoid bouncing in this way is 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.920
 easier to drink we can finish 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.210
 hold it now I had it wrong 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.670
 we can finish holding it here 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.890
 It's worth it and we're much better then 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.390
 front two pockets that we 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.090
 they give capacity to put bottles of 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.130
 up to 650 milliliters ie pockets 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.049
 great we can do without perhaps the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.640
 hydration in the back if we 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.130
 like to take it and take advantage of behind 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.290
 all the capacity to carry material 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.080
 plus two pockets a pocket here 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.610
 tiny to be able to carry 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.140
 gels that we are spending and take them 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.330
 here that the content is falling towards 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.400
 the outside and pocket here 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.020
 little one where we can take advantage of 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.600
 put the keys or very small things 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.320
 pocket here with zip thought 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.300
 for the mobile phone or other things that 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.100
 we need but it is very thought for 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.390
 put the mobile phone tell you that if 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.660
 you carry the mobile phone is not 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.010
 isolated so we're going to need to put 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.200
 some plastic thing that we 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.090
 isolate and on the sides to finish off 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.790
 give him even more capacity 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.010
 two very large pockets where to put 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.650
 gels where to carry bands where to take 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.010
 what we want in the race to have it more 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.750
 hand on both sides one on this side 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.930
 and another on this side 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.390
 Then as I said, it's worth this here 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.590
 which are the tensors this here the 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.510
 as we are filling 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.670
 we have to let go so that the 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.860
 backpack gain capacity and as you 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.810
 we are spending the content 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.660
 we are stretching from here to go thinking 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.460
 all this and that the content that more 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.850
 subject also incorporates to it 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.520
 tape 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.460
 but here above fix is ​​here 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.180
 also stretching from here we think the 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.130
 Inside contents the backpack nathan 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.070
 goes by cloud as we told you several 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.830
 compartments various systems 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.390
 agreement and some backpacks that work 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.120
 by sizes because not everyone has the 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.410
 same box with thoracic we need 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.360
 different capabilities so they work 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.640
 by sizes this is the size l subjection 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.900
 front clamping behind that camera 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.180
 air the tube insulation system 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.250
 of hydration we can also include the 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.440
 ice the special tensioning of the material 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.940
 we can also carry sticks I had 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.180
 forgotten to notice here we can also 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.030
 finish on these tapes here together 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.650
 with the lower ribbons down here 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.220
 to hold the clubs in this part 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.500
 front we will tell you how it works and 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.120
 side pockets front pockets 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.820
 pockets with zipper to carry 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.500
 All the material in this nathan backpack 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.290
 vapor cloud as always we encourage you to 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.970
 follow our review to connect them to 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.560
