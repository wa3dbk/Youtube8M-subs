00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
up over the years and I'm removing that

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.080 
up over the years and I'm removing that
that's<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> looks<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.340> before<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that's what it looks like before and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.319 
that's what it looks like before and
after<00:00:36.420> I've<00:00:36.510> removed<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.700> my<00:00:38.700> paint<00:00:39.000> removal

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
after I've removed it my paint removal

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
after I've removed it my paint removal
method<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.960> steam<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> portable

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
method is steam this is the portable

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.610 
method is steam this is the portable
steam<00:00:42.120> generator<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.440> has<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> hose<00:00:48.620> that's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
steam generator that has a hose that's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.060 
steam generator that has a hose that's
connected<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.879> simple<00:00:51.570> nozzle<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:54.949> think<00:00:55.949> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
connected to a simple nozzle I think you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.720 
connected to a simple nozzle I think you
can<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> steam<00:00:56.760> coming<00:00:57.149> out<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.270> there

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.280 

it's<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.239> gentle<00:01:03.600> stream<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it's just a little gentle stream of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.420 
it's just a little gentle stream of
steam<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> blast<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.330> steam<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.310> my

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
steam not really a blast of steam so my

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
steam not really a blast of steam so my
method<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:11.030> play<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.360> steam<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
method is to just play that steam on the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.980 
method is to just play that steam on the
paint<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.939> 5<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.180> 10<00:01:15.509> seconds

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
paint for really just 5 or 10 seconds

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.740 
paint for really just 5 or 10 seconds
and<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:17.280> softens<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.030> enough<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> easily

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and that softens it up enough to easily

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.920 
and that softens it up enough to easily
scrape<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.570> I've<00:01:27.750> already

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
scrape it off you can see I've already

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.640 
scrape it off you can see I've already
gotten<00:01:28.229> about<00:01:28.500> 2<00:01:29.490> inches<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.329> 10<00:01:31.229> 15

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
gotten about 2 inches just in 10 15

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.700 
gotten about 2 inches just in 10 15
seconds<00:01:35.720> here<00:01:36.720> I'll<00:01:36.869> give<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.140> close-up<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
seconds here I'll give you a close-up of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390 
seconds here I'll give you a close-up of
that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.200 

so<00:01:43.000> here's<00:01:43.450> how<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.690> goes<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.970> few

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
so here's how that goes just a few

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.540 
so here's how that goes just a few
seconds<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.750> steam<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.170> there<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.220> paint

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
seconds of steam on there and that paint

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.370 
seconds of steam on there and that paint
is<00:01:52.090> soft<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:52.810> comes<00:01:53.020> right<00:01:53.320> off<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.320> to

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
is soft and comes right off you have to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.740 
is soft and comes right off you have to
be<00:01:56.440> careful<00:01:56.890> not<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.100> get<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.520> warmed<00:01:58.330> up<00:01:58.450> too

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
be careful not to get it warmed up too

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.250 
be careful not to get it warmed up too
much<00:01:58.990> or<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.470> some<00:01:59.650> gummy<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.110> see

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
much or it get some gummy you can see

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.980 
much or it get some gummy you can see
that's<00:02:05.440> taking<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:05.980> off<00:02:06.420> really<00:02:07.420> just<00:02:07.870> about

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
that's taking it off really just about

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.640 
that's taking it off really just about
down<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.410> bare<00:02:08.710> wood<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.940> traces<00:02:10.510> of<00:02:10.650> primer

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
down to bare wood just traces of primer

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:22.830 
down to bare wood just traces of primer
left<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:21.010> as<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.120> develop<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.690> right

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
left and as I develop the right

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.640 
left and as I develop the right
technique

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
technique

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.160 
technique
there's<00:02:24.520> not<00:02:24.730> even<00:02:24.790> any<00:02:26.520> wood<00:02:27.520> damaged<00:02:28.110> when<00:02:29.110> I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
there's not even any wood damaged when I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.880 
there's not even any wood damaged when I
first<00:02:29.470> got<00:02:29.620> started<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.930> wood<00:02:32.140> was<00:02:32.350> scruffing

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
first got started the wood was scruffing

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.080 
first got started the wood was scruffing
up<00:02:33.040> just<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.430> bit<00:02:35.460> because<00:02:36.460> that's<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.820> damp

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
up just a bit because that's a damp

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.620 
up just a bit because that's a damp
process<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.640> moisture<00:02:40.140> softens<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.320> wood

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
process the moisture softens the wood

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.480 
process the moisture softens the wood
but<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.900> here<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.170> was<00:02:44.440> trying<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.800> do<00:02:44.980> vertical

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
but up here I was trying to do vertical

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.080 
but up here I was trying to do vertical
strokes<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:47.350> really<00:02:47.850> damaged<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.940> wood

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
strokes and that really damaged the wood

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.570 
strokes and that really damaged the wood
a<00:02:49.120> bit<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.020> shifted<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.500> horizontal<00:02:51.190> strokes

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
a bit so I shifted to horizontal strokes

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.710 
a bit so I shifted to horizontal strokes
and<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.989> works<00:02:56.170> real<00:02:56.380> nice

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:15.540 

no<00:03:00.380> damage<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.160> wood

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.150 

really<00:03:16.550> just<00:03:16.790> about<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.150> shortest<00:03:17.890> time<00:03:18.890> that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
really just about the shortest time that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.950 
really just about the shortest time that
I<00:03:19.220> can<00:03:19.370> hold<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.700> steam<00:03:19.940> on<00:03:20.090> there<00:03:20.360> for<00:03:20.570> just<00:03:20.690> 5

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
I can hold the steam on there for just 5

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.110 
I can hold the steam on there for just 5
or<00:03:20.990> 10<00:03:21.470> seconds<00:03:21.950> at<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.160> most<00:03:22.190> softens<00:03:22.970> it

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
or 10 seconds at the most softens it

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:42.370 
or 10 seconds at the most softens it
plenty<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.840> get<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.080> off<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.900> that's<00:03:42.230> the

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
plenty to get it off so that's the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:52.660 
plenty to get it off so that's the
method<00:03:43.300> steam<00:03:45.040> paint<00:03:46.040> removal<00:03:51.430> we<00:03:52.430> use<00:03:52.550> it

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
method steam paint removal we use it

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.260 
method steam paint removal we use it
quite<00:03:52.850> a<00:03:52.910> bit<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.150> our<00:03:53.330> window<00:03:53.630> work<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.940> damp

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
quite a bit in our window work it's damp

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.230 
quite a bit in our window work it's damp
so<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.630> helps<00:03:56.900> control<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.640> lid<00:03:58.640> containing

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
so it helps control the lid containing

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.630 
so it helps control the lid containing
debris<00:03:59.630> and<00:04:00.590> that's<00:04:00.800> an<00:04:00.920> important<00:04:01.370> part<00:04:01.490> of

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
debris and that's an important part of

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:18.449 
debris and that's an important part of
our<00:04:01.760> lead<00:04:02.030> safe<00:04:02.830> work<00:04:03.830> operations

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.519
