00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
together again what you've got the ideal

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
together again what you've got the ideal
height<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.369> your<00:01:20.430> hi-hat<00:01:20.880> set<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
height for your hi-hat set for you it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.499 
height for your hi-hat set for you it
stays<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.229> way

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
stays that way
