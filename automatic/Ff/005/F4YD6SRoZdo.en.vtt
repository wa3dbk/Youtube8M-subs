00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
conditioner you know as my leave in for

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
conditioner you know as my leave in for
two<00:00:47.879> years<00:00:48.329> straight<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:50.010> stopped

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
two years straight and I just stopped

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.119 
two years straight and I just stopped
using<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:51.030> leave<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.170> found

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
using it as my leave in because I found

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.979 
using it as my leave in because I found
another<00:00:53.610> leave-in<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.360> I'm<00:00:54.480> using<00:00:54.660> gel

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
another leave-in because I'm using gel

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.330 
another leave-in because I'm using gel
now<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> reason<00:00:55.949> why<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.250> not

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
now so that's the reason why I do not

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.209 
now so that's the reason why I do not
use<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> leave-in<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.109> still<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.980> this

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

front of nice sized leaves pretty big to
me<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.880> say<00:01:17.880> naturals<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.140> an

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
me and say naturals this is not an

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.730 
me and say naturals this is not an
all-natural<00:01:19.740> product<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.740> don't

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
all-natural product so you know don't

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350 
all-natural product so you know don't
think<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.670> say<00:01:23.850> naturals

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
think that it is just say naturals

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.510 
think that it is just say naturals
because<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
strikes the stuff in it but it's fairly

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.950 
strikes the stuff in it but it's fairly
reasonable<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> prices<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.829> around<00:01:32.960> 479

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
reasonable the prices like around 479

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
reasonable the prices like around 479
