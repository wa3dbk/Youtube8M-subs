00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
and when it's cloudy it's still possible

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.889

net metering which basically means that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.530 
net metering which basically means that
you<00:01:06.980> get<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.400> full<00:01:07.640> value<00:01:07.940> of<00:01:08.330> solar

that<00:03:35.500> did<00:03:35.740> occur<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.100> me<00:03:36.340> as<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.490> possible<00:03:37.060> Part

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
that did occur to me as a possible Part

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.080 
that did occur to me as a possible Part
B<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.630> my<00:03:37.900> question<00:03:38.520> well<00:03:39.520> there<00:03:39.940> are

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
B to my question well there are

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.120 
B to my question well there are
different<00:03:40.270> reasons<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:41.320> one<00:03:41.560> reason<00:03:41.980> is

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
different reasons and one reason is

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.010 
different reasons and one reason is
their<00:03:42.340> roof<00:03:42.580> won't<00:03:42.850> support<00:03:43.330> it<00:03:43.570> either

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
their roof won't support it either

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.140 
their roof won't support it either
because<00:03:44.500> it's<00:03:44.680> too<00:03:44.890> old<00:03:44.920> or<00:03:45.370> too<00:03:45.640> much<00:03:45.820> shade

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
because it's too old or too much shade

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.850 
because it's too old or too much shade
around<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> roof<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.140> they<00:03:47.290> don't<00:03:47.530> want<00:03:47.739> to

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
around the roof and they don't want to

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.100 
around the roof and they don't want to
trim<00:03:48.100> anything<00:03:48.450> another<00:03:49.450> reason<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.080> that

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
trim anything another reason is that

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.260 
trim anything another reason is that
they<00:03:50.470> don't<00:03:50.680> like<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.160> look<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.670> although

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
they don't like the look of it although

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.600 
they don't like the look of it although
as<00:03:52.660> more<00:03:52.959> people<00:03:53.110> are<00:03:53.350> going<00:03:53.530> solar<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.370> hear

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
as more people are going solar we hear

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.180 
as more people are going solar we hear
much<00:03:54.820> less<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.420> reason<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.709> has<00:03:56.860> become

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
much less of that reason it has become

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.250 
much less of that reason it has become
much<00:03:57.459> more<00:03:57.730> acceptable<00:03:58.239> as<00:03:58.510> more<00:03:58.750> people<00:03:58.930> do
