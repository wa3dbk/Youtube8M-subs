00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
fingers are moving as much they are

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.969 
fingers are moving as much they are
moving<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.619> little<00:02:02.710> bit

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
moving a little bit

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.279

the<00:02:03.520> more<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.850> do<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.240> more<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.960> will<00:02:05.049> stop

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
the more you do it the more it will stop

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.570 
the more you do it the more it will stop
because<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.619> shouldn't<00:02:05.830> be<00:02:05.920> doing<00:02:06.130> all<00:02:06.429> this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
because you shouldn't be doing all this

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.279 
because you shouldn't be doing all this
with<00:02:06.789> all<00:02:06.939> of<00:02:07.060> them<00:02:07.270> but<00:02:07.780> eventually<00:02:07.869> you'll

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
with all of them but eventually you'll

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.839 
with all of them but eventually you'll
get<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.619> point<00:02:08.830> where<00:02:09.069> I'm<00:02:09.399> deleting

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
get to that point where I'm deleting

Anjali

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.510 

these<00:03:09.200> are<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.470> practice<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.890> deal<00:03:10.130> with<00:03:10.280> both

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
these are the practice I deal with both

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.520 
these are the practice I deal with both
of<00:03:10.550> my<00:03:10.760> hands<00:03:11.090> only<00:03:11.360> give<00:03:11.600> me<00:03:11.720> more<00:03:11.900> fluid<00:03:12.380> in

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
of my hands only give me more fluid in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.860 
of my hands only give me more fluid in
my<00:03:12.740> movements<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.550> think<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.569> can<00:03:14.690> do<00:03:14.810> all

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
my movements I think you can do all

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.830 
my movements I think you can do all
those<00:03:15.440> together<00:03:18.790> also<00:03:19.790> another<00:03:20.060> exercise<00:03:20.569> to

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
those together also another exercise to

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.960 
those together also another exercise to
take<00:03:21.110> your<00:03:21.410> fingers<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:21.950> curl<00:03:22.310> them<00:03:22.580> towards

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
take your fingers and curl them towards

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.720 
take your fingers and curl them towards
the<00:03:23.090> palm<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.750> then<00:03:24.319> push<00:03:24.650> them<00:03:24.950> away<00:03:25.100> from

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
the palm and then push them away from

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.500 
the palm and then push them away from
the<00:03:25.819> car

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
the car

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.199 
the car
I<00:03:26.540> like<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.560> reverse<00:03:27.920> ways<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.970> you're<00:03:29.060> actually

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
I like a reverse ways so you're actually

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.690 
I like a reverse ways so you're actually
making<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.720> wave<00:03:29.930> think<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.010> all<00:03:31.160> these<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.580> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
making a wave think of all these in the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:45.220 
making a wave think of all these in the
water<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.739> I'll<00:03:42.830> do<00:03:43.040> these<00:03:43.750> movements<00:03:44.750> my

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
water so I'll do these movements my

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.180 
water so I'll do these movements my
practice<00:03:45.739> time<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.250> hands<00:03:47.739> give<00:03:48.739> this<00:03:48.920> video

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
practice time for hands give this video
