00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.260
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.189
 harm and today we have a fight on arte on behalf of 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.460
 Dr. Storm on the map of Prokhorovka 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.770
 encounter battle and so the card is very 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.230
 convenient for artillery and in general often 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.320
 manages to leave here well and so 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.119
 dr. storm we are playing solo 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.480
 They move for a piece of metal 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.790
 position here in the bushes 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.280
 hiding behind trees and bushes well 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.160
 comes down under the first light let's see who 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.790
 what the batch will tell us here is giving light 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.730
 this one and look here there are 268 objects 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.579
 I draw your attention as a doctor storm 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.899
 gets the point yes and how the oval distributes 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.360
 and see what it gives to the top 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.149
 1600 case flies up 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.930
 virtually no damage to one 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.180
 very important since the 268 object you yourself 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.750
 you know what this car is and of course 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.459
 nice to almost get it right away 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.590
 OK 

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:19.220
 recharge while you again see that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.429
 include replay yes how here here 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.940
 turned out to be a circle of information yes well, as always 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.819
 pay attention to the green line she 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.170
 displayed correctly and here already 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:36.080
 all is well well this very 268 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.780
 object and thanks to the original paper 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.670
 doctor storm now this object is already in 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.470
 hangar 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.569
 let's see who else will show us well 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.310
 until there is no light waiting for the mountain but 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.810
 doctor storm apparently expecting after all 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.209
 here podamazhit here thought it 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.569
 highlight butt but for some reason not 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:02:01.849
 it turns out and translates it to the mountain 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:05.239
 batchat enemy here 60 Vojko whom 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:07.250
 he 'll pick one for now 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:10.970
 since there is no light 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.230
 amx 50b no longer gets fugen accounted for 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.660
 reduced again this is one of these 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.060
 features of the Soviet art 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 such an uncomfortable feature is necessary 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 notice he sends in 50 b 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.080
 projectile comes in and vanshot 50b in the hangar 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.770
 very nice it is also the way 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.610
 by the way 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:38.600
 this level 10 and drum that is also 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:43.910
 very useful shot well take a look 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.730
 what happens next does not shine anymore 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.860
 no one on grief unfortunately though doctor 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.450
 the storm is reduced and now finally 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.160
 highlighted amx 50 120 he sends 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.560
 outside of the 730 van arrives and its right there 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.580
 finish off well 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.610
 on the center the lion glows and from 8 but u 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.470
 doctor side recharge another 15 seconds 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.640
 can wait 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.640
 nothing can be done about it 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.720
 we are waiting on and now there are already 5 seconds 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.790
 and unfortunately the light disappears we already 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.060
 guys let's highlight because he's already 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.709
 ready to shock will be great i'm sure well 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.050
 let's but for some reason that 's good 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.530
 finally give schott a torch and 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.860
 doctor storm gets lego 709 damage 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.620
 he managed to throw but in general 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.380
 maybe it would be more well u lion not 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.760
 enough hp to knock out more great 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.390
 converge on the center here from 8 our batchat 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.140
 you see 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.750
 leaves him a little bit recklessly 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.840
 since okay he is with a weight of eight as 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.090
 to cope but according to the light it is a 8 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.870
 can think other tanks that are worth 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.140
 well away doctor storm come out by 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.569
 obstacle shooting method 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.090
 through the stone there on the slope he managed 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.200
 throw a great shot picks up from a 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.019
 8 and actually you see that alley 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.390
 pushed through 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:29.240
 here, in principle, everything is clear 10 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:34.510
 5 in principle, it is already seeking leftovers 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.510
 as you remember the flooded opponent e75 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.460
 did not doctor assault on him shoot well 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.710
 actually did the right thing because 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.620
 it would be a waste 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.139
 a shot if someone does not know the damage 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.419
 everything flies out well fine but he 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:05:00.290
 not considered to be damage unfortunately so 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:05.280
 freebies such no guts e100 take 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.650
 remains butch 60 deuce butch already 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.270
 By the way, too, was sent to the hangar but here 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.400
 out of 8 we reduce it well but here 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.840
 We have a lot of Allied tanks and 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.790
 maybe just will not be able to have time 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.470
 Fire 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.020
 especially this clinch is always very 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.800
 hard for the arts to throw and don't let 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.760
 god of his 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.120
 don't pick them up 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.470
 where do you even want her last step 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:41.400
 throw and the base is captured like this 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.919
 The fight turned out guys fast enough 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.630
 interesting there are cool shots 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.340
 I hope you enjoyed leaving 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.340
