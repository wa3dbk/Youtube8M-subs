hi my name's Rob Tarek and in this

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.170 
hi my name's Rob Tarek and in this
tutorial<00:00:05.010> I'm<00:00:05.399> going<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> show<00:00:05.760> you<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.149> to

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
tutorial I'm going to show you how to

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.910 
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
create<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> simple<00:00:06.750> program<00:00:07.200> using<00:00:07.500> LabVIEW

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
create a simple program using LabVIEW

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.970 
create a simple program using LabVIEW
for<00:00:08.189> Mindstorms<00:00:08.820> NXT<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:10.380> first<00:00:10.710> thing<00:00:10.830> we're

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
for Mindstorms NXT the first thing we're

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.299 
for Mindstorms NXT the first thing we're
going<00:00:11.100> to<00:00:11.190> do<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:12.410> click<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.560> this<00:00:13.710> blank<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.160> VI

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
going to do is click on this blank of VI

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.700 
going to do is click on this blank of VI
targeted<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.480> NXT<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:18.199> LabVIEW<00:00:19.199> brings<00:00:19.560> up

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
targeted to NXT and LabVIEW brings up

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
targeted to NXT and LabVIEW brings up
these<00:00:19.829> two<00:00:20.070> windows<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.730> front<00:00:20.999> panel<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
these two windows the front panel that

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.890 
these two windows the front panel that
we<00:00:21.779> will<00:00:21.960> minimize<00:00:22.259> and<00:00:23.089> the<00:00:24.089> block<00:00:24.300> diagram

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
we will minimize and the block diagram

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.589 
we will minimize and the block diagram
that<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.679> will<00:00:25.890> maximize<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:27.239> we<00:00:27.359> want<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
that we will maximize because we want to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.109 
that we will maximize because we want to
see<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.839> of<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.859> we're<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.909> need

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
see all of this and we're going to need

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.870 
see all of this and we're going to need
some<00:00:30.419> functions<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.319> we<00:00:31.349> need<00:00:31.649> to<00:00:31.769> find<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
some functions so we need to find the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.729 
some functions so we need to find the
functions<00:00:33.210> palette<00:00:33.600> by<00:00:33.750> right-clicking<00:00:34.440> and

you<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:38.039> we've<00:00:38.160> got<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> few<00:00:38.489> different

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
you see we've got a few different

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.840 
you see we've got a few different

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to see how displays so this one here is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.360 
to see how displays so this one here is
view<00:01:17.010> this<00:01:17.100> palette<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.700> icons<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.480> text<00:01:20.660> and

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
view this palette as icons and text and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:33.080 
view this palette as icons and text and
we'll<00:01:23.370> drag<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> motor<00:01:24.150> block<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:32.090> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
we'll drag out a motor block and that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
we'll drag out a motor block and that
motor<00:01:33.420> block<00:01:33.720> you'll<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.710> got<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.890> few

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
motor block you'll see it's got a few

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.850 
motor block you'll see it's got a few
little<00:01:35.300> these<00:01:36.300> little<00:01:36.330> terminals<00:01:37.290> around<00:01:37.680> us

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
little these little terminals around us

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
little these little terminals around us
and<00:01:38.730> we<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> information<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:39.870> we

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and we get a bit of information when we

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630 
and we get a bit of information when we
hold<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> mouse<00:01:40.350> over<00:01:40.710> those<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
hold the mouse over those these are the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.180 
hold the mouse over those these are the
inputs<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> outputs<00:01:42.710> we're<00:01:43.710> also<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
inputs and outputs we're also going to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.040 
inputs and outputs we're also going to
put<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> wait<00:01:45.710> block<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.630> idea<00:01:48.870> here<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
put in a wait block so the idea here is

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.050 
put in a wait block so the idea here is
going<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.410> we<00:01:49.920> want<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.340> make<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> robot<00:01:50.940> go

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
going to be we want to make the robot go

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
going to be we want to make the robot go
forward<00:01:51.480> for<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.690> couple<00:01:51.900> of<00:01:51.960> seconds<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.590> then

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
forward for a couple of seconds and then

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.750 
forward for a couple of seconds and then
stop<00:01:53.190> now<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.260> bring<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.980> block<00:01:56.340> close

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
stop now if you bring a block close

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.670 
stop now if you bring a block close
enough<00:01:57.150> when<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.720> first<00:01:57.930> drag<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.440> from

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
enough when you first drag it out from

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.810 
enough when you first drag it out from
the<00:01:58.860> pallet<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.640> will<00:01:59.820> wire<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.480> automatically

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
the pallet it will wire in automatically

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.010 
the pallet it will wire in automatically
that<00:02:02.820> didn't<00:02:03.060> happen<00:02:03.330> here<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.840> didn't

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that didn't happen here because I didn't

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.570 
that didn't happen here because I didn't
bring<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.260> close<00:02:04.470> enough<00:02:04.650> but<00:02:04.980> if<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.160> click<00:02:05.220> on

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
bring it close enough but if I click on

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.250 
bring it close enough but if I click on
this<00:02:05.730> icon<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.150> move<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.930> over<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.140> and

see this one's a motor on at the top

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.660 
see this one's a motor on at the top
we've<00:03:42.750> got<00:03:42.780> an<00:03:43.230> output<00:03:43.829> port<00:03:44.069> which<00:03:44.430> by

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
we've got an output port which by

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.059 
we've got an output port which by
default<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:45.090> all<00:03:45.359> ports<00:03:45.799> bottom<00:03:46.799> left<00:03:46.950> hand

corner<00:03:47.190> we<00:03:47.549> can<00:03:47.579> change<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.090> power<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.079> we

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
corner we can change the power so if we

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.490 
corner we can change the power so if we
want<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.410> make<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.370> robot<00:03:50.669> run<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:50.880> full<00:03:51.090> power

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
want to make the robot run at full power

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.710 
want to make the robot run at full power
we<00:03:52.500> can<00:03:52.739> right<00:03:53.459> click<00:03:53.489> on<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:55.099> terminal<00:03:56.099> and
