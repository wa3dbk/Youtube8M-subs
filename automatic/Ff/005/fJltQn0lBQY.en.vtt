generations

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:19.079 
generations

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.519 
generations
when<00:00:20.009> I<00:00:20.039> say<00:00:20.339> generations<00:00:21.029> I'm<00:00:21.569> starting<00:00:22.380> with

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
when I say generations I'm starting with

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.519 
when I say generations I'm starting with
a<00:00:22.800> parent<00:00:23.429> quilt<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.029> then<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.140> time

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
a parent quilt and then this time

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.349 
a parent quilt and then this time
instead<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.159> putting<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> scraps<00:00:26.999> from<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
instead of putting the scraps from the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.899 
instead of putting the scraps from the
first<00:00:27.659> quilt<00:00:27.960> into<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.589> scrap<00:00:28.859> pile<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.489> am

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:29.909 
first quilt into my scrap pile I am

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.849 
first quilt into my scrap pile I am
making<00:00:30.239> something<00:00:30.539> out<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.409> very<00:00:31.619> same

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
making something out of the very same

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
making something out of the very same
scraps<00:00:32.360> sometimes<00:00:33.360> when<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.720> done<00:00:33.989> with

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
scraps sometimes when I get done with

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.070 
scraps sometimes when I get done with
the<00:00:34.290> quilt<00:00:34.560> I<00:00:35.490> look<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.060> that<00:00:36.210> pile<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> fabric

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
the quilt I look at that pile of fabric

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.470 
the quilt I look at that pile of fabric
and<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.580> something<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.150> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and I just want to do something with it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.690 
and I just want to do something with it
I've<00:00:39.540> coordinated<00:00:40.530> everything<00:00:40.650> it<00:00:41.190> goes

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
I've coordinated everything it goes

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
I've coordinated everything it goes
together<00:00:41.970> and<00:00:42.450> sometimes<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.830> pile<00:00:44.130> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
together and sometimes that pile of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.610 
together and sometimes that pile of
leftovers<00:00:44.970> looks<00:00:45.300> big<00:00:45.780> enough<00:00:45.810> to<00:00:46.500> do

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
leftovers looks big enough to do

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.250 
leftovers looks big enough to do
something<00:00:46.950> else<00:00:47.220> with<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> same<00:00:47.790> thing<00:00:48.260> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
something else with the same thing so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.470 
something else with the same thing so
what<00:00:49.560> we<00:00:49.650> have<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.180> pattern

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
what we have here is this is a pattern

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.950 
what we have here is this is a pattern
called<00:00:51.750> cloud9<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.490> a<00:00:53.640> lot<00:00:53.880> of<00:00:53.960> prints

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
called cloud9 and it's a lot of prints

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.040 
called cloud9 and it's a lot of prints
with<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.560> constant<00:00:56.340> solid<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.360> between<00:00:57.870> them

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
with a constant solid in between them

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.220 
with a constant solid in between them
very<00:00:58.890> nice<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.490> simple<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.180> when<00:01:00.810> this<00:01:01.020> one

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
very nice and simple and when this one

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.189 
very nice and simple and when this one
is<00:01:01.410> made<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.400> solid<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> sewed<00:01:03.630> with<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is made the solid is sewed with the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.919 
is made the solid is sewed with the
strip<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.579> our<00:01:05.790> scraps<00:01:06.270> had

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
strip so that all of our scraps had

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:09.230 
strip so that all of our scraps had
these<00:01:07.499> two<00:01:07.799> fabrics<00:01:08.340> sewed<00:01:08.789> together

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
these two fabrics sewed together

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.599 
these two fabrics sewed together
whatever<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.899> print<00:01:10.140> was<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.609 
whatever the print was with some of the

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:13.609 
whatever the print was with some of the
gray<00:01:11.819> that's<00:01:12.060> been<00:01:12.270> used<00:01:12.509> here<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.289> child

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
gray that's been used here the child

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.889 
gray that's been used here the child
that<00:01:14.069> was<00:01:14.280> made<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.640> those<00:01:14.850> scraps<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.780> if

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
that was made from those scraps now if

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.859 
that was made from those scraps now if
you<00:01:16.079> remember<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.679> had<00:01:16.890> gray<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.609> print<00:01:18.060> so

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
you remember we had gray so to print so

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
you remember we had gray so to print so
I<00:01:19.200> took<00:01:19.259> some<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> those<00:01:19.950> scraps<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.240> cut

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
I took some of those scraps and I cut

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
I took some of those scraps and I cut
them<00:01:21.689> all<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> same<00:01:22.259> width<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.859> I<00:01:23.069> just

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
them all the same width and I just

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.910 
them all the same width and I just
randomly<00:01:23.639> sewed<00:01:24.210> them<00:01:24.389> together<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.679> have

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
randomly sewed them together and I have

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
randomly sewed them together and I have
columns<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.990> are<00:01:28.109> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
columns here that you can see are the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.679 
columns here that you can see are the
same<00:01:28.469> width<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.219> gray<00:01:29.460> sewed<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.569> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
same width of the gray sewed to the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
same width of the gray sewed to the
prints<00:01:30.959> I<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:32.039> some<00:01:32.249> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.429> print<00:01:32.700> leftover

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
prints I have some of the print leftover

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.289 
prints I have some of the print leftover
so<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:35.399> know<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.149> I

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so you know I don't know what I'm I

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.879 
so you know I don't know what I'm I
don't<00:01:36.359> know<00:01:36.659> where<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:36.959> going<00:01:37.319> when<00:01:37.469> I<00:01:37.499> start

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
don't know where I'm going when I start

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.760 
don't know where I'm going when I start
these<00:01:38.069> they<00:01:38.429> just<00:01:38.670> kind<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.149> happen<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.770> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
these they just kind of happen and this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.889 
these they just kind of happen and this
wasn't<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.459> to<00:01:41.609> be<00:01:41.729> quite<00:01:42.090> big<00:01:42.359> enough<00:01:42.389> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
wasn't going to be quite big enough and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.929 
wasn't going to be quite big enough and
I<00:01:43.109> decided<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.799> wanted<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.249> little<00:01:44.490> more<00:01:44.639> color

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
I decided I wanted a little more color

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.080 
I decided I wanted a little more color
contrast<00:01:45.539> so<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> cut<00:01:46.920> some<00:01:47.130> tiny<00:01:47.459> pieces<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
contrast so I cut some tiny pieces of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.840 
contrast so I cut some tiny pieces of
some<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> prints<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.979> put<00:01:50.279> some<00:01:50.310> strips

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
some of the prints and I put some strips

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.209 
some of the prints and I put some strips
in<00:01:51.060> there<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.689> solid<00:01:52.049> print<00:01:52.590> next

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
in there that are just solid print next

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.300 
in there that are just solid print next
to<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.450> piece<00:01:54.719> so<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.350> two<00:01:55.649> rows<00:01:55.859> of<00:01:55.889> piece

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to the piece so I have two rows of piece

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.349 
to the piece so I have two rows of piece
-<00:01:56.789> salad<00:01:57.270> -<00:01:57.420> piece<00:01:57.779> -<00:01:58.079> salad<00:01:58.529> and<00:01:58.880> then<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.209> took

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
- salad - piece - salad and then I took

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.230 
- salad - piece - salad and then I took
chunks<00:02:01.139> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> print<00:02:01.859> at<00:02:02.069> the<00:02:02.279> end<00:02:02.459> and<00:02:02.849> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
chunks of the print at the end and I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.719 
chunks of the print at the end and I
just<00:02:03.450> randomly<00:02:03.749> put<00:02:04.469> chunks<00:02:05.039> around<00:02:05.399> because

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
just randomly put chunks around because

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.910 
just randomly put chunks around because
these<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.149> cut<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.509> same<00:02:06.749> size<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.770> big

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
these are cut the same size as the big

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.030 
these are cut the same size as the big
chunks<00:02:08.310> were<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.940> original<00:02:09.030> quilt<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:10.040> had

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
chunks were in the original quilt I had

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.590 
chunks were in the original quilt I had
enough<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.760> great

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
enough of the great

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.980 
enough of the great
and<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.530> often<00:02:14.010> determines<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.870> get

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and in this often determines if you get

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.510 
and in this often determines if you get
down<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> end<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.890> borders<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
down to the end it's the borders or the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.190 
down to the end it's the borders or the
binding<00:02:17.910> lots<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.270> times<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.720> determine

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
binding lots of times that determine

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.410 
binding lots of times that determine
what<00:02:19.350> size<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:20.270> obviously<00:02:21.270> when

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
what size you can be obviously when

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.240 
what size you can be obviously when
you're<00:02:21.540> making<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.080> smaller<00:02:22.410> quilt<00:02:22.770> out<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
you're making a smaller quilt out of the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.730 
you're making a smaller quilt out of the
bigger<00:02:23.540> yeah<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.690> can't<00:02:24.990> make<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> same<00:02:25.500> size

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
bigger yeah you can't make the same size

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.250 
bigger yeah you can't make the same size
or<00:02:26.040> you've<00:02:26.280> gotten<00:02:27.000> way<00:02:27.270> too<00:02:27.300> much<00:02:27.660> fabric<00:02:27.960> to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
or you've gotten way too much fabric to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.140 
or you've gotten way too much fabric to
start<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.310> whatever<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.760> make<00:02:29.940> is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
start with so whatever you make is

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.030 
start with so whatever you make is
obviously<00:02:30.840> going<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.080> be<00:02:31.170> smaller<00:02:31.590> than<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
obviously going to be smaller than the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.700 
obviously going to be smaller than the
one<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.400> started<00:02:32.820> with<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.110> case<00:02:34.410> I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
one you started with and in this case I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.400 
one you started with and in this case I
looked<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.550> had<00:02:35.880> enough<00:02:36.180> grey<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.380> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
looked I had enough grey and so I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.250 
looked I had enough grey and so I
probably<00:02:38.100> cut<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.850> binding<00:02:39.030> first<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.230> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
probably cut the binding first so that I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.440 
probably cut the binding first so that I
knew<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> had<00:02:40.740> enough<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:42.090> used

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
knew I had enough of that and then used

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
knew I had enough of that and then used
whatever<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.960> had<00:02:43.230> left<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.820> quilt

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
whatever I had left in here this quilt

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.870 
whatever I had left in here this quilt
is<00:02:45.330> called<00:02:45.630> pristine<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.160> fun<00:02:47.520> easy

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
is called pristine and it's a fun easy

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.360 
is called pristine and it's a fun easy
one<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.360> piece<00:02:48.570> -<00:02:48.870> we<00:02:49.410> had<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.800> assortment<00:02:50.190> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
one to piece - we had an assortment of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.940 
one to piece - we had an assortment of
prints<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.060> then<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.810> pick<00:02:51.990> one<00:02:52.230> constant

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
prints and then you pick one constant

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.400 
prints and then you pick one constant
and<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.550> constant<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.930> side<00:02:55.200> of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
and the constant is so to the side of

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.530 
and the constant is so to the side of
each<00:02:55.530> print<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:56.790> pieces<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.330> cut

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
each print and then your pieces are cut

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.770 
each print and then your pieces are cut
and<00:02:57.840> then<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.740> sew<00:02:58.980> together<00:02:59.420> all<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
and then just sew together all of the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.440 
and then just sew together all of the
scraps<00:03:01.140> from<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.710> quilt<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:03.030> piece<00:03:03.240> of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
scraps from this quilt have a piece of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.410 
scraps from this quilt have a piece of
solid<00:03:03.630> sewed<00:03:04.560> next<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> print<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.940> they're

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
solid sewed next to a print and they're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.420 
solid sewed next to a print and they're
all<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:07.590> length<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.840> analyzed<00:03:10.740> my<00:03:11.070> scraps

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
all this length so I analyzed my scraps

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
all this length so I analyzed my scraps
that<00:03:11.580> were<00:03:11.760> left<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.450> decided<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.110> love

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
that were left and I decided I love

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.050 
that were left and I decided I love
these<00:03:13.710> fabrics<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.310> want<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.700> keep<00:03:14.850> them

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
these fabrics I want to keep them

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.090 
these fabrics I want to keep them
together<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.720> something<00:03:16.260> let's<00:03:16.650> try<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.890> make

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
together in something let's try to make

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.450 
together in something let's try to make
a<00:03:17.130> table<00:03:17.370> runner<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:18.590> had<00:03:19.590> some<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.220> pieces

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
a table runner I had some of the pieces

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.270 
a table runner I had some of the pieces
so<00:03:20.670> you'll<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:21.300> here<00:03:21.690> here's<00:03:22.200> my<00:03:22.320> salad<00:03:22.890> so

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
so you'll see here here's my salad so

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.750 
so you'll see here here's my salad so
next<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.850> print<00:03:24.170> solid<00:03:25.170> print<00:03:25.760> print

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
next to the print solid print print

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.650 
next to the print solid print print
solid<00:03:27.300> print<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.370> had<00:03:29.370> scraps<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.300> prints

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
solid print I had scraps of the prints

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.070 
solid print I had scraps of the prints
left<00:03:30.870> over<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:32.280> decided<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.390> sew

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
left over and I decided to just sew

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.320 
left over and I decided to just sew
strips<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.710> those<00:03:34.890> together<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.610> then<00:03:36.000> cut

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
strips of those together and then cut

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.200 
strips of those together and then cut
them<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.690> same<00:03:36.960> length<00:03:37.350> as<00:03:37.590> my<00:03:37.650> scraps<00:03:38.640> with

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
them the same length as my scraps with

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.300 
them the same length as my scraps with
the<00:03:39.390> solid<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.260> print<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.280> I

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
the solid so to the print so I

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.180 
the solid so to the print so I
alternated<00:03:42.060> rows<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.960> these<00:03:43.320> just<00:03:43.800> whatever

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
alternated rows and these just whatever

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.000 
alternated rows and these just whatever
size<00:03:44.520> block<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.240> just<00:03:45.690> happens<00:03:46.080> however<00:03:46.320> much

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
size block is just happens however much

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.340 
size block is just happens however much
I<00:03:47.190> need<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.520> get<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.820> length<00:03:48.080> when<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.110> got

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
I need to get that length when I got

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.130 
I need to get that length when I got
this<00:03:49.560> Center<00:03:49.980> done<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.670> wasn't<00:03:51.120> quite<00:03:51.480> as<00:03:51.900> big

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
this Center done it wasn't quite as big

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.230 
this Center done it wasn't quite as big
as<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.440> wanted<00:03:52.830> for<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.490> didn't<00:03:53.970> think<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.150> was

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
as I wanted for I didn't think it was

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.150 
as I wanted for I didn't think it was
quite<00:03:54.480> usable<00:03:54.990> enough<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.440> wanted<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.010> little

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
quite usable enough I wanted it a little

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.250 
quite usable enough I wanted it a little
bit<00:03:56.310> bigger<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:57.360> did<00:03:57.600> have<00:03:57.780> some<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:58.050> this

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
bit bigger and I did have some of this

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.310 
bit bigger and I did have some of this
dark<00:03:58.560> left<00:03:58.880> so<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.210> figured<00:04:00.720> out<00:04:00.870> how<00:04:01.260> many

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
dark left so I figured out how many

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.380 
dark left so I figured out how many
strips<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:02.100> would<00:04:02.340> need<00:04:02.580> if<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:02.940> was<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.300> to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
strips I would need if I was going to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.270 
strips I would need if I was going to
put<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> border<00:04:03.990> on<00:04:04.020> and<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.740> needed<00:04:04.950> three

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
put a border on and I needed three

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.060 
put a border on and I needed three
strips<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.060> looked<00:04:06.840> at<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.110> piece<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.590> blue

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
strips I looked at the piece of blue

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.720 
strips I looked at the piece of blue
that<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.580> had<00:04:08.940> left<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:10.770> divided<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.430> width

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
that I had left and I divided that width

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.480 
that I had left and I divided that width
by<00:04:12.000> three<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:13.440> told<00:04:13.860> me<00:04:13.950> what<00:04:14.250> size

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
by three and that told me what size

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.150 
by three and that told me what size
borders<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.150> was<00:04:15.300> going<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.600> cut<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.770> wasn't

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
borders I was going to cut so it wasn't

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.220 
borders I was going to cut so it wasn't
any<00:04:17.280> kind<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.730> standard<00:04:18.150> size<00:04:18.480> I<00:04:18.810> couldn't

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
any kind of a standard size I couldn't

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.260 
any kind of a standard size I couldn't
predetermine<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.100> took<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.669> piece<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:21.030> had

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
predetermine I took the piece I had

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.540 
predetermine I took the piece I had
divided<00:04:21.900> by<00:04:22.140> three

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
divided by three

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.540 
divided by three
that's<00:04:23.000> what<00:04:23.240> I<00:04:23.270> had<00:04:23.509> so<00:04:24.349> I<00:04:24.379> sold<00:04:24.680> those<00:04:24.919> on<00:04:25.250> and

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
that's what I had so I sold those on and

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.779 
that's what I had so I sold those on and
then<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.479> had<00:04:26.900> one<00:04:27.470> other<00:04:27.680> print<00:04:28.129> left<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.639> was

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
then I had one other print left that was

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.320 
then I had one other print left that was
almost<00:04:29.150> enough<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.289> be<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.560> binding<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:31.819> I<00:04:31.849> got

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
almost enough to be the binding so I got

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.719 
almost enough to be the binding so I got
as<00:04:32.479> much<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.990> could<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.740> had<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.069> sub<00:04:34.400> in

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
as much as I could and I had to sub in

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.330 
as much as I could and I had to sub in
there's<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.150> couple<00:04:35.569> pieces<00:04:35.810> here<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.650> tried<00:04:37.159> to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
there's a couple pieces here I tried to

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.369 
there's a couple pieces here I tried to
be<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.909> tried<00:04:38.449> to<00:04:38.539> be<00:04:38.629> casual<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.050> there's<00:04:39.289> a

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:39.379 
be I tried to be casual but there's a

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.649 
be I tried to be casual but there's a
couple<00:04:39.710> pieces<00:04:39.860> where<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.250> subbed<00:04:40.669> in<00:04:40.849> some<00:04:41.539> of

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.659 
couple pieces where I subbed in some of

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.230 
couple pieces where I subbed in some of
the<00:04:41.750> dark<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:42.979> was<00:04:43.099> long<00:04:43.340> enough<00:04:43.490> so

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
the dark so that it was long enough so

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.760 
the dark so that it was long enough so
these<00:04:44.389> are<00:04:44.599> the<00:04:44.659> some<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.900> things<00:04:45.379> you<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:45.740> to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
these are the some of things you have to

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.529 
these are the some of things you have to
think<00:04:45.889> about<00:04:46.370> when<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:46.759> want<00:04:46.909> to<00:04:47.090> use<00:04:47.270> the

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
think about when you want to use the

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.129 
think about when you want to use the
same<00:04:47.840> chunk<00:04:48.470> of<00:04:48.650> fabric<00:04:49.039> from<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.400> quilt<00:04:50.139> you

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
same chunk of fabric from a quilt you

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.899 
same chunk of fabric from a quilt you
have<00:04:51.379> to<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.590> don't<00:04:51.770> know<00:04:51.949> before<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.819> start

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
have to you don't know before you start

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.850 
have to you don't know before you start
always<00:04:53.389> if<00:04:53.659> you<00:04:53.750> have<00:04:53.900> enough<00:04:54.229> if<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.710> don't

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
always if you have enough if you don't

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.290 
always if you have enough if you don't
know<00:04:54.979> where<00:04:55.130> you're<00:04:55.250> going<00:04:55.550> when<00:04:55.699> you<00:04:55.819> start<00:04:56.090> I

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
know where you're going when you start I

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.939 
know where you're going when you start I
didn't<00:04:56.630> have<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.810> pattern<00:04:57.169> for<00:04:57.349> this<00:04:57.500> I<00:04:57.680> was

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
didn't have a pattern for this I was

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.800 
didn't have a pattern for this I was
just<00:04:58.009> making<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.580> up<00:04:58.669> so<00:04:59.270> you<00:04:59.330> have<00:04:59.569> to<00:04:59.690> keep

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
just making it up so you have to keep

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.080 
just making it up so you have to keep
winging<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.380> as<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:00.620> go<00:05:00.740> along<00:05:00.770> but<00:05:01.699> I<00:05:01.880> think

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
winging it as you go along but I think

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.730 
winging it as you go along but I think
it's<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.300> really<00:05:02.539> fun<00:05:02.569> table<00:05:03.080> runner<00:05:03.259> and<00:05:03.500> I'm

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
it's a really fun table runner and I'm

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.460 
it's a really fun table runner and I'm
really<00:05:04.009> glad<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.310> did<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:04.909> now<00:05:05.389> with<00:05:06.020> this

a<00:05:34.729> store<00:05:35.150> sample<00:05:35.719> we<00:05:35.870> got<00:05:35.900> started<00:05:36.349> and<00:05:36.650> then

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
a store sample we got started and then

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.309 
a store sample we got started and then
we<00:05:36.949> rejected<00:05:37.490> some<00:05:37.729> of<00:05:37.819> the<00:05:37.909> fabrics<00:05:38.330> so<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.020> had

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
we rejected some of the fabrics so I had

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.260 
we rejected some of the fabrics so I had
a<00:05:39.349> little<00:05:39.590> additional<00:05:40.159> scrap<00:05:40.490> from<00:05:40.729> this<00:05:41.000> and

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
a little additional scrap from this and

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.200 
a little additional scrap from this and
I<00:05:41.840> took<00:05:41.900> those<00:05:42.650> fabrics<00:05:43.190> plus<00:05:43.909> the<00:05:44.120> original

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
I took those fabrics plus the original

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.110 
I took those fabrics plus the original
ones<00:05:44.719> and<00:05:45.020> I<00:05:45.469> just<00:05:45.860> randomly<00:05:46.130> started<00:05:46.849> cutting

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
ones and I just randomly started cutting

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.450 
ones and I just randomly started cutting
squares<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:48.020> making<00:05:48.500> half<00:05:48.710> square<00:05:48.979> triangles

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
squares and making half square triangles

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.120 
squares and making half square triangles
these<00:05:50.090> these<00:05:50.719> are<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.020> ones<00:05:51.050> we<00:05:51.349> rejected<00:05:51.919> and

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
these these are the ones we rejected and

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.219 
these these are the ones we rejected and
we<00:05:52.460> thought<00:05:52.639> they<00:05:52.849> look<00:05:53.029> too<00:05:53.240> gray<00:05:53.539> after<00:05:54.139> we

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
we thought they look too gray after we

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.809 
we thought they look too gray after we
started<00:05:54.620> instead<00:05:55.069> of<00:05:55.219> black<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.550> white

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
started instead of black and white

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.749 
started instead of black and white
that's<00:05:56.630> why<00:05:56.870> we<00:05:57.080> rejected<00:05:57.529> them<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.400> anyway

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
that's why we rejected them so anyway

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.790 
that's why we rejected them so anyway
I've<00:05:59.029> got<00:05:59.300> half<00:05:59.509> square<00:05:59.750> triangles<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:00.380> solid

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
I've got half square triangles and solid

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.830 
I've got half square triangles and solid
squares<00:06:01.099> and<00:06:01.400> I've<00:06:01.789> just<00:06:02.029> played<00:06:02.360> with

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
squares and I've just played with

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.050 
squares and I've just played with
throwing<00:06:03.169> in<00:06:03.440> some<00:06:03.710> of<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.979> solid<00:06:04.669> colors

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
throwing in some of the solid colors

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.480 
throwing in some of the solid colors
just<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:05.960> brighten<00:06:06.259> it<00:06:06.380> up<00:06:06.529> it's<00:06:06.740> just<00:06:06.860> so<00:06:07.219> fun

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
just to brighten it up it's just so fun

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.100 
just to brighten it up it's just so fun
to<00:06:07.520> have<00:06:07.819> those<00:06:08.000> solid<00:06:08.419> colors<00:06:08.779> with<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
to have those solid colors with the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.860 
to have those solid colors with the
black<00:06:09.289> and<00:06:09.469> white<00:06:09.620> so<00:06:10.460> I<00:06:10.490> pieced<00:06:10.849> the<00:06:11.210> center<00:06:11.659> I

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
black and white so I pieced the center I

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.290 
black and white so I pieced the center I
was<00:06:12.319> looking<00:06:12.620> for<00:06:12.830> a<00:06:12.860> table<00:06:13.250> runner<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:13.699> then

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
was looking for a table runner and then

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.990 
was looking for a table runner and then
somebody<00:06:14.960> said<00:06:15.199> hmm<00:06:15.680> it'd<00:06:16.340> be<00:06:16.490> nicer<00:06:16.849> if<00:06:16.880> it

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
somebody said hmm it'd be nicer if it

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.570 
somebody said hmm it'd be nicer if it
was<00:06:17.060> longer<00:06:17.449> so<00:06:17.960> I<00:06:18.020> thought<00:06:18.229> alright<00:06:18.620> so<00:06:19.550> I

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
was longer so I thought alright so I

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.749 
was longer so I thought alright so I
went<00:06:20.060> back<00:06:20.270> to<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.569> solids<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.289> I<00:06:21.830> made<00:06:22.190> inner

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
went back to the solids and I made inner

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.240 
went back to the solids and I made inner
borders<00:06:23.270> on<00:06:23.599> the<00:06:24.020> two<00:06:24.229> ends<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:24.830> decided

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
borders on the two ends and I decided

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.180 
borders on the two ends and I decided
it's<00:06:25.940> more<00:06:26.449> fun<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:27.020> have<00:06:27.199> more<00:06:27.529> colors<00:06:27.919> than

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
it's more fun to have more colors than

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.480 
it's more fun to have more colors than
just<00:06:28.400> one<00:06:28.639> so<00:06:29.120> I<00:06:29.150> pieced<00:06:29.630> those<00:06:29.900> half<00:06:30.380> half<00:06:31.310> and

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
just one so I pieced those half half and

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.999 
just one so I pieced those half half and
half

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
half

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.159 
half
and<00:06:32.099> then<00:06:32.669> I<00:06:32.699> put<00:06:32.999> one<00:06:33.180> more<00:06:33.210> row<00:06:33.539> of<00:06:33.659> blocks<00:06:33.930> on

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
and then I put one more row of blocks on

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.040 
and then I put one more row of blocks on
the<00:06:34.289> end<00:06:34.469> and<00:06:34.889> I<00:06:35.639> think<00:06:36.059> I<00:06:36.180> maybe<00:06:36.360> did<00:06:36.659> go<00:06:36.839> get

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
the end and I think I maybe did go get

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.659 
the end and I think I maybe did go get
the<00:06:37.199> black<00:06:37.409> for<00:06:37.680> the<00:06:37.710> binding<00:06:38.099> but<00:06:38.400> black<00:06:38.639> is

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
the black for the binding but black is

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.159 
the black for the binding but black is
something<00:06:39.180> I<00:06:39.300> don't<00:06:39.479> count<00:06:39.629> that<00:06:39.749> doesn't

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
something I don't count that doesn't

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.379 
something I don't count that doesn't
have<00:06:40.289> to<00:06:40.409> be<00:06:40.529> a<00:06:40.559> scrap<00:06:40.889> because<00:06:41.369> I<00:06:41.490> had<00:06:41.729> all<00:06:42.149> the

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
have to be a scrap because I had all the

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.619 
have to be a scrap because I had all the
prints<00:06:42.719> from<00:06:42.839> the<00:06:42.930> beginning<00:06:43.439> to<00:06:43.919> do<00:06:44.069> that<00:06:44.099> one

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629 
prints from the beginning to do that one

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.480 
prints from the beginning to do that one
now<00:06:45.629> this<00:06:45.899> one<00:06:45.960> has<00:06:46.439> what<00:06:47.159> I<00:06:47.189> call<00:06:47.460> a

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
now this one has what I call a

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.359 
now this one has what I call a
third-generation<00:06:48.529> because<00:06:49.529> we<00:06:49.770> rejected

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:50.369 
third-generation because we rejected

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.119 
third-generation because we rejected
some<00:06:50.819> of<00:06:50.909> those<00:06:50.999> first<00:06:51.270> fabrics<00:06:51.930> I<00:06:52.169> had<00:06:52.800> parts

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.129 
some of those first fabrics I had parts

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.339 
some of those first fabrics I had parts
of<00:06:53.219> houses<00:06:53.639> left<00:06:53.819> over<00:06:54.210> when<00:06:54.839> I<00:06:54.869> picked<00:06:55.199> those

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349 
of houses left over when I picked those

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.920 
of houses left over when I picked those
triangles<00:06:55.860> off<00:06:56.159> if<00:06:56.460> I<00:06:56.909> put<00:06:57.119> them<00:06:57.300> down<00:06:57.479> here

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
triangles off if I put them down here

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.119 
triangles off if I put them down here
and<00:06:58.080> put<00:06:58.860> four<00:06:59.699> house<00:07:00.119> Peaks<00:07:00.569> together<00:07:01.080> I<00:07:01.409> came

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:02.129 
and put four house Peaks together I came

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:04.489 
and put four house Peaks together I came
up<00:07:02.279> with<00:07:02.309> another<00:07:02.610> mat<00:07:03.089> so<00:07:03.899> here<00:07:04.199> we<00:07:04.319> have

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:04.499 
up with another mat so here we have

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:07.219 
up with another mat so here we have
their<00:07:04.680> houses<00:07:04.919> without<00:07:05.520> their<00:07:05.939> roof<00:07:06.180> and<00:07:06.419> just

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
their houses without their roof and just

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.959 
their houses without their roof and just
a<00:07:07.349> half<00:07:07.529> square<00:07:07.800> triangle<00:07:08.279> in<00:07:08.339> the<00:07:08.399> corner<00:07:08.759> and

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
a half square triangle in the corner and

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:11.899 
a half square triangle in the corner and
then<00:07:09.749> I<00:07:09.779> took<00:07:09.990> my<00:07:10.379> scraps<00:07:10.770> of<00:07:11.039> the<00:07:11.249> solid<00:07:11.669> color

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909 
then I took my scraps of the solid color

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:15.709 
then I took my scraps of the solid color
and<00:07:12.210> just<00:07:12.990> made<00:07:13.319> a<00:07:13.620> scrappy<00:07:14.219> binding<00:07:14.759> to<00:07:15.569> go

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:15.719 
and just made a scrappy binding to go

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:18.799 
and just made a scrappy binding to go
around<00:07:16.080> it<00:07:16.639> so<00:07:17.639> you<00:07:17.699> can<00:07:18.059> keep<00:07:18.240> playing<00:07:18.449> with

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:18.809 
around it so you can keep playing with

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.260 
around it so you can keep playing with
the<00:07:18.899> same<00:07:19.139> scraps<00:07:19.589> as<00:07:20.039> far<00:07:20.399> as<00:07:20.520> you<00:07:20.639> can<00:07:20.789> go<00:07:21.029> at

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.270 
the same scraps as far as you can go at

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.360 
the same scraps as far as you can go at
some<00:07:21.779> point<00:07:22.020> at<00:07:22.139> this<00:07:22.319> point<00:07:22.409> now<00:07:22.770> I<00:07:22.949> am<00:07:23.219> done

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
some point at this point now I am done

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.010 
some point at this point now I am done
with<00:07:23.580> these<00:07:23.759> now<00:07:24.300> these<00:07:24.539> are<00:07:24.719> going<00:07:24.809> to<00:07:24.870> go

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
with these now these are going to go

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.139 
with these now these are going to go
into<00:07:25.169> my<00:07:25.379> general<00:07:25.589> scrap<00:07:26.009> pile<00:07:26.249> but<00:07:26.879> I<00:07:26.909> had<00:07:27.120> a

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:27.149 
into my general scrap pile but I had a
