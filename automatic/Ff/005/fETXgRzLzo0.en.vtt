00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello friends i want you today 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.819
 Imagine something for smartphone 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.960
 could be interesting after me 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.370
 last week already the little mini 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 had presented speakers for the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.679
 pc today i want the little mini 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
 introduce bass club for your smartphone 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.020
 during the jay tech mini 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.760
 bass speaker last week 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 actually presented exclusively for 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.910
 the pc suitable or as an mp3 player 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.500
 is the advantage of the baskets that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 I use it as an external speaker for 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.960
 use the pc and for the smartphone 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.119
 can 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 I can show you what the little device can do 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.340
 you still in the test the minibars club can 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.989
 buy at Kaufland for 14 euro 99 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.940
 and I have to say this little one 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 Cube is worth every penny 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.629
 But first let's see what we are in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 scope of delivery on the one hand we have 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.899
 down this little cute slide me 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.579
 asked me but why in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.170
 Afterwards I understood why we 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.239
 the top of this area give the whole 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.649
 normal on the table and then place with 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 the basket on top 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.649
 having fits the advantage I can 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.820
 why does it slide back and forth? 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.410
 important he shows later 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.390
 otherwise the user manual in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.149
 Germany is otherwise still 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.260
 this extremely ugly lanyard i 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.210
 my life is already warming around 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.979
 wrist yes but no matter 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.119
 advantage is of course but if I 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.850
 Now I'm on the road, I can do it everywhere 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.570
 Of course, in the cultivation shelf track always 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.869
 away with it 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.759
 and otherwise the most important thing 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.490
 USB cable at the same time the supply 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.360
 least pc has connected the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.920
 advantage here 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.210
 we can say that once over 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.580
 Connect the USB to the computer 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.350
 then connect via second 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 the three companies just click on 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.770
 smartphone and as I said like that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.770
 use an external speaker 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 but let's see the minibars club of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.090
 worked but at times little more closely 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.770
 what is striking for 14 99 a super price 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.539
 super processed and a great 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.619
 quality 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.360
 otherwise the minibus club 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 different ways to him 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
 we can use it once as 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.909
 normal mp3 player use 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.619
 that means we put a micro sd card 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.319
 Plug in headphones and it was already 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 an mp3 player or we use it as 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.590
 external speakers for the pc or 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.240
 for us a cell phone we here the layman 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.469
 in poke and next to has 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.479
 connect our devices 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.519
 additionally, it will then stop even if 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.950
 the charging station because an integrated 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.110
 Battery in it is extra pr and as I said 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.610
 already with a micro sd card otherwise 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.230
 we can turn it on and off we 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.790
 have an extra one and a little extra 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 switch off what I felt as a disadvantage 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.750
 the on and off switch went very well 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.280
 easily as that can happen to us 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.110
 Just make a decision about it 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.940
 do not want to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.569
 otherwise from below wh we are here 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.670
 also have different 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.209
 controls we can loud and quiet 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.269
 do 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.680
 back and forth and impulses and stops 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.060
 that of course we can use then 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 use it as an mp3 player 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.790
 I want you right now 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.290
 always point out that we are now 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.609
 So the sound test is about to start 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.030
 make something easier and 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.030
 watch out 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.810
 The operating principle is actually 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.910
 simply three company jack plug 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.290
 just put it in the device as in 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.510
 the case now the smartphone then that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.830
 amateur in the speakers a song 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 choose and then only make hits 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.880
 what should be considered at the beginning is a 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.709
 better device is a bit quiet 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.090
 because the small cube is 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.860
 animal lottery man underestimated 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.680
 really then the complete volume 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.680
 and what the part is really original 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.909
 to show you how loud this little one is 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.230
 basket is really i have an app 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.409
 actually downloaded 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.629
 should clarify the loud but her 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.390
 see 73 decibel is realistic with in 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.010
 Reality is the dice can be so loud 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.989
 you do not even describe and like you 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.220
 See, he's jumping all the time 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.359
 and her and slide back and forth and 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.519
 Now you know what to do with these 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.840
 little sweet little pieces need it 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.049
 speaker does not do what he wants 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.000
 So I have to say that I have to paint 14 99 at all times 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.819
 Kaufland this bass club every cent 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.590
