00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
made the face super clean so I was able

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.589

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.900 
to get that big card to start and then
it<00:02:27.080> went<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.380> little<00:02:27.500> dead<00:02:27.770> but<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.220> got<00:02:28.670> enough

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
it went a little dead but I got enough

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.280 
it went a little dead but I got enough
speed<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.390> was<00:02:29.450> looking<00:02:29.750> for<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:29.930> section

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
speed and I was looking for that section

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.460 
speed and I was looking for that section
inside<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.580> threw<00:02:32.000> out<00:02:32.150> really<00:02:32.450> weird<00:02:32.720> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
inside and it threw out really weird and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.900 
inside and it threw out really weird and
I<00:02:33.620> thought<00:02:33.800> all<00:02:33.950> it's<00:02:34.100> gonna<00:02:34.280> catch<00:02:34.520> my<00:02:34.670> rail

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
I thought all it's gonna catch my rail

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.510 
I thought all it's gonna catch my rail
and<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:36.050> launched<00:02:36.380> me<00:02:36.470> perfect<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.069> let

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
and it just launched me perfect and let

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.979 
and it just launched me perfect and let
me<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.790> pretty<00:02:38.090> good<00:02:38.330> fish<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> land

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
me have a pretty good fish in the land

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.780 
me have a pretty good fish in the land
so<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.770> thought<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.250> gonna<00:02:40.310> be<00:02:40.459> close<00:02:40.610> either

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
so I thought it's gonna be close either

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.030 
so I thought it's gonna be close either
way<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.660> know<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:42.020> would<00:02:42.440> go<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:42.770> pretty

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
way and you know I would go so pretty
