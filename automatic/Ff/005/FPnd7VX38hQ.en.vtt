he made that into hunger games in
Minecraft<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:17.119> another<00:01:18.119> reason<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.479> wanted<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
Minecraft and another reason I wanted to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
Minecraft and another reason I wanted to
put<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.920> really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
put this on here is because I really

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
put this on here is because I really
like<00:01:21.060> fast<00:01:21.509> paced<00:01:21.780> Hunger<00:01:22.080> Games<00:01:22.259> maps<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
like fast paced Hunger Games maps that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
like fast paced Hunger Games maps that
are<00:01:23.189> small<00:01:23.670> cuz<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.030> map<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
are small cuz this map was like I was a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.679 
are small cuz this map was like I was a
pretty<00:01:25.439> small<00:01:25.710> map<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:27.030> liked

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
pretty small map I just really liked

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
pretty small map I just really liked
this<00:01:27.840> fast<00:01:28.200> paced<00:01:28.500> maps<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.759> he

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
this fast paced maps and you know he

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.670 
this fast paced maps and you know he
just<00:01:30.119> did<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.810> good<00:01:31.259> job<00:01:31.290> at

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
just did a really really good job at

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.219 
just did a really really good job at
recreating<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.400> ends<00:01:32.850> begin<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> Hunger<00:01:34.020> Games

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
recreating it ends begin to Hunger Games

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.770 
recreating it ends begin to Hunger Games
I<00:01:34.590> guess<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.579> chests<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I guess to put more chests and make it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.510 
I guess to put more chests and make it
so<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> map<00:01:37.170> isn't<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.650> too<00:01:37.770> limited<00:01:38.280> he

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so the map isn't really too limited he

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880 
so the map isn't really too limited he
put<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> bunch<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.659> ladders<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.500> different

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
put a bunch of ladders and different

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.010 
put a bunch of ladders and different
secret<00:01:41.100> passageways<00:01:41.850> over<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> map<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.930> get

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
secret passageways over the map to get

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.899 
secret passageways over the map to get
on<00:01:43.170> rooftops<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.979> there's<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.579> different

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
on rooftops and there's like different

the<00:02:34.100> trick<00:02:34.340> life<00:02:34.550> 101<00:02:35.060> it's<00:02:35.390> for<00:02:35.540> eight

the trick life 101 it's for eight
players<00:02:35.990> but<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.680> think<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:36.950> works<00:02:37.130> best<00:02:37.340> for

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
players but I think it works best for

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.680 
players but I think it works best for
eight<00:02:37.580> players<00:02:37.850> cuz<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> pretty<00:02:38.480> large

like<00:04:24.360> towards<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.199> number<00:04:25.470> one<00:04:25.620> spot<00:04:25.949> or

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
like towards like the number one spot or

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.430 
like towards like the number one spot or
like<00:04:26.850> if<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.120> an<00:04:27.330> original<00:04:27.660> map<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.080> it's<00:04:28.199> I

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
like if it is an original map and it's I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.689 
like if it is an original map and it's I
mean<00:04:28.830> if<00:04:28.919> this<00:04:29.010> was<00:04:29.190> an<00:04:29.310> original<00:04:29.370> map<00:04:29.789> I<00:04:30.030> would

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
mean if this was an original map I would

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.219 
mean if this was an original map I would
just<00:04:32.699> be<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.120> crazy<00:04:33.449> but<00:04:33.690> again<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:33.990> was<00:04:34.110> an

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
just be on crazy but again it was an

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.560 
just be on crazy but again it was an
original<00:04:34.380> map<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.070> but<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.060> know<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.270> map<00:04:36.449> is

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
original map so but you know this map is

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.779 
original map so but you know this map is
really<00:04:36.810> really<00:04:36.990> fun<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.590> it's<00:04:38.340> definitely

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
really really fun and it's definitely

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.310 
really really fun and it's definitely
one<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.030> those<00:04:39.210> types<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.690> hunger<00:04:39.960> games<00:04:40.020> that

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
one of those types of hunger games that

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.010 
one of those types of hunger games that
are<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> bit<00:04:40.650> different<00:04:41.250> because<00:04:42.000> getting<00:04:42.720> Lou

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
are a bit different because getting Lou

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.900 
are a bit different because getting Lou
and<00:04:43.260> gear<00:04:43.500> are<00:04:43.530> kind<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.250> difficult<00:04:44.699> actually

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
and gear are kind of difficult actually

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.210 
and gear are kind of difficult actually
on<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.360> but<00:04:45.630> besides<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.919> really

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
on that but besides that it's a really

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.700 
on that but besides that it's a really
really<00:04:47.370> fun<00:04:47.490> map<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.840> know<00:04:48.960> how<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.470> put

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
really fun map and you know how to put

really fun map and you know how to put
this<00:04:49.800> out<00:04:49.949> number<00:04:50.190> two<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.550> just<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.699> look<00:04:50.910> at

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
this out number two it's just a look at

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.060
