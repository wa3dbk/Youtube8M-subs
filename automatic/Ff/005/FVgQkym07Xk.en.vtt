bit<00:01:52.920> stepped<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.550> terms<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.649> how<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.820> edges<00:01:56.820> go

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
bit stepped in terms of how the edges go

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
bit stepped in terms of how the edges go
on<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.690> which<00:01:58.289> doctors<00:01:58.680> did<00:01:58.860> not

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
on this thing now which doctors did not

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.100 
on this thing now which doctors did not
supply<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.460> fit<00:01:59.820> out<00:01:59.940> like<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.720> found

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
supply it fit out like that but I found

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
supply it fit out like that but I found
that<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.700> installation<00:02:03.569> I<00:02:04.459> had<00:02:05.459> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that to be the installation I had to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940 
that to be the installation I had to
grind<00:02:06.179> that<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.569> get<00:02:06.750> proper<00:02:07.140> clearance<00:02:07.590> for

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
grind that to get proper clearance for

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.999 
grind that to get proper clearance for
the<00:02:08.130> electrical<00:02:08.610> harness<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.179> well<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.569> the
