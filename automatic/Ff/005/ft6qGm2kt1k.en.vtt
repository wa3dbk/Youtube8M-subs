 Y 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.920
 i 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.690
 Hi all 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.289
 how about for us and share 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.589
 then a makeup that I made 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.859
 with this wave let's talk a palette that 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.859
 have sent 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.379
 I was interested in trying that palette and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.180
 and none and as it took several weeks 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.470
 trying many results because I 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.130
 I wanted to share with you 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.650
 in this case, what are you seeing 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.340
 I already notice you and I'm really sorry 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.830
 but the result of what I wanted 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 because I have super sensitive eyes and 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.790
 good 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790
 of water 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.210
 I'm very sorry and I hope you forgive me 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.580
 and well I hope that with a lot of makeup 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.580
 itself during the video 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.690
 it appears thousand 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.340
 Well as always we started the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.280
 eye makeup and in this case I go back 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.210
 to my big favorite the sedena test and 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.520
 the store with your finger 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.440
 then I have a matte vanilla shadow and 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.119
 I start by applying the below the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.680
 eyebrow and then the rest that I have left in the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.890
 brush I apply it all over the eyelid 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.890
 mobile 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.990
 now with a medium brown shade and a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.670
 brochita of the natural and loose I begin 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.670
 to define the account little by little 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.950
 now with the reddish brown shadow of the 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.770
 palette I give a little more intensity 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.359
 to the eye socket and how do you see if 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.020
 using the same brush and now 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:05.060
 with a pretty dark brown shadow and 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.920
 a brush finished in tip we give a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.130
 little bit more definition at the end of 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.130
 eye 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 i 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.750
 and you 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.880
 with the same brush as the first step 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.650
 blur the cuts and now I take the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.360
 shadow of bronze color of the palette and the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.050
 I apply all over the mobile eyelid to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050
 little touches 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.690
 to intensify the shade bronze color 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.250
 that you have applied previously we already put 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.260
 a little bit of this new shadow that 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.980
 I have a pop color that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.959
 combined it looks beautiful now with a 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.360
 matte black shadow I'll start to 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.640
 make up at eyelashes and as you see 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.319
 I'm depositing the color very very flush and 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.689
 little by little I go up in a brush towards 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.689
 up to create this blur effect 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.440
 and continues to intensify flush with eyelashes 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.750
 to then later draw a 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.510
 very very very finite eyeliner for still 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.200
 give a little more intensity to the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.200
 Eyelash root 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.970
 I take this opportunity to tell you that I am 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.340
 delighted with the tattoo the inner one of kat 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 von d because the precision at the time of 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.650
 apply the product is brutal 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.560
 and now I 'm going to make up the line 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.120
 inside of the eye using one of my 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.420
 favorite pencils that is the charlotte 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.190
 tilbury later we apply a lot 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.319
 a lot of mascara and the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.319
 Eye makeup is almost ready 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.820
 we start with the face and in this case 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.340
 already start applying a primer that 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.380
 be of sense and that I love already 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.120
 then let's move on to apply a 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.070
 from my favorite makeup bases the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.890
 I was sample and in this case I'm 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.900
 applying with the fulco craig de bobby and 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.280
 next, helping me 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.830
 brush that will take a bit of 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.080
 makeup on the bobby stick too 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.640
 and I'm going to apply it simply in the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.750
 center of the face to bring a 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.750
 little more coverage 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.400
 I'm going to go on to define the eyebrows in this 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.580
 case I will use a product that leaves them 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.210
 super natural that is liquid of 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.210
 zhouqu 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.730
 i 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.320
 it was time to seal the base of 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.480
 makeup and in this case it's those who 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.760
 McKesson live is not sincere to 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.010
 be my favorite powders in order 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.050
 Well now it's time to apply 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.910
 the bronzer and in this case bios to the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.040
 golden light of bobby and I'm going to 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.400
 apply basically for almost all 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.400
 face 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.770
 now I take the old tone and apply it 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.199
 all over the cheek area to 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.210
 Then apply another blush 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.650
 the zone of the manzanitas arrived the 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.150
 time to apply the corrector and in 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.909
 this case I am applying to the tattoo 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.710
 conciliar de cat bondi and I apply it with 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:17.060
 one of my favorite products for the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.950
 concealer that is the mini beauty blender 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.960
 now I take the garnet shadow of the 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.389
 palette and I apply it just the line 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.080
 lower eye and as you see I'm going 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.080
 blurring 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.800
 Now I'm going to give you a little touch of 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.449
 color to the manzanitas so I'm going to 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.970
 apply this current of pop color in 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.800
 the craft tone and finally I'm going to move on 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.540
 apply illuminator that in this case is 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.540
 the famous jumping by dbk 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.090
 and to finish with the makeup I'm going to 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.280
 move to makeup the lips and in this 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.410
 case and I will use a labia de dÃ©bora milano 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.200
 which is a very precious color 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.910
 Transparent and perfect for brunettes and 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.980
 As you can see, the makeup is already 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.420
 finished good because this has been all 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.100
 I hope you have shown family 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.570
 I also ask you please do me 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.570
 know a bit about our end 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.100
 what kind of makeup or please something 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.380
 older 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.820
 with about me I know what you want 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.430
 so with this state much much 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.090
 your pinion 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:36.260
 but as I have done 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.470
 and also as always all video in the 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.470
 Blog 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.820
 and the names and of course the theme 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.180
 so I do not expect anything in the middle of the 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.180
 neighborhood 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.919
