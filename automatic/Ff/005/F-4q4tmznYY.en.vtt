00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the side when the two cuts meet you'll

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.900 
the side when the two cuts meet you'll
have<00:00:37.410> an<00:00:37.530> apple<00:00:37.890> wedge<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.309> pops<00:00:38.579> right<00:00:38.850> out

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
have an apple wedge that pops right out

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940

and<00:00:39.390> while<00:00:39.960> we're<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.110> let's<00:00:40.440> cut<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> piece

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and while we're here let's cut a piece

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.490 
and while we're here let's cut a piece
from<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.280> other<00:00:41.399> side<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.910> same<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:43.350> our

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
from the other side the same way now our

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.260 
from the other side the same way now our
goal<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:43.860> these<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> cut<00:00:44.550> out<00:00:44.579> three<00:00:45.059> more

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
goal with these is to cut out three more

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.150 
goal with these is to cut out three more
l-shaped<00:00:45.809> wedges<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> quarter<00:00:47.129> inch

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160

thick<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.270> time<00:00:48.480> rather<00:00:48.750> than<00:00:48.899> cutting

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
thick and this time rather than cutting

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
thick and this time rather than cutting
in<00:00:49.469> sideways<00:00:49.950> toward<00:00:50.309> your<00:00:50.460> fingers<00:00:50.820> try

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390

in sideways toward your fingers try
turning<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> piece<00:00:51.989> over<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.710> cut

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
turning the piece over so you can cut

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
turning the piece over so you can cut
downward<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.699> meet<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> first<00:00:54.270> cut<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
downward and meet the first cut at the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.930 
downward and meet the first cut at the
bottom<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> little<00:00:56.129> wiggle<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.610> new

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

see that repeating this process three or
four<00:01:31.770> times<00:01:32.009> gives<00:01:32.610> us<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.850> nice<00:01:33.030> variety<00:01:33.240> of
