00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.769
 from crespo province of between rivers 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.199
 really an 11 year old cabin 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.449
 I work with an excellent job in 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.190

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.950

 paschal owner of the cabin and 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.509
 theresa to give a start 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.240
 relatively of all that was that 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:20.710
 day that first day that is to say we are 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 within the Creole race good to me 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.440
 I have always liked horses 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 and good and we are buying some that 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.260
 another some mestizo never at the end we 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.860
 we will have stayed with none until 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.130
 one day 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.240
 we buy in a auction an auction in 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.340
 palermo 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 a horse that was in pain you will be 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.610
 a gelding 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.299
 for me because I kept looking for a 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.299
 horse for me 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.460
 this 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.870
 We were surprised by the quality 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.600
 I had 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.920
 both on a cute smart horse 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.720
 it was fine the time that was spectacular 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.880
 I still have it and you had ridden and 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.440
 the truth that I take great care of him is already 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.320
 a little bigger by the time that 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.479
 happened but good from that horse 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.950
 well, we bought the breeder that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.070
 had sold that had sold us 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.620
 Roberto Cerutti in him had brought him 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.090
 the auction and he has the cabin that 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.250
 approach between rivers then we went 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.870
 and as I tell you, I always like them 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.080
 the horses I liked very much the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.209
 criollos so good with my husband 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.310
 we went to visit to steal everything and there 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.440
 we buy other mares 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.790
 and then investigating a bit too 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.340
 the pedigree of our horse and 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.849
 we started to get in because good 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.690
 first it started with one thing was to have a 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.450
 horse after the truth was was was a 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.730
 hobby after we had the mares say 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.970
 well we have the mares now the truth 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.580
 we wanted to get them pups because we 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.500
 I liked it a lot and well we ended up going and 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.140
 knowing what he kept he will be in san 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.489
 baldomero and we became very close friends of 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.190
 eduardo and we started a stage let's say 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:19.430
 as the first was stage 0 and this one 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.430
 then the as the foundational stage was 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:31.120
 good if we buy 2 stallions and good 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.390
 all that what followed was incorporate 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.560
 Eduardo's genetics I also had a lot 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:42.670
 lucky because we learned a lot with him and 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.870
 then he started to see more and more 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.530
 horses then what was something very 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.280
 Simple required good cabañero more 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:59.049
 organization we keep learning from 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.790
 genetic and good a 'not a thing that does not 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.160
 I told you that also so with very few 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.160
 horses we went to this me why 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.780
 I do not know, I would almost tell you, I do not remember 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.780
 how it was but we had three 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.480
 good horses let's see what this is 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.139
 the gold brake that I think good as 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.760
 that was already beginning to be heard here between 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.530
 the breeders and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.510
 and since I had applied the bug 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.210
 of the gold brake here yes, let's go to 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.440
 see what this is because it said good there 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.260
 very good also very good horses 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.720
 well let's go there we went and the truth that 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.630
 we had a lot of fun the test is 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.100
 very nice we started we were treated barbarian 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:47.090
 In Brazil we loved it and we saw that it was 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.910
 something that we really loved 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.070
 we would say horses did everything that 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.800
 they were very beautiful they will be very similar to what 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.110
 how good many matches it seemed that 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.160
 we liked lived with a vision 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.250
 renovator 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.380
 yes yes it was very very very good let's say 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.620
 have done that 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.890
 good we keep incorporating good 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.790
 Eduardo's animals and at some point 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.550
 We thought it was good, let's see 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.820
 what's up with this 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.520
 brake genetics and we had 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.900
 known to a breeder that is very 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.640
 important in brazil and very good rider 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.590
 well known that is marcelo mobile that 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.110
 it also brings the brake here so 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.860
 we brought a stallion from him we started 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.590
 cross because it was was one seemed to us a 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.720
 very complementary horse by 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.270
 example of the asleep tintillo that is the 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.950
 horse that 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.990
 We were using at that time 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.720
 principle we had used tomorrow the 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.360
 amulet that is now in brazil in the 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.060
 of some friends as they were few 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.870
 We needed another stallion because if not 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:58.569
 I was going to be too we could not 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.490
 cast the same stallion and 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.710
 after d 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.789
 over time we say good inside the 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.190
 singing we had already started a little 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.070
 oriented to the brake and well that is 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:16.260
 that is reinforced 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.360
 and we saw that we needed 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.939
 function 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.180
 we said good what is a little blood 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:25.650
 functional that we are missing and it was the 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.849
 the Falcon and Victor lines that 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:33.330
 bug so well before we had 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:35.939
 discovered a horse that joined facón 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.400
 with his collisions they are both blood 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.229
 Functional most important here that 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.420
 They use here in Argentina so we take 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.670
 that horse 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.210
 about our mares for three years 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.910
 and we also brought a stallion of Victor 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.630
 that we are using now that is the 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:58.470
 linen boot that yes we think that 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:00.710
 They have a good morphology and good 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.730
 we think it has to be that it is 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.180
 now he has a problem on a rope 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.040
 but if he leaves he will train and good and 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.150
 now we are throwing that stallion and so 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.250
 it's like we arrived we were arming like the 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.400
 genetic map that we have that we have 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.400
 today 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.129
 yes 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.140
 Y
