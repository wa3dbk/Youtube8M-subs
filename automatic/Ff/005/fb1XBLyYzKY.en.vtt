00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
then a flat side as the glass Jem we're

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.060 
then a flat side as the glass Jem we're
going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> take<00:01:04.860> our<00:01:05.010> tape<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.640> line<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
around the base of our glass gem so we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.710 
around the base of our glass gem so we
are<00:01:12.890> want<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.400> flat<00:01:14.700> card<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.210> dipped<00:01:15.479> into

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

other you can do it in any order you
like<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.580> if<00:02:09.670> you'd<00:02:09.789> like<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.090> put<00:02:10.239> the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
like and if you'd like to put the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
droplets of the fingernail polish in

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.650 
droplets of the fingernail polish in
next<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.340> each<00:02:12.459> other<00:02:12.640> instead<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.300> top<00:02:13.510> of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
next to each other instead of on top of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.589 
next to each other instead of on top of
each<00:02:13.780> other<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.620> also<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.599> like

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
each other you can do that also I like

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.780 
each other you can do that also I like
using<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:17.080> light<00:02:17.319> medium<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.130> dark<00:02:18.160> color

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
using a light medium and a dark color

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.240 
using a light medium and a dark color
because<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.050> way<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.830> gives<00:02:21.069> a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
because I like the way that it gives a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.120 
because I like the way that it gives a
contrast<00:02:21.790> when<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.180> swirl<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.989> together<00:02:23.440> it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
contrast when you swirl it together it

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.160 
contrast when you swirl it together it
seems<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.610> show<00:02:24.850> up<00:02:25.030> more<00:02:25.239> as<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.720> center<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.049> a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
seems to show up more as the center of a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.350 
seems to show up more as the center of a
flower<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.549> want<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.030> be<00:02:28.180> more

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
flower but if you want it to be more

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.720 
flower but if you want it to be more
subtle<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.959> can<00:02:29.230> definitely<00:02:29.470> use<00:02:30.100> colors

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
subtle you can definitely use colors

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.210 
subtle you can definitely use colors
that<00:02:30.910> are<00:02:31.030> closer<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.569> same<00:02:31.780> shade<00:02:32.049> now<00:02:32.980> at

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
that are closer to the same shade now at

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.400 
that are closer to the same shade now at
this<00:02:33.400> point<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.510> want<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> make<00:02:34.900> sure<00:02:34.930> that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this point you want to make sure that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.920 
this point you want to make sure that
you<00:02:35.500> don't<00:02:35.769> touch<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.400> outer<00:02:36.760> part<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
you don't touch that outer part of the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.870 
you don't touch that outer part of the
fingernail<00:02:38.230> plus<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.799> see<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.310> has<00:02:39.580> dried

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
fingernail plus you can see it has dried

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.020 
fingernail plus you can see it has dried
the<00:02:40.090> most<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.599> gets<00:02:40.780> sticky<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.400> work

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the most and it gets sticky so I work

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.990 
the most and it gets sticky so I work
from<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.590> inside<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> white<00:02:45.430> layer<00:02:45.670> was<00:02:45.880> the

the same so you can see by touching that

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.870 
the same so you can see by touching that
outside<00:03:49.590> layer<00:03:49.770> it<00:03:49.980> does<00:03:50.190> move<00:03:50.430> all<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> nail
