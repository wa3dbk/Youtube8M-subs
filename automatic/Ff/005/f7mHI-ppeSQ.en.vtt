thrillers<00:00:20.540> have<00:00:20.570> always<00:00:20.810> been<00:00:21.080> very<00:00:21.890> close<00:00:22.340> to

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
thrillers have always been very close to

my<00:00:22.610> heart<00:00:22.820> always<00:00:23.090> been<00:00:23.300> something<00:00:23.540> that<00:00:23.689> I've

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869

loved and and yeah I was pretty clear

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.359 
loved and and yeah I was pretty clear
from<00:00:26.750> pretty<00:00:27.320> early<00:00:27.410> on<00:00:27.680> that<00:00:27.890> if<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.099> was<00:00:28.220> going

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
from pretty early on that if I was going

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.810 
from pretty early on that if I was going
to<00:00:28.400> write<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.759> was<00:00:28.880> going<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:29.060> be<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.210> thriller

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240 

I'm<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.900> big<00:00:34.079> fan<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.290> American<00:00:34.440> crime<00:00:35.040> fiction

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I'm a big fan of American crime fiction

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
I'm a big fan of American crime fiction
I've<00:00:35.550> always<00:00:35.760> grown<00:00:35.970> up<00:00:36.030> reading<00:00:36.720> American

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I've always grown up reading American

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.930 
I've always grown up reading American
crime<00:00:37.500> fiction<00:00:37.739> probably<00:00:38.280> much<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.730> than

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
crime fiction probably much more than

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.700 
crime fiction probably much more than
British<00:00:39.750> crime<00:00:39.900> fiction<00:00:40.140> even<00:00:40.350> though<00:00:40.530> my

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
British crime fiction even though my

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.670 
British crime fiction even though my
books<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.070> actually<00:00:41.160> set<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> UK<00:00:42.680> authors

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
books are actually set in the UK authors

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.450 
books are actually set in the UK authors
I<00:00:43.860> love<00:00:45.050> many<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> varied<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> guess<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
I love many and varied but I guess the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
I love many and varied but I guess the
biggest<00:00:47.760> influence<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.300> me<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.230> author<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
biggest influence on me and the author I

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
biggest influence on me and the author I
love<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.400> most<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.790> probably<00:00:51.059> Michael

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
love the most is probably Michael

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.190 
love the most is probably Michael
Connelly

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.140 

I<00:00:56.400> think<00:00:57.400> how'd<00:00:57.520> you<00:00:57.670> come<00:00:57.850> up<00:00:57.880> with<00:00:58.000> your

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
I think how'd you come up with your

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.580 
I think how'd you come up with your
ideas<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:58.630> probably<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.020> question<00:00:59.170> you<00:00:59.440> get

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
ideas it's probably the question you get

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.260 
ideas it's probably the question you get
asked<00:00:59.770> the<00:01:00.100> most<00:01:00.130> as<00:01:00.460> an<00:01:00.550> author<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.030> think

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
asked the most as an author and I think

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.260 
asked the most as an author and I think
that<00:01:01.450> I'm<00:01:02.200> not<00:01:02.350> sure<00:01:02.500> there's<00:01:02.680> any<00:01:02.860> any<00:01:03.280> really

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
that I'm not sure there's any any really

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.840 
that I'm not sure there's any any really
satisfying<00:01:04.750> answer<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:06.580> my<00:01:06.700> point

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
satisfying answer to that from my point

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.520 
satisfying answer to that from my point
of<00:01:06.940> view<00:01:07.000> there's<00:01:07.300> there's<00:01:07.630> infinite<00:01:08.140> ideas

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
of view there's there's infinite ideas

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.290 
of view there's there's infinite ideas
there's<00:01:08.770> loads<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.190> ideas<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.760> lots<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.180> ideas

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
there's loads of ideas and lots of ideas

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.110 
there's loads of ideas and lots of ideas
come<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.900> me<00:01:11.220> lots<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.340> different<00:01:12.640> times<00:01:12.880> in

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
come to me lots of different times in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.250 
come to me lots of different times in
fact<00:01:13.330> they're<00:01:13.420> coming<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.780> me<00:01:13.810> all<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.080> time

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
fact they're coming to me all the time

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.780 
fact they're coming to me all the time
which<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.500> why<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:14.680> carry<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.100> notebook<00:01:15.370> around

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
which is why I carry a notebook around

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.120 
which is why I carry a notebook around
with<00:01:15.910> me<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:16.990> it's<00:01:17.140> not<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:17.380> much<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.680> ideas

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
with me but it's not so much the ideas

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.560 
with me but it's not so much the ideas
it's<00:01:18.280> how<00:01:18.430> you<00:01:18.490> knit<00:01:18.760> those<00:01:18.910> ideas<00:01:19.360> together

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
it's how you knit those ideas together

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.570 
it's how you knit those ideas together
into<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.170> cohesive<00:01:20.530> whole<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.190> think<00:01:21.430> that's

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
into a cohesive whole and I think that's

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.010 
into a cohesive whole and I think that's
the<00:01:21.850> that's<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.270> real<00:01:22.450> challenge<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.900> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
the that's the real challenge of the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.450 
the that's the real challenge of the
writer<00:01:23.229> not<00:01:23.530> perhaps<00:01:23.680> coming<00:01:24.070> up<00:01:24.250> with<00:01:24.370> the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
writer not perhaps coming up with the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.340 
writer not perhaps coming up with the
original<00:01:24.880> idea<00:01:24.970> but<00:01:25.330> how<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.540> push<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.020> idea

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
original idea but how to push that idea

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.630 
original idea but how to push that idea
forward<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.890> see<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.160> through<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.490> its

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
forward and see it through to its

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.090 
forward and see it through to its
conclusion

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.800 

growing<00:01:34.100> up<00:01:34.189> I'd<00:01:34.340> read<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.549> lot<00:01:34.790> of<00:01:34.909> traditional

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
growing up I'd read a lot of traditional

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.560 
growing up I'd read a lot of traditional
police<00:01:36.380> procedural<00:01:37.009> thrillers<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.549> I<00:01:38.180> admire

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
police procedural thrillers and I admire

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.600 
police procedural thrillers and I admire
them<00:01:39.229> completely<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.070> want<00:01:40.399> to<00:01:40.490> do

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
them completely and I want to do

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.420 
them completely and I want to do
something<00:01:40.909> that<00:01:40.939> was<00:01:41.119> kind<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.689> same

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
something that was kind of in the same

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.529 
something that was kind of in the same
field<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.640> have<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.909> I<00:01:44.090> had<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.299> kind<00:01:44.450> of

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
field and have the I had a kind of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.450 
field and have the I had a kind of
familiar<00:01:44.930> feel<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:45.619> at<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.860> same<00:01:46.039> time<00:01:46.280> was

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
familiar feel but at the same time was

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.620 
familiar feel but at the same time was
something<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:46.909> just<00:01:47.060> had<00:01:47.180> it<00:01:47.299> gave<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.570> a

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
something that just had it gave it a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.240 
something that just had it gave it a
little<00:01:47.659> bit<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.079> twist<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.560> missing<00:01:48.860> person

looked further into it I was just

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.170

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
actually did go missing every year in

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.770 
actually did go missing every year in
the<00:02:18.739> UK<00:02:18.920> alone<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.480> seemed<00:02:20.660> like

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the UK alone you know so it seemed like

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.660 
the UK alone you know so it seemed like
a<00:02:20.810> good<00:02:21.049> starting<00:02:21.560> point<00:02:21.799> for<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.099> for<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.459> kind

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
a good starting point for a for a kind

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.699 
a good starting point for a for a kind
of<00:02:22.760> series<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.299> also<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.599> thought<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.049> it<00:02:24.380> ran

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
of series and also I thought it it ran

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.130 
of series and also I thought it it ran
very<00:02:25.099> nicely<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.760> parallel<00:02:26.269> with<00:02:26.510> David<00:02:26.930> raker

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
very nicely in parallel with David raker

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.170 
very nicely in parallel with David raker
as<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> character<00:02:27.920> who<00:02:28.130> is<00:02:28.160> my<00:02:28.790> series

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
as a character who is my series

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.000 
as a character who is my series
character<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.349> how<00:02:30.500> he<00:02:30.560> felt<00:02:30.920> about

character and and and how he felt about
his<00:02:31.310> wife<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:31.849> how<00:02:31.940> he<00:02:32.000> was<00:02:32.150> grieving<00:02:32.660> about

his wife and how he was grieving about
his<00:02:33.380> wife<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.799> how<00:02:34.010> he<00:02:34.069> would<00:02:34.280> be<00:02:34.400> able<00:02:34.489> to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
his wife and how he would be able to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.160 
his wife and how he would be able to
identify<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:35.480> these<00:02:35.569> people<00:02:35.930> when<00:02:36.049> they

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
identify with these people when they

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.300 
identify with these people when they
came<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.500> see<00:02:36.709> him

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.449 

no<00:02:42.060> he's<00:02:42.209> not<00:02:42.420> based<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.110> anyone<00:02:43.500> particularly

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
no he's not based on anyone particularly

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.570 
no he's not based on anyone particularly
I<00:02:44.910> think<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.870> know<00:02:45.959> almost<00:02:46.620> inevitably<00:02:47.130> parts

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
I think you know almost inevitably parts

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.280 
I think you know almost inevitably parts
of<00:02:47.730> yourself<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> writer<00:02:48.569> go<00:02:48.930> into<00:02:49.200> your

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
of yourself as a writer go into your

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.839 
of yourself as a writer go into your
character<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.739> think<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.099> anyone<00:02:50.520> who<00:02:50.640> says

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
character I think that's anyone who says

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.040 
character I think that's anyone who says
that<00:02:51.000> that's<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.480> case<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:51.870> probably

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that that's not the case it's probably

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.080 
that that's not the case it's probably
telling<00:02:52.500> her<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.739> bit<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> porky<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:53.970> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
telling her a bit of a porky because you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.030 
telling her a bit of a porky because you
do<00:02:54.239> end<00:02:54.420> up<00:02:54.599> you<00:02:54.959> know<00:02:54.989> getting<00:02:55.110> bits<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.800> bits

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
do end up you know getting bits of bits

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.190 
do end up you know getting bits of bits
of<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.310> into<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.610> character<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.569> think<00:02:57.959> I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
of you into the character but I think I

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.589 
of you into the character but I think I
think<00:02:58.319> one<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.819> reasons<00:03:00.300> that

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
think one of the one of the reasons that

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.960 
think one of the one of the reasons that
I<00:03:00.950> wanted<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.069> do<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> missing-persons

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
I wanted to do a missing-persons

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.140 
I wanted to do a missing-persons
investigator<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.680> how<00:03:04.950> kind<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.550> David<00:03:05.849> Rekha

investigator and how kind of David Rekha

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.820 
investigator and how kind of David Rekha
grew<00:03:06.330> out<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.780> was<00:03:06.959> was<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.560> need<00:03:07.800> I

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
grew out of that was was this need I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.699 
grew out of that was was this need I
felt<00:03:08.250> for<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.269> bit<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:10.050> character

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709

felt for a little bit of a character
with<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> bit<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.489> an<00:03:11.550> emotional<00:03:11.819> core<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.540> know

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
the reasons are really connected with

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
had a real emotional heart that perhaps

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.630 
had a real emotional heart that perhaps
you<00:03:27.630> don't<00:03:27.750> get<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.440> much<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.739> British<00:03:29.010> crime

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
you don't get so much in British crime

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.789 
you don't get so much in British crime
fiction<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.450> think<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.870> really<00:03:31.170> really

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.229 
fiction and I think I really really
connected<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.400> those<00:03:32.489> characters<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.209> I

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
connected with those characters and I

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.580 
connected with those characters and I
definitely<00:03:33.510> wanted<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.959> bring<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.200> across

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
definitely wanted to bring that across

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.589 
definitely wanted to bring that across

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
expected her to resonate you know and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.300 
expected her to resonate you know and
that<00:04:02.960> relationship<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.590> resonate<00:04:03.980> quite<00:04:04.220> as

that relationship to resonate quite as

that relationship to resonate quite as
quite<00:04:04.640> as<00:04:04.730> well<00:04:04.910> as<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.150> has<00:04:05.740> you<00:04:06.740> know<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:06.890> don't

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
quite as well as it has you know I don't

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.590 
quite as well as it has you know I don't
want<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.310> spoil<00:04:07.550> too<00:04:07.580> much<00:04:07.970> about<00:04:08.270> what<00:04:08.450> goes

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
want to spoil too much about what goes

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.270 
want to spoil too much about what goes
on<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:08.870> vanish<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.380> won't<00:04:09.590> won't<00:04:09.860> talk<00:04:10.040> about

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
on in vanish so I won't won't talk about

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.830 
on in vanish so I won't won't talk about
it<00:04:10.400> too<00:04:10.550> much<00:04:10.730> but<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.060> think<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.480> know<00:04:11.600> their

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
it too much but I think you know their

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.530 
it too much but I think you know their
relationship<00:04:11.990> is<00:04:12.590> certainly<00:04:12.970> one<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.150> several

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
relationship is certainly one of several

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.410 
relationship is certainly one of several
relationships<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.440> books<00:04:15.710> that<00:04:15.970> span<00:04:16.970> you

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
relationships in the books that span you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.270 
relationships in the books that span you
know<00:04:17.480> all<00:04:17.660> three<00:04:17.959> or<00:04:18.290> all<00:04:18.350> three<00:04:18.920> of<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.130> books

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
know all three or all three of the books

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.970 
know all three or all three of the books
and<00:04:19.519> I<00:04:19.640> think<00:04:19.910> it's<00:04:20.120> it's<00:04:20.660> probably<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.799> one

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
and I think it's it's probably the one

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.460 
and I think it's it's probably the one
that<00:04:22.220> people<00:04:22.580> want<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:22.910> see<00:04:23.000> turn<00:04:23.990> out<00:04:24.230> nicely

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
that people want to see turn out nicely

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.260 
that people want to see turn out nicely
whether<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.280> will<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.670> guess<00:04:26.000> we'll<00:04:26.240> just

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
whether it will and I guess we'll just

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.830 
whether it will and I guess we'll just
have<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.540> find<00:04:26.810> out<00:04:26.930> once<00:04:27.110> we<00:04:27.290> read<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.530> book

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.020 

I'll<00:04:33.590> ever<00:04:33.740> write<00:04:33.860> in<00:04:34.010> Healy<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.340> think<00:04:34.639> he

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
I'll ever write in Healy I think he

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.490 
I'll ever write in Healy I think he

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500

Lee's the reason I introduced Healy
really<00:04:36.740> was<00:04:36.860> because<00:04:37.130> in<00:04:37.220> chasing<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.639> dead

opposite<00:05:06.139> of<00:05:06.260> raker<00:05:07.070> but<00:05:07.340> at<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.520> same<00:05:07.729> time

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
opposite of raker but at the same time

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.540 
opposite of raker but at the same time
they're<00:05:08.300> that<00:05:08.720> they're<00:05:08.990> very<00:05:09.320> very<00:05:09.560> close<00:05:10.280> a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
they're that they're very very close a

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.250 
they're that they're very very close a
lot<00:05:10.760> of<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:10.910> time<00:05:11.120> in<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.389> way<00:05:11.510> they<00:05:11.690> think<00:05:12.020> in

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
lot of the time in the way they think in

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.640 
lot of the time in the way they think in
the<00:05:12.410> way<00:05:12.560> they've<00:05:13.070> both<00:05:13.310> lost<00:05:13.729> people<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.750> and

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
the way they've both lost people and and

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.370 
the way they've both lost people and and
the<00:05:15.800> way<00:05:15.919> in<00:05:16.040> which<00:05:16.160> they<00:05:16.370> grieve<00:05:16.930> quite<00:05:17.930> quite

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
the way in which they grieve quite quite

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.830 
the way in which they grieve quite quite
similarly<00:05:18.860> so<00:05:19.729> that<00:05:20.150> they're<00:05:20.360> in<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.570> it's<00:05:20.750> an

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
similarly so that they're in it it's an

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.570 
similarly so that they're in it it's an
interesting<00:05:20.990> dynamic<00:05:21.470> it's<00:05:21.889> really<00:05:22.340> fun<00:05:22.550> to

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
interesting dynamic it's really fun to

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.790 
interesting dynamic it's really fun to
write<00:05:22.940> because<00:05:23.180> Healy's<00:05:23.810> like<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.260> release

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
write because Healy's like the release

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.650 
write because Healy's like the release
valve<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.430> know<00:05:25.550> he<00:05:25.639> just<00:05:25.850> goes<00:05:26.060> off<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.510> he's

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
valve you know he just goes off and he's

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.140 
valve you know he just goes off and he's
just<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:27.290> hothead<00:05:27.919> whereas<00:05:28.280> rakers<00:05:28.700> like<00:05:28.940> the

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
just a hothead whereas rakers like the

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.510 
just a hothead whereas rakers like the
other<00:05:29.720> side<00:05:29.990> of<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.169> coin<00:05:30.380> he's<00:05:30.680> very<00:05:31.130> similar

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
other side of the coin he's very similar

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.700 
other side of the coin he's very similar
to<00:05:31.669> to<00:05:32.300> Healy<00:05:32.570> but<00:05:32.720> much<00:05:32.960> better<00:05:33.169> at<00:05:33.410> kind<00:05:33.620> of

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
to to Healy but much better at kind of

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.129 
to to Healy but much better at kind of
keeping<00:05:34.070> is<00:05:34.280> his<00:05:34.550> emotions<00:05:35.030> in<00:05:35.150> check<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.720> it

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
keeping is his emotions in check and it

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.840 
keeping is his emotions in check and it
provides<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.950> really<00:05:37.250> interesting<00:05:37.520> dynamic

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
provides a really interesting dynamic

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.880 
provides a really interesting dynamic
when<00:05:38.330> they're<00:05:38.479> taking<00:05:38.870> on<00:05:38.990> these<00:05:39.169> these<00:05:39.470> cases

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
when they're taking on these these cases

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.260 
when they're taking on these these cases
together
