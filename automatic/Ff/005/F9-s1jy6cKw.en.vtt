00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 At the beginning of the year I have a small one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.390
 series started in the 5 technique 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.610
 youtuber out your top 5 engineering products 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.769
 have presented to everyday life and how that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.630
 there is no such thing in series 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.639
 only one consequence but several 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 and therefore welcome 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.500
 two yes to a few other youtubers with 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.320
 on board of course many new and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.359
 other products and yes I would say 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.920
 we do not talk much anymore and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.420
 start directly I wish you still 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.680
 happy easter on the occasion of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 release dates her am 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 Easter Sunday and as always the others 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 youtuber and of course the products 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.290
 the ones shown are all in below 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.730
 linked to the video description and the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.570
 youtuber again at the end of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.190
 this video 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.899
 so definitely look at the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.579
 others over and now but have fun 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.579
 let 's start the video 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.329
 last time it has my iphone 6 with 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.890
 into the top 5 because I am now 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.420
 Just use it every day when I do that 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.050
 I leave it there and so on 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.580
 continue 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.250
 and this time I thought so 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.640
 namely the ipad 2 at first 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.100
 space 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.310
 that is the 16 gigabyte variant in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.690
 space gray is enough for me on the ipad 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.790
 Honestly, because it's mainly me 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.610
 use to watch youtube videos to 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.780
 at prime instant movies and series too 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.670
 stream and so on 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.750
 that means I store relatively little 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.950
 the tablet and needs 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.300
 of course not so 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.160
 a lot of space 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.869
 but I like the device itself 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.910
 just totally good it is easy that 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.860
 display is cool and I think there are 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.890
 almost nothing better on the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 sofa or in bed at wk and at youtube 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.460
 something to look at or like in the net 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.710
 surf a bit on twitter at 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.360
 rummage and so on is for and 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.000
 Tablet really great 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.820
 yes and there is just my choice on the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.789
 ipad 2 , therefore, also my first 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.470
 place because all these devices pretty much 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.509
 expensive are it be a smartphone or 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.130
 Of course it is not a tablet 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.619
 bad if you protect them to just 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.390
 to keep the condition as good as possible and 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.580
 I have some covers for this 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.500
 from the house since I have you 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.659
 just last week or two weeks ago 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.390
 I think the iphone case presented 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.729
 but also for the ipad is just this 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.489
 cover available and I find the things 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.900
 simply great fitting genuine leather 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.930
 So really a very high quality 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.940
 history and yes both of the optics 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.540
 I also like the feel 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.670
 really good 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.640
 except from the features with the magnet 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.230
 when closing and the 360 ​​degrees all around 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.239
 protection the flap does not bother you if you 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.829
 So you can fix it in the back as well 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.180
 I find everything pretty handy 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.829
 you may have seen him as a rebel 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.989
 have then also noticed that I am you 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.280
 really praised today and that 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.049
 all for a decent price 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.160
 So I think the iphone case costs 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.380
 29 euros 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.760
 I think that's true leather cover 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.280
 great workmanship and so on 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.900
 really ok so this is such a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.840
 pretty good overall package 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.299
 Therefore, I use the both for the iPad as 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.170
 also for the iphone 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.940
 maybe you're someone too 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.530
 super likes listening to music 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.750
 at least that's me 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.350
 almost always hear music whether in the car 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.510
 or at home if I am 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.280
 just hang out or whatever I do 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.410
 actually always somehow hear music 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.510
 when I'm not doing anything else and 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.360
 Of course, good headphones are for that 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.390
 not bad that's my choice here 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.330
 the mib m3 per headphone as well 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.430
 had in review and if I'm super cool 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.650
 they have bluetooth that means you have 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.120
 no annoying cable but on a 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.950
 reconnect cables if you can do that 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.800
 want because, for example, the current 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.830
 is the battery I believe 14 hours 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.140
 So it has to be quite a lot 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.300
 processing moderate sound are moderate etc 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.920
 It's really really good 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.730
 Of course, I also use them because they are 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.190
 just good 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.920
 The price is not quite without 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.600
 said everything linked below but the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.640
 Quality is just right here 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.750
 and that's why I can give you that on everyone 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.600
 recommend this case 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.420
 So the metro is so my favorite 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.650
 Over your headphones will be honest 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.930
 said rather than in ear headphones 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.870
 because that sounded dramatically much 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.780
 better is in fourth place 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.900
 actually a very simple gadget or 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.910
 a very simple helper so to speak and 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.320
 Although this is a usb hub 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.430
 So I do not know what kind of device 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.590
 you have if we just the normal 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.590
 pc have a laptop or maybe 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.900
 an ultrabook where connections are often a 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.960
 they are a little tighter over in the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.270
 latest mac book a connection though 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.950
 Well, apart from that connections are often 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.880
 just above all usb-connections as soon as possible 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.320
 you even a little bit external 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.320
 connects because it is not an external one 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.190
 mouse keyboard a hard disk or 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.430
 maybe here with me, for example 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.490
 microphone and so on then you have quite 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.260
 very fast, four five six 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.480
 usb-ports away and that's why I think so 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.360
 usb have a handy one 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.720
 from anchor he has 4 port and of course 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.550
 also usb 3.0 so everything up to date and before 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.170
 all he has is a bit of apple 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.050
 design so it suits very well 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.160
 example with me to the imac and what I 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.420
 I also think it's very convenient 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.310
 me with the Velcro something in the 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.950
 scope of delivery here is on the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.120
 stand climbed or glued and 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.890
 That's why I have the connections 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.840
 directly at the front when I was at that time 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.090
 fast something needs usb stick what 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.350
 also always stuck in it 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.360
 otherwise always a bit at the imac 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.420
 voluntarily because the connections are up 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.550
 sit back and that is 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.830
 Such an advantage in any case 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.710
 a usb hub should be absolute recommendation 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.630
 everyone actually own and on the 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.550
 fifth and thus last place grab 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.740
 Let's get back to the topic of music 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.700
 namely here with this mobile 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.860
 speaker 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.780
 that's the depression with the second 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.240
 generation and also in my eyes 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.980
 very good overall package what just one 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.620
 mobile bluetooth speaker 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.780
 now just where summer is finally coming 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.520
 Of course you can hear happiness as well 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.720
 like to play music for example on the outside 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.850
 terrace or if you are somewhere with 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.200
 friends in the park is and your sun 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.940
 sitting or whatever 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.290
 then there is a bit of music for everyone 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.270
 Of course not bad and that's why 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.550
 these mobile speakers also always 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.140
 popular so what i buy so much 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.170
 More and more people are becoming such a mobile 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.940
 speakers and I really have to say 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.280
 sound mean are the things meanwhile 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.480
 really good battery keeps some 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.430
 hours i believe eight hours or so 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.440
 What is here at the song is one 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.090
 Handsfree with in and to 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.920
 not if the battery is all one has below 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.260
 also a cable directly integrated 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.120
 the part is splash-proof 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.770
 you have such a case that you 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.240
 against sand and so is protected so ever 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.320
 after where you are growing 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.450
 even on vacation at the beach 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.540
 you can always do the sun 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.920
 use and so that is my choice 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.850
 what a mobile bluetooth speaker 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.950
 As for 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.510
 nfc is also on board with the part 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.330
 So basically everything you need 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.840
 Sound tuned for a price from me 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.890
 believe 85 euro is really top so that 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.330
 price performance ratio is 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.190
 one hundred percent in my opinion 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.960
 but if you have one more thing 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.370
 have smaller do you want a few more 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.260
 costs less 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.930
 then look in any case, the top 5 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.460
 video from marvin so from review there 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.560
 is there namely the mini variant 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.160
 to see it from here so in any case 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.220
 daily 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.910
 yes that was already my top five 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.770
 Products 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.330
 I hope as always that you the video 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.010
 has fallen and that the 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.290
 have liked products
