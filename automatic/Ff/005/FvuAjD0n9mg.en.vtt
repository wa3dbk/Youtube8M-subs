one-thirty pretty and uh wtd same parts
as<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.960> original<00:03:24.350> one<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:28.780> w2<00:03:29.780> d<00:03:29.930> stands<00:03:30.650> for

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
as the original one so w2 d stands for

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.140 
as the original one so w2 d stands for
wave<00:03:31.370> wide<00:03:31.730> defense<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.410> can<00:03:33.530> see<00:03:34.150> it's

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
wave wide defense so you can see it's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.430 
wave wide defense so you can see it's
like<00:03:35.360> W<00:03:36.230> D<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.150> has<00:03:38.270> that<00:03:38.480> little<00:03:38.630> wave<00:03:39.050> up

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
like W D but it has that little wave up

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.740 
like W D but it has that little wave up
here<00:03:39.770> that<00:03:40.520> kind<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.790> comes<00:03:41.030> up<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.360> very

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
here that kind of comes up to a very

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.250 
here that kind of comes up to a very
sharp<00:03:42.080> point<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:43.420> over<00:03:44.420> time<00:03:44.630> if<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:44.930> keep

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
sharp point and over time if you keep

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.290 
sharp point and over time if you keep
using<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:46.130> point<00:03:46.430> will<00:03:46.610> kind<00:03:46.940> of<00:03:47.030> dull

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
using this the point will kind of dull

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.020 
using this the point will kind of dull
down<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:48.010> eventually<00:03:49.010> become<00:03:49.340> flat<00:03:49.700> so<00:03:50.000> you

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
down and eventually become flat so you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.210 
down and eventually become flat so you
want<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.330> be<00:03:50.390> careful<00:03:50.600> with<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:50.930> part<00:03:51.320> so

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
want to be careful with that part so

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.930 
want to be careful with that part so
let's<00:03:52.760> do<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> quick<00:03:53.450> comparison<00:03:54.910> here<00:03:55.910> is

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
let's do a quick comparison here is

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.870 
let's do a quick comparison here is
takara<00:03:56.870> tomy<00:03:57.580> Fang<00:03:58.580> Leone<00:04:00.400> no<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.550> stickers

tomy is darker but they pretty much look
the<00:04:39.699> same<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:40.440> takara<00:04:41.440> tomy<00:04:41.470> does<00:04:41.889> have<00:04:42.070> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
the same but takara tomy does have the

the same but takara tomy does have the
middle<00:04:42.340> powder<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:43.110> now<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.169> biggest

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
middle powder and now the biggest

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.409 
middle powder and now the biggest
difference<00:04:44.740> of<00:04:45.160> course<00:04:45.400> is<00:04:45.699> in<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.060> metal

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
difference of course is in the metal

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.490 
difference of course is in the metal
wheel<00:04:46.949> so<00:04:47.949> this<00:04:49.199> Hasbro<00:04:50.199> one<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.880> is<00:04:52.500> Chicago

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
wheel so this Hasbro one this is Chicago

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.490 
wheel so this Hasbro one this is Chicago
me<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.669> which<00:04:54.789> is<00:04:54.940> my<00:04:55.030> Toto<00:04:55.270> means<00:04:55.509> you<00:04:56.259> could

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
me so which is my Toto means you could

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.860 
me so which is my Toto means you could
switch<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:59.289> modes<00:05:00.210> like<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.389> and<00:05:01.630> then<00:05:01.750> you

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
switch the modes like that and then you

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.260 
switch the modes like that and then you
like<00:05:02.020> turn<00:05:02.259> it<00:05:02.349> upside<00:05:02.650> down<00:05:04.979> come<00:05:05.979> on<00:05:06.270> in

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
like turn it upside down come on in

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.140 
like turn it upside down come on in
comes<00:05:07.630> counter<00:05:08.139> mode<00:05:08.520> now<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.580> can't<00:05:09.849> do<00:05:10.000> that

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
comes counter mode now you can't do that

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.370 
comes counter mode now you can't do that
with<00:05:11.759> the<00:05:12.759> hospital<00:05:13.180> version<00:05:13.539> so<00:05:13.810> stays<00:05:14.199> in

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
with the hospital version so stays in

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.490 
with the hospital version so stays in
defense<00:05:14.740> mode<00:05:14.860> all<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.280> time<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:17.880> mean<00:05:18.880> like

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
defense mode all the time I mean like

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.230 
defense mode all the time I mean like
this<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.740> hollow<00:05:21.010> on<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.280> inside<00:05:21.400> like<00:05:22.000> this

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
this is hollow on the inside like this

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.140 
this is hollow on the inside like this
too<00:05:22.960> but<00:05:23.949> that's<00:05:24.099> only<00:05:24.280> because<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.940> needs

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
too but that's only because it needs

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.950 
too but that's only because it needs
this<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.260> fit<00:05:26.440> inside<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:29.729> yeah<00:05:30.729> alright<00:05:31.690> so

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
this to fit inside so yeah alright so

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.339 
this to fit inside so yeah alright so
like<00:05:32.530> it<00:05:33.370> does<00:05:33.610> give<00:05:34.150> more<00:05:34.599> like<00:05:34.960> this<00:05:35.199> is

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
like it does give more like this is

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.490 
like it does give more like this is
definitely<00:05:35.530> not<00:05:35.860> much<00:05:36.220> heavier<00:05:37.440> takara<00:05:38.440> tomy

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
definitely not much heavier takara tomy

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.120 
definitely not much heavier takara tomy
is<00:05:38.860> certainly<00:05:39.220> much<00:05:39.400> heavier<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:41.800> parts

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
is certainly much heavier and the parts

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:48.379 
is certainly much heavier and the parts
are<00:05:42.460> basic<00:05:42.849> basically<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.449> same<00:05:44.310> same<00:05:45.310> color

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389
