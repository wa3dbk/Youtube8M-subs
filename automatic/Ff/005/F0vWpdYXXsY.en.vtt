what super fun problem singing in tech
365.com<00:00:02.879> now<00:00:03.449> say<00:00:03.629> I'm<00:00:03.780> doing<00:00:03.959> unboxing<00:00:04.620> of

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
365.com now say I'm doing unboxing of

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.720 
365.com now say I'm doing unboxing of
the<00:00:05.009> Coolermaster<00:00:05.759> CX<00:00:06.180> 650<00:00:07.020> M<00:00:07.370> power<00:00:08.370> supply

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the Coolermaster CX 650 M power supply

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.000 
the Coolermaster CX 650 M power supply
so<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.630> might<00:00:10.320> as<00:00:10.469> well<00:00:10.620> some<00:00:10.920> people

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
so this is a might as well some people

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.709 
so this is a might as well some people
call<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.309> semi<00:00:11.580> modular<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.150> like<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.599> call

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
call it semi modular but I like to call

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.810 
call it semi modular but I like to call
it<00:00:12.780> fully<00:00:13.139> modular<00:00:13.380> power<00:00:13.740> supply<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.700> I'll

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
it fully modular power supply and I'll

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.760 
it fully modular power supply and I'll
get<00:00:14.969> into<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.389> reasons<00:00:15.750> why<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.199> call<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.710> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
get into the reasons why I call it a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.590 
get into the reasons why I call it a
fully<00:00:16.980> modular<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.640> will<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:17.970> save<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.300> modular

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
fully modular I will not save in modular

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.599 
fully modular I will not save in modular
some<00:00:18.869> people<00:00:19.109> would<00:00:19.199> call<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.500> when<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> open

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
some people would call it when I open

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.730 
some people would call it when I open
the<00:00:20.670> box<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.480> 750<00:00:22.320> watt<00:00:22.529> power

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the box up so this is 750 watt power

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.849 
the box up so this is 750 watt power
supply<00:00:23.130> from<00:00:24.090> corsets<00:00:24.630> 80<00:00:24.869> plus<00:00:25.260> bronze<00:00:25.289> size

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
supply from corsets 80 plus bronze size

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.179 
supply from corsets 80 plus bronze size
so<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.550> did<00:00:26.760> 3<00:00:26.970> years<00:00:27.000> warranty<00:00:27.920> so<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.980> know

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so if I did 3 years warranty so you know

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.220 
so if I did 3 years warranty so you know
you've<00:00:29.369> got<00:00:29.400> three<00:00:29.699> years<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.179> make<00:00:30.840> sure<00:00:30.929> well

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you've got three years to make sure well

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.479 
you've got three years to make sure well
last<00:00:31.439> time<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.769> course<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> very<00:00:32.219> good

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
last time of course is a very good

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.310 
last time of course is a very good
company<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.000> haven't<00:00:33.270> heard<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:34.200> know

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
company and I haven't heard you know

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.470 
company and I haven't heard you know
much<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.640> wrong<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.120> early

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
much about them going wrong that early

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
much about them going wrong that early
on<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> back<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> box<00:00:38.040> you've<00:00:38.250> got

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
on for the back of the box you've got

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.520 
on for the back of the box you've got
things<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> efficiency<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.350> tends

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
things like the efficiency so it tends

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.740 
things like the efficiency so it tends
to<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.680> most<00:00:40.920> efficient<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:41.520> 50%<00:00:41.969> load<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to be most efficient around 50% load and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.290 
to be most efficient around 50% load and
you<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.710> again<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> fans<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:45.030> really

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you know again the fans don't really

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.680 
you know again the fans don't really
seem<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.890> get<00:00:46.890> any<00:00:47.070> louder<00:00:47.280> until<00:00:47.610> 50%<00:00:48.360> onwards

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
seem to get any louder until 50% onwards

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.680 
seem to get any louder until 50% onwards
so<00:00:49.190> before<00:00:50.190> 50%<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.180> quiet<00:00:51.390> fan

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so before 50% it's a really quiet fan

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.470 
so before 50% it's a really quiet fan
and<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> starts<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> speed<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:53.010> after<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.489> so

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and it starts to speed up after that so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.459 
and it starts to speed up after that so
you've<00:00:54.600> got<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> different<00:00:54.930> connectors

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you've got all the different connectors

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.060 
you've got all the different connectors
here<00:00:55.739> you've<00:00:56.610> got<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.140> 24<00:00:58.140> pin<00:00:58.320> ATX<00:00:58.829> connector

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
here you've got one 24 pin ATX connector

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.020 
here you've got one 24 pin ATX connector
which<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.510> modular<00:01:00.989> you've<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> then

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
which is not modular you've got the then

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.160 
which is not modular you've got the then
you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.329> all<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> other<00:01:03.750> connections<00:01:04.080> like

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
you know all the other connections like

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.039 
you know all the other connections like
for<00:01:04.470> PC<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.070> yes<00:01:05.580> eight<00:01:05.970> satyrs<00:01:06.570> six

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
for PC is yes eight satyrs six

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.980 
for PC is yes eight satyrs six
peripherals<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.119> four<00:01:09.119> pin<00:01:09.299> peripherals<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
peripherals and four pin peripherals and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.330 
peripherals and four pin peripherals and
two<00:01:10.200> floppies<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.650> we'll<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.920> into<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> when

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
two floppies or we'll get into that when

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880 
two floppies or we'll get into that when
we<00:01:11.400> open<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.760> box<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.090> itself<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> that's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
we open the box up itself and that's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.649 
we open the box up itself and that's
pretty<00:01:14.100> much<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> actual<00:01:15.000> box<00:01:15.240> itself

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
pretty much it for the actual box itself

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.100 
pretty much it for the actual box itself
there's<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.020> much<00:01:16.200> else<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:17.310> there<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> we'll

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
there's not much else on there so we'll

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
there's not much else on there so we'll
open<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.560> box<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.159> exactly<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:20.970> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
open the box up and see exactly what you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
open the box up and see exactly what you
get<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> box<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.830> I've<00:01:22.979> taken<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> plastic

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
get in the box so I've taken the plastic

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
get in the box so I've taken the plastic
off<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.030> power<00:01:24.270> supply<00:01:24.420> itself<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.229> I'll<00:01:25.290> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
off the power supply itself so I'll just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
off the power supply itself so I'll just
get<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.920> box<00:01:26.100> open<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.030> get

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
get this box open up and see what we get

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.950 
get this box open up and see what we get
inside<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.140> box<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.470> stuff<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.479> start<00:01:30.780> for

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
inside the box and stuff the start for

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
inside the box and stuff the start for
you<00:01:31.110> agree<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> warranty<00:01:32.040> guide<00:01:32.189> so

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you agree with the warranty guide so

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
you agree with the warranty guide so
like<00:01:32.670> two<00:01:32.820> three<00:01:33.000> years<00:01:33.060> warranty<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
like two three years warranty so I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
like two three years warranty so I
probably<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.140> how<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.680> return<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> if

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
probably just how to then return it if

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.760 
probably just how to then return it if
anything<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.729> go<00:01:35.909> wrong<00:01:36.320> with<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> patch<00:01:37.560> by

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
anything just go wrong with the patch by

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340 
anything just go wrong with the patch by

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I've heard from a lot of companies that

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
I've heard from a lot of companies that
never<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:45.000> use<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.420> Swit<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
from the mains for some for many reasons

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.469

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
power adapter to cattle lead so you got

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.920 
power adapter to cattle lead so you got
the<00:02:01.110> UK<00:02:01.350> kettle<00:02:01.680> lead<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.750> you've<00:02:03.750> got<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the UK kettle lead there you've got a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170 
the UK kettle lead there you've got a
bag<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.009> zip<00:02:05.310> ties<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.820> when<00:02:06.000> you're<00:02:06.149> using

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
bag of the zip ties so when you're using

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.760 
bag of the zip ties so when you're using
it<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.630> good<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.899> cable<00:02:07.229> management<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it it's good for cable management in

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.010 
it it's good for cable management in
your<00:02:07.799> case<00:02:08.190> itself<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.910> seeing<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.539> much<00:02:09.869> of

the<00:02:10.080> case<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.470> may<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.709> need<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.920> because

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the case you may not need it because

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.420 
the case you may not need it because
obviously<00:02:11.340> cause<00:02:11.700> unplugged

and<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.980> power<00:02:21.370> supply<00:02:21.549> itself<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.840> that's

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
and the power supply itself and that's

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.020 
and the power supply itself and that's
pretty<00:02:23.409> much<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.680> for<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.890> box<00:02:25.439> so<00:02:26.439> just<00:02:26.469> a

pretty much it for the box so just a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.550 
pretty much it for the box so just a
little<00:02:28.030> bit<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.209> power<00:02:28.359> supply<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:29.379> like<00:02:29.530> I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
little bit of power supply so like I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.699 
little bit of power supply so like I
said<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:30.040> lot<00:02:30.489> of<00:02:31.109> power<00:02:32.109> supply<00:02:32.379> unit

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.879 
module which is some people call it
because<00:03:28.120> these<00:03:28.299> cables<00:03:28.750> here<00:03:28.840> are<00:03:29.049> modular<00:03:29.500> is

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
because these cables here are modular is

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.429 
because these cables here are modular is
because<00:03:30.400> device<00:03:30.669> there's<00:03:30.939> no<00:03:31.359> need<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.750> sort

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
because device there's no need to sort

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.059 
because device there's no need to sort
of<00:03:32.470> not<00:03:32.799> have<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.840> 24-pin<00:03:34.840> connector<00:03:35.109> on<00:03:35.859> your

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
of not have a 24-pin connector on your

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.020 
of not have a 24-pin connector on your
power<00:03:36.489> supply

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
power supply

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.339 
power supply
I'm<00:03:37.329> also<00:03:37.569> people<00:03:37.750> know<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.930> having<00:03:38.260> it

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
I'm also people know that having it

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.990 
I'm also people know that having it
directly<00:03:38.829> into<00:03:39.099> your<00:03:39.310> power<00:03:39.459> provide<00:03:39.849> the

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
directly into your power provide the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.949 
directly into your power provide the
module<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.389> makes<00:03:40.569> it<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.780> bit<00:03:40.930> more

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
module that makes it a bit more

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.039 
module that makes it a bit more
efficient<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.949> wouldn't<00:03:42.759> see<00:03:42.970> any<00:03:43.299> sort<00:03:44.019> of

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
efficient so I wouldn't see any sort of

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.409 
efficient so I wouldn't see any sort of
reason<00:03:44.349> why<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.530> would<00:03:45.099> want<00:03:45.129> Adam<00:03:45.970> modular

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
reason why you would want Adam modular

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.020 
reason why you would want Adam modular
24-pin<00:03:47.049> motherboard<00:03:47.290> connector<00:03:48.159> so<00:03:48.579> yeah

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
24-pin motherboard connector so yeah

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.149 
24-pin motherboard connector so yeah
I'll<00:03:49.180> do<00:03:49.329> classes<00:03:49.720> as<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> fully<00:03:50.139> modular<00:03:50.349> power

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
I'll do classes as a fully modular power

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.610 
I'll do classes as a fully modular power
supply<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:52.659> look<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.019> past<00:03:53.199> website<00:03:53.560> if

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
supply so look in the past website if

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.780 
supply so look in the past website if
you've<00:03:53.739> got<00:03:53.889> where<00:03:54.129> you'd<00:03:54.340> put<00:03:54.370> all<00:03:54.669> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
you've got where you'd put all the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.449 
you've got where you'd put all the
different<00:03:55.409> actual<00:03:56.409> modular<00:03:56.799> cables<00:03:57.189> so<00:03:57.310> your

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
different actual modular cables so your

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.640 
different actual modular cables so your
PC<00:03:57.849> I<00:03:57.879> can<00:03:58.150> actually<00:03:58.269> go<00:03:58.540> here<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:58.780> CPU<00:03:59.470> ones

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
PC I can actually go here you CPU ones

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.499 
PC I can actually go here you CPU ones
here<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.459> you're<00:04:00.639> sayin<00:04:01.030> peripherals<00:04:01.389> and

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:01.509 
here and you're sayin peripherals and

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.420 
here and you're sayin peripherals and
these<00:04:01.629> ones<00:04:01.840> here<00:04:02.019> let's<00:04:03.009> have<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.129> look<00:04:03.280> at<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
these ones here let's have a look at the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.610 
these ones here let's have a look at the
cables<00:04:04.239> close-up<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.169> one<00:04:05.319> of<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.439> things

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
cables close-up so one of the things

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.409 
cables close-up so one of the things
that<00:04:05.709> attracted<00:04:06.099> me<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.609> power<00:04:07.239> supply

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
that attracted me to this power supply

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.259 
that attracted me to this power supply
was<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.409> fact<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.650> all<00:04:08.889> the<00:04:09.069> cable<00:04:09.459> modular

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
was the fact that all the cable modular

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.729 
was the fact that all the cable modular
cables<00:04:10.629> are<00:04:10.720> fully<00:04:10.930> black<00:04:11.229> you<00:04:11.379> don't<00:04:11.500> get<00:04:11.680> a

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
cables are fully black you don't get a

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.219 
cables are fully black you don't get a
sort<00:04:12.009> of<00:04:12.239> blacks<00:04:13.239> leaving<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:13.900> sort<00:04:14.109> of

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
sort of blacks leaving and sort of

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.529 
sort of blacks leaving and sort of
colored<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.829> edges<00:04:15.069> a<00:04:15.099> bit<00:04:15.159> like<00:04:15.539> this

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
colored on the edges a bit like this

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.210 
colored on the edges a bit like this
cable<00:04:16.870> here<00:04:16.989> because<00:04:17.259> if<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.799> do<00:04:17.979> obviously

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
cable here because if you do obviously

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.219 
cable here because if you do obviously
do<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.639> good<00:04:19.239> cable<00:04:19.599> management<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.079> your

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
do a good cable management with your

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.190 
do a good cable management with your
case<00:04:20.969> more<00:04:21.969> than<00:04:22.029> likely<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.510> only<00:04:22.719> ever<00:04:22.930> see

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
case more than likely you only ever see

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.659 
case more than likely you only ever see
the<00:04:23.229> end<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.950> cable<00:04:24.099> here<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.550> rest

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
the end of the cable here and the rest

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.250 
the end of the cable here and the rest
will<00:04:24.789> be<00:04:24.880> tucked<00:04:25.090> behind<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.539> case<00:04:25.719> so<00:04:26.110> when

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
will be tucked behind the case so when

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.480 
will be tucked behind the case so when
you<00:04:26.320> look<00:04:26.469> into<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.740> all<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:27.039> ever<00:04:27.130> see<00:04:27.279> is<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
you look into it all you ever see is the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.430 
you look into it all you ever see is the
coloured<00:04:27.789> part<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.690> with<00:04:28.840> these<00:04:29.050> rather<00:04:29.289> than

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
coloured part but with these rather than

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.600 
coloured part but with these rather than
having<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.650> sleeve

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
having a sleeve

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.870 
having a sleeve
you've<00:04:30.849> got<00:04:30.969> a<00:04:31.000> fully<00:04:31.330> black<00:04:31.570> K<00:04:31.930> which<00:04:32.169> means

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
you've got a fully black K which means

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
you've got a fully black K which means
regardless<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:34.000> how<00:04:34.180> much<00:04:34.330> of<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.539> cable<00:04:34.840> is

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
regardless of how much of the cable is

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.570 
regardless of how much of the cable is
showing<00:04:35.260> they<00:04:35.620> will<00:04:35.740> still<00:04:35.979> look<00:04:36.130> nice<00:04:36.310> in

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
showing they will still look nice in

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.040 
showing they will still look nice in
your<00:04:36.729> case<00:04:36.909> especially<00:04:37.389> if<00:04:37.779> you<00:04:37.900> have<00:04:37.990> a

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
your case especially if you have a

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.640 
your case especially if you have a
windowed<00:04:38.380> case<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:40.389> look<00:04:40.779> at<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.289> cables

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
windowed case so look at the cables

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.370 
windowed case so look at the cables
you've<00:04:41.740> got<00:04:41.889> so<00:04:42.099> I've<00:04:42.219> got<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:43.199> got<00:04:44.199> a<00:04:44.229> couple

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
you've got so I've got the got a couple

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.899 
you've got so I've got the got a couple
of<00:04:44.500> molex<00:04:44.889> cables<00:04:45.880> here<00:04:47.010> we've<00:04:48.010> got<00:04:48.130> some<00:04:48.430> PCI

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
of molex cables here we've got some PCI

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.899 
of molex cables here we've got some PCI
okay<00:04:49.539> well<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:49.900> you've<00:04:50.169> got<00:04:50.310> quite<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.370> few<00:04:51.580> six

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
okay well so you've got quite a few six

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.750 
okay well so you've got quite a few six
pin<00:04:52.240> six<00:04:52.810> plus<00:04:52.990> two<00:04:53.139> pin<00:04:53.440> PCI<00:04:53.889> cables<00:04:54.550> and

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
pin six plus two pin PCI cables and

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.209 
pin six plus two pin PCI cables and
there<00:04:55.419> should<00:04:55.599> be<00:04:55.630> one<00:04:55.779> eight<00:04:56.349> pin<00:04:56.650> cable<00:04:56.860> in

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:57.219 
there should be one eight pin cable in

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:02.399 
there should be one eight pin cable in
here<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.060> yeah<00:04:58.599> another<00:05:00.240> six<00:05:01.240> plus<00:05:01.449> two<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:02.169> six

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
here so yeah another six plus two to six

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.480 
here so yeah another six plus two to six
plus<00:05:02.560> twos<00:05:02.800> here<00:05:04.199> two<00:05:05.199> more<00:05:05.440> on<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:06.070> one<00:05:06.250> here

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
plus twos here two more on this one here

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.450 
plus twos here two more on this one here
just<00:05:06.639> for<00:05:09.750> we<00:05:10.750> got<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:10.930> couple<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:11.229> molex<00:05:11.650> so<00:05:12.339> the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
just for we got a couple of molex so the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.640 
just for we got a couple of molex so the
