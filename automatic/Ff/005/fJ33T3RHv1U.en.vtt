00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.420
 How do we come to the protection of the tenth edition of Count Karl Malden Medical 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.509
 Keller 1 This is Hope's most traditional and important 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.509
 International there were races here in Vienna 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.579
 There are some novelties in this year's performance namely the distance 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.890
 2460 meters the troupe is serious and after a long break a race again 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.599
 from the tapes 15 Werders six nationalities years and again with 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.210
 this is the winner of the last two years 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.739
 the Swedish Foreign Minister and Walwei Kind 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.640
 he is clear that things are now cleared here and had to be meters 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280
 Default slightly failed 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 It is certainly not easy to win for the third time in a row 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.750
 the Austrian chances lie above all with the spell chamber it is with 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.879
 The fourfold champion Georg Maier and we make a trip to four times 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.879
 the stable to get you in the right mood for this event 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.760
 because there is bustle and tense atmosphere on the coach 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.820
 Jan Filc Georg Meier is that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.200
 its most valuable piece of way to avoid it being wrong representatives 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 to have smoked too much 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.850
 only just noticed 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.390
 well-protected ears 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.690
 and Meier looks in front of the stable the chances for the funnyordie 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.020
 vl and performance ago, it is safe to generally refuse because quiet 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.760
 Mail order Merchant Guerrero did not have that 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.310
 hopes also the German airline has the Upper Austrian duty the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.590
 Family ownership is still the case 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.610
 the seven year old Lea Hawke Steinfeld and much earlier in Sweden successfully 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.820
 although on the depth start number 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660
 Phone and slower so that is not good way 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.040
 Mueller of the windows-pcs associate possible 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.080

 Years is a warm-up phase left Kiel, entitled the Street 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.350
 Hertha BSC is the case Rebstock Kammeier does not expect a win 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.790
 but that will not come with immediate effect 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.060
 The nine-year class had the Gold Inn handlebars more in the legs 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.669
 maybe that's why the events and Artur financial circles 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.790
 MySpace had set the pace to the rhythm of the Tibetans 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.409
 they often need to go back sooner 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.959
 but that he now sees somewhere else 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.149
 Seconds later 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.129
 ssv coach if he is the center 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.219
 the resort 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.949
 the convicted release 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:34.609
 Opal Viking's strongest competitor is also a difficult one on paper 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.960
 Opponents but not yet scored 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.590
 Â«We are now challenged were it for him, it was now again 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.590
 Advised Martin Abadir 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.379
 his goal so far good that something like FTP work Essence 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.219
 There is no special treatment for Tuesday before the race 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.540
 Kings massages 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 for the fast Rheine 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.369
 the state will think more and in the second edition phase that some drivers 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.890
 watch 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.550
 This time Hague will be sent back from the reason 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.780
 clearly no one is already pretty tight knows also veteran Meier 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.340
 Project manager Adrian villages a gesture Ehrenberg percent 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.159
 For Bayern there was a momentum going on and the man had to 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.109
 be destroyed in a true a video assume that some of the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.290
 According to Vaarts' lesson, 43 percent will go to 3 0 percent 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:35.459
 and their bikes 15 fair the line the 2009 watch out for such 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.949
 Gebauer 4 took the city champion is 11 the GCH the from the first volume 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.309
 Foreground distance 2460 meters 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:48.779
 3 Unger Rische guests then in front of the distance 2004 will be 80 meters the strongest 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:53.629
 perhaps the logical ones with the number 14 are about 40 meters specification 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.739
 Opal largely the Swedish exception thereby starts from the distance of 2000 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.739
 and 1200 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:07.309
 there is a dense crowd in the bands but it works without 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.120
 Defective in this residential area 2009 but not quite correct 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.299
 Do not choose all are the perfect starting position draftsman and poet

 Gamer it means reacts with a mistake 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.460
 does not matter if 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.960
 and as a result obstructs the storming Opal Viking the forward 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.889
 Preliminary decision of the situation the Monier goes in 2009 after a few meters 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.689
 Formally, four horses who were very well trained pastoralists in a duel 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:41.129
 to remember the lead between test with Wolfgang big 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.580
 and outside, Dan Ditib Diamant take command with Georg Frick 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.539
 It goes in a swift ride through the first stage rehearsals 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.469
 behind it tried to come up with the slow 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.630
 in the front of course the man in the lead Georg Frick tries hard to up the pace 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.229
 do not keep the competition close enough 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.729
 another push on the first Steiger evening Dahlenburg 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.080
 putting the Italian gas field Flamingo ahead with Lamberg to Cut the Nottie 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.080
 in second position next to the leader 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.819
 this thanks to order then it goes 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.110
 change past the triple 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.280
 Veit distance is completed another 1000 100 meters this called the air Opal 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.840
 largely fought back despite the bug being in it 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.629
 hopeless position from the end of the field by Rudi Haller who tried 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.580
 to get here again 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.610
 the Austrians are outrageous there is a gap, "said the penalty

 Obstruction of Opal Viking seven-day driving ban 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
 the crucial question no 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:07.090
 Galler a three hits we have 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:19.500
 al 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.930
 Kaa 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.099
 as in other countries sowing hatred 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.809
 only wonder if she now has 9 against Laupheim because we have against one 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.059
 clearly beaten 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:38.119
 large train station under the leadership of their provinces sent the guests and there 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.869
 a lot too much for and against 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:44.969
 Daimler was still young should the EU are not allowed it is always a 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:45.599
 little way 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.599
 hopefully good was not going to want him to stay that way 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:50.369
 to repeat 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.369
 the duo he had the first Austrian successes in one
