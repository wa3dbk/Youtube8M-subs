I'll<00:02:07.660> just<00:02:07.930> go<00:02:08.050> off<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.200> ones<00:02:08.500> by<00:02:08.679> myself<00:02:09.100> I

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
I'll just go off the ones by myself I

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.210 
I'll just go off the ones by myself I
need<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.520> about<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:11.100> went<00:02:12.100> across

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
need to think about this and went across

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.190 
need to think about this and went across
New<00:02:12.640> Year<00:02:12.850> think<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.360> still<00:02:13.600> have<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.930> sketch

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
New Year think I still have that sketch

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.080 
New Year think I still have that sketch
somewhere<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.640> little<00:02:15.760> napkin

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
somewhere and it's like a little napkin

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.060 
somewhere and it's like a little napkin
sketch<00:02:16.510> about<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> first<00:02:17.170> sketch<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.950> we

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
sketch about the first sketch that we

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.130 
sketch about the first sketch that we
started<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.580> go<00:02:18.970> towards<00:02:19.420> Kratos<00:02:19.930> with

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
started to go towards Kratos with

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.370 
started to go towards Kratos with
doubled<00:02:20.860> waves<00:02:21.160> big<00:02:21.880> thick<00:02:22.209> blade<00:02:22.420> swinging

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
doubled waves big thick blade swinging

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.310 
doubled waves big thick blade swinging
around<00:02:23.680> with<00:02:23.980> his<00:02:24.640> chains<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.600> an<00:02:25.780> artist<00:02:25.930> I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
around with his chains as an artist I

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.970 
around with his chains as an artist I
would<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.739> push<00:02:27.070> him<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:28.810> game<00:02:29.140> artist

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
would like to push him as a game artist

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.250 
would like to push him as a game artist
where<00:02:30.489> we<00:02:30.580> ended<00:02:30.820> up<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.120> think<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.600> works<00:02:31.959> well

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
where we ended up I think it works well

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.560 
where we ended up I think it works well
my<00:02:33.100> first<00:02:33.430> started<00:02:33.820> here<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.360> PATA

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
my first started here for the PATA

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.600 
my first started here for the PATA
tingling<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.560> main<00:02:35.739> thing<00:02:35.769> like<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.370> theory

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
tingling the main thing like the theory

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.220 
tingling the main thing like the theory
behind<00:02:36.760> all<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.269> was<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.630> maintain<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
behind all of it was to maintain the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.170 
behind all of it was to maintain the
fluidity<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.799> change<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.430> fact<00:02:40.090> of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
fluidity of the change and the fact of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.630 
fluidity of the change and the fact of
their<00:02:40.299> weight<00:02:40.660> at<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.320> end<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.590> them<00:02:41.769> but<00:02:42.370> not

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
their weight at the end of them but not

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.410 
their weight at the end of them but not
not<00:02:43.480> crippled<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.989> play<00:02:44.200> because<00:02:44.799> of<00:02:44.980> it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
not crippled to play because of it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.910 
not crippled to play because of it
why<00:02:46.420> nothing<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:47.110> over<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.530> place<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.890> was

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
why nothing go over the place it was

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.250 
why nothing go over the place it was
actually<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:52.260> performance

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
actually just like like a performance

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.910 
actually just like like a performance
know<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.650> sounds<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.549> know<00:02:54.670> but<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.239> not<00:02:55.299> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
know it sounds you know but it's not the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
know it sounds you know but it's not the
biggest<00:02:56.920> challenge<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.400> guess<00:02:57.430> would<00:02:57.790> be

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
biggest challenge I guess would be

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.780 
biggest challenge I guess would be
animating<00:02:58.930> his<00:02:59.890> blades<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.640> beginning

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
animating his blades in the beginning

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.210 
animating his blades in the beginning
the<00:03:01.299> rig<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.750> really<00:03:02.140> support<00:03:02.319> that<00:03:02.829> kind<00:03:03.069> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the rig and really support that kind of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.550 
the rig and really support that kind of
weapon<00:03:03.609> so<00:03:04.030> there<00:03:04.329> was<00:03:04.480> an<00:03:04.599> evolution<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
weapon so there was an evolution and the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.580 
weapon so there was an evolution and the
way<00:03:06.040> we<00:03:06.579> handle<00:03:07.000> all<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.420> now<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.959> animators

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
way we handle all that now the animators

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.099 
way we handle all that now the animators
are<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.769> lot<00:03:09.010> happier<00:03:09.659> actually<00:03:10.659> everything

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
are a lot happier actually everything

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.660 
are a lot happier actually everything
with<00:03:11.409> the<00:03:11.560> rig<00:03:11.709> right<00:03:11.890> now<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.220> pretty<00:03:12.459> good

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
with the rig right now is pretty good

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.690 
with the rig right now is pretty good
it's<00:03:13.060> pretty<00:03:13.299> pretty<00:03:13.810> easy

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
it's pretty pretty easy

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.150 
it's pretty pretty easy
cradles<00:03:15.150> compared<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.620> first<00:03:16.830> game

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
cradles compared to the first game

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.520 
cradles compared to the first game
Kratos<00:03:17.790> would<00:03:18.660> never

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
Kratos would never

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.199 
Kratos would never
vicious<00:03:21.530> guy<00:03:21.770> when<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> was<00:03:22.580> trying<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.060> put

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
vicious guy when I was trying to put

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.820 
vicious guy when I was trying to put
into<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.510> as<00:03:23.660> well<00:03:23.810> as<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:24.260> would<00:03:24.380> sort<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
into it as well as it would sort of the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.740 
into it as well as it would sort of the
violence<00:03:25.640> but<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.850> also<00:03:26.060> had<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.360> bit<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.569> a

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
violence but it also had a bit of a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.190 
violence but it also had a bit of a
style<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.760> felt<00:03:29.060> cool<00:03:29.330> playing<00:03:29.990> this

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
style so that you felt cool playing this

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.690 
style so that you felt cool playing this
guy

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.370 

we<00:03:33.700> wanted<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:33.970> keep<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.300> player<00:03:34.510> interested

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
we wanted to keep the player interested

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.320 
we wanted to keep the player interested
so<00:03:35.650> we<00:03:35.950> can't<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.310> do<00:03:36.460> a<00:03:36.490> rehash<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.180> the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
so we can't just do a rehash of the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.540 
so we can't just do a rehash of the
color<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.630> something<00:03:38.110> else<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.400> we

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
color of something else and so we

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.100 
color of something else and so we
struggled<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:39.940> lot<00:03:40.060> with<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.330> powers<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.990> also

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
struggled a lot with the powers and also

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.320 
struggled a lot with the powers and also
the<00:03:41.320> weapons<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.830> in<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.580> first<00:03:42.790> game<00:03:42.940> we<00:03:43.180> had

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
the weapons and in the first game we had

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.060 
the weapons and in the first game we had
one<00:03:43.570> sub<00:03:43.810> weapon<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.260> chains<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.710> swords

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
one sub weapon the chains in the swords

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.700 
one sub weapon the chains in the swords
and<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.420> we<00:03:46.540> knew<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:46.990> needed<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.320> expand

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
and so we knew that we needed to expand

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.520 
and so we knew that we needed to expand
upon<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.460> really<00:03:48.820> wanted<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.530> experience

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
upon that I really wanted to experience

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.440 
upon that I really wanted to experience
that<00:03:50.890> being<00:03:51.280> cut<00:03:51.520> down<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.790> side<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.180> fall

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
that being cut down the side that fall

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.750 
that being cut down the side that fall
from<00:03:52.480> grace<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.290> have<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.800> player<00:03:54.100> experience

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
from grace and have a player experience

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.450 
from grace and have a player experience
that<00:03:55.030> during<00:03:55.810> play<00:03:56.080> like<00:03:56.500> actually<00:03:57.130> have<00:03:57.160> to

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
that during play like actually have to

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.610 
that during play like actually have to
deal<00:03:57.730> with<00:03:57.880> all<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.510> then<00:03:58.590> take<00:03:59.590> a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
game but actually the technical signs

this<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.460> model<00:04:22.730> with<00:04:23.210> action<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.080> we<00:04:24.380> use

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
this is a model with action and we use

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.260 
this is a model with action and we use
the<00:04:24.889> green<00:04:25.100> color<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.760> do<00:04:25.910> all<00:04:26.120> the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the green color to do all the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.510 
the green color to do all the
transparency<00:04:26.990> initially<00:04:27.710> was<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:28.130> was<00:04:28.310> very

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
transparency initially was it was very

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.270 
transparency initially was it was very
hard<00:04:28.820> because<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.330> design<00:04:30.110> always<00:04:30.500> asks<00:04:30.980> for

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
hard because the design always asks for

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.480 
hard because the design always asks for
a<00:04:31.310> lot<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.639> things<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.889> my<00:04:33.889> initial<00:04:34.400> reaction
