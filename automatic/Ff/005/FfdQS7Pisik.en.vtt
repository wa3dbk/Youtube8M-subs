00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 State-of-the-art flight a glimpse into the future of unmanned aircraft without a pilot five-party paper 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.309
 It was released for the first time. 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.590
 From misunderstanding the disaster to the individual six aircraft 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.590
 It is expected to be utilized. 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.080
 This fact, one UAV use, install the four propeller airship slowly to the public 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.960
 Come up 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:34.600
 Let's reach for one kind of composition UAV in the air so they enter the scouting 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.090
 The landing party's popularity is not based on the base, but landed with a flying hand 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.460
 The airship plays an aviation security role. 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.410
 It will enlarge the radius of activities of UAV . 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.659
 Like a Korean Mam 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:55.059
 A small UAV will go to Silk and a small UAV will be in the destination part 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:57.699
 Do a mission on what line to do and recharge and do a little charging 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:02.199
 Such a scenario would be that 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:07.150
 Punishment 3 I am a worker, and a veteran of Uri is spreading broth. 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:11.740
 Shows harmonious movement with constant spacing 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.350
 This is a force technique that controls the cooperation of UAVs . 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.330
 Do not let Lee Soo-young become unmanned. 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:24.070
 Advanced anal techniques such as precision position control and collision avoidance have been applied 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.330
 Unlike a normal helicopter, the propeller turns forward , 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.520
 I saw it. 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.410
 It can be cultured on vertical wall or ceiling closely . 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.760
 Can be utilized 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:42.220
 The unmanned aerial vehicle , which was exhibited at the aerospace exhibition in KINTEX 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:46.930
 All five vertical take-off and landing technologies have been applied 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.640
 It will be applied to the development of unpersonal personal use to operate the city ​​center . 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:58.180
 The application of future three-dimensional, agreeable pink technology 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.710
 Tab is a very promising technology that can release the current car of the future 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.260
 I will. 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:09.970
 It runs like a car. It floats like a helicopter . 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.379
 The air in the dream we could see in the movies is increasingly becoming a reality 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.379
 ytn is piled up
