00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.319
 day in heathrow and welcome to one 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.889
 more monday minis this time it works 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.590
 why is this card linked today ? 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.520
 follow from this series of this new 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.890
 series is port of greed or top gear 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.869
 probably one of the best known forbidden ones 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.810
 cards yu gi oh 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.970
 which is very old in any case and also 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 the effect is very strong though 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.830
 someone who does not know eats pulls two 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.469
 cards and people will wonder 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.180
 why is the map connected to me 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.300
 so many other cards have too 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 the effect of 4 2 cards 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.610
 that's because pot of greed is one 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.559
 the card has no cost the activity 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 card and pull two immediately 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.820
 cards 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.910
 this is very very strong introduce yourself time 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.120
 in front of six wiener cross or scholl or 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.100
 clifford or I do not know with the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.070
 library outside somehow 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.870
 access to one or two or three top 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 gear 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 that would be pretty tough and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.229
 without any of it after that too 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.900
 because it simply has none 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.460
 cost target two cards just like that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 Let's look at other cards the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.159
 have the same effect with practically 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.890
 goal two cards 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 then the card is immediately invading 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.009
 the reckless creed or daredevil greed 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.710
 in german self effect 2 cards but 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.290
 then you have your next 2-3 rocks 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 skip faces of these 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.020
 and that's about him that's about 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.759
 the same effect, it is the same 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.220
 effect so simply aim two heads 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.079
 away just so first is one 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.869
 Folded Card That means you have to go first 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.060
 put and then you have to wait until he 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.200
 and then if you have them in yours 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.880
 you want to activate then 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.549
 they wait practically two rounds 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.820
 you can activate and then you have to 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.250
 for two times sacrifice your your face 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.610
 and should not we draw closer 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.799
 knowing and that's why it's one 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.140
 fairer version of top gear 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.450
 then there are the cards for the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.819
 example 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.310
 direct litter are from top gear that 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.590
 is, for example, the yaw scherbe the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.470
 and the same effect is so they are 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.040
 lets them pull you two cards 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.680
 but you have to wait two more rounds 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.540
 like at red bull street and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.400
 It is also a perfect cleanliness 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.230
 that means it can be invested 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.690
 or kastel or whatever 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.670
 and if you then, for example, two 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.410
 wait for your second village lacie 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.860
 has on the map you have 210 make 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.959
 on it and then just go mst and 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.720
 You waited two routes for free 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.630
 that is then quite disadvantageous of 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.810
 the map compared to the top gear then 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.130
 cards like kettcar they let you too 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.470
 draw two cards 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.140
 however, you have to for this card 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.660
 sacrifice your normal summon and you 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.849
 you have to do it in the mail faced 1 then 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.140
 you have to offer that well so should 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.269
 then defenseless in the sense 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.430
 then you draw it two cards and then 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.750
 you have to finish your train immediately 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.220
 that's pretty tough 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.079
 disadvantage the card entails only 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.420
 to draw two cards what top.de 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.000
 just like that would do or like cards 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.060
 coface just happens to be her 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.549
 Throws a coin and pulls the result 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.799
 you two cards what in that are then 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.660
 also without cost is but you have her 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.010
 the risk of being an opponent on two 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.910
 draws cards and that's the one 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.100
 disadvantage or cards like europe.net or 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.290
 shallow we gloom now pulls too 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.030
 just two can from the deck but you 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.010
 then have a mushroom as a monster of the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.600
 bandaged and if you have kainz 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.459
 then you have your entire hand on the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.560
 cemetery so throw that too pretty 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.840
 violent disadvantages or secret of seven 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.000
 stars you have to be a level 7 monster 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.340
 banish from rage of your sulfur 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.700
 side open and should be two cards 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.440
 pull 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.799
 but you can only profit one thing 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.049
 activate from before the swords or 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.970
 of which I hard a single horse 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.340
 and same principle with trading so you 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.590
 have to one of the two drop 819 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.419
 draw cards and not every Beck 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.310
 plays level 8 or with seven monsters 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.400
 or dark monsters around the effects 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.600
 to activate and also magic plenter is 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.320
 also his card 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.690
 actually, I'll tell you about the design 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.210
 her and so on is support of 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.320
 breed because it is one of my card her 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.170
 you can activate this 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.900
 you just pull two cards and the 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.270
 only condition is that you for that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.530
 an open trap or an open trap 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.600
 permanent fall Send to reader 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.100
 then have to pull two cards what 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.740
 may also be materially disadvantageous 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.260
 such otherwise high alloyed or me 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.150
 also say flatrates would go too 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.520
 as we and ines or light lock the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.110
 Mirror or Imperial Eisenhower 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.280
 then you have to go worth it and show 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.860
 but to put in itself is a very 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.500
 low cost and I believe you 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.260
 understands with so many cards now 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.390
 why daughter is ever prohibited is it 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.590
 simply a too good effect without cost 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.970
 The man can activate it immediately 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.630
 his mail face because it's in the summer card 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.790
 is normal and therefore just too much 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.350
 good, must be used I agree too 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.050
 Perfect to get the card up 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.370
 no case to come back 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.250
 where guest alternative already 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.360
 show that pulling two cards is already 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.730
 a privilege so completely real though 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.340
 is already something where you say for where you 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.420
 I should pay for that 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.570
 just a fekter here just like that 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.580
 and yes your opinion of the 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.190
 read whole thing in the comments 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.080
 really very much like his 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.360

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.370
