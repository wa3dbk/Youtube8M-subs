darken and then especially in the water
right<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.300> area<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.990> over<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.090> lot

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
right in this area and over here a lot

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.970 
right in this area and over here a lot
more<00:01:15.300> detail<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> come<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.800> we

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
more detail is going to come out as we

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.719 
more detail is going to come out as we
go<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.700> higher<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.530> think<00:01:19.550> 63%<00:01:20.550> is<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
go a little bit higher I think 63% is a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
go a little bit higher I think 63% is a
really<00:01:21.240> good<00:01:21.390> starting<00:01:21.690> point<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
really good starting point for this

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.540 
really good starting point for this
image<00:01:23.780> contrast<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.140> next<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.190> is<00:01:26.250> your

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
image contrast is next and this is your

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.120 
image contrast is next and this is your
standard<00:01:26.640> contrast<00:01:27.710> it'll<00:01:28.710> increase<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
standard contrast it'll increase the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
standard contrast it'll increase the
contrast<00:01:29.550> throughout<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.570> entire<00:01:30.930> image

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
contrast throughout the entire image

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.820 
contrast throughout the entire image
this<00:01:32.040> defaults<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.610> 6%<00:01:33.110> will<00:01:34.110> increase<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
this defaults at 6% will increase that a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.590 
this defaults at 6% will increase that a
bit<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:37.520> 46<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> good<00:01:39.240> point<00:01:39.690> for<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
bit to 46 is a good point for that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.399 
bit to 46 is a good point for that
saturation<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.020> standard

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
saturation this is your standard

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
saturation this is your standard
saturation<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.850> increase

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
saturation so this is going to increase

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.530 
saturation so this is going to increase
the<00:01:45.360> vibrancy<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> colors<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.000> image<00:01:48.299> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the vibrancy of colors in the image so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.140 
the vibrancy of colors in the image so
watch<00:01:48.900> up<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.619> there's<00:01:49.880> light<00:01:50.880> light

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
watch up in here there's light light

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.010 
watch up in here there's light light
greens<00:01:52.580> here<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> greens<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> rocks

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
greens here and the greens on the rocks

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.710 
greens here and the greens on the rocks
as<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.619> increase<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.070> saturation<00:01:57.000> we're

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
as we increase the saturation we're

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.190 
as we increase the saturation we're
going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.900> take<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.260> up<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.560> bit

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
going to take that up a bit

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.490 
going to take that up a bit
39%<00:02:01.200> looks<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.220> good<00:02:02.930> next<00:02:03.930> control<00:02:04.290> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
39% looks really good next control is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.330 
39% looks really good next control is
the<00:02:04.650> effect<00:02:05.040> radius<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.200> affects<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the effect radius so this affects the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.300 
the effect radius so this affects the
size<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.360> object<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.679> detail

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
size of the object that the detail

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.940 
size of the object that the detail
extractor<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.180> working<00:02:12.630> with<00:02:12.840> right<00:02:13.620> now<00:02:13.650> it's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
extractor is working with right now it's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.839 
extractor is working with right now it's
set<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.160> normal

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
set to normal

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.759 
set to normal
and<00:02:15.969> if<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:16.239> go<00:02:16.359> to<00:02:16.390> fine<00:02:16.810> we'll<00:02:17.170> see<00:02:17.379> how<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
and if we go to fine we'll see how that

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.830 
and if we go to fine we'll see how that
affects<00:02:18.249> the<00:02:18.430> image<00:02:18.579> notice<00:02:19.359> how<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> water

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
affects the image notice how the water

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.179 
affects the image notice how the water
has<00:02:20.109> gotten<00:02:20.379> a<00:02:20.469> little<00:02:20.560> more<00:02:20.709> ribbon-like

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
has gotten a little more ribbon-like

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.000 
has gotten a little more ribbon-like
especially<00:02:21.790> over<00:02:21.969> in<00:02:21.999> this<00:02:22.150> area<00:02:22.769> so<00:02:23.769> we'll<00:02:23.889> go

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
especially over in this area so we'll go

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.099 
especially over in this area so we'll go
back<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.280> drawl

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
back to drawl

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.920 
back to drawl
it's<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.200> little<00:02:26.739> bit<00:02:26.859> lighter<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:27.719> if<00:02:28.719> we<00:02:28.810> go

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
it's a little bit lighter and if we go

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.750 
it's a little bit lighter and if we go
to<00:02:28.959> large<00:02:29.379> so<00:02:29.680> that's<00:02:29.829> affecting<00:02:30.280> larger

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
to large so that's affecting larger

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.610 
to large so that's affecting larger
objects<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.040> more<00:02:33.219> subtle<00:02:34.290> let's<00:02:35.290> go<00:02:35.469> with

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
objects it's a more subtle let's go with

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.339 
objects it's a more subtle let's go with
fine<00:02:35.889> for<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.219> image<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:37.200> next<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.319> have

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
fine for this image and next we have

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.140 
fine for this image and next we have
these<00:02:38.560> shadows<00:02:38.980> protection<00:02:39.519> slider<00:02:39.849> which

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
these shadows protection slider which

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.349 
these shadows protection slider which
defaults<00:02:41.139> at<00:02:41.260> 0%<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.700> don't<00:02:42.760> think<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.209> need

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
defaults at 0% and I don't think we need

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.750 
defaults at 0% and I don't think we need
to<00:02:43.480> do<00:02:43.599> anything<00:02:43.810> with<00:02:44.109> that<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:45.370> highlights

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
to do anything with that the highlights

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.940 
to do anything with that the highlights
protection<00:02:46.239> slider<00:02:46.540> defaults<00:02:47.019> at<00:02:47.109> 0%<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.889> I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
protection slider defaults at 0% and I

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.589 
protection slider defaults at 0% and I
think<00:02:48.159> we're<00:02:48.340> fine<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.000> high<00:02:49.030> light<00:02:49.359> side

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
think we're fine on the high light side

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.119 
think we're fine on the high light side
too<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:52.480> click<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> drop<00:02:53.260> down<00:02:53.290> arrow<00:02:53.500> next<00:02:53.829> to

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
too we click the drop down arrow next to

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.890 
too we click the drop down arrow next to
control<00:02:54.549> points<00:02:54.939> we'll<00:02:55.060> open<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.510> control

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
control points we'll open the control

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.309 
control points we'll open the control
points<00:02:56.379> menu<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.879> we<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.299> new<00:02:58.510> slider<00:02:59.109> we

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
points menu and we see the new slider we

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.890 
points menu and we see the new slider we
have<00:02:59.530> which<00:02:59.799> is<00:02:59.829> the<00:03:00.219> opacity<00:03:00.879> slider<00:03:01.359> that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
have which is the opacity slider that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.030 
have which is the opacity slider that
defaults<00:03:02.409> at<00:03:02.560> 100%<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.620> let's<00:03:05.620> reduce<00:03:05.829> that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
defaults at 100% and let's reduce that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.860 
defaults at 100% and let's reduce that
quite<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.609> bit<00:03:06.730> we're<00:03:07.000> just<00:03:07.180> gonna<00:03:07.359> look<00:03:07.569> at<00:03:07.689> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
quite a bit we're just gonna look at the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.800 
quite a bit we're just gonna look at the
rocks<00:03:08.199> right<00:03:08.560> now<00:03:09.000> want<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> reduce<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
rocks right now want to reduce the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.559 
rocks right now want to reduce the
details<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.799> rocks<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.519> just<00:03:13.239> let<00:03:13.419> that

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
details in the rocks and just let that

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.339 
details in the rocks and just let that
be<00:03:13.719> a<00:03:13.750> little<00:03:14.109> bit<00:03:14.260> softer<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:16.199> think<00:03:17.199> that

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
be a little bit softer I think that

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.979 
be a little bit softer I think that
looks<00:03:17.530> good<00:03:17.739> right<00:03:18.099> there<00:03:18.659> we're<00:03:19.659> gonna<00:03:19.780> bring

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
looks good right there we're gonna bring

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.629 
looks good right there we're gonna bring
back<00:03:20.169> to<00:03:20.409> full<00:03:20.650> effect<00:03:21.009> of<00:03:21.159> the<00:03:21.220> detail

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
back to full effect of the detail

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.990 
back to full effect of the detail
extractor<00:03:22.269> filter<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.280> waters<00:03:24.759> by

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
extractor filter just in the waters by

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.710 
extractor filter just in the waters by
using<00:03:25.389> a<00:03:25.780> plus<00:03:26.709> control<00:03:27.220> point<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.389> I'll<00:03:28.479> drop

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
using a plus control point so I'll drop

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.979 
using a plus control point so I'll drop
that<00:03:28.949> control<00:03:29.949> point<00:03:30.250> right<00:03:30.519> there<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.900> the

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
that control point right there and the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.259 
that control point right there and the
control<00:03:32.349> point<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.799> looking<00:03:33.250> at<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.759> pixels

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
control point is looking at the pixels

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.369 
control point is looking at the pixels
underneath<00:03:34.689> it's<00:03:34.930> looking<00:03:35.199> at<00:03:35.259> the

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
underneath it's looking at the

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.179 
underneath it's looking at the
hue/saturation<00:03:36.419> color<00:03:37.919> texture<00:03:38.919> and

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
hue/saturation color texture and

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.860 
hue/saturation color texture and
luminosity<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:40.060> then<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.299> going<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.569> apply

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
luminosity and then it's going to apply

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.439 
luminosity and then it's going to apply
the<00:03:40.930> effect<00:03:41.439> of<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.769> control<00:03:42.220> point<00:03:42.579> in<00:03:42.849> this

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
the effect of that control point in this

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.170 
the effect of that control point in this
case<00:03:43.659> a<00:03:43.689> plus<00:03:44.049> control<00:03:44.470> point<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:45.669> any<00:03:45.849> similar

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
case a plus control point to any similar

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.610 
case a plus control point to any similar
pixels<00:03:46.750> within<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.290> area<00:03:48.099> of<00:03:48.310> influence<00:03:48.790> so

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
pixels within the area of influence so

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.780 
pixels within the area of influence so
we'll<00:03:50.620> increase<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.009> area<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.549> influence

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
we'll increase the area of influence

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.530 
we'll increase the area of influence
just<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.269> little<00:03:52.629> bit<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.759> that<00:03:54.759> looks<00:03:55.000> really

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
just a little bit and that looks really

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.319 
just a little bit and that looks really
good<00:03:55.900> right<00:03:56.470> there<00:03:56.919> let's<00:03:57.759> take<00:03:57.909> a<00:03:57.970> look<00:03:58.209> at

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
good right there let's take a look at

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.059 
good right there let's take a look at
the<00:03:58.449> original<00:03:58.569> image<00:03:59.079> now<00:03:59.409> by<00:03:59.560> clicking<00:03:59.620> on

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
the original image now by clicking on

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.699 
the original image now by clicking on
the<00:04:00.159> compare<00:04:00.519> button<00:04:01.259> so<00:04:02.259> there's<00:04:02.439> where<00:04:02.620> we

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
the compare button so there's where we

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.809 
the compare button so there's where we
started<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:03.959> there's<00:04:04.959> where<00:04:05.169> we<00:04:05.319> are<00:04:05.819> so

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
started and there's where we are so

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.610 
started and there's where we are so
let's<00:04:06.969> add<00:04:07.120> one<00:04:07.150> more<00:04:07.479> control<00:04:08.109> point<00:04:08.379> we'll

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
let's add one more control point we'll

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.649 
let's add one more control point we'll
make<00:04:08.859> a<00:04:08.889> copy<00:04:09.189> of<00:04:09.400> this<00:04:09.669> plus<00:04:10.000> control<00:04:10.419> point

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
make a copy of this plus control point

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.569
