00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone with you dangerous b and today 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.560
 It will be about the external battery from 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.620
 xiaomi companies at 10,000,400 milliamps 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.259
 hours I will not say that this review I 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.630
 I'll just show you about it 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.460
 company and how much battery can you once 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.500
 charge any device 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.500
 well let's start let's go 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.879
 so this power bank is external 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.699
 battery for 10 thousand 400 milliampere hours 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.379
 but actually I did it like that 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.970
 i only have two devices that i 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.530
 Charged on yusbi this iphone 5 and ipod 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.079
 touch fifth generation 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.809
 It means such a background and charged five times a 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.040
 ipod about four times at iphone 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.449
 battery capacity 1520 miles ampere hours 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.729
 ipad and about 1000 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.239
 that is, it turns out somewhere was 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:04.690
 incompatibility in energy i.e. issue 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.570
 energy well and it turned out somehow so this is 4 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.470
 I took it charged about 7-8 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.550
 percent from zero he charged about 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.229
 an hour and a half but the output current is just for 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.259
 ipad battery but for iphone it 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.280
 there will be a lot of input current here 5 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:28.030
 volt 2 amps and ear on the top 5 1 volts per 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.539
 2 and 1 amp well, in principle, yes it is a lot 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.220
 for iphone i charge this battery 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.420
 also of course a better adapter from 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.479
 ipad because he gives more 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.670
 energy and 3 honeycomb from iphone also 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.979
 there 5 volts 1 amp will hold the whole 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.800
 day as in principle i have in the morning 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:53.830
 I will insert it in the evening it is already charged with me 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.080
 so here we have the usual usb is for 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.690
 energy output for charging devices and 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.840
 microusb for charging by wire which 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.290
 was bundled i usually charge four 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.770
 indicator that show the state 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.690
 battery and button to turn on ie 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.840
 when flashing the battery is turned on 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.130
 for a while it just turns off 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.500
 the battery went on like this 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.400
 plastic case inside there only 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.450
 Chinese manual and website 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.600
 and everything and this case was like this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.020
 box 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.360
 There is a code for checking on the site as 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.970
 xiaomi company is very big in china and 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.640
 and often fake they make phones 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.680
 tablets and accessories 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.190
 I advise you to order all the products of the company 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.620
 all on the site that nedele because there 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.530
 Only the original is my battery, I certainly 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.740
 same checked and such good results 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.170
 she issued therefore I advise everyone 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.940
 remove if you like where you are going 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.570
 or just to have it and 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.600
 choose a smaller 5,600 in my opinion she 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.209
 and it looks a little smaller and it is more 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.480
 compact well here is such a cool 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.450
 thing i'm honestly very pleased 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.019
 charge 5 times iphone and four times ipod 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.260
 touch of the fifth generation is actually 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.390
 very cool maybe we and then I 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.060
 will order and then maybe the same pieces 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.680
 We will play with you therefore
