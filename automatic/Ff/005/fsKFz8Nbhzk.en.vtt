lot of competition within the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.500 
lot of competition within the
organization<00:04:08.720> for<00:04:08.750> poor<00:04:09.500> spot<00:04:09.799> so<00:04:10.130> it's<00:04:11.030> never

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
organization for poor spot so it's never

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.640 
organization for poor spot so it's never
a<00:04:11.630> bad<00:04:11.720> thing<00:04:11.900> when<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.350> have<00:04:12.500> that

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
a bad thing when you have that

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.259 
a bad thing when you have that
competition<00:04:12.950> because<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.489> forces<00:04:14.120> everyone

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
competition because it forces everyone

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.440 
competition because it forces everyone

to raise their level of play so I you
know<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.600> think<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.410> depths<00:04:18.709> we<00:04:18.799> have<00:04:18.979> in

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
know I think that the depths we have in

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.830 
know I think that the depths we have in
that<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:20.180> great<00:04:20.359> thing<00:04:20.419> for<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
that is the great thing for the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.280 
that is the great thing for the
organization

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
organization

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.230

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
uh even for me because it's going to

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.190 
uh even for me because it's going to
force<00:04:24.480> me<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.810> play<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:25.470> much<00:04:25.590> better<00:04:25.770> now

a chance to work with Frankie I had
heard<00:04:46.200> some<00:04:46.410> things<00:04:46.560> about<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.400> know<00:04:47.520> him

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
heard some things about you know him

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.610 
heard some things about you know him
being<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.750> know<00:04:48.840> kind<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.140> his<00:04:49.290> way<00:04:49.470> or<00:04:49.530> the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
being you know kind of his way or the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.190 
being you know kind of his way or the
highway<00:04:49.680> sort<00:04:50.250> ideal<00:04:50.580> but<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.330> know<00:04:51.420> I<00:04:51.480> I<00:04:51.540> I

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
highway sort ideal but you know I I I

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.110 
highway sort ideal but you know I I I
think<00:04:52.650> that's<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.040> far<00:04:53.250> from<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.490> truth<00:04:53.610> and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
think that's so far from the truth and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.940 
think that's so far from the truth and
i'm<00:04:54.300> not<00:04:54.330> sure<00:04:54.480> where<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:55.470> kind<00:04:55.830> of
