00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.090 
passivity
and<00:00:49.499> then<00:00:49.679> is<00:00:49.829> certainly<00:00:50.159> talking<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and then is certainly talking about the

and then is certainly talking about the
goats<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.819> course<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.179> Capricorn<00:00:54.679> and

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
goats which of course is Capricorn and

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.700 
goats which of course is Capricorn and
we<00:00:55.859> are<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.719> decadence<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.839> Capricorn<00:00:58.499> in

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
we are in the decadence of Capricorn in

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.209 
we are in the decadence of Capricorn in
this<00:00:58.920> case<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.199> Crowley<00:01:01.499> the<00:01:01.739> Great<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
this case and so Crowley the Great the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.000 
this case and so Crowley the Great the
Capricorn<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.420> girls<00:01:03.960> upon<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> sphere<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
Capricorn the girls upon the sphere is a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.640 
Capricorn the girls upon the sphere is a
great<00:01:05.400> work<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.300> fertility<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.440> great

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
great work which is fertility the great

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.499 
great work which is fertility the great
work<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.460> was<00:01:08.670> working<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> holy

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
work is to do was working for the holy

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.830 
work is to do was working for the holy
guardian<00:01:09.960> angel<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.680> his<00:01:10.770> spiritual<00:01:11.280> forces

guardian angel and his spiritual forces

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.770 
guardian angel and his spiritual forces
so<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.250> idea<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> had<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.450> calm

a<00:02:35.750> three-dimensional<00:02:36.750> hexagram<00:02:37.940> hexagram

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
a three-dimensional hexagram hexagram

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.800 
a three-dimensional hexagram hexagram
balances<00:02:39.540> energies<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:42.239> much

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.680 

this<00:02:45.810> idea<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:47.129> hexagram<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.540> with

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
this idea of a hexagram is to do with

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.500 
this idea of a hexagram is to do with
Tiferet<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.099> spirit<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:52.380> course<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
Tiferet and the spirit is of course the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.140 
Tiferet and the spirit is of course the
ones<00:02:54.720> who<00:02:54.959> pushes<00:02:55.470> fire<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.400> she<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.760> able<00:02:56.910> to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
ones who pushes fire so she is able to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.470 
ones who pushes fire so she is able to
control<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.099> other<00:02:59.099> balanced<00:02:59.640> energy<00:02:59.910> so

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
control the other balanced energy so

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.830 
control the other balanced energy so
there<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.780> projective<00:03:01.319> forces<00:03:01.860> from<00:03:02.370> there

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
there are projective forces from there

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.770 
there are projective forces from there
in<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.799> left<00:03:05.099> hand<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.790> curved<00:03:06.209> her<00:03:06.510> proper

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
in the left hand is curved her proper

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.289 
in the left hand is curved her proper
disc<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.920> sphere<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.370> heaps<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.790> circles

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.350 
disc the sphere of heaps and circles
interlaced<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.069> disc<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.670> other

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
interlaced so this is the disc of other

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.500 
interlaced so this is the disc of other
disc<00:03:12.660> starts<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:15.030> fully<00:03:15.299> dark

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.960 
disc starts and it's fully dark
three-dimensional<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:17.579> something

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
three-dimensional and it's something

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.259 
three-dimensional and it's something

that she calls within cheese she's has

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.410 
that she calls within cheese she's has
this<00:03:21.450> ability<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.370> capture<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.150> hold

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
this ability to to in capture and hold

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.229 
this ability to to in capture and hold
the<00:03:24.989> complete<00:03:25.739> energy<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.489> discs<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:27.000> her

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the complete energy of the discs in her

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.530 
the complete energy of the discs in her
hands<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.160> she's<00:03:29.400> not<00:03:29.549> attached<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.359> and

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
hands so she's not attached to it and

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.270 
hands so she's not attached to it and
indeed<00:03:30.630> she's<00:03:31.139> not<00:03:31.319> looking<00:03:31.590> at<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.069> money

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
indeed she's not looking at the money

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.920 
indeed she's not looking at the money
she's<00:03:32.549> actually<00:03:32.730> looking<00:03:33.329> into<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.690> far

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
she's actually looking into the far

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.160 
she's actually looking into the far
distance<00:03:34.639> so<00:03:35.639> this<00:03:36.540> whole<00:03:36.750> idea<00:03:36.780> of

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
distance so this whole idea of

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.140 
distance so this whole idea of
non-attachment<00:03:37.380> sand<00:03:38.160> mining<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.639> material

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
non-attachment sand mining and material

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.860 
non-attachment sand mining and material
things<00:03:39.359> is<00:03:39.720> very<00:03:39.750> strong<00:03:40.260> within<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.739> card

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
things is very strong within this card

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.050 
things is very strong within this card
so<00:03:42.870> let's<00:03:43.109> Crowley<00:03:43.440> say<00:03:43.650> about<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
so let's Crowley say about this the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.080 
so let's Crowley say about this the
queen<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.299> disks<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.489> who<00:03:47.489> these<00:03:47.700> people

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
queen of disks and who these people

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.140 
queen of disks and who these people
represent<00:03:48.739> these<00:03:49.739> are<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.549> represent<00:03:51.000> the
