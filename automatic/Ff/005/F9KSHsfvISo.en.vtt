paper dg2 for not zombies this is my
first<00:00:21.779> attempt<00:00:22.200> at<00:00:22.290> it<00:00:22.500> I've<00:00:22.710> watched<00:00:23.070> several

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
first attempt at it I've watched several

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.390 
first attempt at it I've watched several
other<00:00:23.910> videos<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.830> that's<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.039> basically

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
other videos and that's what basically

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.560 
other videos and that's what basically
inspired<00:00:27.029> me<00:00:27.260> when<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:28.980> started<00:00:29.670> it's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
inspired me when I first started it's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
inspired me when I first started it's
completely<00:00:31.019> bored<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.470> had<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:32.040> couple<00:00:32.610> weeks<00:00:32.879> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
completely bored I had a couple weeks to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.979 
completely bored I had a couple weeks to
do<00:00:33.330> stuff<00:00:33.629> so<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.650> just<00:00:35.220> got<00:00:35.400> out<00:00:35.519> an<00:00:35.790> old<00:00:36.269> Cocoa

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
do stuff so I just got out an old Cocoa

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.220 
do stuff so I just got out an old Cocoa
Puffs<00:00:37.199> box<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.860> cereal<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.699> I<00:00:39.600> started<00:00:39.930> making

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Puffs box of cereal and I started making

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.500 
Puffs box of cereal and I started making
this<00:00:40.320> wall<00:00:40.559> right<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.769> and<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:42.150> eventually

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this wall right here and that eventually

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.549 
this wall right here and that eventually
turned<00:00:42.900> into<00:00:43.670> this<00:00:44.670> main<00:00:44.940> section<00:00:45.530> where<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
turned into this main section where I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
turned into this main section where I
then<00:00:46.890> made<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> stock<00:00:47.519> started<00:00:48.449> adding<00:00:48.600> some

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
then made the stock started adding some

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.109 
then made the stock started adding some
of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.049> detail<00:00:49.729> and<00:00:50.729> I<00:00:50.850> worked<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> Power

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:54.119 
of the detail and I worked on the Power

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.820 
of the detail and I worked on the Power
Cell<00:00:54.479> I<00:00:54.809> guess<00:00:55.080> that's<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.799> call

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
Cell I guess that's what I like to call

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.430 
Cell I guess that's what I like to call
it<00:00:56.040> I'm<00:00:56.790> not<00:00:57.030> exactly<00:00:57.449> sure<00:00:57.720> what<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.989> would<00:00:58.110> be

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it I'm not exactly sure what it would be

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.490 
it I'm not exactly sure what it would be
in<00:00:58.559> real<00:00:58.739> life<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.850> transformer<00:01:00.540> for<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
in real life in the transformer for that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.609 
in real life in the transformer for that
I'm<00:01:01.799> also<00:01:02.040> not<00:01:02.250> sure<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> would<00:01:02.970> be<00:01:03.619> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I'm also not sure what it would be and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.340 
I'm also not sure what it would be and
then<00:01:04.769> I've<00:01:04.890> got<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.190> front<00:01:05.869> I'm<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.110> sure

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
then I've got the front I'm not sure

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.280 
then I've got the front I'm not sure
what<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> call<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.040> either

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
what you call that either

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
what you call that either
I've<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> element<00:01:11.189> 1<00:01:11.280> 1<00:01:11.460> 5<00:01:11.670> I've<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I've got the element 1 1 5 I've got the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
I've got the element 1 1 5 I've got the
piece<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> Tesla<00:01:13.470> coil<00:01:13.830> which<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.220> not

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
piece of the Tesla coil which is not

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.180 
piece of the Tesla coil which is not
it's<00:01:15.270> amplified<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.410> should<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.800> these

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
it's amplified as it should be these

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.720 
it's amplified as it should be these
rings<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.670> usually<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.300> lot<00:01:18.450> bigger<00:01:18.660> but<00:01:19.730> then

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
rings are usually a lot bigger but then

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.750 
rings are usually a lot bigger but then
I've<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.840> vacuum<00:01:22.050> tubes<00:01:22.560> an<00:01:23.070> off<00:01:23.580> switch

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
I've got the vacuum tubes an off switch

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
I've got the vacuum tubes an off switch
which<00:01:23.910> doesn't<00:01:24.540> stay<00:01:24.810> off<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:26.850> doesn't<00:01:27.180> stupid

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
which doesn't stay off it doesn't stupid

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.310 
which doesn't stay off it doesn't stupid
and<00:01:29.060> then<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.810> reload<00:01:31.590> lever<00:01:32.900> I'm<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.170> sure

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and then the reload lever I'm not sure

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.610 
and then the reload lever I'm not sure
what<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.530> call<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.420> can<00:01:36.420> pick<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.050> off<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
what you call it I can pick this off and

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.220 
what you call it I can pick this off and
work<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.940> right<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
work with it right now I have to

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.170 
work with it right now I have to
reinforce<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.920> stock<00:01:41.190> because<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.850> held<00:01:42.030> in

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
reinforce the stock because it's held in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.530 
reinforce the stock because it's held in
there<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.480> hot<00:01:42.690> glue<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.260> two<00:01:43.590> pieces<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
there with hot glue and two pieces of

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.080 
there with hot glue and two pieces of
paper<00:01:45.540> once<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.260> roll<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.590> paper<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.850> stock

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
paper once you roll to paper the stock

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.350 
paper once you roll to paper the stock
itself<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.690> very<00:01:48.870> durable<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.980> I<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:51.240> come

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
itself is very durable like I can come

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.380 
itself is very durable like I can come
over<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.610> show<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.670> guys<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.270> it's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
over here and show you guys but it's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.260 
over here and show you guys but it's
like<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> pick<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.200> up

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.740 

it's<00:02:01.200> nice<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> strong<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.670> front<00:02:03.299> end<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it's nice and strong the front end was a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.190 
it's nice and strong the front end was a
little<00:02:04.049> bit<00:02:04.170> long<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.770> mean<00:02:05.270> if<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.720> piece

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
little bit long I mean if this piece

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.100 
little bit long I mean if this piece
should<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.560> been<00:02:07.680> farther<00:02:08.160> back<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.750> mean

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
should have been farther back but I mean

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.640 
should have been farther back but I mean
it<00:02:10.259> still<00:02:10.800> works<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.239> okay

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
it still works like this so it's okay

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.080 
it still works like this so it's okay
and<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.130> said<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.400> stock<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.819> really

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and like I said the stock is really

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.949 
and like I said the stock is really
loose<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.349> broke<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:18.840> gonna

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
loose and you just broke it it's gonna

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.690 
loose and you just broke it it's gonna
be<00:02:19.080> hard<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.290> fix<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.260> vacuum<00:02:22.500> tube<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.280> just

so<00:02:55.810> I'm<00:02:56.200> not<00:02:56.380> sure<00:02:56.440> what<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.220> either<00:02:57.610> but

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
so I'm not sure what this is either but

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.699 
so I'm not sure what this is either but
I<00:02:58.360> was<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.200> drawn<00:02:59.560> with<00:02:59.739> Sharpie<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:02.410> stock

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
I was just drawn with Sharpie the stock

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.710 
I was just drawn with Sharpie the stock
is<00:03:02.950> not<00:03:03.070> accurate<00:03:03.760> it's<00:03:03.940> not<00:03:04.120> like<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> one<00:03:04.600> in

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
is not accurate it's not like the one in

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.900 
is not accurate it's not like the one in
the<00:03:04.810> game<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.320> doesn't<00:03:05.530> I've<00:03:06.340> never<00:03:06.520> added<00:03:06.730> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the game it doesn't I've never added a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the game it doesn't I've never added a
trigger<00:03:07.239> because<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.630> don't<00:03:08.020> want<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.410> because

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
trigger because I don't want to because

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.690 
trigger because I don't want to because
after<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:11.170> complete<00:03:11.620> all<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.430> then<00:03:12.519> I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
after I complete all of this and then I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.520 
after I complete all of this and then I
like<00:03:12.910> turning<00:03:13.360> around<00:03:13.480> I'm<00:03:13.720> all<00:03:13.989> excited

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
like turning around I'm all excited

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.110 
like turning around I'm all excited
shoot<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:14.980> then<00:03:15.130> nothing<00:03:15.340> happens<00:03:15.880> when<00:03:16.060> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
shoot and then nothing happens when I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.990 
shoot and then nothing happens when I
pull<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.420> trigger<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.810> makes<00:03:16.959> me<00:03:17.080> feel<00:03:17.230> bad<00:03:18.000> so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
pull the trigger it makes me feel bad so

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.290 
pull the trigger it makes me feel bad so
I<00:03:19.060> don't<00:03:19.269> feel<00:03:19.390> like<00:03:19.540> pointing<00:03:19.810> up<00:03:19.930> triggering

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
I don't feel like pointing up triggering

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.350 
I don't feel like pointing up triggering
but<00:03:22.300> it's<00:03:22.690> pretty<00:03:23.170> accurate<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.800> scale<00:03:24.360> I've

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
but it's pretty accurate the scale I've

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.009

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
real wires I don't of course

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.320 
real wires I don't of course
