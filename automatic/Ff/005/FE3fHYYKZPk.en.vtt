00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.630
 hello with you alex forehead stars and today 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.529
 I would like to talk about gaming bots 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.450
 mechanics went so a few months 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.520
 back I caught sight of one 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.980
 curious post which expounded 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.810
 revelations of the former employee of vag this 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.550
 post was published in one of the top 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.590
 tank groups VKontakte 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.510
 what kind of group was it now 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.790
 no longer remember and that's not the point 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.310
 were there even really revelations 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.829
 former employee unknown for sure 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.510
 it is possible that he did his 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.640
 sort of fanfiction group sharing 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.570
 even if so infa anyway 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.730
 interesting 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.460
 so I decided to share it with you 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.679
 The first part of the post was devoted to the bot 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.019
 from the vaga itself yes yes while 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.210
 developers severely cut out all who 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.510
 household no they themselves led his group the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.519
 beach and at the release stage in 2010 but in 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.620
 there is nothing wrong with luggage 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.780
 abbot is used exclusively on 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.020
 the first third levels for what it was 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.240
 done reasons 2 1 with bots 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.490
 balancer forms teams faster 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.070
 and if some of the real 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.620
 players do not have enough, he scored these places 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.960
 bots for the second reason 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.630
 novice players at least do something to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.790
 I will beat the fight much easier every 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.220
 sand team on each side in battle 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.770
 there may be up to five bots to distinguish bots 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.960
 according to statistics it is almost impossible in 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.270
 them laid eaten at the average beginner 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.700
 the player who skated three or four hundred 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.430
 battles acts bots as follows 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.800
 go ahead shoot on the go can 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.080
 shoot at the light in general nothing 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.090
 remarkable act as if 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.340
 understand where they should go 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.590
 for them on the cards spelled standard 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.540
 travel routes with a small 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.880
 deviation error in case 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.220
 necessary because it is done 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.100
 manually and people are not always enough and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.930
 more important tasks are explained very 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.210
 limited number of cards for 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.179
 sand fights and a very rare appearance 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.129
 new account data and not intended 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.410
 for sale but even if somehow 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.599
 way and quit to access 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.670
 such an account there will be all that 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.040
 it is possible for the century itself to be a little bit farmed 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.100
 a few hours game the second part of the post 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.960
 dedicated graph 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.120
 and the mechanics were all laid 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.940
 equal odds 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.400
 Ie 50 on 50 with small 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.650
 the error on the sword it all looks 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.750
 it is logical but each of us came across 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.000
 the fact that the team merges almost 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.800
 dry out of the blue why so 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.830
 what happens is that even 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.600
 statistics of any individual player 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.180
 the server is forcedly nailed to these 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.250
 10 percent this way if the player 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.650
 starts to recruit more than fifty 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.990
 percent wins it balances to drain 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.300
 command for this command apply 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.820
 reduced ratios of all that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.680
 only possible projectile will fly away edge 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.010
 Circle information ricochets and non-penetration 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.470
 will be from any cardboard surface and in 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.750
 any projection tanks drain teams 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.970
 will be stitched anywhere and so 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.550
 further in this way at the meeting of two 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.250
 equal machines in equal conditions this fight 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.130
 and the reverse approach is obvious applied to 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.950
 players whose winning percentage is below 45 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.260
 what again infa not one hundred percent 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.480
 original source unknown 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.000
 and all this can be just a fake 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.550
 but it looks pretty interesting yes and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.330
 gives at least some explanation 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.670
 surprise mba bar 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.610
 What do you think about this? 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.680
