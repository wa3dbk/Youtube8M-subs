00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.160
 m 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.300
 who is he 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.109
 so thing promised thing due 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.429
 here is the great contest we promised you 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.279
 in addition it falls well since it is the return of the psn 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.590
 and the thirty thousand subscribers 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.570
 so we're going to say it's a stone two shots 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.869
 by the way about that 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 you really want to thank you for your dynamism 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.269
 hugo encouragements the good atmosphere prevailing on this chain 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.980
 in my meningitis style to compose the video 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.659
 the aiba I hope it will continue as well 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:36.970
 long time possible 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.390
 while we stand 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.220
 I will explain the rules because we will have to be very attentive 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.649
 actually there are rules that must be respected 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.550
 it goes of course that the duty black ops 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.640
 the crcm that's why as a target you will understand we would like this 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.900
 who is on a cloud 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.880
 why not 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.570
 you explain to yourself the rules of the contest so the tears to use and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.609
 the mp5 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.259
 no other benefit for m besson the game mode this is the general 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.120
 so the match to death solo 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.690
 that's great in 1500 points so it's going to be so if the game is 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.690
 interrupted 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.670
 esch gnagnagna water problems head and will pay now is he 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.760
 you really have to have the game from zero to one thousand five hundred 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.700
 not two for him this elimination we must listen to this pace there 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.320
 there is no immigration police the industry member these nice robots 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.360
 of elimination and in fact it's going to be the fastest of you then between 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.760
 10 meters the elysée part 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.980
 who so seniors to contests so here's the idea to give you the date of 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.400
 end of the contest is June 15 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.810
 you know about three to three weeks here until June 15 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.420
 I think I would have understood why it's happening on black ops that's all 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 simply because there is no death 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.150
 in addition to its part in the shared files 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.690
 so that one is a proof even beaten 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.580
 I think I could not suggest so now I'm going to show you 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.660
 how can you waste your time a skier it's important to know the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.800
 time of a weekend the moment when it takes then I ask it 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.330
 right now 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.680
 then you have recorded your best you are in the studio 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.769
 you have to watch the game so it starts 4 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.459
 and it's now 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.849
 as soon as the display 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.059
 I try without help 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.649
 we must start now 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.390
 to take it and there now the end of the game 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.339
 it really is 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.359
 here is when playing a dam 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.429
 at the same time or the display of returns 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.909
 it's the cub had to stop the time so that there really is no dispute 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.809
 at that level when you have recovered your time I will 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.969
 advise to put it in title of the video like that if you want 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.759
 improve it will be easy for you to see where you were and then there 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.089

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:54.239
 the usual a mermaid in photo with an album whose cultural mco des qg des 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.179
 grandchildren complicated on and here you go on the album page 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:02.949

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:07.849
 your nickname of players and the platform on which you evolve if you 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.519

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.350
 beginning of the contest but in apathy album really respect that it's me
