or in sets of a dozen so i bought three
dozen<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.060> them<00:02:25.150> why<00:02:26.050> i'm<00:02:26.710> not<00:02:26.890> exactly<00:02:27.130> sure

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
dozen of them why i'm not exactly sure

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.540 
dozen of them why i'm not exactly sure
but<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.480> see<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.720> comes<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.370> strap<00:02:30.370> a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
but you can see it comes with strap a

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.170 
but you can see it comes with strap a
wrist<00:02:30.790> raft<00:02:31.860> instructions<00:02:32.860> which<00:02:33.280> I've<00:02:33.760> heard

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
wrist raft instructions which I've heard

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.580 
wrist raft instructions which I've heard
that<00:02:34.300> these<00:02:34.420> are<00:02:34.540> from<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> 80s<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.380> this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that these are from the 80s but this

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.970 
that these are from the 80s but this
looks<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.450> font<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.350> way<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.650> actually

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
looks the the font the way it's actually

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.330 
looks the the font the way it's actually
printed<00:02:39.459> as<00:02:40.000> well<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.709> graphics<00:02:41.950> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
printed as well and the graphics and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.930 
printed as well and the graphics and
everything<00:02:42.610> much<00:02:43.030> much<00:02:43.420> different<00:02:43.720> than<00:02:44.940> then

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
everything much much different than then

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.949 
everything much much different than then
the<00:02:46.060> 80s<00:02:46.750> maybe<00:02:47.410> 70<00:02:48.070> s<00:02:48.660> talks<00:02:49.660> about<00:02:49.870> the

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
the 80s maybe 70 s talks about the

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.320 
the 80s maybe 70 s talks about the
flashlight<00:02:50.410> but<00:02:50.680> there's<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.610> there's<00:02:52.209> no

flashlight but there's a there's no
flash<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.840> comes<00:02:52.990> with<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:54.250> actually

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
flash that comes with it and it actually

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.840 
flash that comes with it and it actually
uses<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.090> flash<00:02:55.390> bulb<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.140> very<00:02:57.100> electronic

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
uses a flash bulb in a very electronic

uses a flash bulb in a very electronic
looking<00:02:58.120> flash<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:58.870> kind<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.140> see<00:02:59.290> it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
looking flash you can kind of see it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.900 
looking flash you can kind of see it
right<00:02:59.530> there<00:02:59.560> but<00:03:00.160> it's<00:03:00.310> distinctly<00:03:00.790> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
right there but it's distinctly a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.300 
right there but it's distinctly a
flashbulb<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.540> says<00:03:01.690> use<00:03:01.900> AG<00:03:02.410> one<00:03:02.590> flash<00:03:02.890> unit

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
flashbulb it says use AG one flash unit

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.030 
flashbulb it says use AG one flash unit
right<00:03:03.730> there<00:03:04.000> for<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.080> camera<00:03:05.410> itself<00:03:08.040> we

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
right there for the camera itself we

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.390 
right there for the camera itself we
open<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.430> up<00:03:09.550> it's<00:03:10.180> very<00:03:10.959> very<00:03:11.200> basic<00:03:11.590> it's

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
open it up it's very very basic it's

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.520 
open it up it's very very basic it's
actually<00:03:13.030> very<00:03:13.060> much<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.720> holga<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.320> lens

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
actually very much like a holga the lens

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.160 
actually very much like a holga the lens
cap<00:03:14.940> feels<00:03:15.940> exactly<00:03:16.269> like<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.570> holy<00:03:16.720> cap<00:03:16.989> the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
cap feels exactly like a holy cap the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.220 
cap feels exactly like a holy cap the
way<00:03:17.290> supplied<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:18.190> lens<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.730> f<00:03:19.180> eight<00:03:19.690> sixty

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230

way supplied the lens is a f eight sixty
millimeter<00:03:20.440> lens<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.519> shutter<00:03:22.170> one

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
millimeter lens on the shutter one

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.449 
millimeter lens on the shutter one
one-hundredth<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.739> second<00:03:24.130> but<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.340> can

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
one-hundredth of a second but you can

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.910 
one-hundredth of a second but you can
even<00:03:24.550> see<00:03:24.900> how<00:03:25.900> much<00:03:26.080> does<00:03:26.320> not<00:03:26.470> vary<00:03:26.680> hold

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
even see how much does not vary hold

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.070 
even see how much does not vary hold
alike<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.090> lot<00:03:28.239> freer<00:03:28.570> than<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.780> whole<00:03:28.959> day

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
alike it's a lot freer than a whole day

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.420 
alike it's a lot freer than a whole day
I'll<00:03:29.200> tell<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.470> much<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.100> it's<00:03:30.220> got<00:03:30.340> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
I'll tell you that much but it's got the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.240 
I'll tell you that much but it's got the
same<00:03:30.550> distance<00:03:30.940> scale<00:03:31.120> markings<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:31.660> there

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
same distance scale markings on there

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.500 
same distance scale markings on there
you've<00:03:33.250> got<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.550> two<00:03:33.760> aperture<00:03:34.209> settings

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
you've got the two aperture settings

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.820 
you've got the two aperture settings
which<00:03:34.660> I'm<00:03:34.780> sure<00:03:34.930> don't<00:03:35.140> do<00:03:35.260> anything<00:03:35.440> and

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
which I'm sure don't do anything and

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.470 
which I'm sure don't do anything and
then<00:03:36.340> you've<00:03:36.459> got<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.730> film<00:03:36.940> advance<00:03:37.239> which

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
then you've got the film advance which

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.640 
then you've got the film advance which
also<00:03:37.980> very<00:03:38.980> holga<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:40.320> however<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.440> rest<00:03:41.590> of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
also very holga like however the rest of

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.090 
also very holga like however the rest of
the<00:03:41.709> camera<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.840> actually<00:03:43.840> cheaper<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:44.920> even

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
the camera is actually cheaper and even

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.650 
the camera is actually cheaper and even
crappier<00:03:45.310> than<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.640> whole<00:03:45.760> graph<00:03:45.940> that's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
crappier than a whole graph that's

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.320 
crappier than a whole graph that's
possible<00:03:47.610> let's<00:03:48.610> see<00:03:48.730> how<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.880> back<00:03:49.090> comes

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
possible let's see how the back comes

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.259 
possible let's see how the back comes
out<00:03:49.450> here<00:03:49.630> ah<00:03:53.730> there's<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.790> latch<00:03:54.970> on<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
out here ah there's a latch on the

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.690 
out here ah there's a latch on the
bottom<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:55.900> just<00:03:56.049> flick<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.370> then

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
bottom so you just flick that and then

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.199 
bottom so you just flick that and then
it<00:03:57.820> slides<00:03:58.090> off<00:03:58.530> like<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.560> Diana<00:03:59.950> or<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:01.060> an

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
it slides off like a Diana or like an

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.870 
it slides off like a Diana or like an
old<00:04:01.420> Nikon<00:04:01.780> F<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:03.220> then<00:04:03.340> there's<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.610> shutter

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
old Nikon F and then there's the shutter

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.660 
old Nikon F and then there's the shutter
mechanism<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.540> there<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:05.530> can<00:04:05.680> see<00:04:06.810> which

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
mechanism in there you can see which

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.240 
mechanism in there you can see which
fires<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.940> works<00:04:10.290> comes<00:04:11.290> with<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.470> 120<00:04:11.950> school

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
fires it works comes with a 120 school

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.849 
fires it works comes with a 120 school
and<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:13.180> mean<00:04:13.600> it's<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:13.989> super<00:04:14.350> basic<00:04:14.530> it

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
and you mean it's it's super basic it

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.819 
and you mean it's it's super basic it
actually<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.310> six<00:04:15.639> by<00:04:15.880> four<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.329> half<00:04:16.359> only

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
actually is six by four and a half only

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.789 
actually is six by four and a half only
unlike<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.859> whole<00:04:18.100> go<00:04:18.190> which<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:18.489> six

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
unlike the whole go which is six

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.699 
unlike the whole go which is six
six<00:04:19.039> or<00:04:19.159> 615<00:04:19.489> or<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.389> original<00:04:21.079> Diana<00:04:21.530> which

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
six or 615 or the original Diana which

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.649 
six or 615 or the original Diana which
is<00:04:21.829> four<00:04:22.039> by<00:04:22.159> four<00:04:22.430> or<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.849> newer<00:04:23.120> Diana<00:04:23.539> which

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
is four by four or the newer Diana which

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.559 
is four by four or the newer Diana which
