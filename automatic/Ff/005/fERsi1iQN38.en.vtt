about I think when people see the name
cartoon<00:06:29.969> art<00:06:30.120> museum<00:06:30.449> they<00:06:30.569> first<00:06:30.810> think<00:06:31.050> kids

pretty evenly from your experience as a

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.890 
pretty evenly from your experience as a
director<00:06:50.400> of<00:06:50.430> a<00:06:50.580> cartoon<00:06:50.909> art<00:06:51.060> museum<00:06:51.449> how

director of a cartoon art museum how

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.929 
director of a cartoon art museum how
would<00:06:52.050> you<00:06:52.169> define<00:06:52.529> otaku<00:06:53.159> the

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:53.939 
would you define otaku the

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:55.429 
would you define otaku the
straightforward<00:06:54.240> definition<00:06:54.599> I've<00:06:55.050> heard<00:06:55.289> is

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:55.439 
straightforward definition I've heard is

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.899 
straightforward definition I've heard is
sort<00:06:55.620> of<00:06:55.680> just<00:06:55.860> a<00:06:55.949> geek<00:06:56.099> or<00:06:56.340> a<00:06:56.370> nerd<00:06:56.460> you<00:06:56.879> know

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:56.909 
sort of just a geek or a nerd you know

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.179 
sort of just a geek or a nerd you know
so<00:06:57.300> but<00:06:58.020> there's<00:06:58.229> also<00:06:58.379> a<00:06:58.560> sort<00:06:59.009> of<00:06:59.099> a

00:06:59.179 --> 00:06:59.189 
so but there's also a sort of a

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.490 
so but there's also a sort of a
derogatory<00:06:59.849> meaning<00:07:00.419> of<00:07:00.719> otaku<00:07:01.139> sort<00:07:01.349> of<00:07:01.409> a

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
derogatory meaning of otaku sort of a

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.279 
derogatory meaning of otaku sort of a
shut-in<00:07:01.800> and<00:07:02.189> so<00:07:02.879> you<00:07:03.569> know<00:07:03.689> I<00:07:03.719> think<00:07:03.960> the

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
shut-in and so you know I think the

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.559 
shut-in and so you know I think the
modernized<00:07:04.860> word<00:07:05.159> word<00:07:05.669> is<00:07:06.000> sort<00:07:06.240> of<00:07:06.300> more

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:06.569 
modernized word word is sort of more

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:08.420 
modernized word word is sort of more
towards<00:07:06.990> the<00:07:07.169> geek<00:07:07.349> and<00:07:07.529> the<00:07:07.620> nerd<00:07:07.800> and<00:07:07.830> less

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
towards the geek and the nerd and less

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.240 
towards the geek and the nerd and less
towards<00:07:08.789> the<00:07:09.240> shut-in<00:07:09.659> and<00:07:09.689> I<00:07:10.590> think<00:07:11.039> all<00:07:11.219> of

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
towards the shut-in and I think all of

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.249 
towards the shut-in and I think all of
us<00:07:11.430> have<00:07:11.699> a<00:07:11.729> little<00:07:12.060> bit<00:07:12.210> of<00:07:12.240> otaku<00:07:12.930> in<00:07:13.110> us

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
us have a little bit of otaku in us

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.950 
us have a little bit of otaku in us
basically<00:07:13.740> you<00:07:14.610> can't<00:07:14.909> help<00:07:15.150> it<00:07:15.330> some<00:07:15.659> of<00:07:15.810> them

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
basically you can't help it some of them

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.559 
basically you can't help it some of them
you<00:07:16.560> know<00:07:16.680> push<00:07:17.250> it<00:07:17.400> down<00:07:17.699> and<00:07:18.000> others<00:07:18.240> of<00:07:18.449> us
