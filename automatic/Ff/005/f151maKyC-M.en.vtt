were<00:00:10.139> very<00:00:10.740> clearly<00:00:11.040> scoped<00:00:11.520> to<00:00:11.610> fit<00:00:11.879> within

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
were very clearly scoped to fit within

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.429 
were very clearly scoped to fit within
the<00:00:12.629> release<00:00:13.139> cycle<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:15.020> having<00:00:16.020> fit<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.349> the

the release cycle the having fit in the
release<00:00:16.680> cycle<00:00:16.860> we're<00:00:17.189> able<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.520> make<00:00:17.610> sure

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:17.759 
release cycle we're able to make sure

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.300 
release cycle we're able to make sure
that<00:00:17.970> they're<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.990> work<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.890> things<00:00:20.099> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
that they're in and work the things that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.150 
that they're in and work the things that
didn't<00:00:21.000> quite<00:00:21.119> make<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.869> work<00:00:22.440> completely<00:00:22.859> cut

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
didn't quite make it work completely cut

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
didn't quite make it work completely cut
the<00:00:23.490> things<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.940> do<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> cut<00:00:24.869> early<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the things that do and cut early and the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
the things that do and cut early and the
things<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.100> did<00:00:26.220> make<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.850> their

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
things that did make it in get their

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810 
things that did make it in get their
time<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.750> tested<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.279> improved

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
time to be tested and and improved

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.089 
time to be tested and and improved
performance<00:00:30.510> improved<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.010> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
performance improved so a lot of the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.580 
performance improved so a lot of the
things<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.400> I'm<00:00:32.640> looking<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.110> kind<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
things that I'm looking at are kind of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
things that I'm looking at are kind of
multi<00:00:34.890> release<00:00:35.190> things<00:00:35.400> so<00:00:35.970> it's<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.330> matter<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
multi release things so it's a matter of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.069 
multi release things so it's a matter of
the<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.350> team<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.860> group<00:00:38.780> looking<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:39.930> these

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the the team or group looking at these

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.530 
the the team or group looking at these
roadmaps<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:41.040> input<00:00:41.370> from<00:00:41.520> me<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> saying

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
roadmaps with input from me and saying

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
roadmaps with input from me and saying
what<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> first<00:00:43.980> step<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.250> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
what can we do as a first step in this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.100 
what can we do as a first step in this
release<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.969> would<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.989> next

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
release what would we do the next

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.470 
release what would we do the next
release<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.610> aspect<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> security

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
release and so on the aspect of security

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.049 
release and so on the aspect of security
that<00:00:48.570> I'd<00:00:48.690> point<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> IT<00:00:49.770> pros<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that I'd point out to IT pros is that

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
that I'd point out to IT pros is that
there's<00:00:51.510> no<00:00:52.010> perfect<00:00:53.010> security<00:00:53.250> solution

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
there's no perfect security solution

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.940 
there's no perfect security solution
that<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.750> matter<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.289> degrees<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
that it's a matter of degrees it's a

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.069 
that it's a matter of degrees it's a
matter<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> risk<00:00:56.340> assessment<00:00:56.700> so<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.600> it's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
matter of risk assessment so it's it's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
matter of risk assessment so it's it's
never<00:00:58.320> am<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.610> truly<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.090> hundred

looking for this security Silver Bullet
it<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.950> doesn't<00:01:20.189> exist<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> ways

they are proactive security measures
obviously<00:01:56.790> when<00:01:56.970> seven<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.720> there's<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
obviously when seven is really there's a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
obviously when seven is really there's a
consumer<00:01:58.799> audience<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.640> there's<00:01:59.790> an<00:01:59.880> IT

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
consumer audience for it there's an IT

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
consumer audience for it there's an IT

pro audio for it enterprise audience for
it<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.090> we've<00:02:03.810> taken<00:02:04.110> inputs<00:02:04.740> from<00:02:04.829> both<00:02:05.040> of

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it so we've taken inputs from both of

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.880 
it so we've taken inputs from both of
those<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.880> becomes<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.890> prioritization

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
those and it becomes a prioritization

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.560 
those and it becomes a prioritization
where<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.880> neglect<00:02:09.149> either

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
where we don't want to neglect either

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.180 
where we don't want to neglect either
side<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.380> things<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.739> we've<00:02:10.829> got<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> limited

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
side of things and we've got a limited

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.720 
side of things and we've got a limited
amount<00:02:11.519> of<00:02:11.549> resources<00:02:11.640> Limina<00:02:12.480> at<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.630> time<00:02:12.870> so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
amount of resources Limina at a time so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.339 
amount of resources Limina at a time so
obviously<00:02:14.730> stuff<00:02:15.060> falls<00:02:15.599> off<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.110> we'd<00:02:16.230> like

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
obviously stuff falls off that we'd like

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.960 
obviously stuff falls off that we'd like
to<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:16.920> can't<00:02:17.220> get<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.520> but<00:02:17.819> we
