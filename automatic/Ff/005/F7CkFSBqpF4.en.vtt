00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 friends I have something for you and that 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.490
 Let's take a look at the LG Watch Wayne today 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.410
 at a special smart are not 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.179
 only looks extremely good but also with 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.299
 an interesting operating system comes 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.830
 with lte and nfc in this video want 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.390
 not only look at us in the design 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.070
 background you already see 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 some no chance also the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.650
 function at chance an vivo is or the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.390
 lg barrel platform is built and on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.420
 They also compare with the end 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.399
 lg watch a with android who runs and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.770
 yes there are very very distinctive and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.630
 big differences for example that we 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.190
 already three keys on the edge have that gives 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.469
 in android who have not yet 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.870
 but also the complete construction and the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.030
 function well, let's throw one more 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 short last look at that really 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
 well finished piece of engineering i had 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.030
 it was already on hand yesterday 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.440
 or on the wrist and me 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.360
 I think that's not good 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.030
 but it also feels good and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.699
 looks really good on the thing 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.329
 is processed top weighs a few 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.399
 gram 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.439
 but you get used to it very fast 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.000
 That's why I do not see it at all 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.270
 problem that gives the whole thing such a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.159
 certain value as well as this 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 housing here you see it is already there 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.490
 really very nice on the design 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 been worked 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.689
 and exactly these three points we 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.939
 right now so here they are 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.280
 direct press buttons have a good one 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.930
 pressure point and what you can do exactly that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 I'll show you here now, let's see 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.250
 first time then right that watch face 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 that's what the eu looks like and we'll go 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.630
 the three keys through we start completely 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.100
 just right in the middle 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.380
 sitting herewith we change then 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.299
 between menu and the normal view 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.460
 that means once again click 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.009
 click it out and that's it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.750
 the lg promotional platform is the web os 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.909
 based on how moving here in this 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.159
 circle there is another view 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.540
 quite simply with swiping around 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.420
 we want to be a little bit short 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.040
 just scroll through the menu here 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.719
 to show you how the built up 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.790
 system Here we see the name 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.270
 that there is the lte version there is urban 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.979
 Well and without a break well enough we click 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.530
 on the bottom button and come with it 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.479
 one step back completely legal 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.729
 where any 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.799
 menu , we are moving on 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.569
 Still look what many different apps 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.220
 we have already seen 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.709
 There is also a kind of golf coach here 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.730
 and when we click on apps above then 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.560
 we have the possibility the whole 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 not visible in this view circle 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 but also in a list there 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.890
 It certainly many which the mind have fun 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.140
 or those who like it better 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.720
 But I think this circle view is 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.370
 very nice and that's why I would 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.310
 but just say back 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.980
 and stay with her, so these are the ones 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.540
 apps that are currently here you can see 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.280
 again that we come back and back 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.870
 above the middle button and us 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 Just look into the apps 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.299
 purely 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.160
 it is the lte version that means we 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.329
 You can also call and over 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.890
 the upper button we see the 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.180
 main quick settings 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.609
 means we can mute the whole thing 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.629
 switch or loud wireless or bluetooth 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.280
 on and off 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.870
 we can enter the mobile data and 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.629
 Turn off to adjust the brightness 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.709
 and so on 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.079
 But let's see what 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.190
 it wants to have functions as said the 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.239
 Lte version that can of course 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.000
 to phone 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.079
 that's how small buttons we look at 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.130
 see the course even enough times 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.180
 bit i say you work shorter 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.799
 Note that here is still pre 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.880
 production so if that's all 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.829
 not so bad then running 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.660
 In any case, forgive that if it 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.910
 finalist then runs the definitely 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.190
 So yes, so the dialer looks 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.340
 enough for the first look we go 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.889
 time to messaging yes clicks today 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.180
 look at it young man looks very good 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.609
 that's from I see so here 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.299
 news who wrote when 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.230
 or what did I miss 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.819
 Let's take a step again 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.290
 back to the menu and look too 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.359
 music controls 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.970
 yes, we can also use this for the music 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.669
 We control 4GB of internal memory 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.560
 By the way, also a gigabyte ram and with it 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.780
 we can go out a little bit like that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.410
 hard we can of course also the pulse 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.269
 measure up 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.950
 below it is then installed again 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.799
 we put the good piece to the wrist 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.459
 A light shines and then it becomes 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.220
 hopefully very carefully tested 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.919
 Taken tested, counted as we did 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.859
 also always want to call the light 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.359
 So most of the time it was flashing for me 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.320
 it happens every now and then 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.730
 go out that 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.440
 probably means you can too 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.290
 just the whole day small 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.390
 stretch so looks the calendar of the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.310
 view is very very interesting 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.450
 like the 12 moderate I think even 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.490
 not so stupid because if you already have one 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.750
 should have round watches design then 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.250
 also be the menu around 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.050
 they thus really have everything 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.940
 done right that they are still like that 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.320
 the more maps this one gives i want it 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.390
 just briefly with you through 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.340
 feels were already pre-installed 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.080
 but there will of course still be in the future 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.940
 more will come there will also be an app 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.100
 give store for it makes you so 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.800
 I take it easy 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.090
 have me, even the lg watch a 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.680
 Just catch it 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.450
 from the design side 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.860
 also she is around she has 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.420
 but only a push button and 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.530
 Of course it comes in a completely different one 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.570
 design 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.220
 i have to say i found the usa 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.750
 always chic and chic is the 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.580
 moto2 six what many of you 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.920
 might look different but 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.440
 now that I had the upper hand, think 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.120
 yes, yes you can still do it 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.470
 make neat beautiful here we see 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.360
 even the backs you see her well 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.970
 that the heart rate of the knife 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.530
 heart rate monitor likes to bring us every now and then 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.130
 look at the bottom both 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.050
 of course come with microphones then 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.730
 also to work on language and the 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.560
 Bands are very different once 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.330
 leather and once this plastic and 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.830
 they also have different ones 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.040
 cut once this year already 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.720
 together clip base and on the other 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.180
 on the right side at the lga 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.310
 just these normal wristwatches 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.750
 Shut up, I say you can now 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.780
 of course change the size 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.160
 at the Lgt shards and that was it 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.540
 this video i hope you have now 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.290
 learned a lot and have a good one 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.290
 impression 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.290
 thank you for your time is good
