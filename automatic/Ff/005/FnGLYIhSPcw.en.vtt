so I'm doing this I'm doing two da
strokes<00:01:41.399> down<00:01:42.399> using<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.149> strings<00:01:43.479> with<00:01:43.630> this

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
strokes down using the strings with this

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.170 
strokes down using the strings with this
part<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.079> my<00:01:44.170> hand<00:01:44.409> so<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:48.490> just<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:48.939> down

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
part of my hand so then just one down

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.999 
part of my hand so then just one down
stroke<00:01:49.420> on<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.689> minor<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:51.009> then<00:01:51.759> you<00:01:51.939> tit

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
stroke on the a minor and then you tit

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.429 
stroke on the a minor and then you tit
then<00:01:54.009> down<00:01:54.399> up<00:01:54.880> down<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.750> up<00:01:56.079> down<00:01:57.030> down<00:01:58.439> down

up down on the D end up down down so one

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:20.280 
up down on the D end up down down so one
more<00:02:04.240> time

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.289 

and<00:02:21.129> it's<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> little<00:02:21.519> bit<00:02:21.640> faster<00:02:21.879> in<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
and it's a little bit faster in the

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:29.520 
and it's a little bit faster in the
original<00:02:22.480> version<00:02:27.930> when<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.049> feel<00:02:29.319> like<00:02:29.469> it

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:53.979 

okay<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.730> that's<00:02:41.120> for<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.300> whole<00:02:41.480> verse<00:02:41.750> like

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.309 

okay<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.700> bridge<00:03:00.420> which

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
okay and then we have the bridge which

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:35.809 
okay and then we have the bridge which
is<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:01.800> goes<00:03:02.700> like<00:03:02.849> this

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.929 

okay<00:03:36.689> and<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.439> also<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.489> you're<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> little
