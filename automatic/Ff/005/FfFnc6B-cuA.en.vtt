00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.530 

I've<00:02:18.650> had<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.069> change<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:19.700> head<00:02:20.000> out<00:02:20.150> from<00:02:20.450> a

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
I've had to change this head out from a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.320 
I've had to change this head out from a
plastic<00:02:21.080> head<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.530> all<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.520> solid<00:02:23.000> brass

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
plastic head to all the solid brass

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.500 
plastic head to all the solid brass

because the first one melted about 188
now

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.290 

this<00:02:41.860> was<00:02:42.040> probably<00:02:42.370> gonna<00:02:42.610> end<00:02:42.849> up<00:02:43.060> at<00:02:43.239> about

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
this was probably gonna end up at about

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.509 
this was probably gonna end up at about
190<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.500> we'll<00:02:44.620> hear<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.920> thing<00:02:45.099> sitting<00:02:45.370> two
