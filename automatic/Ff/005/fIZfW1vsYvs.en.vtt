00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.089
 josè compliments nice goal from the left 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 I must say that the corbelli were today 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.590
 many share and maybe the goal 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.410
 less beautiful a joke of course 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.540
 here, however, I saw a heart 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.369
 dedicated valieri i guess you know that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 on the way there was this one thing 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.760
 message yes days together forgive 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.769
 here, however, a nice goal is happy 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.800
 if it's a bit that only a little was missing 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 net after so much there is to say that yes 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.279
 cr made a bad google for one 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.590
 nice action thanks the comrades must 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.829
 thank him no then yes to valeria later 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.100
 four months later there was a beautiful one 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.950
 first leg but to return for 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.379
 luck I made goals and dedicated to her 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.660
 you have been nice to come back to the field and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 do so many minutes and still believe in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.379
 fifth place because today they arrived 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.690
 quite positive results at least 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.750
 defeat of the sampdoria is difficult 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.010
 we probably have some points 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.809
 left in the street in the last games 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.369
 but now the second game 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 consecutive in which we do not take 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 goal at least behind is found 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 solidity and today also ahead then with 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 great qualities of the individual are 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 managed to find it red there is the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 Mathematics still there so we 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.080
 we have to think about winning the two 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 gufare games and some other for by 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 arrive because in the end ours 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.750
 goal I think we have points 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.030
 left here his game in general a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.340
 beginning of cité unlocked with your goal 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.750
 quite well according to the first half 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.460
 then in the second it was better them 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.799
 paradoxically and expulsion of popes 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.329
 which in my opinion there was almost no given 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.869
 the charge because then you closed the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.150
 game 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.659
 after having risked even a little bit yes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.960
 yes at first we left immediately 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.690
 fast with malice forward to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.030
 end because what we always lacked 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.880
 then yes that the expulsion of popes has us 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.340
 given to say a hand, however, they are not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.430
 have been good companions to keep behind and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.590
 starting again in the decisive moments is now 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.720
 it is also a permanent part of the first 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.000
 team you will be tomorrow among the summoned with 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.810
 the with the bologna you also played a 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.440
 Rome at the Olympic Stadium 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.270
 the Olympic debut no bad no no 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.090
 honestly it was nice 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.310
 the debut then you don't realize it's there 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 so many people out but not even taken a 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.600
 yellow 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.070
 strange, however, that time is for you 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.390
 feel grown up since the last interview 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.860
 which we did more or less then 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 January after the debut with the Udine 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.140
 What are three months also had a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.980
 small injury 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.380
 however, you feel more like a player 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.950
 maybe now the first player does not 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.900
 I feel so I feel like someone who knows maybe 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.110
 I found more desire still because 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.380
 stay beyond so many things teach you 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.240
 so not only do I not feel 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.420
 players but I feel more I still want 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.450
 and I feel even more I don't feel like a 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 kid let's talk to them though 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.170
 better but there is an anecdote someone who 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.000
 before the game maybe he tells you 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.810
 something one of the old men who took you 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 a little below the arm-length ones 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.060
 all fortunately this is true that there is 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.840
 a beautiful dressing room there is a group 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.230
 fantastic 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.510
 everyone treats you like one more then you 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.640
 we tell ourselves group of gargano palettes 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.800
 skeleton those south american who us 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.440
 I'm always with them but with them 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.360
 others none of you do another than 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.920
 now the parma salt in the case you want 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.800
 make a special greeting this time 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.959
 I would like to greet someone else's case 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.940
 usual greeting that I always do 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.380
 that of my family that always 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.180
 always close to me valeria friends who 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.150
 it still fits me 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.250
 this brings good and then to all fossil 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.350
 parma that who come to see the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.700
 last matches of the Parma and there 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.700
 accompany or to the stadium
