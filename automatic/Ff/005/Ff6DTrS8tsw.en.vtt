00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.109
 even though he is friendly 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.940
 we have to represent the shirt well 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.130
 that you are wearing regardless of the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
 adversary of the situation that we are 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.599
 because we know that the spindle 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.090
 Do not make it very complicated. 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.250
 I 'm from an east European country that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 It's six hours difference from Brazil and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.380
 here are 12 then there are several athletes 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.210
 and what they are feeling because still 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 I am properly feeling myself 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.340
 I still think it's natural and even 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.980
 The moment of the game, there we go. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 able to train hard and adapt is 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.610
 So much the better that we try to do. 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.070
 when we arrive after a 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.559
 Training like this is that it is the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.110
 late we arrive rather tired at 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.300
 hotel and comes to sleep more 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.129
 we try to do something to that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.129
 do not sleep for us to get 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.360
 Sleeping is here at night so I guess it's 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.180
 This is what we have to do otherwise. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.010
 ends up sleeping when he arrives at the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.549
 hotel there can not sleep at night 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.229
 so we can not adapt the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.240
 korean timetables 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.860
 I'm very happy is a group like 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.400
 that I ended up finding in 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 of the selections favors this 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.670
 to the group because I'm feeling 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.200
 quite comfortable to talk to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.409
 put my style of play within 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.130
 field I think it could not be different 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.829
 is this confidence in trying to put 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.070
 a soccer to be able to show too 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.750
 for the teacher to show my 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.270
 value here also within the selection for 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.520
 I can not go out anymore because it's the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.780
 player's dream is to reach the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.799
 From the moment he arrives is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.060
 to continue is to have a continuity of 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.729
 opportunities within it then 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.460
 It's serious to God for the opportunity and 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.810
 continue working hard so that the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.149
 opportunities can continue 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.520
 appearing and I can show each time 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.520
 but it's my football inside the selection
