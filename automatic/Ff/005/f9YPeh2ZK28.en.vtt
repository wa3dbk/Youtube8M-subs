00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:15.330
 blasts of assassinations and cherry bishop extremes present the tractor is a 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.950
 upset that will serve us to walk comfortably through the mountains 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.400
 the left at the top a break 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.519
 remembering that we will allow gara 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.760
 play with the possession of this camera 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.439
 it is perfectly 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.189
 and unlike 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.470
 of the downs like those of peking 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.230
 at the bottom you can check 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.910
 that takes four legs legs the three-legged team 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.719
 who will allow 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.729
 position our these are in the form of triple comfortably 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.030
 apparently being approached 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.510
 we can close 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.170
 I will bet on the power is the camera 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.810
 and also comment 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.350
 that the system 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.320
 details 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.790
 it is a system that gives equal 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.710
 and although it seems that it does not have to be resistant 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.640
 it really is very comfortable 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.070
 and with a simple click we can do it to freeze our cameras I want 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.480
 a security lock 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.450
 in this camera that currently 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.080
 subjects simply hitting the kicks that opt ​​for another external part 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.560
 we close the legs with the theater 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.299
 and here we expose cane slackeing what the regular manager of 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 the goalkeeper height 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 what we wish we could not walk 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
 really the whole transition process 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.270
 all right 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 b 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 do not 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:24.819
 world
