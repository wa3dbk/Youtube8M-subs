00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello dear friends with you Nikita 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.519
 and now we will talk about the game which 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.519
 just with breathtaking speed 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.639
 gaining popularity I think you already they 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.640
 heard a game called bombsquad game 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.920
 purposefully created to play with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.170
 friends let's say by LAN 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.570
 or on the internet that in principle their 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 managed to do very nothing 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 firstly there is very beautiful graphics 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 very cool and depending on 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.870
 your deviceâ€™s power will be 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.969
 appear all sorts of effects from me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
 on the tablet weak video accelerator 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.010
 but still the game looks very much 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.379
 fun and high level optimization 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.890
 in the settings you can enable 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.039
 the number of fb fps it is displayed in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.039
 bottom left and as you see 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 FPS does not sag below 50 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.000
 this is a very good figure at all in the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.210
 settings you can do control on 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.189
 mobile device on a tablet or 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 Generally connect the gamepad and configure 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.580
 gamepad that is about it too 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.299
 developers are thinking and by the way 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.640
 developers is Eric free Mlyn Respect 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.549
 dude you just created an awesome player 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.189
 so the gamepad can be customized to play 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.009
 on the gamepad what makes this game still 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.280
 more comfortable comfortable and fun your 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.829
 the task is to survive in the arena 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.979
 you can jump ran rush 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.020
 all sorts of bombs raise and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.750
 dumps there from the arena or somewhere 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.180
 throw your rivals in reverse when 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.520
 this will constantly randomly fall 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.979
 boxes with certain bonuses which 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 bonuses that will either give you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.299
 certain kind of bombs that is there 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.960
 either freezing or sticky or 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.930
 instantly exploding and so on either 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.360
 all kinds of shields snares so on that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.969
 will help you fight and try 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.719
 win this arena 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.219
 a cooperative of two to eight people and 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.099
 the only thing that disappointed me is 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.660
 the fact that you can only go through a career 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.700
 to one 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.690
 Someone's business is cooperative 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.690
 mode there is a tournament all this is basically there 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.260
 yes it's fun but still to play 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.060
 ok in this game feel the whole fan 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.700
 feel all they wanted to invest in 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.520
 this game developers need to play with 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.860
 friends that, in principle, I do not know all the same 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.900
 You can say a minus because you can 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.880
 was add bots like with him 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.220
 to have fun with them somewhere out there 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.250
 on pairs and so on because they don't 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.560
 everywhere there is wi-fi especially in my 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.590
 the city is problematic to find somewhere 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.260
 other than your home or not any 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.570
 the phone can act as a point 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.240
 access for let's say there to friends 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.130
 connected and play this game and in 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.470
 the whole game was just awesome 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.590
 awesome voice awesome graphics 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.220
 very fun gameplay really 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.130
 very cool everything and me sometimes you 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.260
 there is no climbing advertisement for donat 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.850
 the only thing the developer decided 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.370
 cash in on advertising but it is quite 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.709
 excusably and quickly gets used to the game 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.470
 available for free in the market link in 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.459
 description under video and average rating in 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.050
 4,5 fully justified her personally 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.420
 5 stars she deserves to wait 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.330
 I think further updates will be 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.030
 something else interesting something else fun 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.130
 so I advise you to play with friends 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.400
 and just go through a career 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.270
 just a class can not pass by
