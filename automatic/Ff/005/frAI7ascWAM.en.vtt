00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.530 
way it's so interesting and animation
you<00:02:17.099> kind<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.610> your<00:02:17.760> part<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:18.420> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you kind of do your part and then you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.870 
you kind of do your part and then you
give<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.930> away<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.980> comes<00:02:20.250> back<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.730> you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
give it away and it comes back to you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.000 
give it away and it comes back to you
like<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.180> beautiful<00:02:21.720> present<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.739> when<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
like this beautiful present so when I

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.009 
like this beautiful present so when I
saw<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.489> first<00:02:23.640> time<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.849> couldn't<00:02:24.330> believe

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
saw it the first time I couldn't believe

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.830 
saw it the first time I couldn't believe
it<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.349> was<00:02:25.670> more<00:02:26.670> than<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:26.910> ever<00:02:27.060> imagined<00:02:27.629> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
it I was more than I ever imagined and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
it I was more than I ever imagined and
everyone<00:02:28.110> at<00:02:28.200> Pixar<00:02:28.500> kind<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.799> proved<00:02:29.160> my

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
everyone at Pixar kind of proved my

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.070 
everyone at Pixar kind of proved my
theory<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.790> talented<00:02:30.599> people<00:02:30.870> are<00:02:30.959> usually

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
theory that talented people are usually

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.479 
theory that talented people are usually
good<00:02:31.410> collaborators<00:02:32.010> because<00:02:32.160> they're<00:02:32.400> not

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
good collaborators because they're not

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.250 
good collaborators because they're not
fear-based<00:02:32.760> they're<00:02:33.150> not<00:02:33.299> afraid<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:34.080> is

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
fear-based they're not afraid of when is

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.660 
fear-based they're not afraid of when is
their<00:02:34.380> next<00:02:34.560> good<00:02:34.860> idea<00:02:35.160> then<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.430> come<00:02:35.549> from

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
their next good idea then it come from

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.030
