00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.730 
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
take<00:04:20.970> my<00:04:21.180> other<00:04:21.450> piece<00:04:21.930> of<00:04:22.910> tape<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.210> put<00:04:24.740> it

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
take my other piece of tape and put it

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.110 
take my other piece of tape and put it
over<00:04:26.600> top<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.630> there

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.290 

mushy<00:04:31.120> not<00:04:32.050> helping

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
mushy not helping

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.520 
mushy not helping
so<00:04:34.300> it's<00:04:34.660> gonna<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.110> again<00:04:35.410> I'm<00:04:35.620> pulling<00:04:36.450> down

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
so it's gonna and again I'm pulling down

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.860 
so it's gonna and again I'm pulling down
that<00:04:38.530> was<00:04:38.620> as<00:04:38.770> tight<00:04:39.190> as<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.700> possibly<00:04:40.240> can<00:04:40.570> and

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
that was as tight as I possibly can and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.020 
that was as tight as I possibly can and
then<00:04:41.650> what<00:04:41.920> I<00:04:41.950> do<00:04:42.100> is<00:04:42.610> I'd<00:04:42.970> run<00:04:43.330> one<00:04:43.780> more<00:04:45.030> strip

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
then what I do is I'd run one more strip

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.480 
then what I do is I'd run one more strip
of<00:04:46.180> tape<00:04:46.420> right<00:04:47.050> from<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.410> top<00:04:47.620> all<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:47.950> way

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
of tape right from the top all the way

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.530 
of tape right from the top all the way
around<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.270> back<00:04:49.330> up<00:04:49.870> over<00:04:50.320> top<00:04:51.270> here<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.510> I

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
around and back up over top here so I

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.900 
around and back up over top here so I
then<00:04:52.900> I<00:04:53.020> would<00:04:53.170> have<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:55.680> ideally<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:56.920> want

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
then I would have to and ideally I want

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.970 
then I would have to and ideally I want
this<00:04:58.390> down<00:04:59.020> as<00:04:59.850> tight<00:05:00.850> as<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.270> can<00:05:01.330> get<00:05:01.630> it

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
this down as tight as I can get it

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.620 
this down as tight as I can get it
without<00:05:02.980> as<00:05:03.610> long<00:05:03.850> as<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.030> dog<00:05:04.180> can<00:05:04.390> breathe

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
without as long as the dog can breathe

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.060 
without as long as the dog can breathe
you<00:05:04.660> should<00:05:04.960> have<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> finger<00:05:05.470> under<00:05:05.710> there

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
you should have a finger under there

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.110 
you should have a finger under there
nobody<00:05:06.490> has<00:05:06.910> passed<00:05:07.180> out<00:05:07.480> yet<00:05:07.780> here<00:05:08.880> yeah<00:05:09.880> and

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
nobody has passed out yet here yeah and

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.170 
nobody has passed out yet here yeah and
that's<00:05:10.450> basically<00:05:11.370> what<00:05:12.370> I<00:05:13.210> do<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.490> then<00:05:15.490> if<00:05:16.090> I

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
that's basically what I do and then if I

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.030 
that's basically what I do and then if I
have<00:05:16.330> a<00:05:16.360> really<00:05:16.720> bad<00:05:16.900> pocket<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:17.530> could<00:05:17.710> even

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
have a really bad pocket I could even

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.190 
have a really bad pocket I could even
stick<00:05:18.670> a<00:05:18.970> little<00:05:19.360> something<00:05:19.750> under<00:05:20.020> there

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
stick a little something under there

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.420 
stick a little something under there
like<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:22.200> piece<00:05:23.200> of<00:05:23.230> tampon<00:05:23.800> or<00:05:23.830> something<00:05:24.250> just

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
like a piece of tampon or something just

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.300 
like a piece of tampon or something just
to<00:05:24.760> rule<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.810> year<00:05:26.140> even<00:05:26.530> more<00:05:26.770> for<00:05:27.190> that

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
to rule that year even more for that

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.210 
to rule that year even more for that
pocket<00:05:27.790> but<00:05:28.450> you<00:05:29.020> should<00:05:29.260> be<00:05:29.410> okay<00:05:29.680> just<00:05:30.010> like

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
pocket but you should be okay just like

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.870 
pocket but you should be okay just like
this<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:32.530> should<00:05:33.280> have<00:05:33.400> said<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.700> before

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
dog in the beginning will scratch but

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.930 
dog in the beginning will scratch but

scratching and going crazy then you need

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
its chin so much because because I have

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.700 
its chin so much because because I have
that<00:06:48.910> chin<00:06:49.860> guarded<00:06:50.860> from<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:52.120> tape<00:06:52.380> so<00:06:53.380> but

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
that chin guarded from the tape so but

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.250 
that chin guarded from the tape so but
you<00:06:53.770> can<00:06:53.800> see<00:06:53.950> how<00:06:54.220> it's<00:06:54.370> pulling<00:06:54.580> down<00:06:55.260> and

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
you can see how it's pulling down and

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.220 
you can see how it's pulling down and

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
when I take the tape off his ears will

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.219 
when I take the tape off his ears will
be<00:06:59.980> down<00:07:00.280> and<00:07:00.850> then<00:07:01.060> they'll<00:07:01.210> gradually<00:07:01.900> work

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:02.229 
be down and then they'll gradually work

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:06.390 
be down and then they'll gradually work
their<00:07:02.440> way<00:07:02.560> up<00:07:02.940> and<00:07:04.139> hopefully<00:07:05.139> they<00:07:06.040> will<00:07:06.070> be

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
their way up and hopefully they will be

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.820 
their way up and hopefully they will be
