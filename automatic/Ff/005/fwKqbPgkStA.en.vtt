our<00:00:09.450> opponent<00:00:09.840> which<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.860> think<00:00:11.070> can<00:00:11.219> only<00:00:11.370> name

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
our opponent which I think can only name

either<00:00:12.179> tour<00:00:12.570> matzke<00:00:12.960> crypt<00:00:13.469> or<00:00:13.710> relic<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
not a dredge pilot myself so perhaps

not a dredge pilot myself so perhaps
Ravagers<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:26.550> troublesome<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.269> would

Ravagers more troublesome but would

appear to me that you could at least

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.030 
appear to me that you could at least
flashback<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.070> therapy<00:00:33.200> you<00:00:34.200> can't<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
flashback the therapy you can't do and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.729 
flashback the therapy you can't do and
hit<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.120> Ravager<00:00:36.570> before<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.899> could<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.680> a

keep<00:00:58.910> future<00:00:59.910> damp<00:01:00.090> into<00:01:00.719> careful<00:01:01.050> study<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
keep future damp into careful study and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.780 
keep future damp into careful study and
now<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.160> sure<00:01:02.730> we'll<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:05.040> plan<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.700> if

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
now I'm sure we'll see the plan but if

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.300 
now I'm sure we'll see the plan but if
the<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:06.540> putrid<00:01:07.140> imp<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.500> along<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the if you had putrid imp all along it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.640 
the if you had putrid imp all along it
seems<00:01:08.610> even<00:01:09.180> more<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> me<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> plan

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
seems even more so to me that the plan

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.050 
seems even more so to me that the plan
should<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.189> been<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.520> name<00:01:11.700> crypt<00:01:12.090> or<00:01:14.060> relic

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
should have been to name crypt or relic

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.570 
should have been to name crypt or relic

target the crypt with the garage and

target the crypt with the garage and
then<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.929> can<00:01:54.110> activate<00:01:56.350> at<00:01:57.350> times<00:01:57.679> I<00:01:57.920> get<00:01:57.979> a

little greedy early in my experience

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.169 
little greedy early in my experience
playing<00:02:02.420> against<00:02:02.750> reg<00:02:03.250> if<00:02:04.250> I'd<00:02:04.489> see<00:02:04.819> that<00:02:05.000> they

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
playing against reg if I'd see that they

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.529 
playing against reg if I'd see that they
clearly<00:02:05.630> didn't<00:02:05.989> have<00:02:06.340> or<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.880> appeared<00:02:08.329> that

clearly didn't have or it appeared that
it<00:02:08.929> was<00:02:09.019> very<00:02:09.289> clear<00:02:09.560> they<00:02:09.709> didn't<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.039> any

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
it was very clear they didn't have any

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.160 
it was very clear they didn't have any
further<00:02:10.940> dredge<00:02:11.360> cards<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.870> would<00:02:12.019> often

further dredge cards I would often

further dredge cards I would often
activate<00:02:12.769> my<00:02:12.890> crypt<00:02:13.720> early<00:02:14.890> but<00:02:15.890> that's<00:02:16.099> just

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
activate my crypt early but that's just

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.960 
activate my crypt early but that's just
too<00:02:17.269> greedy<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.870> said<00:02:18.519> there<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.760> he

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
too greedy as I said there it is he

with<00:02:48.639> glimpse<00:02:49.639> and<00:02:50.889> the<00:02:51.889> deck<00:02:52.959> sometimes<00:02:53.959> it

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
with glimpse and the deck sometimes it

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.550 
with glimpse and the deck sometimes it
is<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:54.790> amazing<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.450> it's<00:02:56.780> unreal<00:02:57.260> what<00:02:57.470> it

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
is just amazing and it's unreal what it

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.449 
is just amazing and it's unreal what it
does<00:02:57.970> but<00:02:58.970> very<00:02:59.239> often<00:02:59.450> it<00:03:00.049> just<00:03:00.530> kind<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.190> sits

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459

does but very often it just kind of sits
in<00:03:01.609> your<00:03:01.639> hand<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:03.010> it's<00:03:04.010> hard<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.609> do

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150

and<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.540> will<00:03:23.690> say<00:03:23.900> I'm<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.050> little<00:03:24.380> surprised<00:03:24.830> at

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and I will say I'm a little surprised at

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.990 
and I will say I'm a little surprised at
the<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.980> plan<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.520> attack<00:03:28.640> here<00:03:29.150> with<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.420> kid

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the the plan of attack here with the kid

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.790 
the the plan of attack here with the kid
perhaps<00:03:32.000> he's<00:03:32.270> just<00:03:32.960> hoping<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.650> hit<00:03:33.830> enough

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
perhaps he's just hoping to hit enough

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.740 
perhaps he's just hoping to hit enough
free<00:03:36.800> creatures<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.700> be<00:03:37.880> able<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.270> dread

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
total land count is but i was wondering

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.300 
total land count is but i was wondering
if<00:03:49.940> perhaps<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:51.020> only<00:03:51.140> out<00:03:51.470> he<00:03:51.770> would<00:03:51.920> have<00:03:52.130> in

if perhaps the only out he would have in

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.070 
if perhaps the only out he would have in
this<00:03:52.400> game<00:03:52.700> would<00:03:52.940> be<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.390> activate<00:03:54.050> that

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
this game would be to activate that

basically making it a thought cast and
attack<00:04:15.459> plating<00:04:16.459> is<00:04:16.640> clearly<00:04:17.000> lethal<00:04:17.510> here<00:04:17.720> if
