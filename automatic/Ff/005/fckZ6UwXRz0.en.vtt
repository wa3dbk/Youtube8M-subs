00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
as speaker wires are attached to the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.240 
as speaker wires are attached to the
actuator<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.410> order<00:02:24.680> for<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.920> alarm<00:02:25.160> to

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
so that's it the wires get run into the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.710 
so that's it the wires get run into the
vehicle<00:02:37.010> attached<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.820> alarm<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.360> the

vehicle attached to the alarm and the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.480 
vehicle attached to the alarm and the
process<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.290> duplicated<00:02:39.890> for<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.160> rest<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
process is duplicated for the rest of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:51.339 
process is duplicated for the rest of
the<00:02:40.580> three<00:02:40.730> doors

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.750 

what<00:02:52.349> would<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.650> more<00:02:52.800> awesome<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> rugged

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
what would be more awesome on a rugged

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.089 
what would be more awesome on a rugged
vehicle<00:02:54.000> than<00:02:54.510> heated<00:02:54.810> seats<00:02:55.110> let<00:02:55.800> me<00:02:55.920> show
