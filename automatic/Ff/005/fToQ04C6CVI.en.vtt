like<00:01:33.800> folding<00:01:34.340> that's<00:01:34.730> a<00:01:34.910> pretty<00:01:35.810> cool<00:01:36.080> thing

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
like folding that's a pretty cool thing

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:49.150 
like folding that's a pretty cool thing
got<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:45.880> some<00:01:46.880> molex<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.570> 6-pin<00:01:47.960> power<00:01:48.620> cables

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
got a some molex to 6-pin power cables

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:59.280 
got a some molex to 6-pin power cables
they<00:01:49.340> fit<00:01:50.240> your<00:01:50.420> car<00:01:50.600> supply<00:01:50.930> doesn't<00:01:51.260> have<00:01:51.410> it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:08.770 

the<00:02:00.290> cards<00:02:00.650> so<00:02:06.460> Center<00:02:07.460> fan<00:02:07.700> this<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.179> HD

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the cards so Center fan this is the HD

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.260 
the cards so Center fan this is the HD
model<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> difference<00:02:10.220> between<00:02:10.280> HD<00:02:10.970> and

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
model so the difference between HD and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.350 
model so the difference between HD and
the<00:02:11.480> non<00:02:11.840> HD<00:02:12.140> version<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.490> either<00:02:13.670> set<00:02:14.120> fan

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the non HD version is either set fan

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.240 
the non HD version is either set fan
here<00:02:14.630> or<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.050> center<00:02:15.320> fan<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:15.770> on<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> end

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
here or the center fan here on the end

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.610 
here or the center fan here on the end
which<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.240> turbine<00:02:17.810> they'll<00:02:18.110> blow<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
which is like a turbine they'll blow the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.380 
which is like a turbine they'll blow the
heat<00:02:18.800> out<00:02:19.130> towards<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> back<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.180> so

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
heat out towards the back and so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.640 
heat out towards the back and so
straight<00:02:20.810> down<00:02:22.330> another<00:02:23.330> difference<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.140> on

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
straight down another difference is on

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.760 
straight down another difference is on
the<00:02:24.710> back<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.460> these<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:26.150> full<00:02:26.660> hdmi<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
the back of these have full hdmi and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.229 
the back of these have full hdmi and
displayport<00:02:28.840> non<00:02:29.840> HD<00:02:30.200> version<00:02:30.890> has<00:02:31.100> mini<00:02:31.520> so

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
displayport non HD version has mini so

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.350 
displayport non HD version has mini so
you'll<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.690> use<00:02:32.720> an<00:02:32.989> adapter<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.940> one

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
you'll have to use an adapter that's one

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.780 
you'll have to use an adapter that's one
main<00:02:35.570> reason<00:02:35.780> why<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.110> got<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:37.160> for<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
main reason why I got this is for the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.940 
main reason why I got this is for the
full<00:02:37.970> size<00:02:38.209> DisplayPort<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:42.530> card<00:02:42.800> is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
full size DisplayPort on it this card is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.820 
full size DisplayPort on it this card is
also<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.250> little<00:02:43.489> bit<00:02:43.580> shorter<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:45.110> HD<00:02:45.470> version

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
also a little bit shorter the HD version

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.729 
also a little bit shorter the HD version
is<00:02:46.010> shorter<00:02:46.250> than<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.700> non<00:02:47.270> HD<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.320> if<00:02:48.500> you're

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
is shorter than the non HD so if you're

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.870 
is shorter than the non HD so if you're
curious<00:02:49.040> as<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.340> which<00:02:49.910> version<00:02:51.700> what<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
curious as to which version what the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.100 
curious as to which version what the
difference<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.510> that's<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:55.190> major<00:02:55.840> major<00:02:56.840> one

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
difference is that's the major major one

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.540 
difference is that's the major major one
so<00:02:57.320> pretty<00:02:57.560> much<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.830> exact<00:02:58.100> same<00:02:58.130> card

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
so pretty much the exact same card

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.540 
so pretty much the exact same card
though

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
though

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.300 
though
yeah<00:03:02.380> can't<00:03:03.380> wait<00:03:03.530> around<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:04.130> couple

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
yeah can't wait around a couple

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.730 
yeah can't wait around a couple
