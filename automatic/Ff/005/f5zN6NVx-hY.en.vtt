00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hi I'm Tony Northup and for my

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.740 
hi I'm Tony Northup and for my
photography<00:00:02.310> buying<00:00:02.939> guide<00:00:03.210> I'm<00:00:03.389> gonna<00:00:03.540> talk

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
photography buying guide I'm gonna talk

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.650 
photography buying guide I'm gonna talk
about<00:00:03.870> sensor<00:00:04.500> size<00:00:04.680> crop<00:00:05.430> factor<00:00:05.670> focal

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
about sensor size crop factor focal

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.620 
about sensor size crop factor focal
length<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.109> aperture<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:08.160> yes<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.389> need

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
length and aperture because yes you need

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.870 
length and aperture because yes you need
to<00:00:09.960> take<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.349> crop<00:00:10.679> factor<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.280> multiply<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
to take that crop factor and multiply it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.400 
to take that crop factor and multiply it
by<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.269> aperture<00:00:12.780> if<00:00:12.900> you're<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> be

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
by your aperture if you're going to be

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.810 
by your aperture if you're going to be
comparing<00:00:13.830> different<00:00:14.070> lenses<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.580> before

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
comparing different lenses and before

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.550 
comparing different lenses and before
you<00:00:14.910> get<00:00:15.030> mad<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.420> write<00:00:15.599> an<00:00:15.780> angry<00:00:15.960> comment

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
you get mad and write an angry comment

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.710 
you get mad and write an angry comment
hold<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.160> I'm<00:00:17.369> gonna<00:00:17.460> demonstrate<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.330> all<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
hold on I'm gonna demonstrate it all and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.120 
hold on I'm gonna demonstrate it all and
I<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:18.840> you'll<00:00:19.170> understand

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I think you'll understand

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700 
I think you'll understand
so<00:00:20.820> before<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> explain<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.900> I'll<00:00:22.080> demonstrate

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
so before I explain it I'll demonstrate

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.370 
so before I explain it I'll demonstrate
it<00:00:23.160> attached<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> camera<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it attached to the camera here I have a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.220 
it attached to the camera here I have a
zoom<00:00:25.830> lens<00:00:26.010> set<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.369> 100<00:00:26.880> millimeters<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
zoom lens set to 100 millimeters and a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.400 
zoom lens set to 100 millimeters and a
full-frame<00:00:28.920> camera<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.550> Canon<00:00:30.359> 5d<00:00:30.390> Mark<00:00:30.720> 2<00:00:31.080> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
full-frame camera a Canon 5d Mark 2 so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380 
full-frame camera a Canon 5d Mark 2 so
I'll<00:00:31.740> take<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> picture<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.730> my<00:00:32.850> lovely<00:00:33.210> bride

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
I'll take a picture of my lovely bride

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.140 
I'll take a picture of my lovely bride
here

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.520 

then<00:00:38.270> I'll<00:00:38.360> take<00:00:38.540> this<00:00:38.660> body<00:00:38.900> off<00:00:39.140> without

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
then I'll take this body off without

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.460 
then I'll take this body off without
adjusting<00:00:40.310> the<00:00:40.430> lens<00:00:40.640> at<00:00:40.790> all<00:00:40.910> now<00:00:41.600> I'll<00:00:41.960> put

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
adjusting the lens at all now I'll put

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.890 
adjusting the lens at all now I'll put
the<00:00:42.590> crop<00:00:42.770> body<00:00:43.010> on<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.880> a<00:00:43.910> canon<00:00:44.450> 7d

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
the crop body on this is a canon 7d

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.020 
the crop body on this is a canon 7d
which<00:00:45.380> is<00:00:45.500> an<00:00:45.590> aps-c<00:00:46.040> camera<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:46.850> has<00:00:47.000> a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
which is an aps-c camera so it has a

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.450 
which is an aps-c camera so it has a
slightly<00:00:47.420> smaller<00:00:47.870> sensor<00:00:48.410> now<00:00:49.190> I'll<00:00:49.310> take<00:00:49.400> a

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
slightly smaller sensor now I'll take a

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.380 
slightly smaller sensor now I'll take a
picture<00:00:49.670> with<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:49.970> camera

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.180 

so<00:00:53.990> you<00:00:54.050> can<00:00:54.170> already<00:00:54.350> see<00:00:54.560> without<00:00:54.680> making

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
so you can already see without making

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.100 
so you can already see without making
any<00:00:55.340> adjustments<00:00:55.970> 100<00:00:56.480> millimeter<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.020> it's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
any adjustments 100 millimeter so it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.660 
any adjustments 100 millimeter so it's
very<00:00:57.320> different<00:00:57.530> on<00:00:57.740> a<00:00:57.770> full-frame<00:00:58.280> camera

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
very different on a full-frame camera

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.090 
very different on a full-frame camera
than<00:00:58.790> it<00:00:58.880> does<00:00:59.030> on<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.240> canon<00:00:59.630> 7d<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.530> I'll<00:01:00.800> take

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
than it does on a canon 7d so I'll take

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.560 
than it does on a canon 7d so I'll take
this<00:01:01.310> camera<00:01:01.610> off<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.790> put<00:01:02.060> on<00:01:02.090> one<00:01:02.360> more

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
this camera off and put on one more

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.840 
this camera off and put on one more
camera<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.440> this<00:01:03.770> is<00:01:03.920> going<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.280> be<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.430> camera

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
camera and this is going to be a camera

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.690 
camera and this is going to be a camera
with<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.030> 2x<00:01:05.930> crop<00:01:06.260> factor<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.800> Micro<00:01:07.400> Four

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
with a 2x crop factor a Micro Four

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.850 
with a 2x crop factor a Micro Four
Thirds<00:01:07.730> camera<00:01:08.330> with<00:01:08.510> an<00:01:08.720> adapter<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:09.800> I'll

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
Thirds camera with an adapter so I'll

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.290 
Thirds camera with an adapter so I'll
put<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.250> here<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.640> again<00:01:10.790> we'll<00:01:11.090> use<00:01:11.120> the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
put it on here and again we'll use the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.160 
put it on here and again we'll use the
same<00:01:11.540> settings

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.469 

so<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.370> can<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> same<00:01:18.120> lens

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
so as you can see with the same lens

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.680 
so as you can see with the same lens
changing<00:01:19.320> bodies<00:01:19.680> change<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.610> angle<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> view

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
changing bodies change the angle of view

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.330 
changing bodies change the angle of view
basically<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.440> looks<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.830> used<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.190> more

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
basically it looks like I used a more

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.219 
basically it looks like I used a more
telephoto<00:01:23.850> lens<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.510> got<00:01:24.659> closer<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
telephoto lens or I got closer and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.290 
telephoto lens or I got closer and
closer<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.619> Chelsea<00:01:26.010> with<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> smaller<00:01:26.790> Center

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
closer to Chelsea with a smaller Center

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.050 
closer to Chelsea with a smaller Center
the<00:01:27.690> image<00:01:28.650> size<00:01:28.860> from<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.190> lens<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> same

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the image size from the lens is the same

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
the image size from the lens is the same
but<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.690> sensor<00:01:31.020> seeing<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.500> small<00:01:31.890> part<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
but the sensor seeing a small part of it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
but the sensor seeing a small part of it
and<00:01:32.610> thus<00:01:32.910> it's<00:01:33.210> cropping<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.619> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and thus it's cropping it and this is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590 
and thus it's cropping it and this is
what<00:01:34.800> we<00:01:34.890> call<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> crop<00:01:35.490> factor<00:01:35.729> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
what we call the crop factor so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
what we call the crop factor so
full-frame<00:01:37.050> cameras<00:01:37.650> don't<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> crop

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
full-frame cameras don't have a crop

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.260 
full-frame cameras don't have a crop
factor<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.759> don't<00:01:38.909> need<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> multiply

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
factor you don't need to multiply

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.290 
factor you don't need to multiply
anything<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.200> using<00:01:40.560> an<00:01:40.680> aps-c<00:01:41.130> canon<00:01:41.940> camera

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
anything if using an aps-c canon camera

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.899 
anything if using an aps-c canon camera
they<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> 1.6<00:01:43.590> x<00:01:43.920> crop<00:01:44.190> factor<00:01:44.400> therefore

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
they have a 1.6 x crop factor therefore

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
they have a 1.6 x crop factor therefore
this<00:01:45.360> 100<00:01:45.720> millimeter<00:01:46.080> lens<00:01:46.350> became<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
this 100 millimeter lens became a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.310 
this 100 millimeter lens became a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
hundred and sixty millimeter lens I were

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
hundred and sixty millimeter lens I were
to<00:01:49.410> put<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> nikon<00:01:50.070> aps-c<00:01:50.670> body<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.450> like

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to put a nikon aps-c body on there like

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.889 
to put a nikon aps-c body on there like
a<00:01:51.630> d<00:01:51.899> 3300<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.009> ad71<00:01:53.580> hundred<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:54.600> become

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
a d 3300 or ad71 hundred it would become

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.510 
a d 3300 or ad71 hundred it would become

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
a hundred and fifty millimeters because

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.880 
a hundred and fifty millimeters because
Nikon<00:01:57.060> bodies<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> 1.5<00:01:58.229> x<00:01:58.500> crop<00:01:58.740> factor

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
crop factor so when I put it on here

crop factor so when I put it on here
this<00:02:03.300> one<00:02:03.479> hundred<00:02:03.750> millimeter<00:02:04.110> lens<00:02:04.350> began

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
this one hundred millimeter lens began

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.800 
this one hundred millimeter lens began
to<00:02:04.740> act<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> two<00:02:05.940> hundred<00:02:06.270> millimeter

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
to act like a two hundred millimeter

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.690 
to act like a two hundred millimeter
lens<00:02:07.080> now<00:02:07.740> here's<00:02:08.039> where<00:02:08.250> things<00:02:08.310> get

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
lens now here's where things get

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.350 
lens now here's where things get
interesting<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.899> am<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.160> switch<00:02:11.670> back<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
interesting I am going to switch back to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.870 
interesting I am going to switch back to
the<00:02:12.750> full<00:02:13.200> frame<00:02:13.470> body<00:02:13.709> this<00:02:14.370> time<00:02:14.550> I'm<00:02:14.700> going

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the full frame body this time I'm going

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.320 
the full frame body this time I'm going
to<00:02:14.970> take<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.510> picture<00:02:15.959> at<00:02:16.280> 200<00:02:17.280> millimetres<00:02:17.820> so

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
to take a picture at 200 millimetres so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.050 
to take a picture at 200 millimetres so
in<00:02:18.840> theory<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.470> should<00:02:19.500> look<00:02:19.800> just<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
in theory it should look just like the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
in theory it should look just like the
last<00:02:21.299> picture<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.810> took<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.980> Micro

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
last picture that I took of the Micro

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.380 
last picture that I took of the Micro
Four<00:02:23.519> Thirds<00:02:23.549> sensor

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.380 

now<00:02:30.200> as<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:30.470> compared<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.250> full-frame<00:02:31.970> camera

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
now as we compared the full-frame camera

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.360 
now as we compared the full-frame camera
at<00:02:32.540> 200<00:02:33.050> millimeters<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.740> Micro<00:02:34.130> Four

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
at 200 millimeters to the Micro Four

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.940 
at 200 millimeters to the Micro Four
Thirds<00:02:34.400> camera<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.270> 100<00:02:35.840> millimetres<00:02:36.320> we<00:02:36.740> do

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
Thirds camera at 100 millimetres we do

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.070 
Thirds camera at 100 millimetres we do
see<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.520> cover<00:02:37.850> about<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.480> same<00:02:38.660> angle

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
see that they cover about the same angle

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.230 
see that they cover about the same angle
of<00:02:39.170> view<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.800> see<00:02:39.830> Chelsea's<00:02:40.640> head<00:02:41.030> and

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
of view you see Chelsea's head and

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.420 
of view you see Chelsea's head and
shoulders<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.870> about<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.860> same<00:02:43.010> amount<00:02:43.280> of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
shoulders and about the same amount of

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.010 
shoulders and about the same amount of
the<00:02:43.580> background<00:02:44.030> but<00:02:44.570> if<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.720> look<00:02:44.840> at<00:02:44.930> those

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
the background but if you look at those

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.410 
the background but if you look at those
two<00:02:45.080> pictures<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:46.160> background<00:02:46.700> doesn't<00:02:47.120> look

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
two pictures the background doesn't look

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.840 
two pictures the background doesn't look
the<00:02:47.840> same<00:02:47.870> at<00:02:48.290> all<00:02:48.440> does<00:02:48.740> it<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:49.250> see<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.460> lot

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
the same at all does it you see a lot

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.880 
the same at all does it you see a lot
more<00:02:49.880> background<00:02:50.510> blur<00:02:51.020> on<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.290> full-frame

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
more background blur on the full-frame

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.700 
more background blur on the full-frame
camera<00:02:52.400> that's<00:02:52.760> because<00:02:53.150> when<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.080> apply<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
camera that's because when you apply the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.640 
camera that's because when you apply the
crop<00:02:55.310> factor<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:56.060> go<00:02:56.540> from<00:02:56.780> 100<00:02:57.200> millimetres

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
crop factor to go from 100 millimetres

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.949 
crop factor to go from 100 millimetres
to<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.920> full-frame<00:02:58.910> 200<00:02:59.570> millimeter

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
to a full-frame 200 millimeter

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.470 
to a full-frame 200 millimeter
equivalent<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:01.280> also<00:03:01.520> have<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.030> multiply<00:03:02.150> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
equivalent you also have to multiply the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.380 
equivalent you also have to multiply the
aperture<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.650> that's<00:03:03.830> what<00:03:04.100> 200<00:03:04.940> millimetres

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
aperture so that's what 200 millimetres

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.300 
aperture so that's what 200 millimetres
at<00:03:05.570> f28<00:03:06.050> looks<00:03:06.260> like<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> full<00:03:06.830> frame<00:03:06.980> body

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
at f28 looks like on a full frame body

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.550 
at f28 looks like on a full frame body
and<00:03:07.610> as<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.030> can<00:03:08.150> see<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.959> background<00:03:09.440> is

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
and as you can see the background is

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.460 
and as you can see the background is
blurred<00:03:09.830> much<00:03:10.340> much<00:03:10.580> more<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.180> also<00:03:11.420> had<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.290> lot

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
blurred much much more I also had a lot

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.650 
blurred much much more I also had a lot
better<00:03:12.500> image<00:03:13.160> quality<00:03:13.190> because<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:14.360> camera

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
better image quality because the camera

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.030 
better image quality because the camera
settings<00:03:14.959> don't<00:03:15.140> change<00:03:15.380> your<00:03:15.680> shutter<00:03:15.950> speed

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
settings don't change your shutter speed

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.640 
settings don't change your shutter speed
your<00:03:16.670> ISO<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.300> your<00:03:17.570> f-stop<00:03:17.720> number<00:03:17.959> will<00:03:18.530> all

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
your ISO and your f-stop number will all

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.090 
your ISO and your f-stop number will all
be<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.950> same<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.630> smaller<00:03:21.110> sensor<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.890> an

be the same but the smaller sensor of an
aps-c<00:03:22.459> camera<00:03:23.120> or<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.390> micro<00:03:23.959> 4/3<00:03:24.470> sensor<00:03:24.950> will

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
aps-c camera or a micro 4/3 sensor will

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.220 
aps-c camera or a micro 4/3 sensor will
introduce<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.910> lot<00:03:26.030> more<00:03:26.239> noise<00:03:26.540> because

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
introduce a lot more noise because

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.380 
introduce a lot more noise because
they're<00:03:27.380> gathering<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:27.980> less<00:03:28.310> total<00:03:28.850> amount<00:03:29.270> of

getting<00:03:37.010> much<00:03:37.370> less<00:03:37.640> light<00:03:38.030> because<00:03:38.600> there's

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
getting much less light because there's

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.470 
getting much less light because there's
simply<00:03:39.110> less<00:03:39.230> sensor<00:03:39.860> size<00:03:40.070> we<00:03:40.640> can<00:03:40.910> adjust

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
simply less sensor size we can adjust

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.750 
simply less sensor size we can adjust
for<00:03:41.840> both<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.410> those<00:03:42.530> things<00:03:42.890> if<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.370> remember

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
for both of those things if we remember

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.580 
for both of those things if we remember
to<00:03:43.910> multiply<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.360> crop<00:03:44.750> factor<00:03:44.989> by<00:03:45.530> the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
to multiply the crop factor by the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.150 
to multiply the crop factor by the
aperture<00:03:46.330> now<00:03:47.330> that<00:03:47.840> micro<00:03:48.140> 4/3<00:03:48.560> sensor<00:03:48.980> had<00:03:49.130> a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
aperture now that micro 4/3 sensor had a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.449 
aperture now that micro 4/3 sensor had a
crop<00:03:49.400> factor<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:49.820> 2<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.720> I'm<00:03:51.170> at<00:03:51.500> f28<00:03:52.070> now<00:03:52.220> I'll

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
crop factor of 2 so I'm at f28 now I'll

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.040 
crop factor of 2 so I'm at f28 now I'll
up<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.299> f5<00:03:53.989> 6

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.470 

increasing<00:03:59.800> my<00:03:59.920> f-stop<00:04:00.340> number<00:04:00.370> from<00:04:00.820> f28<00:04:01.330> to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
increasing my f-stop number from f28 to

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.310 
increasing my f-stop number from f28 to
f56

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
f56

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.470 
f56
gave<00:04:02.860> me<00:04:03.070> basically<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.820> same<00:04:04.030> amount<00:04:04.330> of

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
gave me basically the same amount of

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.140 
gave me basically the same amount of
background<00:04:05.050> blur<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.500> same<00:04:05.680> okay<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.850> that's

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
background blur the same okay so that's

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.390 
background blur the same okay so that's
why<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:07.480> multiply<00:04:07.960> the<00:04:08.020> aperture<00:04:08.620> times<00:04:09.040> the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
why you multiply the aperture times the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.040 
why you multiply the aperture times the
crop<00:04:09.610> factor<00:04:09.820> because<00:04:10.240> it<00:04:10.360> allows<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:10.810> to

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
crop factor because it allows you to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.110 
crop factor because it allows you to
compare<00:04:11.800> lenses<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.670> amount<00:04:12.940> of

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
compare lenses and the amount of

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.730 
compare lenses and the amount of
background<00:04:13.630> blur<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.260> you'll<00:04:14.410> be<00:04:14.500> able<00:04:14.590> to

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
background blur that you'll be able to

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.289 
background blur that you'll be able to
get<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> really<00:04:15.880> important

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
get this is a really important

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.490 
get this is a really important
consideration<00:04:16.420> if<00:04:17.140> you're<00:04:17.260> shopping

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
consideration if you're shopping

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.020 
consideration if you're shopping
different<00:04:17.980> camera<00:04:18.280> systems<00:04:18.610> or<00:04:18.790> different

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
lenses for example in the micro

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.860 
lenses for example in the micro
four-thirds<00:04:21.459> world<00:04:21.730> a<00:04:22.000> lot<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.450> people<00:04:22.660> think

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
four-thirds world a lot of people think

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.200 
four-thirds world a lot of people think
that<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.230> 45<00:04:23.890> millimeter<00:04:24.370> f-18<00:04:24.730> lens

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
that that 45 millimeter f-18 lens

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.410 
that that 45 millimeter f-18 lens
provides<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.230> same<00:04:26.560> image<00:04:27.220> quality<00:04:27.460> as<00:04:27.850> the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
provides the same image quality as the

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.260 
provides the same image quality as the
full-frame<00:04:29.170> 85<00:04:29.860> millimeter<00:04:30.310> f-18<00:04:30.580> lenses

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
full-frame 85 millimeter f-18 lenses

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.150 
full-frame 85 millimeter f-18 lenses
because<00:04:31.600> they<00:04:31.690> have<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.840> 2x<00:04:32.050> crop<00:04:32.440> factor<00:04:32.860> so

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
because they have a 2x crop factor so

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.400 
because they have a 2x crop factor so
they<00:04:33.280> multiply<00:04:33.640> two<00:04:33.700> times<00:04:34.150> 45<00:04:34.930> millimeters

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
they multiply two times 45 millimeters

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.080 
they multiply two times 45 millimeters
and<00:04:35.650> they<00:04:35.830> think<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.190> lens<00:04:36.370> becomes<00:04:36.550> 90

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
and they think the lens becomes 90

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.080 
and they think the lens becomes 90
millimeters<00:04:37.720> f-18<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:39.040> doesn't<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.700> becomes<00:04:40.000> a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
millimeters f-18 it doesn't it becomes a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.380 
millimeters f-18 it doesn't it becomes a

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
90 millimeter F 3 6 lens so you're not

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.090 
90 millimeter F 3 6 lens so you're not
going<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.600> get<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.930> same<00:04:44.140> background<00:04:44.680> blur<00:04:44.890> as

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
going to get the same background blur as

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.780 
going to get the same background blur as
you<00:04:46.030> would<00:04:46.330> with<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.930> full-frame<00:04:47.530> camera<00:04:48.070> but

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
you would with a full-frame camera but

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.970 
you would with a full-frame camera but
if<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.270> do<00:04:49.540> remember<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:50.080> multiply<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.590> you'll

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
if you do remember to multiply it you'll

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.780 
if you do remember to multiply it you'll
have<00:04:51.400> much<00:04:52.120> better<00:04:52.620> comparisons<00:04:53.620> for<00:04:54.310> example

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
have much better comparisons for example

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.180 
have much better comparisons for example
you<00:04:55.120> can<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.720> fuji<00:04:56.080> world<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.650> can<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:56.950> a

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
you can in the fuji world you can get a

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.450 
you can in the fuji world you can get a
56<00:04:57.880> millimeter<00:04:58.330> F<00:04:58.660> 1/2<00:04:59.350> lens<00:04:59.800> that<00:05:00.130> seems<00:05:00.370> like

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
56 millimeter F 1/2 lens that seems like

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.340 
56 millimeter F 1/2 lens that seems like
a<00:05:00.490> very<00:05:00.580> fast<00:05:01.090> lens<00:05:01.390> but<00:05:01.750> when<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:01.960> multiply

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
a very fast lens but when you multiply

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.310 
a very fast lens but when you multiply
that<00:05:02.530> 1.5<00:05:03.430> X<00:05:03.760> crop<00:05:04.060> factor<00:05:04.419> to<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:05.110> becomes

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
that 1.5 X crop factor to it it becomes

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.890 
that 1.5 X crop factor to it it becomes
about<00:05:05.800> an<00:05:06.100> 85<00:05:06.580> millimeter<00:05:07.210> f-18<00:05:07.480> lens

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
about an 85 millimeter f-18 lens

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.900 
about an 85 millimeter f-18 lens
therefore<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:08.980> have<00:05:09.010> a<00:05:09.190> full-frame

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
therefore if you have a full-frame

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.360 
therefore if you have a full-frame
cannon<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.960> 85<00:05:11.410> millimeter<00:05:11.830> f-18<00:05:12.040> lens

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.540 
millimeter f12 lens you can shoot
side-by-side<00:05:19.750> and<00:05:20.050> you'll<00:05:20.530> have<00:05:20.800> similar

that's<00:05:34.000> not<00:05:34.240> really<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.320> case<00:05:35.500> at<00:05:35.740> least<00:05:35.770> it's

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
that's not really the case at least it's

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.110 
that's not really the case at least it's
not<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.550> simple

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
not that simple

not that simple
if<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.390> were<00:05:37.510> to<00:05:37.630> shoot<00:05:37.780> them<00:05:37.990> with<00:05:38.230> exactly

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
if you were to shoot them with exactly

the<00:05:39.040> same<00:05:39.220> settings<00:05:39.730> in<00:05:40.030> most<00:05:40.480> cases<00:05:40.690> the

of<00:05:43.390> image<00:05:43.660> quality<00:05:43.810> because<00:05:44.320> each<00:05:44.530> pixel<00:05:44.980> is

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070

gathering less light and that just

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.240
