sure something you guys can find use for
whatever<00:00:14.099> you're<00:00:14.340> drawing<00:00:14.549> or<00:00:14.759> if<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.880> want

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
whatever you're drawing or if you want

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.220 
whatever you're drawing or if you want
to<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.210> create<00:00:15.630> something<00:00:15.990> out<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
to just create something out of the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.480 
to just create something out of the
imagination<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.949> really<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.460> how

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
imagination it's really up to you how

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.519 
imagination it's really up to you how
you<00:00:17.670> want<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> use<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:19.050> basically<00:00:21.439> I'm<00:00:22.439> just

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you want to use it so basically I'm just

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.290 
you want to use it so basically I'm just
going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.830> show<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> would<00:00:23.880> create<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
going to show you how I would create a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.540 
going to show you how I would create a
like<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> plaid<00:00:24.960> pattern<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.519> course

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
like a plaid pattern and then of course

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.250 
like a plaid pattern and then of course
you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> many<00:00:27.359> variations<00:00:27.720> too<00:00:28.109> it's

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you can have many variations too it's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.839 
you can have many variations too it's
really<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.010> then<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
really up to you and then I'm going to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.460 
really up to you and then I'm going to
show<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.060> how<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> would<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.929> know<00:00:31.050> combine

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
show you how I would you know combine

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.490 
show you how I would you know combine
that<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.120> with<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.300> basic<00:00:33.660> forms<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.260> draw

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that in with like basic forms to draw

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
that in with like basic forms to draw
like<00:00:34.710> different<00:00:35.010> patterns<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.730> okay

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
like different patterns and so on okay

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.100 
like different patterns and so on okay
so<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.800> simple<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:39.059> plaid<00:00:39.600> pattern<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so really simple this plaid pattern is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
so really simple this plaid pattern is
really<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> make<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.370> consist

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
really I'm just going to make it consist

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:56.590 
really I'm just going to make it consist
of<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.710> say<00:00:43.710> 3<00:00:47.120> C<00:00:48.120> 3<00:00:48.149> bands<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.870> values<00:00:49.200> here

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.799 

you

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.990 

all<00:00:59.410> right<00:00:59.590> it's<00:00:59.800> pretty<00:00:59.829> simple<00:01:00.309> so<00:01:00.730> where

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
all right it's pretty simple so where

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.509 
all right it's pretty simple so where
they<00:01:01.180> overlap<00:01:01.559> where<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.680> two<00:01:02.860> bands<00:01:03.070> overlap

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
they overlap where the two bands overlap

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.340 
they overlap where the two bands overlap
that's<00:01:03.670> where<00:01:03.910> I'm<00:01:04.000> going<00:01:04.119> to<00:01:04.180> make<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:05.110> have

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
that's where I'm going to make that have

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:16.330 
that's where I'm going to make that have
a<00:01:05.379> like<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> dark<00:01:06.159> square<00:01:06.690> it's<00:01:07.690> like<00:01:07.840> that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.819 

all<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:17.909> basically<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.829> it's

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
all right so that's basically it it's

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.350 
all right so that's basically it it's
going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.039> be<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.280> our<00:01:20.399> little<00:01:20.460> plaid

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
going to be like our little plaid

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
going to be like our little plaid
whatever<00:01:22.159> but<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.219> course<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:23.579> we<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
whatever but of course what we going to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.630 
whatever but of course what we going to
do<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.570> we're<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> apply<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
do now is when we're going to apply the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310 
do now is when we're going to apply the
basic<00:01:26.820> forms<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
basic forms to it so this is just a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.840 
basic forms to it so this is just a
basic<00:01:28.619> pattern<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.399> we're<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> show

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
basic pattern now we're going to show

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.169 
basic pattern now we're going to show
how<00:01:30.060> we'll<00:01:30.270> look<00:01:31.579> around<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.030> it's

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
how we'll look around like if it's

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.240 
how we'll look around like if it's
actually<00:01:33.539> fabric<00:01:33.929> okay<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.740> won't<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.979> flat

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
actually fabric okay which won't be flat

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.620 
actually fabric okay which won't be flat
like<00:01:35.399> this<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> sketch

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like this so I'm just going to sketch

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
like this so I'm just going to sketch
right<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:38.329> cylinder<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> most<00:01:40.770> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
right here a cylinder because I most of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
right here a cylinder because I most of
the<00:01:41.009> forms<00:01:41.429> and<00:01:41.610> folds<00:01:41.969> in<00:01:42.060> some<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.390> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the forms and folds in some one of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.929 
the forms and folds in some one of
fabric<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.909> be

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
fabric you know I think can be

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
fabric you know I think can be
conceptualized<00:01:45.689> through<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.920> cylinder<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.369> we

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
conceptualized through a cylinder so we

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.830 
conceptualized through a cylinder so we
can<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> sewn<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.569> this<00:01:48.720> is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
can think of a sewn you know this is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.510 
can think of a sewn you know this is
just<00:01:48.959> a<00:01:49.020> basic<00:01:49.170> cylinder<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.039> can<00:01:50.220> also<00:01:50.369> think

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just a basic cylinder we can also think

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.820 
just a basic cylinder we can also think
of<00:01:50.819> a<00:01:50.939> cylindrical<00:01:51.179> form<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.709> this

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
of a cylindrical form you know in this

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.499 
of a cylindrical form you know in this
sense<00:01:53.099> like<00:01:53.429> say<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.640> example<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.090> sliced<00:01:54.360> it

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
sense like say for example we sliced it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.490 
sense like say for example we sliced it
in<00:01:54.599> half<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.640> looks<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.819> that<00:01:57.030> okay<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
in half so it looks like that okay or it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.940 
in half so it looks like that okay or it
can<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:01.079> other<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.439> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
can be you know the the other way it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.550 
can be you know the the other way it
could<00:02:02.069> be<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.399> that

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
could be like that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.870 
could be like that
see<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:07.860> course<00:02:08.099> from<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.549> we<00:02:08.789> can

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
see and of course from this we can

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.910 
see and of course from this we can
create<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.209> whole<00:02:09.569> variation<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.410> different

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
create a whole variation of different

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.309 
create a whole variation of different
folds<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.760> whatnot<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.450> right<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.019> let's

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
folds and whatnot all right so let's

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.589 
folds and whatnot all right so let's
over<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.099> I'm<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.489> combine<00:02:15.090> this

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
over here I'm just going to combine this

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.490 
over here I'm just going to combine this
basic<00:02:16.500> fabric<00:02:16.940> plaid<00:02:17.940> design<00:02:18.120> two<00:02:18.840> little

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
basic fabric plaid design two little

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
basic fabric plaid design two little
basic<00:02:19.829> shapes<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.250> kind<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.489> like<00:02:20.639> sketch<00:02:20.910> out

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
basic shapes to kind of like sketch out

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.330 
basic shapes to kind of like sketch out
some<00:02:22.310> folds<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.459> could<00:02:23.760> create<00:02:24.120> right<00:02:24.660> so

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
some folds that we could create right so

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:35.460 
some folds that we could create right so
let's<00:02:26.340> let's<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:26.819> up<00:02:26.850> something

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.650 

you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.750 

so<00:02:38.200> now<00:02:38.350> we<00:02:38.410> have<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.220> kind<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
so now we have this you know kind of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.630 
so now we have this you know kind of
like<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:39.970> fabric<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:41.110> form<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.460> have

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
like a fabric like form and all you have

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.600 
like a fabric like form and all you have
to<00:02:42.670> do<00:02:42.910> now<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.750> sketch<00:02:44.380> in<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:45.160> basic

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
to do now is just sketch in this basic

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.250 
to do now is just sketch in this basic
pattern<00:02:45.790> over<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:46.930> we're<00:02:47.080> paying

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
pattern over it so we're paying

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.080 
pattern over it so we're paying
attention<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> folds<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:48.580> on<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.000> for

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
attention to the folds and so on so for

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.430 
attention to the folds and so on so for
example<00:02:49.480> let's<00:02:49.930> say<00:02:49.990> we're<00:02:50.140> going<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.320> have

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
example let's say we're going to have

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.220 
example let's say we're going to have
two<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.490> these<00:02:51.910> bands<00:02:52.270> going<00:02:52.630> across<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:53.110> will

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
two of these bands going across it will

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:18.070 
two of these bands going across it will
be<00:02:53.350> something<00:02:53.710> like<00:02:53.830> this

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:29.320 

you

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:46.130 

you

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.070 

and<00:03:46.680> that's<00:03:47.190> basically<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.060> notice<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:48.930> I

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
and that's basically it so notice that I

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.960 
and that's basically it so notice that I
put<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.650> lot<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.920> shadows<00:03:50.250> on<00:03:50.370> there<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:50.670> you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
put a lot of shadows on there like you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.940 
put a lot of shadows on there like you
know<00:03:51.120> areas<00:03:51.570> that<00:03:51.660> are<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.290> underside

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
know areas that are like the underside

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.240 
know areas that are like the underside
I<00:03:52.980> put<00:03:53.670> shadows<00:03:54.210> in<00:03:54.360> these<00:03:54.510> areas<00:03:55.010> because<00:03:56.010> I'm

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
I put shadows in these areas because I'm

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.770 
I put shadows in these areas because I'm
you<00:03:56.400> know<00:03:56.490> it's<00:03:56.640> assuming<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.330> light<00:03:57.540> can

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
you know it's assuming the light can

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.400 
you know it's assuming the light can
catch<00:03:58.020> back<00:03:58.230> there<00:03:59.510> so<00:04:00.510> if<00:04:00.870> light<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.110> unable

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
catch back there so if light is unable

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.170 
catch back there so if light is unable
to<00:04:01.560> reach<00:04:02.160> these<00:04:02.370> areas<00:04:02.730> you're<00:04:02.880> going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.060> be

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
to reach these areas you're going to be

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.840 
to reach these areas you're going to be
in<00:04:03.330> shadow<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.810> then<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.700> little

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
in shadow and then in the little

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.610 
in shadow and then in the little
crevices<00:04:06.390> like<00:04:06.420> areas<00:04:06.900> where<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.140> falls<00:04:07.350> under

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
crevices like areas where it falls under

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.820 
crevices like areas where it falls under
like<00:04:07.950> under<00:04:08.160> here<00:04:08.400> I'd<00:04:08.580> make<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.030> little<00:04:09.330> bit

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
like under here I'd make it a little bit

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.550 
like under here I'd make it a little bit
darker<00:04:10.830> than<00:04:11.930> areas<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:13.110> here

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
darker than areas like here

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.039 
darker than areas like here
see<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.610> that's<00:04:14.820> that's<00:04:15.090> basically<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.900> know

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
see and that's that's basically you know

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.170 
see and that's that's basically you know
I<00:04:16.290> think<00:04:16.530> that's<00:04:16.709> pretty<00:04:16.920> cool<00:04:17.220> effects<00:04:18.030> you

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
I think that's pretty cool effects you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.970 
I think that's pretty cool effects you
can<00:04:18.299> apply<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.690> if<00:04:19.049> you're<00:04:19.169> drawing<00:04:19.410> like<00:04:19.739> um

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
can apply this if you're drawing like um

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.720 
can apply this if you're drawing like um
you<00:04:20.850> know<00:04:21.230> actual<00:04:22.230> fabric<00:04:22.740> or<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.610> know

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
you know actual fabric or you know

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.280 
you know actual fabric or you know
clothing<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.480> a<00:04:24.540> character<00:04:24.840> or<00:04:25.050> anything

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
clothing for a character or anything

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.320 
clothing for a character or anything
like<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.919> of<00:04:26.490> course<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.760> can<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.210> know

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
like that and of course you can you know

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.760 
like that and of course you can you know
you<00:04:27.570> can<00:04:29.300> use<00:04:30.300> your<00:04:30.330> imagination<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:31.440> find

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
you can use your imagination and find

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.170 
you can use your imagination and find
ways<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.040> even<00:04:32.580> make<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.790> even<00:04:33.000> more

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
ways to even make this even more

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.260 
ways to even make this even more
interesting<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:34.820> know<00:04:35.820> I'm<00:04:36.000> just<00:04:36.150> playing

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
interesting you know I'm just playing

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.420 
interesting you know I'm just playing
around<00:04:36.600> with<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.900> here<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.800> that's<00:04:38.100> at<00:04:38.250> least

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
around with it here so that's at least

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.470 
around with it here so that's at least
you<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.700> it's<00:04:38.910> just<00:04:39.060> something<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.360> can

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
you know it's just something you can

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.800 
you know it's just something you can
practice<00:04:39.740> another<00:04:40.740> thing<00:04:40.980> you<00:04:41.130> can<00:04:41.600> learn<00:04:42.600> how

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
practice another thing you can learn how

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.050 
practice another thing you can learn how
to<00:04:42.840> do
