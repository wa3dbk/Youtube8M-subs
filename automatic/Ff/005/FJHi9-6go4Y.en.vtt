through we'll go through what they are

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.220 
through we'll go through what they are
in<00:00:43.449> just<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.719> minute

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
in just a minute

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.330 
in just a minute
we<00:00:44.739> got<00:00:44.920> your<00:00:45.070> battery<00:00:45.430> pack<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:50.350> what<00:00:51.129> this

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
we got your battery pack which what this

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.270 
we got your battery pack which what this
is<00:00:51.520> is<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.850> equivalent<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.510> 418<00:00:53.260> 650<00:00:53.980> s<00:00:56.280> 4400

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
is is the equivalent of 418 650 s 4400

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.000 
is is the equivalent of 418 650 s 4400
milliamps<00:00:57.910> is<00:00:58.090> its<00:00:58.390> capacity<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:59.320> it's<00:00:59.920> a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
milliamps is its capacity and it's a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.229 
milliamps is its capacity and it's a
pretty<00:01:00.250> neat<00:01:00.430> thing<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.840> just<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:04.210> just

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
pretty neat thing you just you just

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.050 
pretty neat thing you just you just
swipe<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.530> it's<00:01:06.130> got<00:01:06.340> your<00:01:06.460> battery<00:01:06.670> meter

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
swipe it and it's got your battery meter

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.679 
swipe it and it's got your battery meter
right<00:01:07.360> there<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.140> can<00:01:08.409> see<00:01:08.590> what<00:01:08.770> your

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
right there so you can see what your

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.539 
right there so you can see what your
what<00:01:10.689> your<00:01:10.810> capacity<00:01:11.439> is<00:01:11.470> left<00:01:11.860> in<00:01:12.040> it<00:01:12.159> at<00:01:12.340> any

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
what your capacity is left in it at any

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.330 
what your capacity is left in it at any
given<00:01:12.820> time<00:01:13.090> your<00:01:13.390> voltage<00:01:13.900> so<00:01:14.799> that's<00:01:15.100> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
given time your voltage so that's the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.440 
given time your voltage so that's the
that's<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:16.180> battery<00:01:16.390> pack<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.970> comes<00:01:19.240> with<00:01:19.420> a

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
that's the battery pack it comes with a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.120 
that's the battery pack it comes with a
charger<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:20.110> wall<00:01:20.409> charger

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
charger a wall charger

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.020 
charger a wall charger
I<00:01:21.159> believe<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:23.400> charges<00:01:24.400> in<00:01:24.579> about<00:01:24.790> three

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
I believe this charges in about three

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.730 
I believe this charges in about three
and<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.180> half<00:01:25.360> hours<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.840> full<00:01:26.020> capacity<00:01:26.710> and

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
and a half hours to full capacity and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.560 
and a half hours to full capacity and
then<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.159> have<00:01:27.340> your<00:01:27.520> o-rings<00:01:27.970> which<00:01:28.270> are

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
then you have your o-rings which are

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.710 
then you have your o-rings which are
what<00:01:29.170> attaches<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.100> your<00:01:30.579> it's<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.479> quick

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
what attaches it to your it's a quick

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.980 
what attaches it to your it's a quick
attached<00:01:32.229> quick<00:01:32.590> detach<00:01:33.009> system<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.790> your

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
attached quick detach system to your

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.010

let<00:01:39.520> me<00:01:39.610> get<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.880> battery<00:01:40.270> pack<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
let me get the battery pack and the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.870 
let me get the battery pack and the
light<00:01:41.860> out<00:01:42.100> here<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:43.149> way<00:01:43.299> this<00:01:43.479> is<00:01:43.689> set<00:01:43.899> up<00:01:43.960> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
light out here the way this is set up is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.940 
light out here the way this is set up is
it's<00:01:45.880> really<00:01:46.180> neat<00:01:46.509> easy<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.079> use<00:01:47.200> system<00:01:47.500> I

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
it's really neat easy to use system I

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.179 
it's really neat easy to use system I
mean<00:01:48.780> can't<00:01:49.780> get<00:01:49.899> any<00:01:50.110> easier<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.590> plug<00:01:51.070> it

mean can't get any easier you plug it

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.609 
mean can't get any easier you plug it
into<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.520> battery<00:01:51.909> then<00:01:52.540> what<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.869> has<00:01:53.259> on<00:01:53.469> the

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
into the battery then what it has on the

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.880 
into the battery then what it has on the
back<00:01:53.770> here<00:01:54.219> is<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.689> will<00:01:56.110> give<00:01:56.469> you<00:01:56.619> four

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
see how much battery got left your green

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.870 
see how much battery got left your green
when<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.180> shows<00:02:04.390> green<00:02:04.750> it's<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.079> hundred<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.500> 70

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
when it shows green it's a hundred to 70
