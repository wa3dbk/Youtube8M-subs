couldn't see anything that stuck out
I've<00:00:30.750> checked<00:00:30.929> through<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.529> options<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I've checked through all the options and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.520 
I've checked through all the options and
to<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> basically<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.290> look<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
going to talk through the quick updates

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.299 
going to talk through the quick updates
for<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:42.739> basically<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> quick<00:00:44.040> synopsis

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
for you so basically a quick synopsis

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.299 
for you so basically a quick synopsis
that<00:00:44.850> basically<00:00:45.090> said<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.530> 8.6<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:46.800> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that basically said that 8.6 is out with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.260 
that basically said that 8.6 is out with
many<00:00:47.640> fixes<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.530> they've<00:00:49.680> done<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.000> big<00:00:51.000> piece

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
many fixes and they've done a big piece

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
many fixes and they've done a big piece
to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> optimization<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> dedicated<00:00:52.980> servers

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to the optimization to dedicated servers

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
to the optimization to dedicated servers
which<00:00:54.329> improves<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> performance<00:00:55.280> but<00:00:56.280> it's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
which improves the performance but it's

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
which improves the performance but it's
still<00:00:56.550> recommend<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.750> set<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> maximum

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
still recommend that you set the maximum

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.279 
still recommend that you set the maximum
players<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.949> eight<00:00:59.780> but<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> lot<00:01:01.109> better

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
players to eight but it's a lot better

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.310 
players to eight but it's a lot better
than<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.590> was<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.930> more<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.229> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
than it was and more to come on this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.460 
than it was and more to come on this
soon<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.970> basically<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
soon and so basically and what the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.300 
soon and so basically and what the
duntov<00:01:07.799> added<00:01:08.450> rare-book<00:01:09.590> loot<00:01:10.590> list<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.189> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
duntov added rare-book loot list for I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.380 
duntov added rare-book loot list for I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the changes that made they've improved

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.490 
the changes that made they've improved
performance<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.119> dedicated<00:01:24.509> servers<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
performance with dedicated servers and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
performance with dedicated servers and
eight<00:01:26.340> players<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.880> still<00:01:27.060> recommended

I have licked and they'll also change

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.490 
I have licked and they'll also change
their<00:02:09.800> mind<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.009> tweak<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.369> loopt<00:02:11.500> tonight

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
their mind a tweak to loopt tonight

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.010 
their mind a tweak to loopt tonight
stunned<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.580> I'm<00:02:13.730> guessing<00:02:13.940> they<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.450> play

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.720 
stunned so I'm guessing they just play
around<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.320> little<00:02:15.380> bit<00:02:15.620> some<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.520> bugs

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
around a little bit some of the bugs

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.960 
around a little bit some of the bugs
that<00:02:16.880> are<00:02:16.970> fixed<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.760> fixed<00:02:19.760> taking<00:02:20.150> damage

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that are fixed and fixed taking damage

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.610 
that are fixed and fixed taking damage
closeout<00:02:22.970> loop<00:02:23.210> containers<00:02:23.780> taking<00:02:24.440> down

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
closeout loop containers taking down

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.860 
closeout loop containers taking down
which<00:02:24.770> would<00:02:24.890> close<00:02:25.190> out<00:02:25.520> loot<00:02:26.270> containers

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
which would close out loot containers

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.330 
which would close out loot containers
even<00:02:27.230> damage<00:02:27.590> was<00:02:28.360> self<00:02:29.950> ok<00:02:30.950> i'm<00:02:31.070> not<00:02:31.190> sure

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
even damage was self ok i'm not sure

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.470 
even damage was self ok i'm not sure
that<00:02:31.370> means<00:02:31.840> maybe<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:33.050> your<00:02:33.110> taking<00:02:33.710> damage

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that means maybe on your taking damage

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.820 
that means maybe on your taking damage
it<00:02:35.480> did<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:35.780> much<00:02:35.870> little<00:02:36.170> loot<00:02:36.320> containers

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
it did so much little loot containers

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.949 
it did so much little loot containers
even<00:02:37.459> if<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.640> were<00:02:37.760> thirsty<00:02:37.940> or<00:02:38.150> hungry<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
even if you were thirsty or hungry the

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.860 
even if you were thirsty or hungry the
fix<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.910> another<00:02:40.910> fix<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.360> when<00:02:41.600> loop

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
fix that and another fix is when loop

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.690 
fix that and another fix is when loop
would<00:02:42.110> spawn<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.740> containers<00:02:43.280> would<00:02:43.459> stay

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
would spawn the containers would stay

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.720 
would spawn the containers would stay
empty<00:02:44.320> even<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.440> had<00:02:45.530> items<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.220> are<00:02:46.490> okay

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
empty even it had items and are okay

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.150 
empty even it had items and are okay
right<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:46.970> i<00:02:47.420> think<00:02:47.680> when<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.770> look<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:49.040> the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
right so i think when you look to the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.460 
right so i think when you look to the
sewing<00:02:49.340> them<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:50.450> know<00:02:50.570> we<00:02:50.720> spawn<00:02:50.990> luton

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
sewing them you know we spawn luton

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.350 
sewing them you know we spawn luton
after<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> set<00:02:52.400> period<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.700> days<00:02:52.850> i<00:02:53.090> think<00:02:53.120> that

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
after a set period of days i think that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.180 
after a set period of days i think that
now<00:02:53.630> fixes<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.440> they<00:02:54.560> actual<00:02:54.830> contain

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
now fixes it so they actual contain

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.860 
now fixes it so they actual contain
tells<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.910> has<00:02:56.000> luton<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.570> because<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
tells you it has luton it because the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.110 
tells you it has luton it because the
moment<00:02:57.260> has<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> cavity<00:02:58.400> point<00:02:58.820> out<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.060> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
moment has a cavity point out of the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.360 
moment has a cavity point out of the
week<00:02:59.240> actually<00:02:59.420> one<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.690> my<00:02:59.750> co<00:03:00.020> op<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:01.130> place

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
week actually one of my co op in place

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.160 
week actually one of my co op in place
that<00:03:02.060> they<00:03:02.209> contain<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.600> also<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.930> was<00:03:03.020> empty

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
that they contain is also it was empty

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.800 
that they contain is also it was empty
you've<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.590> how<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.770> luton<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.540> we

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
you've know how to luton it and we

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.000 
you've know how to luton it and we
basically<00:03:06.050> just<00:03:06.290> still<00:03:06.590> check-in<00:03:06.830> them

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
basically just still check-in them

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.560 
basically just still check-in them
anyway<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.489> so<00:03:07.880> now<00:03:08.000> they<00:03:08.090> look<00:03:08.150> slightly<00:03:08.330> fix

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
anyway and so now they look slightly fix

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.009 
anyway and so now they look slightly fix
that<00:03:08.720> on<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.870> label<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.260> changed<00:03:10.959> fixed<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
that on the label and changed fixed a

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.310 
that on the label and changed fixed a
zombies<00:03:12.380> do<00:03:12.560> not<00:03:12.709> attack<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.320> planted

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
zombies do not attack and planted

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.470 
zombies do not attack and planted
saplings<00:03:15.709> okay<00:03:16.580> somebody<00:03:17.000> with<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.150> fucking

crops<00:03:17.810> now<00:03:18.739> if<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.920> don't<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:20.739> fix<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.890> air

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
crops now if you don't and fix the air

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.430 
crops now if you don't and fix the air
drops<00:03:22.250> weren't<00:03:23.209> shown<00:03:23.390> power<00:03:23.570> tubes<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.230> as<00:03:24.410> a

drops weren't shown power tubes so as a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.710 
drops weren't shown power tubes so as a
boxer's<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.010> fallen<00:03:25.250> out<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.430> sky<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:25.880> fix

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
boxer's of fallen out the sky and fix

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.190 
boxer's of fallen out the sky and fix
that<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:28.120> plays<00:03:29.120> bouncing<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.750> random

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
that and plays bouncing on random

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.110 
that and plays bouncing on random
locations<00:03:30.830> or<00:03:31.010> being<00:03:31.220> teleported<00:03:31.670> through

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
locations or being teleported through

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.789 
locations or being teleported through
the<00:03:32.299> ground<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.810> surface<00:03:33.049> so<00:03:33.500> I've<00:03:33.590> seen

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
the ground to the surface so I've seen

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.350 
the ground to the surface so I've seen
both<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.010> those<00:03:34.220> again<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.790> looks<00:03:34.820> my<00:03:35.120> court

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
both of those again it looks my court

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.780 
both of those again it looks my court
because<00:03:35.630> he<00:03:35.810> was<00:03:35.900> being<00:03:36.049> teleported<00:03:36.560> head<00:03:37.489> to

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
because he was being teleported head to

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.340 
because he was being teleported head to
the<00:03:37.880> surface<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.840> middle<00:03:39.049> of<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.170> night

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
the surface and the middle of the night

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.530 
the surface and the middle of the night
which<00:03:39.560> share<00:03:39.860> create<00:03:40.310> some<00:03:40.430> issues<00:03:40.700> well<00:03:41.450> it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
which share create some issues well it

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.170 
which share create some issues well it
was<00:03:41.660> quite<00:03:41.900> funny<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:43.100> also<00:03:43.489> were<00:03:43.790> bouncing

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
was quite funny and also were bouncing

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.670 
was quite funny and also were bouncing
around<00:03:44.239> or<00:03:44.450> some<00:03:44.570> grey<00:03:44.780> patches<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.200> concrete

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
around or some grey patches of concrete

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.780 
around or some grey patches of concrete
and<00:03:46.040> that's<00:03:46.760> been<00:03:46.910> fixed<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:49.220> can't<00:03:49.459> go<00:03:49.610> up

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
and that's been fixed and it can't go up

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.880 
and that's been fixed and it can't go up
a<00:03:49.820> ramp<00:03:50.330> into<00:03:50.690> doorways<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.680> looks<00:03:51.709> like

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
a ramp into doorways so it looks like

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.199 
a ramp into doorways so it looks like
you<00:03:52.040> couldn't<00:03:52.220> run<00:03:52.400> up<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.820> fix<00:03:53.030> that

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
you couldn't run up it to the fix that

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.229 
you couldn't run up it to the fix that
basically<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.720> ramp<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:55.430> fix<00:03:55.670> collision<00:03:56.120> on

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
basically up a ramp the fix collision on

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.420 
basically up a ramp the fix collision on
dead<00:03:56.480> shrubs<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:57.590> blocks<00:03:57.860> can<00:03:58.040> be<00:03:58.100> placed

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
dead shrubs so blocks can be placed

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.740 
dead shrubs so blocks can be placed
adjacent<00:03:58.820> to<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.390> okay<00:03:59.959> fair<00:04:00.260> enough<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:02.390> fix

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
adjacent to it okay fair enough the fix

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.570 
adjacent to it okay fair enough the fix
the<00:04:02.930> solid<00:04:03.320> wood<00:04:03.500> ramp<00:04:03.769> frames<00:04:04.100> can<00:04:04.549> be

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
the solid wood ramp frames can be

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.259 
the solid wood ramp frames can be
upgraded<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:06.640> so<00:04:07.640> that<00:04:07.790> was<00:04:07.850> obviously<00:04:08.000> an

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
upgraded and so that was obviously an
