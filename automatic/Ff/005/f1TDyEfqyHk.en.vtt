real quick how to make a snare trap and
how<00:00:10.469> effective<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.820> we'll<00:00:12.000> start<00:00:12.240> out

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
how effective it is so we'll start out

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.369 
how effective it is so we'll start out
with<00:00:12.450> how<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> pick<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> spot<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.380> lay<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> trap

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
with how I pick the spot to lay the trap

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.150 
with how I pick the spot to lay the trap
if<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.470> look<00:00:16.619> down<00:00:16.740> here<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.070> ground

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
if you look down here on the ground

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
if you look down here on the ground
you'll<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.810> nice<00:00:19.050> clearing<00:00:19.410> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
you'll see this this nice clearing that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.590 
you'll see this this nice clearing that
runs<00:00:19.830> across<00:00:20.100> through<00:00:20.580> their<00:00:20.730> kind<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.420> curves

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
runs across through their kind of curves

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.120 
runs across through their kind of curves
off<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> left<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:22.590> maybe<00:00:22.920> 10

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
off to the left it's about maybe 10

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.910 
off to the left it's about maybe 10
inches<00:00:23.400> wide<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> foot<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.359> places<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
inches wide a foot in some places but it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.290 
inches wide a foot in some places but it
was<00:00:26.010> cleared<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.849> weren't<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> lot<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
was cleared out there weren't a lot of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.730 
was cleared out there weren't a lot of
green<00:00:27.570> leaves<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> stuff<00:00:28.230> there<00:00:28.500> were<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> few

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
green leaves and stuff there were a few

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.160 
green leaves and stuff there were a few
broken<00:00:28.980> twigs<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.670> when<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> got<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> scraping

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
broken twigs and when I got the scraping

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
broken twigs and when I got the scraping
around<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> leaves<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.070> found<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.759> rabbit

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
around in the leaves I found some rabbit

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
around in the leaves I found some rabbit
droppings<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.350> kind<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.680> knew<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
droppings so I kind of knew this is a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
droppings so I kind of knew this is a
steady<00:00:35.550> route<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> they<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> take

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
steady route that they like to take

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.000 
steady route that they like to take
people<00:00:37.050> econo<00:00:37.290> through<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:37.680> don't<00:00:37.860> know<00:00:37.920> if

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
people econo through they don't know if

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
people econo through they don't know if
you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:39.239> goes<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.870> pretty

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you can see it but it goes on for pretty

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
you can see it but it goes on for pretty
good<00:00:40.170> ways<00:00:40.350> right<00:00:40.770> down<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> other<00:00:41.160> side<00:00:41.250> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
good ways right down the other side of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.660 
good ways right down the other side of
the<00:00:41.520> small<00:00:41.790> hill<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:44.180> got<00:00:45.180> down<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:46.670> before

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the small hill so I got down here before

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.080 
the small hill so I got down here before
I<00:00:47.730> made<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.559> made<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> couple<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.010> my<00:00:50.160> my

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I made this made a couple of my my

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
I made this made a couple of my my
scenario<00:00:51.360> triggers<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
scenario triggers here if you see that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.529 
scenario triggers here if you see that
got<00:00:54.300> got<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> couple<00:00:55.020> notches<00:00:55.260> cut<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
got got a couple notches cut in it and

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.540 
got got a couple notches cut in it and
those<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.890> catch<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.399> like

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
those like the little catch just like

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.060 
those like the little catch just like
that<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> smallest<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.620> smallest

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that but just the smallest the smallest

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.850 
that but just the smallest the smallest
movement<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.850> noose<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.510> we'll

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
movement of this noose right here we'll

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
movement of this noose right here we'll
we'll<00:01:04.860> set<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.189> off<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
we'll set that off so how this

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
we'll set that off so how this
essentially<00:01:07.710> works<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> look<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
essentially works is if you look up to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.609 
essentially works is if you look up to
where<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.090> got<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.360> string<00:01:09.659> tied<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> its<00:01:10.260> tied

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
where I got this string tied to its tied

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
where I got this string tied to its tied
to<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> piece<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.939> Kane<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.510> here

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to a piece of this is Kane right here

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.140 
to a piece of this is Kane right here
been<00:01:13.619> over<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> pressure<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
been over got a lot of pressure on it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.200 
been over got a lot of pressure on it
hold<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> trigger<00:01:16.439> set<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.909> you'll<00:01:18.060> see

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
hold the trigger set and then you'll see

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.929 
hold the trigger set and then you'll see
I<00:01:18.240> drove<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> stake<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.020> either<00:01:19.170> side<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
I drove a stake on either side of the of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.899 
I drove a stake on either side of the of
the<00:01:21.360> noose<00:01:21.979> just<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> give<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.549> just

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the noose just to kind of give them just

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.510 
the noose just to kind of give them just
a<00:01:23.970> guaranteed<00:01:24.479> route<00:01:24.810> maybe<00:01:25.590> increase<00:01:26.250> my

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
a guaranteed route maybe increase my

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
a guaranteed route maybe increase my
chances<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:27.030> don't<00:01:27.540> disturb<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
chances here don't disturb the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.910 
chances here don't disturb the
environment<00:01:29.400> too<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:29.810> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
environment too much so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.320 
environment too much so
let's<00:01:32.430> put<00:01:32.580> this<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.850> stick<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.299> here

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
let's put this little stick right here

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.960 
let's put this little stick right here
to<00:01:33.570> help<00:01:33.720> hold<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> new<00:01:34.229> sub<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.460> get

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
to help hold that new sub kind of get

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730 
to help hold that new sub kind of get
his<00:01:36.060> head<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.570> bit<00:01:36.720> better<00:01:36.869> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
his head in there a little bit better so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
his head in there a little bit better so
essentially<00:01:38.340> how<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> works<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.119> you'll<00:01:39.960> see

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
essentially how this works is you'll see

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.539 
essentially how this works is you'll see
a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.649> little<00:01:41.040> rabbit<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.399> come

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
a little little rabbit will come

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.240 
a little little rabbit will come
trotting<00:01:42.270> along<00:01:42.450> he'll<00:01:43.170> put<00:01:43.830> his<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.070> head

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
trotting along he'll put his little head

the loop as big as possible if it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.270 
the loop as big as possible if it
doesn't<00:02:30.900> stays<00:02:31.200> paracord<00:02:31.680> stays<00:02:31.920> pretty<00:02:32.069> well

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
doesn't stays paracord stays pretty well
