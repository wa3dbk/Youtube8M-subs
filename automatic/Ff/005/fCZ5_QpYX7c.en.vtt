going to add the rest of our wet
ingredients<00:00:12.139> that<00:00:13.139> includes<00:00:13.530> 1<00:00:13.889> cup<00:00:14.130> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
ingredients that includes 1 cup of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.870 
ingredients that includes 1 cup of
molasses<00:00:15.890> we're<00:00:16.890> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:18.109> pour<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.880> really

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
molasses we're going to pour that really

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.400 
molasses we're going to pour that really
thick<00:00:21.660> stuff<00:00:23.029> wow<00:00:24.029> that's<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:25.080> pick

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
thick stuff wow that's just really pick

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.359 
thick stuff wow that's just really pick
coming<00:00:25.590> out<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.830> jar<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:28.070> guess<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
coming out of that jar I guess this is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.790 
coming out of that jar I guess this is
what<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.519> mean<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:30.090> say<00:00:30.420> when<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> says

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
what they mean by would say when it says

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.900 
what they mean by would say when it says
slow<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.399> molasses<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:37.070> pouring<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.760> go

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
slow as molasses and pouring there we go

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.280 
slow as molasses and pouring there we go
and<00:00:39.210> we're<00:00:39.329> getting<00:00:39.390> some<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:39.840> coming<00:00:40.170> out

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and we're getting some more coming out

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.880 
and we're getting some more coming out
now<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:41.309> bit<00:00:41.399> faster<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:42.649> they<00:00:43.649> want

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
now a little bit faster there they want

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.340 
now a little bit faster there they want
one<00:00:44.100> cup<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> molasses<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:46.050> we're<00:00:46.200> going

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
one cup of molasses and then we're going

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290 
one cup of molasses and then we're going
to<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.500> adding<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.010> our<00:00:47.160> egg<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.820> two

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to be adding in our egg and two

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
to be adding in our egg and two
tablespoons<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.020> white<00:00:49.620> vinegar<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:52.670> almost

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
tablespoons of white vinegar and almost

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.510 
tablespoons of white vinegar and almost
there<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:55.050> molasses<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> add<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
there the molasses is going to add the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.069 
there the molasses is going to add the
nice<00:00:56.730> flavor<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> gingerbread<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
nice flavor to the gingerbread which is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.010 
nice flavor to the gingerbread which is
characteristic<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.920> gingerbread<00:00:59.899> as<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
characteristic of gingerbread as I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
characteristic of gingerbread as I
mentioned<00:01:01.379> earlier<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.550> don't

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
mentioned earlier if you really don't

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
mentioned earlier if you really don't
like<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> smell<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.239> molasses<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> taste

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
like the smell of molasses or the taste

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.520 
like the smell of molasses or the taste
of<00:01:04.470> molasses<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.880> similar<00:01:06.330> consistency<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
of molasses for similar consistency you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.539 
of molasses for similar consistency you
can<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:08.010> dark<00:01:08.549> corn<00:01:09.240> syrup<00:01:09.920> but<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.220> you're

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
can use dark corn syrup but if you're

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.890 
can use dark corn syrup but if you're
going<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.119> traditional<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
going for the more traditional then I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.609 
going for the more traditional then I
highly<00:01:13.200> recommend<00:01:13.290> using<00:01:13.710> molasses<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.619> I'm

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
highly recommend using molasses and I'm

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.260 
highly recommend using molasses and I'm
going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> use<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> spatula<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.880> last

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
going to use a spatula to get that last

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.580 
going to use a spatula to get that last
bit<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:19.369> molasses<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> measuring<00:01:21.479> cup

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.679 

and<00:01:25.590> that's<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.950> foul<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.390> thick

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and that's just foul that's really thick

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:36.499 
and that's just foul that's really thick
molasses<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> we'll<00:01:31.259> add<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.409> egg<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:35.509> once

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
molasses so we'll add our egg and once

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.910 
molasses so we'll add our egg and once
we<00:01:36.689> start<00:01:36.960> mixing<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.350> we're<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
we start mixing this we're going to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.859 
we start mixing this we're going to
start<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> slower<00:01:38.729> speed<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.600> start

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
start on a slower speed to start

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.330 
start on a slower speed to start
incorporating<00:01:40.170> things<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> make<00:01:40.979> sure<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
incorporating things to make sure that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.020 
incorporating things to make sure that
that<00:01:41.369> egg<00:01:41.670> yolk<00:01:41.909> gets<00:01:42.150> broken<00:01:42.649> before<00:01:43.850> going<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that egg yolk gets broken before going a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.190 
that egg yolk gets broken before going a
little<00:01:45.149> bit<00:01:45.299> faster<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
little bit faster get that there and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.940 
little bit faster get that there and
then<00:01:49.200> our<00:01:49.470> vinegar

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
then our vinegar

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.789 
then our vinegar
and<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:53.479> might<00:01:53.630> wonder<00:01:53.750> why<00:01:54.049> vinegar<00:01:54.590> is

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
and you might wonder why vinegar is

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.539 
and you might wonder why vinegar is
being<00:01:55.009> added<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.659> cookies<00:01:57.130> it's<00:01:58.130> not<00:01:58.340> really

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
being added to cookies it's not really

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.120 
being added to cookies it's not really
enough<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.180> affect<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.840> flavor<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.890> need

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
enough to affect the flavor but you need

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.109 
enough to affect the flavor but you need
an<00:02:01.310> acid<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.539> interact<00:02:02.990> with<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.259> baking<00:02:03.619> soda

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
an acid to interact with the baking soda

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.169 
an acid to interact with the baking soda
that's<00:02:05.119> what<00:02:05.360> sets<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.780> off<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.520> there<00:02:07.729> are<00:02:07.759> two

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
that's what sets it off so there are two

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.150 
that's what sets it off so there are two
tablespoons<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.050> then<00:02:09.530> let's<00:02:09.739> get<00:02:09.950> this

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
tablespoons and then let's get this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.080 
tablespoons and then let's get this
started<00:02:11.380> start<00:02:12.380> slowly<00:02:12.830> until<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.519> egg<00:02:13.730> yolk

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
started start slowly until that egg yolk

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.750 
started start slowly until that egg yolk
is<00:02:14.209> broken<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.160> then<00:02:16.160> we're<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.519> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
is broken and then we're going to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.740 
is broken and then we're going to
increase<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.540> speed<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:19.299> let<00:02:20.299> me<00:02:20.420> tell<00:02:20.569> you

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
increase the speed and let me tell you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.570 
increase the speed and let me tell you
the<00:02:20.930> smell<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.319> pretty<00:02:21.590> interesting<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:22.370> it's

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
the smell is pretty interesting now it's

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.680 
the smell is pretty interesting now it's
a<00:02:22.670> little<00:02:23.150> bit<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.420> vinegar<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.480> this

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
a little bit of that vinegar and so this

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.080 
a little bit of that vinegar and so this
is<00:02:26.840> being<00:02:27.080> mixed<00:02:27.290> into<00:02:27.860> basically<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.580> brown

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
is being mixed into basically a brown

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.600 
is being mixed into basically a brown
goopy<00:02:29.660> mess<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.680> we're<00:02:30.799> going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:30.980> mix<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.549> a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
goopy mess so we're going to mix it a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.339 
goopy mess so we're going to mix it a
little<00:02:31.640> bit<00:02:31.910> longer<00:02:32.180> until<00:02:32.329> it's<00:02:32.840> smooth<00:02:33.140> and

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
little bit longer until it's smooth and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.640 
little bit longer until it's smooth and
they'll<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.829> ready<00:02:33.950> for<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> next<00:02:34.400> step
