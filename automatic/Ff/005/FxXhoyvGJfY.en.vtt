this<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> looks<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.740> it's

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
this is what it looks like so it's

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.630 
this is what it looks like so it's
pretty<00:02:05.219> neutral<00:02:05.579> I'm<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.320> like

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
pretty neutral I'm kind of just like

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
pretty neutral I'm kind of just like
most<00:02:08.640> other<00:02:08.910> primers<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.599> blend<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
most other primers you blend it in you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.650 
most other primers you blend it in you
don't<00:02:10.500> even<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.879> has<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> little<00:02:12.420> bit<00:02:12.599> of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
don't even see it it has a little bit of

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.270 
don't even see it it has a little bit of
a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.720 
a
feeling<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.690> has<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.730> smooth

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
feeling to it so it has like a smooth

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.040 
feeling to it so it has like a smooth
feeling<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.420> I'm<00:02:17.510> assuming<00:02:17.720> that's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
feeling to it and I'm assuming that's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.960 
feeling to it and I'm assuming that's
the<00:02:18.140> firm<00:02:18.410> at<00:02:18.560> all<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.040> that's<00:02:19.520> supposed<00:02:19.670> to

make your eyes just a little bit
smoother<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:21.920> give<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.190> extra<00:02:22.810> like

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
smoother and give it that extra like

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.059 
smoother and give it that extra like
lift<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.230> way<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.440> applies<00:02:27.709> I

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
lift to it I like the way it applies I

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.220 
lift to it I like the way it applies I
like<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.459> way<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.640> feels<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:29.209> my<00:02:29.270> eyes<00:02:29.540> but

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
like the way it feels on my eyes but

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.260 
like the way it feels on my eyes but
where<00:02:30.380> my<00:02:30.530> problem<00:02:30.920> comes<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.520> about<00:02:31.790> three

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
where my problem comes in is about three

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.840 
where my problem comes in is about three
hours<00:02:32.510> after<00:02:32.900> wearing<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.709> find<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.520> it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
hours after wearing this I find that it

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.380 
hours after wearing this I find that it
doesn't<00:02:35.209> hold<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.130> shadow<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.459> mean<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.060> holds

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
doesn't hold the shadow I mean it holds

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.690 
doesn't hold the shadow I mean it holds
it<00:02:38.480> fine<00:02:38.930> but<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.590> doesn't<00:02:39.860> hold<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.520> like

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
it fine but it doesn't hold it like

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.780 
it fine but it doesn't hold it like
other<00:02:40.910> products<00:02:41.690> do<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.110> find<00:02:42.800> if<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.190> did<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.670> a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
other products do I find if I did like a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.300 
other products do I find if I did like a
lid<00:02:44.030> color<00:02:44.300> with<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.690> crease<00:02:45.140> color<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.040> crease

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
lid color with a crease color the crease

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.920 
lid color with a crease color the crease
color<00:02:46.580> starts<00:02:46.850> coming<00:02:47.269> down<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.480> little<00:02:47.750> bit

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
color starts coming down a little bit

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.259 
color starts coming down a little bit
and<00:02:48.200> or<00:02:48.650> if<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:48.980> had<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> very<00:02:49.370> defined<00:02:49.880> like

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
and or if I had a very defined like

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.390 
and or if I had a very defined like
color<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.200> outer<00:02:51.380> V<00:02:51.709> all<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.130> sudden

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
color on the outer V all of a sudden

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.970 
color on the outer V all of a sudden
it's<00:02:52.550> like<00:02:52.610> moving<00:02:53.000> in<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.380> don't<00:02:54.709> think

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
it's like moving in and I don't think

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.120 
it's like moving in and I don't think
that's<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.310> great<00:02:56.290> thing<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.350> do<00:02:57.650> when<00:02:58.069> you're

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
that's a great thing to do when you're

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.440 
that's a great thing to do when you're
wearing<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.580> primer<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.060> would<00:02:59.209> think<00:02:59.239> that

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
wearing a primer I would think that

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.940 
wearing a primer I would think that
would<00:02:59.630> happen<00:02:59.780> if<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.080> don't<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> primer<00:03:00.800> on

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
would happen if I don't have a primer on

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.940 
would happen if I don't have a primer on
or<00:03:01.760> something<00:03:02.269> like<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.870> kind<00:03:03.830> of

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
or something like that but kind of

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.199 
or something like that but kind of
defeats<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.250> purpose<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.760> going<00:03:04.880> through<00:03:05.120> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
defeats the purpose of going through the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.420 
defeats the purpose of going through the
step<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.569> putting<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.900> primer<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.350> because<00:03:07.160> why
