friend<00:00:04.049> Austin<00:00:04.440> level<00:00:04.650> 99<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.730> basis<00:00:06.060> of

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
friend Austin level 99 so the basis of

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.909 
friend Austin level 99 so the basis of
the<00:00:06.330> series<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.899> going<00:00:07.080> for<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> thousand<00:00:07.710> kills

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
the series is going for a thousand kills

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.500 
the series is going for a thousand kills
as<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.309> probably<00:00:08.550> could<00:00:08.760> tell<00:00:08.940> by<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.090> series

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
as you probably could tell by the series

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.540 
as you probably could tell by the series
and<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.929> do<00:00:09.990> every<00:00:10.410> single<00:00:10.559> kill<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.099> her<00:00:11.250> so

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
and I do every single kill with her so

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.459 
and I do every single kill with her so
that<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.059> how<00:00:12.179> we<00:00:12.240> do<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.719> doooo<00:00:12.900> every<00:00:13.290> kill

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
that is how we do it we doooo every kill

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.829 
that is how we do it we doooo every kill
and<00:00:13.679> each<00:00:14.400> kill<00:00:14.670> takes<00:00:14.910> around<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.450> minute<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and each kill takes around a minute and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.990 
and each kill takes around a minute and
32<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.379> minutes<00:00:16.770> obviously<00:00:17.609> they're<00:00:17.760> not<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
32 two minutes obviously they're not the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.840 
32 two minutes obviously they're not the
fastest<00:00:18.359> kills<00:00:18.570> ever<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:20.039> us<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.400> pretty

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
fastest kills ever but to us it's pretty

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.390 
fastest kills ever but to us it's pretty
decent<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.390> some<00:00:22.289> episodes<00:00:22.619> could<00:00:22.890> take<00:00:23.070> four

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
decent and some episodes could take four

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.340 
decent and some episodes could take four
hours<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:23.910> we're<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.449> fast<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
hours because we're really fast on a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.990 
hours because we're really fast on a
certain<00:00:25.529> episode<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.369> get<00:00:26.490> lucky<00:00:26.670> kills

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
certain episode or we get lucky kills

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.519 
certain episode or we get lucky kills
kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.330> thing<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> rule<00:00:28.500> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
kind of thing but just as a rule of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
kind of thing but just as a rule of
thumb<00:00:28.650> each<00:00:29.039> episode<00:00:29.220> takes<00:00:29.580> five<00:00:29.760> hours<00:00:29.789> so

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
thumb each episode takes five hours so

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.700 
thumb each episode takes five hours so
at<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> end<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> video<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.500> just

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
at the end of the video you can just

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.950 
at the end of the video you can just
divide<00:00:31.920> our<00:00:32.099> loot<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.430> 15<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
divide our loot by 15 and that is the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.990 
divide our loot by 15 and that is the
hourly<00:00:34.350> rate<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.739> we're<00:00:34.860> getting<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.219> then

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
hourly rate that we're getting and then

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.850 
hourly rate that we're getting and then
divided<00:00:36.360> by<00:00:36.450> 2<00:00:36.510> again<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:37.079> our<00:00:37.230> split<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
divided by 2 again that's our split so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
divided by 2 again that's our split so
yeah<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> series<00:00:38.940> itself<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.510> going

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
yeah for the series itself it's going

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
yeah for the series itself it's going
really<00:00:39.870> well<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.890> haven't<00:00:41.070> had<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> time

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
really well we haven't had a lot of time

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
really well we haven't had a lot of time
to<00:00:41.820> corp<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.570> either<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> us<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.129> busy

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
to corp because either one of us is busy

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
to corp because either one of us is busy
or<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.879> other<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.149> busy<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
or the other is busy and it's just it's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
or the other is busy and it's just it's
kind<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.739> hard<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> both<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.670> able<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> corp<00:00:48.270> at

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
kind of hard to both be able to corp at

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
kind of hard to both be able to corp at
the<00:00:48.660> same<00:00:48.870> time<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.129> much<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.309> we

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the same time but we do as much as we

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
the same time but we do as much as we
can<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.899> did<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.350> two<00:00:52.469> days

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
can and this up so we did do in two days

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
can and this up so we did do in two days
that<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.520> had<00:00:53.670> free<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> pretty

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that we had free and it was a pretty

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.869 
that we had free and it was a pretty
good<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.199> didn't<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.949> could<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.280> 100<00:00:56.699> kills

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
good I didn't know we could do 100 kills

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
good I didn't know we could do 100 kills
in<00:00:57.090> two<00:00:57.239> days<00:00:57.530> effectively<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.920> did<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
in two days effectively but we did it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
in two days effectively but we did it
was<00:00:59.430> really<00:00:59.640> nicely<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.000> stream<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> really

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
was really nicely a stream to really

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.619 
was really nicely a stream to really
long<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:02.160> streamed<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> entire

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
long and we streamed like the entire

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390 
long and we streamed like the entire
hundred<00:01:03.989> kills<00:01:04.170> without<00:01:04.290> any<00:01:04.650> crashes<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.309> was

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
hundred kills without any crashes it was

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
hundred kills without any crashes it was
really<00:01:05.610> nice<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.510> kills<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.110> are

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
really nice as for the kills we are

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
really nice as for the kills we are
getting<00:01:07.500> much<00:01:07.710> faster<00:01:08.130> than<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> last

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
getting much faster than the last

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880 
getting much faster than the last
episode<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:09.869> getting<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.409> faster

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
episode and we are getting way faster

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.170 
episode and we are getting way faster
than<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> first<00:01:11.189> up<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.729> were<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:11.939> bad

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
than the first up so we were really bad

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
than the first up so we were really bad
the<00:01:12.720> first<00:01:12.930> episode<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.619> hold<00:01:13.799> their

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the first episode and we can hold their

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160 
the first episode and we can hold their
own<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.720> rarely<00:01:15.930> die

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
own now like really good we rarely die

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
own now like really good we rarely die
and<00:01:16.500> corp<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.000> enjoyable

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and corp is actually pretty enjoyable

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
and corp is actually pretty enjoyable
once<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.640> now

rare loot or you know decent drop I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
rare loot or you know decent drop I
guess<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.070> only<00:01:29.189> got<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> holy

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
guess we only got one and it was a holy

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.660 
guess we only got one and it was a holy
elixir<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> that's<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
elixir and that's not really that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.550 
elixir and that's not really that
amazing<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.990> three<00:01:34.290> we've

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
amazing because we now have three we've

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
amazing because we now have three we've
gotten<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.009> every<00:01:35.340> single<00:01:35.520> episode<00:01:35.729> it's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
gotten one every single episode it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
gotten one every single episode it's
kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> getting<00:01:37.020> redundant<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:38.159> hoping

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
kind of getting redundant but I'm hoping

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
kind of getting redundant but I'm hoping
for<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> sigil<00:01:38.880> still<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.290> can't

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
for a sigil still but you really can't

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.289 
for a sigil still but you really can't
complain<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:40.860> mean<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.220> 800<00:01:41.610> k<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.000> does<00:01:42.150> add

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
complain i mean it's 800 k it does add

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.240 
complain i mean it's 800 k it does add
up<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.960> it'd<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.590> nice<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.799> get<00:01:44.040> something

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
up but it'd be nice to get something

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.310 
up but it'd be nice to get something
different<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:45.090> as<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.420> troll<00:01:45.899> Lutz<00:01:46.110> we

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
different and then as for troll Lutz we

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
different and then as for troll Lutz we
did<00:01:46.500> get<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.950> spirit<00:01:47.280> shield<00:01:47.460> finally<00:01:47.970> um

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
did get one spirit shield finally um

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149 
did get one spirit shield finally um
it's<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:48.869> uncommon<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.770> actually<00:01:50.009> more

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it's pretty uncommon it's actually more

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
it's pretty uncommon it's actually more
common<00:01:50.340> than<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> holy<00:01:50.880> elixir<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.840> was

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
common than a holy elixir and it was

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.480 
common than a holy elixir and it was
weird<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.380> didn't<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.740> any<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.399> had

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
weird that we didn't get any and we had

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.219 
weird that we didn't get any and we had
three<00:01:53.729> elixirs<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:54.930> weird

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
three elixirs so it was really weird

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.600 
three elixirs so it was really weird
that<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.530> didn't<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.799> any<00:01:55.979> spirit<00:01:56.310> shields

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that we didn't get any spirit shields

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060 
that we didn't get any spirit shields
but<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.969> finally<00:01:57.210> got<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.630> unlike<00:01:58.229> kill<00:01:58.469> 278

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
but we finally got one unlike kill 278

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580 
but we finally got one unlike kill 278
or<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:01.079> only<00:02:01.200> 40k

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
or something like that and it's only 40k

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.850 
or something like that and it's only 40k
and<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.310> pretty<00:02:03.000> stupid<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.479> oh<00:02:03.899> well<00:02:04.259> we

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and it's pretty stupid but oh well we

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.590 
and it's pretty stupid but oh well we
did<00:02:05.070> deserve<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.360> three

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
did deserve it because we are three

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.359 
did deserve it because we are three
hundred<00:02:06.840> kills<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.290> only<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> then

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
hundred kills in with only one and then

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249 
hundred kills in with only one and then
this<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.910> off-topic<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.110> other

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
we did in their first episode as we did

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
we did in their first episode as we did
in<00:02:30.930> our<00:02:31.260> second<00:02:31.950> episode<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.520> they<00:02:32.790> literally

in our second episode so they literally
got<00:02:33.300> twice<00:02:33.540> as<00:02:33.570> lucky<00:02:33.990> as<00:02:34.020> us<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.860> those<00:02:34.980> drops

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
got twice as lucky as us for those drops

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.650 
got twice as lucky as us for those drops
and<00:02:35.430> those<00:02:35.610> are<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> ones<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.060> give<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and those are the ones that give you the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.410 
and those are the ones that give you the
most<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.110> money<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.740> be<00:02:37.830> honest<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:38.820> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
most of the money to be honest but I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.930 
most of the money to be honest but I
think<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.170> made<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:40.920> episode<00:02:41.190> tan

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
think we made it up for this episode tan

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.610 
think we made it up for this episode tan
and<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:42.450> let<00:02:42.600> me<00:02:42.690> show<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.170> these<00:02:43.320> onyx

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.060 
onyx bolts which is pretty nice it's not
super<00:02:49.170> lucky<00:02:49.380> or<00:02:49.470> anything<00:02:49.740> but<00:02:49.860> for

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
super lucky or anything but for

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.040 
super lucky or anything but for
cannonballs<00:02:50.490> we<00:02:50.700> did<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.150> extremely<00:02:51.720> lucky

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
cannonballs we did get extremely lucky

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.380 
cannonballs we did get extremely lucky
we<00:02:52.170> got<00:02:52.200> five<00:02:52.590> cannon<00:02:52.980> ball<00:02:53.100> drops<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.640> 100

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
we got five cannon ball drops in 100

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.970 
we got five cannon ball drops in 100
kills<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.750> think<00:02:54.959> that's<00:02:55.080> pretty<00:02:55.410> lucky<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:55.890> me

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
kills I think that's pretty lucky for me

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.770 
kills I think that's pretty lucky for me
because<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.610> think<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.030> drop<00:02:57.239> rates<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.570> one

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
because I think the drop rates like one

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.440 
because I think the drop rates like one
in<00:02:57.870> 35<00:02:58.830> or<00:02:59.130> something<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.420> other

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
in 35 or something and the other

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.360 
in 35 or something and the other
episodes<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:01.200> only<00:03:01.320> got<00:03:01.440> two<00:03:01.650> per<00:03:01.800> episode<00:03:01.920> and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
episodes we only got two per episode and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.890 
episodes we only got two per episode and
then<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.640> episode<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.030> get<00:03:03.180> five<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.810> was

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
then this episode we get five so it was

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.620 
then this episode we get five so it was
really<00:03:03.989> nice<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:05.310> 5<00:03:05.580> mil<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:06.510> from

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
really nice that is 5 mil just from

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.110 
really nice that is 5 mil just from
cannonballs<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.380> our<00:03:07.739> tab<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.580> up<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.910> lot

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
cannonballs so our tab is going up a lot

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.880 
cannonballs so our tab is going up a lot
because<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.320> way<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.650> kind

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
because of that and this way we can kind

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.740 
because of that and this way we can kind
of<00:03:11.010> catch<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.520> Devin<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.180> Kai's<00:03:12.390> luck

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
of catch up to Devin and Kai's luck

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.050 
of catch up to Devin and Kai's luck
because<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.410> they<00:03:13.590> continue<00:03:14.489> their<00:03:14.520> luck<00:03:14.880> they

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
because if they continue their luck they

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.520 
because if they continue their luck they
can<00:03:15.209> easily<00:03:15.510> beat<00:03:15.690> our<00:03:15.840> series<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.260> terms<00:03:16.440> of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
can easily beat our series in terms of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.440 
can easily beat our series in terms of
money<00:03:16.709> especially<00:03:17.130> if<00:03:17.430> they<00:03:17.519> get<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> sigil<00:03:17.880> but

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
money especially if they get a sigil but

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.300 
money especially if they get a sigil but
you<00:03:18.690> never<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:19.100> hopefully<00:03:20.100> we<00:03:20.190> get

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
you never know hopefully we get

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.220 
you never know hopefully we get
essential<00:03:20.640> before<00:03:20.880> then<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.959> isn't

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
essential before then but this isn't

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.470 
essential before then but this isn't
really<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.440> competition<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.970> kind<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.360> just

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
really a competition it's kind of just

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150 
really a competition it's kind of just

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
guys will see how much those are worth

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.339 
guys will see how much those are worth
because<00:04:20.790> those<00:04:20.940> are<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.450> relatively

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
because those are like the relatively

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.400 
because those are like the relatively
rare<00:04:22.650> or<00:04:23.000> expensive<00:04:24.000> drops<00:04:24.300> I'd<00:04:24.479> say<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.930> mean

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
rare or expensive drops I'd say I mean

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.570 
rare or expensive drops I'd say I mean
the<00:04:25.500> spiritual<00:04:25.890> isn't<00:04:26.250> but

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
the spiritual isn't but

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.850 
the spiritual isn't but
it's<00:04:26.789> rare<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.360> guess<00:04:27.599> so<00:04:28.080> yeah<00:04:28.229> there's<00:04:28.439> no<00:04:28.620> use

it's rare I guess so yeah there's no use

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.170 
it's rare I guess so yeah there's no use
in<00:04:28.889> waiting<00:04:29.159> because<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.580> guys<00:04:29.669> have<00:04:29.909> seen

there so we did increase like 20 mil
this<00:05:29.340> episode<00:05:29.729> mainly<00:05:30.659> because<00:05:30.690> we<00:05:30.930> got<00:05:31.020> so
