00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
little extra showmanship that we do but

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.410 
little extra showmanship that we do but
it's<00:05:52.530> not<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.830> real<00:05:53.250> deal<00:05:53.580> you<00:05:54.150> know<00:05:54.270> what<00:05:54.360> I

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
it's not the real deal you know what I

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.850
