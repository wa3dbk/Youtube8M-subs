the Xbox one wasn't the only console on
that<00:04:42.410> list<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:43.160> ps3<00:04:43.910> was<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.420> Xbox<00:04:44.840> 360<00:04:45.440> was

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
that list the ps3 was the Xbox 360 was

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.370 
that list the ps3 was the Xbox 360 was
the<00:04:45.920> Wii<00:04:46.130> was<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.670> Wii<00:04:46.850> U<00:04:47.060> was<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.750> PC<00:04:48.200> and

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
the Wii was the Wii U was and a PC and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.580 
the Wii was the Wii U was and a PC and
yes<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:49.100> ps4<00:04:49.430> came<00:04:50.300> out<00:04:50.510> on<00:04:50.720> top<00:04:50.960> as<00:04:51.200> far<00:04:51.230> as

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
yes the ps4 came out on top as far as

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.100 
yes the ps4 came out on top as far as
the<00:04:52.040> game<00:04:52.250> Capcom<00:04:52.850> games<00:04:53.150> selling<00:04:53.660> better<00:04:53.870> on

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
the game Capcom games selling better on

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.410 
the game Capcom games selling better on
that<00:04:54.350> platform<00:04:54.980> and<00:04:55.190> then<00:04:55.580> like<00:04:55.880> second<00:04:56.300> I

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
that platform and then like second I

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.770 
that platform and then like second I
believe<00:04:56.600> was<00:04:56.870> like<00:04:56.960> Xbox<00:04:57.350> one<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:58.400> know<00:04:58.750> it

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
believe was like Xbox one you know it

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.040 
believe was like Xbox one you know it
instead<00:05:00.710> of<00:05:00.860> saying<00:05:01.130> ps4<00:05:01.700> leads<00:05:01.970> off<00:05:02.270> they

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
instead of saying ps4 leads off they

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.970 
instead of saying ps4 leads off they
they<00:05:04.010> put<00:05:04.220> Xbox<00:05:04.610> one<00:05:04.850> in<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.120> title<00:05:05.980> because

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
they put Xbox one in that title because

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.160 
they put Xbox one in that title because
the<00:05:07.010> ps4<00:05:07.430> didn't<00:05:07.910> just<00:05:08.090> beat<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.360> Xbox<00:05:08.720> one<00:05:08.930> it

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170
