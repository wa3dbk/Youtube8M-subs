00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.359
 on video to see something I have 

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:09.870
 I created this is a machine 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.440
 I did it myself, I am 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.699
 inspired by those machines that are there 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.779
 in a boat with this in this thing 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.240
 right 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.910
 this May hook is take a 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.349
 I managed to do it 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.009
 got a cane 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.509
 I tied the barrel with this scooter e 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.810
 then to a thread 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.560
 and thanks to this other engine and the wire 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.590
 he realizes and this then moves this 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.240
 body is attached acquitted a thread that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 linked to this that it can come down is 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.040
 just as soon as I go down it closes 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 this is a question here 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.850
 a territory that I need to do 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.890
 starting or this or that engine e 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.320
 here they are always wires are i feel it 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.320
 where with small but I to the batteries 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.079
 some inflation I'll show you 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.479
 how it works and friends to see this 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.490
 as how he did I know there is a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.749
 scooter that will be head leather a wire 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.819
 so here are those toothpicks 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:24.210
 here they are folded tied with a piece of 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:26.999
 insulating tape and twine it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.280
 when this one turns over several times 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:32.130
 repeatedly this motor the wire does 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.659
 shorten these here are pulled and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.659
 then they close 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:51.450
 and now it's ok to abolish ok though for 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 have so far ok 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:11.610
 and tried to take this sun would be 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:21.690
 try to get it down ok but not 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:26.850
 I'm sure but where for the 3 it is 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:42.650
 learned by clicking this button but do 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:42.650
 go ahead to thank you
