work so break grodd's adjusted all the
way<00:02:37.390> out<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.980> little<00:02:39.190> hard<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.580> shift

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
way out and it is a little hard to shift

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
but you get a little bit of muscle and

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.930 
but you get a little bit of muscle and
it<00:02:42.610> doesn't<00:02:42.849> really<00:02:42.910> matter<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:45.310> show<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.610> the
