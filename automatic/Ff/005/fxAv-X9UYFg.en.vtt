and<00:03:07.640> head<00:03:08.030> sitting<00:03:08.540> beside<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:10.100> kind

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
and head sitting beside it now this kind

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.090 
and head sitting beside it now this kind
of<00:03:10.430> reminds<00:03:10.790> me<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.750> train<00:03:12.410> platforms<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
of reminds me of the train platforms you

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.699 
of reminds me of the train platforms you
see<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.400> England<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.989> thought<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.530> was

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
see in England so I thought that was

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.710 
see in England so I thought that was
good<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.100> they<00:03:16.220> kind<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.519> designed<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.090> even

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
good that they kind of designed it even

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.930 
good that they kind of designed it even
though<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.019> simple<00:03:18.769> for<00:03:19.010> because<00:03:19.760> it's

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
though it's simple for because it's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.000 
though it's simple for because it's
DUPLO<00:03:20.390> but<00:03:20.660> they<00:03:20.870> made<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.140> look<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.680> train

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
DUPLO but they made it look like a train

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.000 
DUPLO but they made it look like a train
platform<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:23.480> don't<00:03:23.660> have<00:03:23.840> these<00:03:24.140> much<00:03:24.709> here

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010

in<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.190> United<00:03:25.550> States<00:03:25.850> but<00:03:26.239> in<00:03:26.870> England<00:03:27.290> they

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
in the United States but in England they

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.410 
in the United States but in England they
have<00:03:28.100> more<00:03:28.280> train<00:03:28.580> service<00:03:28.610> actually<00:03:29.150> all

back training do close figures are
designed<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.570> not<00:03:59.690> come<00:04:00.049> apart<00:04:00.410> even<00:04:01.400> though

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
designed to not come apart even though

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.250 
designed to not come apart even though
they<00:04:01.820> really<00:04:02.030> are<00:04:02.239> made<00:04:02.480> up<00:04:02.630> of<00:04:02.810> more<00:04:03.019> than<00:04:03.079> one

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
they really are made up of more than one

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.660 
they really are made up of more than one
piece

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
piece

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.839 
piece
they<00:04:04.910> are<00:04:06.220> basically<00:04:07.220> designed<00:04:07.430> where<00:04:07.819> a

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
they are basically designed where a

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.940 
they are basically designed where a
child<00:04:08.090> can't<00:04:08.420> pull<00:04:09.110> them<00:04:09.200> apart<00:04:09.349> and<00:04:09.709> choke

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
child can't pull them apart and choke

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.890 
child can't pull them apart and choke
himself<00:04:10.310> on<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:11.000> that's<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.330> sure<00:04:11.480> couple

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
himself on it so that's for sure couple

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.449 
himself on it so that's for sure couple
hat<00:04:13.209> we<00:04:14.209> also<00:04:14.390> get<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.959> loading<00:04:15.410> station

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
hat we also get this loading station

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.879 
hat we also get this loading station
we're<00:04:16.639> basically<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:17.180> piece<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.720> can<00:04:17.900> put

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
we're basically this piece you can put

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.940 
we're basically this piece you can put
it<00:04:19.010> up<00:04:19.100> like<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.630> cargo<00:04:21.620> falls

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
it up like that and the cargo falls

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.450 
it up like that and the cargo falls
right<00:04:22.190> into<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.580> car<00:04:23.620> just<00:04:24.620> like<00:04:24.830> so<00:04:25.100> and

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
right into the car just like so and

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.530 
right into the car just like so and
you're<00:04:26.419> ready<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.720> go<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:29.120> here's<00:04:29.360> our

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
you're ready to go and here's our

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.450 
you're ready to go and here's our
windmill<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.290> can<00:04:30.440> actually<00:04:30.889> spin<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.340> with

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
windmill you can actually spin it with

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.530 
windmill you can actually spin it with
this<00:04:31.550> little<00:04:31.760> lever<00:04:32.030> on<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.360> back<00:04:34.389> so<00:04:35.389> I'm

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
this little lever on the back so I'm

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.090 
this little lever on the back so I'm
sure<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.840> kids<00:04:36.050> probably<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.620> spinning

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
sure the kids probably like spinning

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.330 
sure the kids probably like spinning
this<00:04:37.220> around<00:04:37.580> it's<00:04:38.330> real<00:04:38.479> easy<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.900> spin<00:04:39.340> just

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
this around it's real easy to spin just

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.260 
this around it's real easy to spin just
basically<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.750> special<00:04:42.260> piece<00:04:42.970> like<00:04:43.970> this

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
basically the special piece like this

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.050 
basically the special piece like this
just<00:04:45.110> slides<00:04:45.830> right<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.220> there<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:46.610> cover<00:04:46.910> it

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
just slides right in there you cover it

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.870 
just slides right in there you cover it
with<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.270> brake<00:04:47.979> you<00:04:48.979> can<00:04:49.310> spin<00:04:49.520> it's<00:04:49.669> like<00:04:49.850> a

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
with a brake you can spin it's like a

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.430 
with a brake you can spin it's like a
deep<00:04:50.479> low<00:04:50.690> Technic<00:04:51.200> piece<00:04:52.930> we<00:04:53.930> also<00:04:54.050> get<00:04:54.410> a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
deep low Technic piece we also get a

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.000 
deep low Technic piece we also get a
signal<00:04:54.830> Tower<00:04:55.040> which<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.580> basically<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:57.010> couple

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
signal Tower which is basically a couple

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.219 
signal Tower which is basically a couple
of<00:04:58.070> columns<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.729> you<00:04:58.790> got<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:59.150> turntable<00:05:00.020> on

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
of columns and you got a turntable on

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.200 
of columns and you got a turntable on
top<00:05:00.470> we<00:05:00.680> can<00:05:00.740> swivel<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.370> between<00:05:01.610> green<00:05:02.000> and

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
top we can swivel it between green and

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.960 
top we can swivel it between green and
red<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.950> there's<00:05:03.950> one<00:05:04.160> little<00:05:04.400> orange<00:05:04.669> flower

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
red and there's one little orange flower

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.320 
red and there's one little orange flower
on<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.330> side<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.669> then<00:05:07.669> you<00:05:07.850> also<00:05:07.970> have

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
on the side of it and then you also have

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.260 
on the side of it and then you also have
the<00:05:08.510> fueling<00:05:08.950> station<00:05:09.950> here<00:05:10.250> which<00:05:11.000> is

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
the fueling station here which is

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.480 
the fueling station here which is
basically<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:12.590> hose<00:05:12.770> coming<00:05:13.190> out<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.430> this
