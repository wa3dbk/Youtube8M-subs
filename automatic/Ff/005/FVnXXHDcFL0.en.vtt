00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.480
 everybody big hello and in this video I 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.250
 I want to show how I draw arrows first 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.360
 option will be everyday second 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.420
 evening version 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.420
 just I want to say that I'm not a makeup artist is not 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.580
 ending with no courses arrows 7 draw 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.710
 almost every day it's just mine 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.130
 magic wand so who 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.080
 I wonder what that case is looking further 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.150
 like i said i am not a makeup artist 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.430
 I'll just show you how I do my 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.140
 arrows arrows and I will do with 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.590
 bourgeois marker 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.320
 I do not like liquid liner I just 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.550
 inconvenient to paint; have isomalt long 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.649
 eyelashes I just smear all eyelashes 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.050
 so for starters i'm doing a thin line on 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.750
 the address is not zami as well as the water 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.890
 the line thereby visually increase 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.890
 number of eyelashes 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.229
 next we need to draw an arrow 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.229
 she should aim for the eyebrow 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.980
 and connect the line with the arrow to the blame of people 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.670
 in the same way we draw the second eye 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.980
 here 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.920
 further i tint the eyelashes with mascara rocket 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.500
 by meybellin and mascara is not bad in 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.670
 general with my eyelashes suits me 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.670
 absolutely all souls 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.910
 and in the end we get everyday 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.910
 arrows 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.520
 further tricky step for the evening 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.470
 option we just make the line thicker 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.460
 so we give our look 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.460
 boldness 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.810
 in the same way we do the second eye 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.000
 so i showed how i make arrows for 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.670
 everyday makeup so for 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.280
 I hope you enjoyed the evening
