00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.369
 hello to all and argos today I 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.980
 am on a video blog in transit mode 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.770
 and I will show you how to get 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 the taser point you owe yourself without 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.240
 probably already know how survival 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.200
 fight 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.540
 maybe very few people know it 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.840
 for the world are passing through 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.899
 finally I believe then you need 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 the internal scale that goes in the bus is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.309
 the one going inside the bus is a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.649
 kind of square me I already had it 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.000
 I did my part this ladder 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.199
 internally or is it can be found 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 to be in different places 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.280
 I had them from the first floor 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.670
 first room you put your turbiner 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.370
 to isra here is after you go to 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.690
 second stop the diner here and you 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.489
 go find a restaurant there 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.670
 will have a small door to open at 750 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 you will open it and you will see that it is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 a restaurant that you will go to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.850
 bottom of the restaurant and all at the bottom of this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 restaurant you're on the ceiling a duct 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.950
 aeration dance ventilation ducts 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.260
 you will have to put your piece and we will 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.270
 allow you to access the roof on the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.400
 bus roof there is taser point here 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.350
 there's nothing else the pointer and costs 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.710
 6000 but it is really really 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.270
 effective ie in efficiency I 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.670
 I'll'll show all 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.550
 along the video but I 'll get you 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.480
 explain then already this taser point is 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.900
 than a shot up to kill a shot up 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.010
 round 14 do not have until round 13 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.170
 and at the 14th inning 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.759
 they kill in two shots 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 which is not bad anyway better than 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.380
 the hunting knife we ​​had on black 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.040
 ops oms who's also behind on the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.830
 transit month 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.770
 it's hidden not so if I need to 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.399
 make a video on it you tell me 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.560
 but hey and that's it so yes super 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.670
 effective it costs 6000 points but the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.310
 6000 points they will be widely 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.860
 refunded you will see here I dint that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.090
 will be quiet you see the zombies 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.670
 morin blow we are ugly 9 a stroke of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.790
 knife besides it's pretty fast the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.489
 stab here is then I'm going 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.610
 make a break for to go 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.720
 until round 13 continues to you 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.489
 show its effectiveness 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.739
 go to right now I'm back a fact 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.049
 of the sleeve 12 rather in play 13 we're going 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.670
 always say to show you 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:46.860
 the effectiveness of this taser point here is the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.850
 gait higher see since 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.280
 was eaten 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.890
 now we are going to pass the heat 13 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.709
 and you see you see you 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.420
 would rather see that he will always kill a 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.140
 taste related to the skull but good I 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.420
 think I'll wait for her 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 disappear I'll wait until she 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.140
 disappears to be able that such and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.239
 Zambia because with the skull we 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.709
 all know that one investigates in short course 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.049
 yes unfortunately I could not film 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.079
 the sleeve 14 to show you that at the 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.820
 rock 14 in tears and well two shots 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.590
 for to kill them two stab wounds 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.340
 we'll take the gun a bullet and a 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.570
 hit enough good too but it's already 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.909
 not bad I think I filmed the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.980
 branch 13 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.989
 Here here I wait for the zombies it 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.180
 come here and I also expect that the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.530
 skull disappears it's important 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.409
 to show you the effectiveness when 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.299
 even we put a little time to 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.510
 get them as always 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.890
 beginning of the heat in addition to 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.500
 solo there are a lot less those of 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.980
 zombies so much less zombies 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.340
 which they arrive even less quickly 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.629
 finally here is I see I confess I describe 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.659
 red pamesa had the laser gun 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.760
 which I play a solo is when I had 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.120
 nothing to do here is what 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.500
 laser gun rpd we are not here to 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.470
 describe the trees is the earliest 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.670
 to talk about my taser point and that's it 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.889
 the taser point you know all 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.189
 now it is much more effective 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.630
 that is much more efficient than the 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.400
 hunting knife hunting knife he 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.489
 struck a blow like 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.530
 only until the 10th inning so 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.470
 here is in addition it is hidden the importance 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.669
 which is good that the pointer is the 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.410
 little aliens me I call that 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.810
 aliens when you cross in the 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.419
 mist wanted to kill in two shots of 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.150
 fist taser not a cost but a 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.310
 document it's already not bad I find 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.800
 you put two shots to them so that's it 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.690
 that you can cross the street without 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.430
 support 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.280
 good and if not I hope you'll have 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.560
 but my video do not hesitate to ask 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.060
 questions I will answer there I have a small 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.460
 I like it is always fun or even 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.580
 subscriber you go I saw all the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.580
 world
