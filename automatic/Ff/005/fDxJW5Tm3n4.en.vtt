while you are under your vehicle once

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.079 
while you are under your vehicle once
you've<00:00:33.140> gathered<00:00:33.559> all<00:00:33.829> your<00:00:33.859> tools<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.820> first

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.089 
you've gathered all your tools the first

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.729 
you've gathered all your tools the first
step<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.600> make<00:00:35.749> sure<00:00:35.780> that<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.320> vehicle's

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
step is to make sure that the vehicle's

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.340 
step is to make sure that the vehicle's
