a<00:00:44.700> couple<00:00:45.570> years<00:00:45.750> old<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.379> came<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
a couple years old I think came out in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.869 
a couple years old I think came out in
2012<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:47.879> 2013<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> those<00:00:49.140> years<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
2012 or 2013 one of those years but this

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.610 
2012 or 2013 one of those years but this
does<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.350> show<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
does have it and I'm going to show you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
does have it and I'm going to show you
how<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> use<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> first<00:00:57.239> we're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
how to use it so first we're going to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.189 
how to use it so first we're going to
identify<00:00:57.750> each<00:00:59.090> basic<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> critical<00:01:00.960> part<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
identify each basic and critical part of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
identify each basic and critical part of
this<00:01:01.350> lens<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.520> aperture<00:01:02.940> ring

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
this lens this is the aperture ring

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.560 
this lens this is the aperture ring
right<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.000> manual

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
right here and then this is the manual

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.620 
right here and then this is the manual
focusing<00:01:07.020> ring<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:08.070> also<00:01:08.610> tells<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.390> how

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
focusing ring which also tells you how

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.500 
focusing ring which also tells you how
far<00:01:09.900> away<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.470> focusing<00:01:11.090> both<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.299> feet

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
far away you're focusing both in feet

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.870 
far away you're focusing both in feet
and<00:01:12.689> meters<00:01:12.869> feet<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> con<00:01:13.799> located<00:01:14.189> by<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and meters feet is con located by the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.179 
and meters feet is con located by the
red<00:01:15.119> while<00:01:15.780> meters<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.380> connotated<00:01:17.009> by<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
red while meters is connotated by the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.640 
red while meters is connotated by the
white<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.900> then<00:01:18.900> there's<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.500> part

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
white and then there's the other part

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.700 
white and then there's the other part
right<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.670> depth<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.570> field<00:01:21.869> now

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
right here which is depth of field now

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.140 
right here which is depth of field now
16<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.869> associated<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:24.900> those<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.560> markers

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
16 is associated with those all markers

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.700 
16 is associated with those all markers
f/4<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> associated<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.840> those<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.229> markers

f/8 is associated with those little

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.069 
f/8 is associated with those little
markers<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> how<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.400> read<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.210> lens<00:01:33.630> than

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
markers so how do you read a lens than

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.800 
markers so how do you read a lens than
in<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.380> case<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.490> let's<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.570> foot

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
in that case so let's go to one foot

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.319 
in that case so let's go to one foot
away<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.409> 1<00:01:37.619> foot<00:01:37.799> away<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.150> saying

bit around 11 inches will be in focus
then<00:02:31.840> let's<00:02:32.080> say<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:32.590> go<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.810> two<00:02:34.810> feet<00:02:35.019> away

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
then let's say we go to two feet away

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.790 
then let's say we go to two feet away
what<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.760> saying<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:38.050> our<00:02:38.170> f-16

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
what this is saying is that our f-16

what this is saying is that our f-16
everything<00:02:39.370> at<00:02:39.580> four<00:02:40.120> feet<00:02:40.330> away<00:02:40.830> two<00:02:41.830> feet<00:02:42.069> to

everything at four feet away two feet to
four<00:02:42.430> feet<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:42.850> be<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.060> focus<00:02:43.269> and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
four feet will be in focus and

to two feet will be in focus so you have

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.990 
to two feet will be in focus so you have
the<00:02:50.290> distance<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:51.160> foot<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.670> half<00:02:51.700> away

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
focus at f-16 when you are focusing at

two feet away
at<00:03:00.540> f4<00:03:02.209> what<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.390> means<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.640> everything

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
at f4 what that means is that everything

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.440 
at f4 what that means is that everything
f-16<00:03:06.630> if<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.319> at<00:03:07.440> f/16<00:03:08.270> everything<00:03:09.270> to

f-16 if you are at f/16 everything to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.870 
f-16 if you are at f/16 everything to
infinity<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.739> around<00:03:10.980> two<00:03:11.400> feet<00:03:11.430> away<00:03:11.730> from

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
infinity to around two feet away from

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.400 
infinity to around two feet away from
you<00:03:12.180> will<00:03:12.989> be<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.260> focus<00:03:14.959> then<00:03:15.959> let's<00:03:16.200> say<00:03:16.500> you

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
you will be in focus then let's say you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.840 
you will be in focus then let's say you
are<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.890> six<00:03:20.370> inches<00:03:22.220> since<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.430> goes<00:03:23.640> from

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
are at six inches since this goes from

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.290 
are at six inches since this goes from
six<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.450> seven<00:03:25.580> basically<00:03:26.580> means<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.910> almost

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
six to seven basically means that almost

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.770 
six to seven basically means that almost
nothing<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.690> going<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> be<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.019> focus<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:29.780> even

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
nothing is going to be in focus and even

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.100 
nothing is going to be in focus and even
more<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.170> when<00:03:31.470> you're<00:03:31.739> at<00:03:31.890> point<00:03:32.130> nine<00:03:32.250> five

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
more so when you're at point nine five

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.820 
more so when you're at point nine five
that<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.140> pretty<00:03:34.530> much<00:03:34.769> how<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.400> works<00:03:35.640> and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
that is pretty much how this works and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.250 
that is pretty much how this works and
yeah<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.069> hope<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.519> was<00:03:38.700> helpful<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.180> guys
