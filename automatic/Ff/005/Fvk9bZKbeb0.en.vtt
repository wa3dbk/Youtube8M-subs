00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.660
 every day they kill hundreds of wild 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.689
 animal birds and thousands of fish every day 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.689
 they slowly destroy our planet and 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.880
 including you and me 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:28.880
 you indifferently walked past them thousands 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 once and did not do a name to them 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:38.340
 plastic bags we look at them 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.200
 accustomed to seeing them as such someone 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 will say that the package and useful because they 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.090
 help us carry products to home but 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.990
 so they will not always look like this 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.640
 only a short beginning of their journey you when 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.680
 ever thought what was going on with them 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.480
 after you throw them on 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.390
 trash can 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.130
 see for yourself tons of plastic bags 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.479
 pile up in landfills 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.520
 tons swim in rivers seas and oceans 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.219
 slowly destroying all life 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.340
 here's a turtle swallowed plastic 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:18.569
 the package she certainly does not know what to cut 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.179
 this life of her 65 years old she will die 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:24.149
 a day after the package hits 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:27.090
 to her stomach this bird took 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.450
 package for something edible later 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.159
 a few days she was gone 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.659
 the same happens with camels 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.409
 dolphins and even whales a little 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.899
 statistics 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.640
 in the world 1 trillion packets are discarded 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.579
 in the trash every year 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 while you watch this video in the trash 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.310
 hit over 2 million plastic 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.950
 packages the next 500 years they will 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.009
 slowly decompose to no one needed and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.789
 all forgotten and only five percent of 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.770
 more than forty of them will be processed 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.280
 years around the world have banned the sale 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.329
 plastic bags among them england 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.810
 Germany 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:14.620
 canada spain italy japan 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.879
 Brazil and many other countries of ours 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.220
 country far from it 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.829
 so still the plastic killer 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.209
 we need to do something with them 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:28.420
 otherwise it will be too late 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.030
 one simple solution in all 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.700
 civilized countries already use it 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.519
 in practice plastic bags 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.560
 replaced by eco bags creates them from 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.780
 natural or synthetic materials 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.190
 which are harmless to our planet and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.650
 decompose easily 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.359
 see how comfortable they are and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.959
 are beautiful 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:55.540
 any design to your taste any color 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.780
 stylishly fashionable and environmentally safe 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.870
 they weigh only 40 50 grams and are capable 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.120
 withstand a load of up to 20 kilograms 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.489
 reuse because they are easy 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.590
 are erased and serve more than a year except 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.359
 addition they can be folded in any bag 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.579
 a purse or even a pocket 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.980
 You can buy eco-bags in many 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.870
 stores and contribute salvation 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.910
 of our planet 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.549
 for example you can buy eco bag 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.489
 we cooperate with the organization 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.430
 WWF and part 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:34.349
 your funds will go to their background 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.349
 save the planet with eco bag.
