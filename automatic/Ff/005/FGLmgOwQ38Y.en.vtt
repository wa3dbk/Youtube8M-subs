00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
at 4 inches from the ground so it's got

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.620

so I can introduce three wheeler visual
also<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:35.800> well<00:03:36.670> it's<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.030> good<00:03:37.210> marketing<00:03:37.630> for

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
also so well it's a good marketing for

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.330 
also so well it's a good marketing for
us<00:03:37.930> because<00:03:38.140> we're<00:03:38.440> not<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.620> multi-million

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
us because we're not a multi-million

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.940 
us because we're not a multi-million
dollar<00:03:39.550> company<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.810> who<00:03:41.320> created<00:03:41.560> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
dollar company that who created the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.980 
dollar company that who created the
first<00:03:42.190> three<00:03:42.430> wheeler<00:03:42.760> two<00:03:43.540> wheels<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.960> the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
first three wheeler two wheels in the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.960 
first three wheeler two wheels in the
front<00:03:44.080> one<00:03:44.620> in<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.830> back<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:45.280> think<00:03:45.520> that's<00:03:45.760> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
front one in the back I think that's the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.780 
front one in the back I think that's the
way<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.180> should<00:03:46.240> be<00:03:46.570> for<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.290> handling<00:03:47.680> on<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
way it should be for the handling on the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.150 
way it should be for the handling on the
room<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.240> big<00:03:49.390> tire<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.870> back<00:03:49.990> helps<00:03:50.890> to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
room the big tire in the back helps to

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.380 
room the big tire in the back helps to
give<00:03:51.550> you<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.940> ambling<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:53.230> everything<00:03:53.650> was

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
give you the ambling so everything was

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.430
