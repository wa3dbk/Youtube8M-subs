00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.870
 and hey guys, he's more of a video 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.669
 then doing in Portuguese 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.829
 just to be able to discuss some things 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.219
 about an attempt 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.219
 nor did I have to change any 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.599
 Added guitar 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.759
 if we go here 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.220
 Toni two come out my still voice is listening there 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.920
 and here in the tournament an attempt that I made for her just like that, right? 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.330
 in my band at the shows when you have been doing eliéser 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.870
 usually require some songs that I play guitar 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.100
 at least with the guitar sound 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 that people would end up 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 the oversight iets are from the simulation 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.340
 in the present you do not have 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 we have to try to improvise, right? 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 good is a scavenger day but I think 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.700
 mixing sand mix people will get one thing at least accept 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.470
 So I tell you that everything is ready. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 I earned little to summarize from here. 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.140
 in fact with the attractions that I did nothing I increased new name 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.759
 present at the maximum and I have found that this process is 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 but closed 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.710
 leave the Italian club only three times to start 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.260
 on the next appearance of guitar 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.030
 to complete enough to put this scam plus equalizer 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.240
 in which 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 here again I did not cut the middle 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.670
 for power 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.450
 if you close the sound so that it can only be compared without the pedal remaining 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 way to area 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.379
 in grand 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 well the idea more or less this 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.839
 I left here too. 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.329
 prepared 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.809
 in Belem 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.729
 What is that in the case of land 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 a treat of palmela 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.439
 I could play some games like that. 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.049
 very interesting 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 and unprepared also a colossus 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.339
 this house people 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.280
 wanted to try 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.289
 there one 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.789
 12-string late simulation is also an option 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.459
 is it that, in the case of the Germans, 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.459
 has the sound pulled a little grumpy, right? 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.399
 with pickups hh 7 7 7 missed 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.399
 and I have to use the taster 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.009
 only what one can see the difference quintão arms 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.999
 - there is medium position that legal work if the bridge is 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.859
 So you know how to enjoy the sound more here. 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.239
 another very important thing here obviously equalization 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.830
 The case when I did this equalization I did is 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.180
 in the test the pedal was not on the day postão 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.009
 but anyway 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.879
 Here it is right - 12/8 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.199
 - 3 3 and here on the cerri side 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.039
 6 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.169
 two scored and new contracts 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.169
 what did this team play? 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.169
 present to the director 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:04.459
 she rings 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.449
 it's ours 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.499
 a thick cloud of radiation organizer 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.499
 I'm going to take it down the road. 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.990
 emphasize baptizing that I think it gives you the power to add here as you see 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.759
 in our acute peak 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.759
 on a very interesting team I think 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.210
 by the way 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.580
 besides that only that revealed in portugal 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:58.119
 nothing that arises from nascar 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.409
 I have not really seen you more than 1100 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.529
 she was 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:23.930
 big hug 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.650
 see you next time
