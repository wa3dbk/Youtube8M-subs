heavier you are the more calories your
body<00:01:46.619> burns<00:01:46.829> when<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.570> same

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
body burns when you do the same

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.359 
body burns when you do the same
activities<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> guy<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.040> weighs<00:01:50.250> less

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
activities that a guy that weighs less

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.210 
activities that a guy that weighs less
than<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.180> does<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.920> me<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
than you actually does so me and you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.469 
than you actually does so me and you
will<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.579> example<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:53.939> both<00:01:54.119> find<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
will for example if we both find the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
will for example if we both find the
same<00:01:54.689> distance<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.320> same<00:01:55.590> polls<00:01:55.829> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
same distance at a the same polls you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.539 
same distance at a the same polls you
will<00:01:56.130> burn<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.340> lot<00:01:56.520> more<00:01:56.579> calories<00:01:56.729> than

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
will burn a lot more calories than

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.069 
will burn a lot more calories than
because<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:59.170> know<00:01:59.259> your<00:01:59.679> body<00:01:59.829> you're<00:02:00.640> bigger

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
