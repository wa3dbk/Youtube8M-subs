 Mecca of Contemporary Art New York Museum of Contemporary Art 2 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:40.250
 In 1997, a young Asian artist surprised three arts. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.250
 17 years ago, the main character of the destruction gets a quilt . 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.310
 A large-scale believer in a world-class installation artist's blanket unveiled at the Seoul Museum of the National Museum of Contemporary Art 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.720
 Your work, which produces an overwhelming scale and intense energy that can not be tolerated

 Length 33m Height 7m Schematic representation of Taean in the second part of the exhibition space 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:28.360
 It's been a long time since I started to look at my 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:32.200
 Because it is the series prepared in the context of the grand narrative, 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.819
 The artist has dreamed of a large-scale project 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.409
 So now that it's heard already or something like sketch 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:42.159
 If it had remained, it would continue to be unbroken now , 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.630
 now 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.630
 You can say that it's amplified and is now a debt. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:59.320
 It features all the meaning of the prestigious 05 body should nore the wall 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.060
 Any of Phil 's devotion to human beings, 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.079
 I can say it's a story. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:11.800
 It is thought that the end element which is inherent in all of our culture 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:18.080
 By expressing it, the writer is in his own age 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:23.990
 The problem posed remarks came to show these things 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 Another work is the Renaissance philosopher Thomas Campanella Gabriel Utopia 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:34.170
 Inspired by the city of sun 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.780
 But still the artist we deviate from Meghan Sims 2 buy No. 2 Well 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 I can not. 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.300
 In addition to the nine criteria under the belly when expressed 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.920
 Reversed 2 other restored fabrication 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.880
 Such things 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.910
 I did not envision at the beginning 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.910
 Give me an interesting result. You called me so much. 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:10.590
 That product is also visually haejusigo loosen its followers yet 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:15.700
 That it will deliver some other elements that are much stronger to the audience's score 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:22.480
 That's what I thought . 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:27.670
 From the 1980s on the second minute, he built a world-class meditation on the work of the structure 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.189
 However, more work by a medium-sized writer who has built his own world maintains sustainability. 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.060
 Uneasy 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:38.650
 In spite of being a writer who continues to work in Korea now 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.629
 Through a certain capacity of work, I was in 5 locations worldwide . 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:48.069
 If so, continue to write it , or keep some other development 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:52.120
 Through our infrastructure, we can play a role 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:56.859
 I think that it should be possible through the infrastructure. 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:01.290
 In the role that hospitalized us that National Smell Hyundai car series 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:05.160
 And I think the role should be control 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.110
 The words that the artist tells the audience are simple. 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.280
 Do not do this , but experience it. 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:18.290
 The city is made up of countless pieces of glass fragments and reflections. 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:24.350
 Beyond the intention of the artist, interpretation is the responsibility of the audience. 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.250
 The authors themselves are also surprised by the fact that they are still in fact . 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.030
 Or 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:35.870
 Now, how much work can be enriched by chance ? 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:40.690
 The reason why modern art exists 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.690
 I met in the city ​​of sun and sing at dawn 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:46.239
 It d like hut Excellent 8
