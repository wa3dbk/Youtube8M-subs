00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.680 

that<00:01:22.710> only<00:01:22.920> does<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.280> look<00:01:23.640> very<00:01:23.910> good<00:01:24.240> also

wearing<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.570> polish<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.200> other<00:01:28.440> nails

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
wearing this polish on my other nails

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890 
wearing this polish on my other nails
since<00:01:29.070> Saturday<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.940> still<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> don't<00:01:30.570> have

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
since Saturday and still I don't have

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.040 
since Saturday and still I don't have
any<00:01:31.140> tape<00:01:31.680> wear<00:01:31.980> on<00:01:32.190> my<00:01:32.370> nails<00:01:32.670> when<00:01:33.660> first

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
any tape wear on my nails when first

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.410 
any tape wear on my nails when first
coat<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.410> dry<00:01:34.830> apply<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.430> second<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
coat is dry apply the second one and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:51.450 
coat is dry apply the second one and
then<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.200> done

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.670 

so<00:01:52.240> overall<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.750> do<00:01:52.810> think<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.260> polish<00:01:53.560> is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
so overall I do think the polish is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.470 
so overall I do think the polish is
worth<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.100> money<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.940> finish<00:01:55.300> is<00:01:55.450> really

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
worth the money the finish is really

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.870 
worth the money the finish is really
unique<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.620> top<00:01:56.800> code<00:01:57.010> works<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.610> well

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
unique and the top code works so well

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.970 
unique and the top code works so well
that<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.210> don't<00:01:58.390> regret<00:01:58.690> buying<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.410> so<00:01:59.770> there's

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
that I don't regret buying it so there's

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.220 
that I don't regret buying it so there's
a<00:02:00.070> new<00:02:00.190> tutorial<00:02:00.670> coming<00:02:00.880> up<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.570> weekend<00:02:02.020> so
