00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.570 
going to start on the right side of the
patch<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.740> score<00:00:16.980> right<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.369> zero

patch so the score right now is zero

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.580 
patch so the score right now is zero
zero<00:00:17.850> or<00:00:18.060> whenever<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> score<00:00:18.930> adds<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.439> to

have<00:01:11.380> won<00:01:11.590> that<00:01:11.770> point<00:01:12.009> so<00:01:12.340> now<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:13.090> will

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
have won that point so now this will

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.890 
have won that point so now this will
would<00:01:13.450> be<00:01:13.479> one<00:01:14.080> zero<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.400> since<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.330> store<00:01:16.690> is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
would be one zero so since that store is

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.749 
would be one zero so since that store is
odd<00:01:17.200> we're<00:01:17.740> gonna<00:01:17.890> play<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.310> left<00:01:18.460> side

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
odd we're gonna play on the left side

now like I told you earlier we call zero

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.010 
now like I told you earlier we call zero
we<00:01:21.580> call<00:01:21.729> one<00:01:22.000> something<00:01:22.479> difference<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:22.960> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
we call one something difference in the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.160 
we call one something difference in the
score<00:01:23.320> is<00:01:23.710> actually<00:01:24.270> 15<00:01:25.270> love

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.190 

okay<00:03:03.620> now<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.160> would<00:03:04.490> be<00:03:04.520> game<00:03:04.850> but<00:03:05.240> just<00:03:05.990> for

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
okay now that would be game but just for

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.020 
okay now that would be game but just for
fun<00:03:06.230> we're<00:03:06.650> gonna<00:03:06.800> pretend<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.310> chelsea<00:03:07.820> won

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
fun we're gonna pretend that chelsea won

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.720 
fun we're gonna pretend that chelsea won
that<00:03:08.330> point<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:09.650> she<00:03:09.890> had<00:03:10.010> won<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.400> point

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
that point so if she had won that point

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.540 
that point so if she had won that point
it<00:03:11.210> would<00:03:11.510> be<00:03:11.570> three<00:03:12.200> points<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.890> three<00:03:13.160> points

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
it would be three points to three points

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.520 
it would be three points to three points
making<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.940> an<00:03:14.180> even<00:03:14.720> score<00:03:14.990> sube<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.410> the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
making it an even score sube on the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
it gets to forty forty it becomes

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.090

get<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.730> do<00:04:36.910> so<00:04:37.180> right<00:04:37.360> now<00:04:37.510> we're<00:04:37.690> at<00:04:37.750> deuce<00:04:37.960> if

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
get to do so right now we're at deuce if

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.380 
get to do so right now we're at deuce if
I<00:04:38.530> win<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.830> next<00:04:38.950> two<00:04:39.190> points<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.670> win<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.240> game

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
I win the next two points I win the game

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.860 
I win the next two points I win the game
but<00:04:41.100> since<00:04:42.100> she<00:04:42.370> beat<00:04:42.670> me<00:04:42.700> at<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:43.690> goes

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
but since she beat me at that in it goes

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.990 
but since she beat me at that in it goes
backwards<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.710> deuce<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.640> might<00:04:45.910> need

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
backwards to deuce so I might need

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:58.710 
backwards to deuce so I might need
another<00:04:46.090> ball<00:04:46.510> here<00:04:46.690> deuce<00:04:57.360> okay<00:04:58.360> now<00:04:58.510> since

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
another ball here deuce okay now since

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.780

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
chelsea won that point from deuce

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.270 
chelsea won that point from deuce

so<00:05:34.690> me<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:34.990> Chelsea<00:05:35.320> would<00:05:35.440> switch<00:05:35.680> sides<00:05:35.980> and

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340
