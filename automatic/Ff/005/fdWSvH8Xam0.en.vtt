00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
immediately and uh dado actually copies

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.070 
immediately and uh dado actually copies
the<00:03:47.960> stat<00:03:48.200> boost<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.710> the<00:03:49.040> Pokemon<00:03:49.460> it<00:03:49.550> copies

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
the stat boost of the Pokemon it copies

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.770 
the stat boost of the Pokemon it copies
so<00:03:51.080> I'm<00:03:52.010> very<00:03:52.240> surprised<00:03:53.240> that<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.540> didn't

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
so I'm very surprised that it didn't

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.840 
so I'm very surprised that it didn't
take<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.080> out<00:03:54.290> because<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.860> did<00:03:55.459> have<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.610> nasty

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
planet but since he has a life form and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.490 
planet but since he has a life form and
the<00:03:59.000> nasty<00:03:59.330> plot<00:03:59.510> up<00:03:59.690> he's<00:03:59.930> actually<00:04:00.110> gonna<00:04:00.320> be

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the nasty plot up he's actually gonna be

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.320 
the nasty plot up he's actually gonna be
able<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.709> take<00:04:00.860> me<00:04:00.890> out<00:04:01.070> but<00:04:01.730> he<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.910> gonna<00:04:02.120> back

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
his dragon pulse like a weirdo I don't

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.430 
his dragon pulse like a weirdo I don't
understand<00:04:19.340> why<00:04:19.660> shadow<00:04:20.660> ball<00:04:20.840> or<00:04:21.140> sphere<00:04:21.260> is

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
understand why shadow ball or sphere is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.400 
understand why shadow ball or sphere is
perfect<00:04:21.829> type<00:04:21.980> coverage<00:04:22.900> but<00:04:23.900> yeah<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.080> go<00:04:24.260> for

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
perfect type coverage but yeah I go for

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.570 
perfect type coverage but yeah I go for
the<00:04:24.440> boiling<00:04:24.770> water<00:04:24.800> doesn't<00:04:25.220> do<00:04:25.370> that<00:04:25.520> much

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
the boiling water doesn't do that much

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.320 
the boiling water doesn't do that much
just<00:04:26.270> for<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.480> dragon<00:04:26.780> pulse<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:28.090> I'm<00:04:29.090> pretty

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
just for the dragon pulse and I'm pretty

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.790 
just for the dragon pulse and I'm pretty
sure<00:04:29.419> this<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.720> my<00:04:29.960> Bold<00:04:31.570> boring<00:04:32.570> guru<00:04:32.810> which

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
sure this is my Bold boring guru which

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.320 
sure this is my Bold boring guru which
is<00:04:33.919> why<00:04:34.130> that<00:04:34.340> Jagan<00:04:34.610> post<00:04:34.760> actually<00:04:35.090> did<00:04:35.300> that

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
is why that Jagan post actually did that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.890 
is why that Jagan post actually did that
much<00:04:35.750> but<00:04:36.740> uh<00:04:37.330> yeah<00:04:38.330> I'm<00:04:38.419> gonna<00:04:38.540> be<00:04:38.630> able<00:04:38.780> to

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
much but uh yeah I'm gonna be able to

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.300 
much but uh yeah I'm gonna be able to
take<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.110> out<00:04:39.290> with<00:04:39.410> another<00:04:39.590> boiling<00:04:40.130> water

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
take it out with another boiling water

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.150 
take it out with another boiling water
so<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.180> think<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.690> calm<00:04:42.140> button<00:04:42.800> gary<00:04:43.010> was

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
so I think a calm button gary was

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.800 
so I think a calm button gary was
actually<00:04:43.520> more<00:04:43.669> useful<00:04:44.000> than<00:04:44.030> bold<00:04:44.360> in<00:04:44.570> some

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
actually more useful than bold in some

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.440 
actually more useful than bold in some
situations<00:04:45.350> most<00:04:45.650> situations<00:04:45.830> actually<00:04:46.580> but

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
situations most situations actually but

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.800 
situations most situations actually but
yeah<00:04:47.630> he's<00:04:47.930> gonna<00:04:48.020> send<00:04:48.260> out<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.410> freaking<00:04:48.800> uh

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
yeah he's gonna send out a freaking uh
