the<00:00:33.870> table<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.700> many<00:00:35.910> options

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the table here not really many options

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.740 
the table here not really many options
here<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.530> shoot<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> combo

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

there got the nine here and possibly the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.700 
there got the nine here and possibly the
13<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.989> nine<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.379> obviously<00:00:46.710> closer<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.120> i

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
13 the nine is obviously closer so i

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.330 
13 the nine is obviously closer so i
could<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.309> nine<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:52.039> just<00:00:53.039> kind<00:00:53.250> of
