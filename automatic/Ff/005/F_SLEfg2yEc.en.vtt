00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.890 
years ago we made an aluminum frame
arrow<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.269> was<00:03:53.390> way<00:03:53.600> ahead<00:03:53.750> of

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
arrow and but it was way ahead of

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.140 
arrow and but it was way ahead of
everyone<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:55.040> world<00:03:55.250> wasn't<00:03:55.549> ready<00:03:55.790> for<00:03:55.940> it

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
everyone the world wasn't ready for it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.800 
everyone the world wasn't ready for it
yet<00:03:56.360> but<00:03:57.200> then<00:03:57.380> actually<00:03:57.829> working<00:03:58.070> with

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
yet but then actually working with

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.100 
yet but then actually working with
slipstream<00:03:59.810> we<00:04:00.650> created<00:04:01.280> for<00:04:01.640> them<00:04:02.480> an<00:04:02.750> aero

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
slipstream we created for them an aero

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.259 
slipstream we created for them an aero
road<00:04:03.440> bike<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.980> because<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:04.820> their<00:04:05.030> feedback

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
road bike and because of their feedback

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.949 
road bike and because of their feedback
and<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:06.139> this<00:04:06.350> AR<00:04:06.919> is<00:04:07.459> second<00:04:07.910> generation<00:04:07.959> its

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
and so this AR is second generation its

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.050 
and so this AR is second generation its
second<00:04:09.350> generation<00:04:09.380> actually<00:04:10.220> third

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
second generation actually third

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.710 
second generation actually third
when<00:04:11.270> you<00:04:11.360> do<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.720> aluminum<00:04:12.140> bike<00:04:12.320> but<00:04:13.070> it<00:04:13.220> is

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
when you do the aluminum bike but it is

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.560 
when you do the aluminum bike but it is
150<00:04:14.720> grams<00:04:14.960> lighter<00:04:15.260> it's<00:04:16.100> 40%<00:04:16.579> stiffer<00:04:17.239> and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
150 grams lighter it's 40% stiffer and

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.050 
150 grams lighter it's 40% stiffer and
it's<00:04:18.170> 30%<00:04:18.829> faster<00:04:19.040> than<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:20.239> old<00:04:20.390> day<00:04:20.570> arm<00:04:20.810> so

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
it's 30% faster than the old day arm so

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.360 
it's 30% faster than the old day arm so
quite<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.450> lot<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.840> fun<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.410> ride<00:04:24.440> right<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:24.980> lot

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
quite a lot of fun to ride right a lot

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.390 
quite a lot of fun to ride right a lot
of<00:04:25.430> fun<00:04:25.730> to<00:04:25.850> ride<00:04:25.880> it's<00:04:26.690> also<00:04:27.250> comfortable<00:04:28.250> a

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
of fun to ride it's also comfortable a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.740 
of fun to ride it's also comfortable a
lot<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.700> aero<00:04:28.910> frames<00:04:29.270> aren't<00:04:29.480> comfortable

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
lot of aero frames aren't comfortable

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.320 
lot of aero frames aren't comfortable
but<00:04:30.500> we<00:04:30.650> work<00:04:30.860> magic<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.670> lay<00:04:31.820> up<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.180> the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
but we work magic in the lay up and the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.690 
but we work magic in the lay up and the
seat<00:04:32.540> post<00:04:32.750> design<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.800> actually<00:04:34.250> allows<00:04:34.670> a

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
seat post design that actually allows a

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.550 
seat post design that actually allows a
narrow<00:04:35.270> frame<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.780> be<00:04:35.870> comfort<00:04:36.290> because

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
narrow frame to be comfort because

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.240 
narrow frame to be comfort because
normally<00:04:37.070> they<00:04:37.190> beat<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.520> up<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:40.010> proof

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
normally they beat you up but the proof

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.520 
normally they beat you up but the proof
is<00:04:40.430> in<00:04:40.580> writing<00:04:40.820> so<00:04:41.420> I<00:04:41.450> challenge<00:04:41.960> everyone<00:04:42.170> go

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
is in writing so I challenge everyone go

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.790 
is in writing so I challenge everyone go
to<00:04:42.590> your<00:04:42.710> felt<00:04:43.040> shop<00:04:43.340> ride<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.680> ride<00:04:45.680> and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
to your felt shop ride it and ride and

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.730 
to your felt shop ride it and ride and
believe<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.250> we<00:04:46.280> do<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:47.900> will<00:04:48.140> thank<00:04:48.620> you
