all just to kind of show you the
fluorescent<00:00:15.089> lighting<00:00:15.240> that's<00:00:15.420> open<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
fluorescent lighting that's open the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.720 
fluorescent lighting that's open the
ceiling<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.740> basically<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.310> or<00:00:17.460> nothing

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
ceiling it's basically all or nothing

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.040 
ceiling it's basically all or nothing
they<00:00:17.820> don't<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.119> any<00:00:18.270> incandescent<00:00:18.750> so

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
they don't have any incandescent so

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.029 
they don't have any incandescent so
there's<00:00:19.199> nothing<00:00:19.350> that's<00:00:19.619> dimmable<00:00:19.920> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
there's nothing that's dimmable and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.830 
there's nothing that's dimmable and
they're<00:00:20.220> fluorescents<00:00:20.730> aren't<00:00:20.910> dimmable<00:00:21.150> so

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
they're fluorescents aren't dimmable so

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.420 
they're fluorescents aren't dimmable so
we're<00:00:22.260> gonna<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.740> battling<00:00:23.279> with

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
we're gonna have a little battling with

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.519 
we're gonna have a little battling with
some<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> our<00:00:23.760> lighting<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.380> could

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
some of our lighting you know we could

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.200 
some of our lighting you know we could
have<00:00:25.619> brought<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.920> some<00:00:25.949> floods<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.789> realize

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
have brought in some floods we realize

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.509 
have brought in some floods we realize
that<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.619> fluorescents<00:00:28.619> guess<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.400> should

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that it was fluorescents guess we should

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
that it was fluorescents guess we should
have<00:00:29.640> done<00:00:30.000> our<00:00:30.090> homework<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.590> were

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
have done our homework on that but were

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
have done our homework on that but were
three<00:00:31.920> hours<00:00:32.130> away<00:00:32.340> from<00:00:32.369> home<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.969> can't

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
three hours away from home so we can't

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.610 
three hours away from home so we can't
change<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> now<00:00:33.630> anyways

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
change it now anyways

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.229 
change it now anyways
so<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.640> lighting<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so the the lighting that we're going to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.910

again this is what we're working with
and<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.290> what<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.470> needs<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.860> like

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
and this is what it needs to be like

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.100 
and this is what it needs to be like
during<00:01:41.280> dinner<00:01:41.550> because<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.570> fluorescence

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
during dinner because the fluorescence

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.070 
during dinner because the fluorescence
basically<00:01:43.620> this<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.070> low<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.400> they<00:01:44.550> go<00:01:45.080> but

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
basically this is as low as they go but

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.390 
basically this is as low as they go but
when<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.290> add<00:01:46.410> some<00:01:46.620> accent<00:01:46.980> lighting<00:01:47.160> it's

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
when we add some accent lighting it's

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.800 
when we add some accent lighting it's
gonna<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.730> freshen<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.630> room<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
gonna really freshen up the room a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
gonna really freshen up the room a
little<00:01:48.900> bit<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> pop<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> walls<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
little bit and pop the walls and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
little bit and pop the walls and
hopefully<00:01:51.300> take<00:01:51.479> some<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.650> that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hopefully take some of that some of that

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.730 
hopefully take some of that some of that
lighting<00:01:53.010> away<00:01:53.250> from<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.150> ceiling<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.440> then

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
lighting away from the ceiling and then

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.160 
lighting away from the ceiling and then
yeah<00:01:56.640> once<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> dance<00:01:57.390> starts<00:01:57.720> all<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
yeah once the dance starts all the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.450 
yeah once the dance starts all the
fluorescence<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:58.860> go<00:01:58.950> off

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
fluorescence will go off

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.800 
fluorescence will go off
we'll<00:01:59.790> really<00:01:59.910> add<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.270> cool<00:02:00.450> accent

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
we'll really add some cool accent

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
we'll really add some cool accent
throughout<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> room<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.470> well<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.979> we'll

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
throughout the room as well so we'll

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
throughout the room as well so we'll
keep<00:02:03.120> you<00:02:03.240> posted<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.990> we'll<00:02:04.290> show<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:04.500> once

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
keep you posted and we'll show you once

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.280 
keep you posted and we'll show you once
we<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.220> all<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> lighting<00:02:05.910> up<00:02:06.150> okay<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.050> one

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
we get all the lighting up okay so one

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.330 
we get all the lighting up okay so one
of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.440> things<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.800> talked<00:02:08.040> about<00:02:08.160> was

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
of the things that we talked about was

what we did is we actually used the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
what we did is we actually used the
swing<00:02:13.560> beam<00:02:13.770> quad<00:02:14.220> IRC<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.120> takes<00:02:15.300> an<00:02:15.390> IRC

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
swing beam quad IRC it takes an IRC

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.110 
swing beam quad IRC it takes an IRC
remote<00:02:16.080> really<00:02:16.500> simple<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> use<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.970> show

treyton come on in here for a second and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.810 
treyton come on in here for a second and
show<00:02:30.750> everybody<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.080> remote<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.670> all

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
show everybody the remote so this is all

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.400 
show everybody the remote so this is all

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
it is it's the regular remote that you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.380 
it is it's the regular remote that you
have<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.800> all<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.160> your<00:02:35.280> Chauvet<00:02:35.580> DJ<00:02:35.940> fixtures

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
treating I want you to turn it to red

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.770 
treating I want you to turn it to red
for<00:02:42.360> me<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.739> fixture<00:02:47.130> becomes<00:02:47.400> red

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
for me so now the fixture becomes red

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.210 
for me so now the fixture becomes red
again<00:02:48.780> all<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> colors<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.530> are<00:02:49.650> preset<00:02:50.070> in

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
again all the colors that are preset in

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.530 
again all the colors that are preset in
there<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.549> actually<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:50.880> color<00:02:51.150> fixing

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
there you can actually do color fixing

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.150 
there you can actually do color fixing
as<00:02:51.660> well<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.380> got<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.620> do<00:02:52.709> some<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.010> color

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
as well we got to do some of the color

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.250 
as well we got to do some of the color
mixing<00:02:53.549> on<00:02:53.700> with<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.090> fixture<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.810> again<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
mixing on with this fixture and again it

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.220 
mixing on with this fixture and again it
allows<00:02:55.350> really<00:02:55.890> simple<00:02:56.370> use<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:57.390> anybody<00:02:58.080> at

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
any level and what we did go and turn it

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.720 
any level and what we did go and turn it
back<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.260> paint<00:03:01.440> for<00:03:01.650> me<00:03:01.830> number<00:03:02.430> eight

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
was going to work and I didn't

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.660 
was going to work and I didn't
do<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.079> normal<00:03:37.349> uplighting<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:38.220> want<00:03:38.579> to

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.119 
create some really cool accents I want
to<00:03:40.019> do<00:03:40.110> something<00:03:40.379> special<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.920> couple

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
to do something special for this couple

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.569 
to do something special for this couple
so<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:42.030> did<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.269> would<00:03:42.480> be<00:03:42.599> my<00:03:42.750> RCS<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.579> what

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
so we did this would be my RCS and what

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.940 
so we did this would be my RCS and what
we<00:03:44.700> did<00:03:44.879> is<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.030> actually<00:03:45.409> made<00:03:46.409> it<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.769> this

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
we did is we actually made it so this

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.850 
we did is we actually made it so this
Center<00:03:47.340> beam<00:03:48.079> comes<00:03:49.079> right<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> edge<00:03:49.739> of

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
Center beam comes right to the edge of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.069 
Center beam comes right to the edge of
here<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.430> right<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.849> edge<00:03:50.939> of<00:03:51.090> here<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.959> it

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
here and right to the edge of here so it

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.780 
here and right to the edge of here so it
frames<00:03:52.409> it<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.709> basically<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.579> kind<00:03:53.730> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
frames it in basically and it kind of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.420 
frames it in basically and it kind of
creates<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:54.090> cool<00:03:54.269> top<00:03:54.959> for<00:03:55.260> us<00:03:55.379> so<00:03:55.950> creates<00:03:56.400> a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
creates a cool top for us so creates a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.039 
creates a cool top for us so creates a
beautiful<00:03:56.819> pattern<00:03:57.000> there<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.510> nice<00:03:57.780> tight

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
beautiful pattern there a nice tight

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.160 
beautiful pattern there a nice tight
beam<00:03:58.260> there<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.739> does<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> beautiful<00:03:59.549> job<00:04:00.170> now

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
beam there and does a beautiful job now

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.780 
beam there and does a beautiful job now

allows<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.990> widen<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.380> beam<00:04:46.530> or<00:04:46.710> tighten

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
allows you to widen the beam or tighten

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.320 
allows you to widen the beam or tighten
the<00:04:47.010> beam<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.370> what<00:04:47.520> we<00:04:47.610> did<00:04:47.729> is<00:04:47.849> we<00:04:47.880> tightened

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
the beam so what we did is we tightened

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.879 
the beam so what we did is we tightened
it<00:04:48.389> a<00:04:48.449> suit<00:04:48.690> as<00:04:48.870> close<00:04:49.110> as<00:04:49.260> we<00:04:49.380> could<00:04:49.620> the

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
it a suit as close as we could the

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.719 
it a suit as close as we could the
actual<00:04:50.729> fixture<00:04:51.120> itself<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:51.780> as<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.110> can<00:04:52.229> see

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
actual fixture itself so as you can see

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.810 
actual fixture itself so as you can see
right<00:04:53.729> here<00:04:54.949> basically<00:04:55.949> it<00:04:56.039> hits<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.550> light

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
right here basically it hits that light

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.939 
right here basically it hits that light
and<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.810> edges<00:04:58.139> of<00:04:58.289> that<00:04:58.409> light<00:04:58.590> actually

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
and the edges of that light actually

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.680 
and the edges of that light actually
goes<00:04:59.099> to<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.400> edge<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.789> the<00:05:00.000> actual<00:05:00.330> fixture

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
goes to the edge of the actual fixture

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.230 
goes to the edge of the actual fixture
so<00:05:00.949> again<00:05:01.949> a<00:05:01.979> really<00:05:02.250> cool<00:05:02.430> effect<00:05:02.550> made<00:05:03.210> a

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
so again a really cool effect made a

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.960 
so again a really cool effect made a
beautiful<00:05:03.479> beautiful<00:05:04.229> wall<00:05:04.650> for<00:05:04.889> us<00:05:04.919> and<00:05:05.280> you

that's<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.080> other<00:05:10.199> side<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.919> then<00:05:11.460> what<00:05:11.580> we

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
that's the other side and then what we

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.689 
that's the other side and then what we
did<00:05:11.940> with<00:05:12.440> what<00:05:13.440> we<00:05:13.560> did<00:05:13.680> with<00:05:13.830> all<00:05:13.979> this<00:05:14.310> is

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.610 
did with what we did with all this is
there's<00:05:15.120> actually<00:05:15.270> just<00:05:15.659> a<00:05:15.750> really<00:05:16.380> small

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
there's actually just a really small

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.100 
there's actually just a really small

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
hint of change in pink so it gets a

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.230 
hint of change in pink so it gets a
little<00:05:19.169> bit<00:05:19.349> pink<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:20.460> little<00:05:20.789> bit<00:05:21.000> more
