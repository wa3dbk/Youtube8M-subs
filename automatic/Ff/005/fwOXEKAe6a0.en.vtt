rooms and i'm going to explain why we

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.849 
rooms and i'm going to explain why we
have<00:00:58.160> all<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.850> these<00:00:58.940> such<00:00:59.469> thanks<00:01:00.469> for

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
have all of these such thanks for

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:26.140 
have all of these such thanks for
watching<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.399> enjoy<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.789> ship

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150 

so<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.870> got<00:01:28.020> our<00:01:28.110> soccer<00:01:28.350> tuned<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.770> finally

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
so we got our soccer tuned up finally

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.470 
so we got our soccer tuned up finally
and<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.430> working<00:01:29.730> pretty<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
and it was working pretty well this is a

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.120 
and it was working pretty well this is a
little<00:01:30.690> bit<00:01:30.810> difficult<00:01:30.990> water<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.650> shock<00:01:31.890> in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
little bit difficult water to shock in

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.730 
little bit difficult water to shock in
because<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.730> highly<00:01:33.120> conductive<00:01:33.870> and<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because it's highly conductive and the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130 
because it's highly conductive and the
electrical<00:01:35.460> field<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.910> get<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.420> intense

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
electrical field you get is very intense

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.720 
electrical field you get is very intense
but<00:01:37.410> not<00:01:37.560> very<00:01:37.740> big<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> kind<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
but not very big so you have to kind of

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.660 
but not very big so you have to kind of
sneak<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.600> fish<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:40.620> get<00:01:40.800> them<00:01:41.040> knocked

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
sneak up on the fish to get them knocked

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.550 
sneak up on the fish to get them knocked
out<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.360> nut<00:01:42.510> them<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.410> found

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
out so you can nut them and we found

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.870 
out so you can nut them and we found
that<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> shocker<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.370> worked<00:01:44.580> much<00:01:44.850> better

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that the shocker here worked much better

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
that the shocker here worked much better
along<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.870> edges<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.680> shallow<00:01:46.950> water<00:01:47.340> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
along the edges and in shallow water so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.710 
along the edges and in shallow water so
we<00:01:47.580> could<00:01:47.730> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.910> trap<00:01:48.120> the<00:01:48.270> fish<00:01:48.450> against

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
we could kind of trap the fish against

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.470 
we could kind of trap the fish against
the<00:01:48.840> edges<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:49.410> shock<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.520> let<00:01:50.820> them<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
the edges and shock them and let them so

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.700 
the edges and shock them and let them so
we're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.750> show<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> fish

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
we're going to show you some of the fish

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.190 
we're going to show you some of the fish
that<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.040> caught<00:01:53.700> Jessica<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.390> pull<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.110> out

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that we caught Jessica can pull them out

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200 
that we caught Jessica can pull them out
here<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.500> we'll<00:01:56.100> show<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.370> some<00:01:56.520> examples<00:01:57.030> of

spotted<00:03:44.120> bass<00:03:44.390> or<00:03:44.690> Guadalupe<00:03:45.440> bass<00:03:45.650> like<00:03:46.040> but

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
spotted bass or Guadalupe bass like but

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.550 
spotted bass or Guadalupe bass like but
it's<00:03:47.090> common<00:03:47.540> throughout<00:03:47.780> Texas<00:03:48.319> that<00:03:48.470> you

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
it's common throughout Texas that you

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.589 
it's common throughout Texas that you
get<00:03:48.709> hybrids<00:03:49.220> between<00:03:49.610> some<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.120> basses

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
get hybrids between some of the basses

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.630 
get hybrids between some of the basses
so<00:03:51.470> we'll<00:03:51.590> take<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.920> sample<00:03:52.310> back<00:03:52.459> and

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
so we'll take the sample back and

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.039 
so we'll take the sample back and
analyze<00:03:52.940> them<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.209> lab<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.629> probably

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
analyze them in the lab and probably

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.369 
analyze them in the lab and probably
take<00:03:54.680> some<00:03:54.830> tissues<00:03:55.190> for<00:03:55.430> DNA<00:03:55.790> sequence<00:03:56.379> much

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
take some tissues for DNA sequence much

it's nice and warm out here
and<00:04:13.400> we're<00:04:13.549> sweating<00:04:13.790> like<00:04:14.030> crazy<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:14.569> the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
and we're sweating like crazy but the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.210 
and we're sweating like crazy but the
reason<00:04:14.959> we<00:04:15.049> wear<00:04:15.230> them<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.650> because<00:04:16.039> we're

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
reason we wear them is because we're

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.680 
reason we wear them is because we're
mixing<00:04:16.400> electricity<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.299> water<00:04:17.419> and

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
mixing electricity and water and

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.870 
mixing electricity and water and
everybody<00:04:18.079> learns<00:04:18.320> from<00:04:18.560> day<00:04:19.160> one<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.789> you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
everybody learns from day one that you

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.330 
everybody learns from day one that you
don't<00:04:20.150> plug<00:04:21.109> your<00:04:21.289> radio<00:04:21.560> in<00:04:21.799> while<00:04:22.039> you're<00:04:22.220> in

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
don't plug your radio in while you're in

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.460 
don't plug your radio in while you're in
the<00:04:22.430> bathtub<00:04:22.639> right<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.810> same<00:04:23.990> principle

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
the bathtub right so the same principle

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.590 
the bathtub right so the same principle
applies<00:04:24.740> water<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.699> highly<00:04:25.880> conductive<00:04:26.180> to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
applies water is highly conductive to

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.650 
applies water is highly conductive to
electricity<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:27.199> there<00:04:27.740> are<00:04:27.860> lots<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.220> safety

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
electricity so there are lots of safety

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.540 
electricity so there are lots of safety
considerations<00:04:29.660> here<00:04:29.900> if<00:04:30.110> we<00:04:30.560> were<00:04:30.710> shocking

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
considerations here if we were shocking

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.950 
considerations here if we were shocking
without<00:04:31.880> these<00:04:32.090> waders<00:04:32.360> we<00:04:32.690> would<00:04:32.840> be

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
without these waders we would be

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.870 
without these waders we would be
shocking<00:04:33.229> ourselves<00:04:33.889> as<00:04:34.010> much<00:04:34.160> as<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.520> fishes

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
shocking ourselves as much as the fishes

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.180 
shocking ourselves as much as the fishes
and<00:04:35.000> we're<00:04:35.599> putting<00:04:35.780> about<00:04:35.960> 300<00:04:36.650> volts<00:04:36.950> into

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
and we're putting about 300 volts into

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.279 
and we're putting about 300 volts into
the<00:04:37.280> water<00:04:37.490> it's<00:04:38.150> fairly<00:04:38.419> low<00:04:38.660> amperage<00:04:38.990> but

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
the water it's fairly low amperage but

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.589 
the water it's fairly low amperage but
it<00:04:39.560> definitely<00:04:40.060> I've<00:04:41.060> been<00:04:41.240> shocked<00:04:41.419> many

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
it definitely I've been shocked many

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.270 
it definitely I've been shocked many
times<00:04:41.900> by<00:04:42.080> electric<00:04:42.470> shockers<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.070> you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
times by electric shockers and you

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.680 
times by electric shockers and you
definitely<00:04:43.729> know<00:04:43.880> you're<00:04:43.910> getting<00:04:44.419> shocked

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
definitely know you're getting shocked

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.210 
definitely know you're getting shocked
and<00:04:44.990> especially<00:04:45.410> if<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:45.710> were<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.919> fall<00:04:46.190> into

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
and especially if you were to fall into

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.330 
and especially if you were to fall into
the<00:04:46.849> water<00:04:47.349> with<00:04:48.349> the<00:04:48.470> shocker<00:04:48.740> going<00:04:49.220> you

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
the water with the shocker going you

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.800 
the water with the shocker going you
would<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:49.610> your<00:04:49.729> full<00:04:49.940> body<00:04:50.150> in<00:04:50.479> the<00:04:50.599> water

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
would have your full body in the water

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.510 
would have your full body in the water
for<00:04:51.110> lots<00:04:51.289> of<00:04:51.410> surface<00:04:51.770> area<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.370> would

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
for lots of surface area and you would

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.339 
for lots of surface area and you would
get<00:04:52.669> shocked<00:04:53.330> very<00:04:53.539> very<00:04:53.810> hard<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.200> could

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
get shocked very very hard it could

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.830 
get shocked very very hard it could
potentially<00:04:55.070> could<00:04:55.789> kill<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.180> actually<00:04:56.539> so

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
potentially could kill you actually so

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.600 
potentially could kill you actually so
so<00:04:57.440> that's<00:04:57.590> why<00:04:57.740> we<00:04:57.889> wear<00:04:58.039> the<00:04:58.160> safety<00:04:58.490> gear

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
so that's why we wear the safety gear

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.310 
so that's why we wear the safety gear
the<00:04:58.729> gloves<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.180> waders<00:04:59.389> so<00:04:59.660> we<00:04:59.780> isolate

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
the gloves in the waders so we isolate

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.740 
the gloves in the waders so we isolate
ourselves<00:05:00.440> from<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.070> electricity<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:05.570> is<00:05:05.720> a

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
ourselves from the electricity this is a

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.270 
ourselves from the electricity this is a
common<00:05:06.169> piece<00:05:06.320> of<00:05:06.500> collecting<00:05:06.919> gear<00:05:07.099> that

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
common piece of collecting gear that

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.680 
common piece of collecting gear that
fisheries<00:05:07.669> biologists<00:05:08.150> use<00:05:08.210> all<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.539> time

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
fisheries biologists use all the time

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.879 
fisheries biologists use all the time
it's<00:05:08.900> called<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.169> same<00:05:09.410> they<00:05:09.650> come<00:05:09.800> in

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
it's called the same they come in

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.040 
it's called the same they come in
various<00:05:10.220> lengths<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:10.760> various<00:05:11.120> depths<00:05:11.389> but

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
various lengths and various depths but

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.659 
various lengths and various depths but
basically<00:05:12.380> it's<00:05:12.590> just<00:05:12.710> a<00:05:12.800> piece<00:05:12.979> of<00:05:13.220> mesh

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
basically it's just a piece of mesh

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.940 
basically it's just a piece of mesh
stretched<00:05:14.479> between<00:05:14.690> two<00:05:15.110> poles<00:05:15.470> that<00:05:15.620> we<00:05:15.770> call

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
stretched between two poles that we call

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.540 
stretched between two poles that we call
brailles

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
brailles

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.580 
brailles
and<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.419> there's<00:05:17.599> a<00:05:17.690> lead<00:05:17.930> line<00:05:18.169> that's<00:05:18.440> led

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
and that there's a lead line that's led

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.230 
and that there's a lead line that's led
along<00:05:18.860> this<00:05:19.010> bottom<00:05:19.340> line<00:05:19.550> that<00:05:19.849> keeps<00:05:20.000> the

bottom of the stream and floats here to
keep<00:05:24.410> this<00:05:24.650> part<00:05:24.889> we'll<00:05:25.460> pull<00:05:25.669> it

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
keep this part we'll pull it

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.330 
keep this part we'll pull it
the<00:05:26.690> water<00:05:26.900> making<00:05:27.409> a<00:05:27.470> big<00:05:27.650> bag<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:27.889> hopefully

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
the water making a big bag and hopefully

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.680 
the water making a big bag and hopefully
we<00:05:28.400> will<00:05:28.430> crop<00:05:28.669> some<00:05:28.849> fish<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.090> drag<00:05:29.389> them<00:05:29.539> up

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
we will crop some fish and drag them up

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.779 
we will crop some fish and drag them up
on<00:05:30.319> this<00:05:30.590> nice<00:05:30.800> little<00:05:31.039> beach<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.550> we<00:05:31.639> have

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
on this nice little beach that we have

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:59.110 
on this nice little beach that we have
here

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.430 

we're<00:06:00.120> dragging<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.570> to<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.720> load<00:06:00.930> line<00:06:01.110> stays

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
we're dragging it to the load line stays

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.460 
we're dragging it to the load line stays
right<00:06:01.650> on<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.920> bottom<00:06:05.480> it's<00:06:06.480> like<00:06:06.570> everything

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
right on the bottom it's like everything

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.390 
right on the bottom it's like everything
we<00:06:07.590> thought<00:06:07.800> before<00:06:09.620> we've<00:06:10.620> got<00:06:10.740> lots<00:06:11.130> of

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
we thought before we've got lots of

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.130 
we thought before we've got lots of
lipomas<00:06:11.910> all<00:06:12.090> right<00:06:12.240> us<00:06:12.390> we've<00:06:12.570> got<00:06:12.690> lots<00:06:13.020> of

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
lipomas all right us we've got lots of

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.300 
lipomas all right us we've got lots of
little<00:06:13.290> baby<00:06:13.500> bass<00:06:15.800> we<00:06:16.800> should<00:06:16.980> have<00:06:17.160> some

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
little baby bass we should have some

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.370 
little baby bass we should have some
minnows<00:06:17.580> I<00:06:17.700> guess<00:06:17.850> they<00:06:18.000> all<00:06:18.030> got<00:06:18.270> away<00:06:18.380> we

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
minnows I guess they all got away we

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.930 
minnows I guess they all got away we
have<00:06:19.530> some<00:06:19.710> shiners<00:06:20.100> in<00:06:20.250> here<00:06:20.520> here's<00:06:20.760> a<00:06:20.790> nice
