off<00:00:27.410> that's<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> funnest<00:00:28.890> part<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.310> just

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
off that's like the funnest part is just

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.500 
off that's like the funnest part is just
doing<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> whole<00:00:29.699> bunch<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.939> cave<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.269> should

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
doing a whole bunch of cave in should

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.269 
doing a whole bunch of cave in should
always<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> bunch<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.380> even<00:00:31.560> try<00:00:31.710> hopping

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
always do a bunch of or even try hopping

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.880 
always do a bunch of or even try hopping
into<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.820> once<00:00:33.809> you're<00:00:33.960> into<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.620> long<00:00:34.770> as

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
into it once you're into it as long as

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
into it once you're into it as long as
you<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.370> hop<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:36.090> you're<00:00:36.899> good<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
you got the hop out right you're good to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
you got the hop out right you're good to
go<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.100> way<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.280> works<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
go so the way it works it's not like a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.180 
go so the way it works it's not like a
regular<00:00:39.570> kickflip<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.950> always<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
regular kickflip which is always a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.889 
regular kickflip which is always a
little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.579> weird<00:00:41.820> make<00:00:42.450> sure<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.719> don't

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
little bit weird make sure you don't

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.600 
little bit weird make sure you don't
stand<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.230> toes<00:00:43.469> too<00:00:43.739> much<00:00:43.890> front<00:00:44.399> foot

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
stand on your toes too much front foot

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
stand on your toes too much front foot
make<00:00:44.910> sure<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.270> pushed<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.719> along<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
make sure it's pushed down along this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
make sure it's pushed down along this
rail<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.890> bit<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.239> stand<00:00:48.600> like

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
rail a bit like that do not stand like

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.350 
rail a bit like that do not stand like
that<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:49.230> always<00:00:49.440> bad<00:00:49.620> policy<00:00:50.239> once<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that that's always bad policy once you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420 
that that's always bad policy once you
all<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.379> basically<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.890> kickflip

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
all in it's just basically a kickflip

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
all in it's just basically a kickflip
but<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.730> kind<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.969> sucks<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.690> better

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
but what kind of sucks about it better

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.869 
but what kind of sucks about it better
push<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> frontside

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
push it up a little bit of a frontside

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
push it up a little bit of a frontside
flip<00:00:57.180> motion<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.410> strange<00:00:58.710> thing<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
flip motion and the strange thing is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
flip motion and the strange thing is
getting<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.399> feet<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.640> there<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.149> said<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
getting your feet out there I said it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
getting your feet out there I said it

towards the back truck because it's in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
towards the back truck because it's in
the<00:01:06.869> middle<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.200> lift<00:01:07.500> Lex's<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.369> it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the middle you lift Lex's a lot and it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
the middle you lift Lex's a lot and it
tends<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> stop<00:01:09.630> you're<00:01:09.900> tossing<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.710> you

to<00:01:14.580> pop<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> puts<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.650> side<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to pop out if it puts on the side of the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
to pop out if it puts on the side of the
deck<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.210> ball<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.689> foots<00:01:18.900> kind<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
deck but if your ball your foots kind of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
deck but if your ball your foots kind of
on<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.470> edge<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.220> way<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> works<00:01:20.729> once

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
on this edge the way it works once

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
on this edge the way it works once
you're<00:01:21.509> sliding<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.950> curl<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you're sliding you kind of curl it you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
you're sliding you kind of curl it you
scoop<00:01:23.880> scoop<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.479> toes<00:01:24.630> over<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
scoop scoop your toes over and what it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.010 
scoop scoop your toes over and what it
does<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.979> pulls<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> board<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.850> this

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
does is it pulls the board like this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
does is it pulls the board like this
just<00:01:28.020> pump<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:28.860> let<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> go

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
just pump it out of the way let it go

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.969 
just pump it out of the way let it go
with<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> sec<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:31.020> pull<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> back<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
with it for a sec then pull it back and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.120 
with it for a sec then pull it back and
then<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.210> Lance<00:01:33.390> pitch<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
then you just Lance pitch so that's the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.850 
then you just Lance pitch so that's the
whole<00:01:35.310> key<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> them<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> whole<00:01:36.860> curling

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
whole key to them is that whole curling

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
whole key to them is that whole curling
motion<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:39.030> foot<00:01:39.240> breakfast<00:01:39.720> just

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
motion with the back foot breakfast just

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.030 
motion with the back foot breakfast just
kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.170> hanging<00:01:40.350> around<00:01:40.650> their<00:01:40.799> weight<00:01:40.950> in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
kind of hanging around their weight in

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.580 
kind of hanging around their weight in
