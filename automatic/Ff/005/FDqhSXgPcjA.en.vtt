from<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> last<00:01:35.790> time<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.420> I'm

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
from the last time I was here I'm

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.999 
from the last time I was here I'm
actually<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.140> where<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> water<00:01:37.799> line

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
actually at about where the water line

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.289 
actually at about where the water line
is<00:01:38.220> right<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> camera<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
is right here with the camera and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
is right here with the camera and
everything<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.990> yeah<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.040> quite<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> ways

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
everything so yeah that's quite a ways

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.899 
everything so yeah that's quite a ways
down<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:43.259> don't<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> flukes<00:01:44.430> gonna<00:01:44.670> work

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
down I don't think the flukes gonna work

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.380 
down I don't think the flukes gonna work
cuz<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.229> big<00:01:46.640> bathtub<00:01:47.640> sitting

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
cuz this is just one big bathtub sitting

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
cuz this is just one big bathtub sitting
in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> Sun<00:01:48.810> basically<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> think

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in the Sun basically so you know I think

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.679 
in the Sun basically so you know I think
the<00:01:50.729> fish<00:01:50.909> are<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.270> pretty<00:01:51.450> deep

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the fish are gonna be pretty deep

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
the fish are gonna be pretty deep
there's<00:01:51.930> some<00:01:52.079> deep<00:01:52.229> water<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.009> I've

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
there's some deep water in here I've

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
there's some deep water in here I've
actually<00:01:54.710> scanned<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> depth

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
actually scanned it with the depth

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
actually scanned it with the depth

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
it through everything working it from

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.509 
it through everything working it from
the<00:03:25.620> bank<00:03:26.239> I've<00:03:27.239> got<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> big<00:03:27.930> barrel<00:03:28.590> sinker<00:03:28.979> so

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
I can get it way out there I think this

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.580 
I can get it way out there I think this
might<00:03:31.409> be<00:03:31.439> even<00:03:31.829> up<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.930> can't<00:03:33.930> remember<00:03:34.199> half

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
might be even up I can't remember half

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.899 
might be even up I can't remember half
maybe<00:03:35.599> but<00:03:37.010> we'll<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:38.040> see<00:03:38.310> if<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.489> can't<00:03:38.760> get

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
maybe but we'll just see if we can't get

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.839 
maybe but we'll just see if we can't get
it<00:03:39.000> out<00:03:39.150> there<00:03:39.389> maybe<00:03:39.659> get<00:03:39.900> some<00:03:40.109> fish<00:03:40.849> I'll

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
right here where I'm at it's just a

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.920 
right here where I'm at it's just a
small<00:03:59.590> little<00:04:00.159> bay<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.359> that<00:04:01.540> goes<00:04:01.719> out<00:04:01.900> to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
small little bay and that goes out to

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.869 
small little bay and that goes out to
the<00:04:02.260> what<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.620> would<00:04:02.829> call<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.219> main<00:04:03.459> part<00:04:03.790> of

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
the what I would call the main part of

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.630 
the what I would call the main part of
the<00:04:03.969> pond<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.769> then<00:04:05.769> directly<00:04:06.400> straight

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
the pond and then directly straight

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.759 
the pond and then directly straight
ahead<00:04:06.849> there's<00:04:07.239> actually<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:08.079> point<00:04:08.560> that
