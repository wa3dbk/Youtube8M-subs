00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.199
 to give your pet a tablet 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.130
 the first thing to find and hide it 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.960
 whole or chopped in food 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.090
 a meatball or cheese 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.010
 foods with a strong taste like pasta 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.010
 of anchovies can do the case 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.050
 first you need to take the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.510
 compressed between thumb and middle finger 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.130
 of the right hand 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.350
 therefore it positions itself to the animal on one 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.750
 stable surface with the left hand 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.490
 you hold up your head you need it 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.350
 of the right index finger to lower the 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.110
 jaw and always helping with 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.670
 the index finger pushes the tablet down the throat 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.800
 after which the mouth is kept closed 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.520
 of the animal by massaging its throat 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.520
 so that it does not swallow 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.350
 the same thing applies to the dog 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.970
 the mouth opens 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.680
 taking care to keep the lips 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.920
 of the animal in contact with the teeth 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 of the upper arch because it does not bite 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.130
 then the complex is inserted 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.110
 pushing it deep with the forefinger e 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.550
 you keep your mouth shut but if you take one 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.550
 throat until swallowing 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 another method is to chop the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.070
 tablet if it doesn't taste 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.680
 too unpleasant and melt it in water 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.260
 the liquid obtained must be aspirated with one 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.330
 syringe without needle insert the syringe 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.580
 side of the mouth holding the artist 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.040
 in the raised animal and press on one 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.750
 plunger slowly making sure that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.280
 the animal swallows and doing 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.550
 be careful not to send liquid to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.550
 transverse
