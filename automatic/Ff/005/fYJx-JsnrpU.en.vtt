00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
3 and it sounds like they are planning
on<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> wii<00:01:16.229> u<00:01:16.619> version<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> once<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> wii<00:01:17.850> u

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
on a wii u version of it once the wii u

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
on a wii u version of it once the wii u
is<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:18.900> pretty<00:01:19.110> cool<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.740> i

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
is out so that's pretty cool what i

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
is out so that's pretty cool what i
think<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.130> funny<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.790> next<00:01:21.030> game<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
think is funny is that this next game is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
think is funny is that this next game is
going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.900> an<00:01:22.080> easy<00:01:22.409> mode<00:01:22.740> which

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
going to have like an easy mode which

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.090 
going to have like an easy mode which
okay<00:01:23.640> cool<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.900> apparently<00:01:25.350> also<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.860> going

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
okay cool but apparently also it's going

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980 
okay cool but apparently also it's going
to<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.280> way<00:01:26.850> harder<00:01:27.180> than<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.600> other<00:01:27.720> games

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to be way harder than the other games

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.640 
to be way harder than the other games
the<00:01:28.890> games<00:01:29.130> already<00:01:29.549> pretty<00:01:30.420> hard<00:01:30.900> although

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the games already pretty hard although

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
the games already pretty hard although
now<00:01:31.890> there's<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.850> contention<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
now there's like all this contention of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.390 
now there's like all this contention of
like<00:01:33.750> well<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:34.170> played<00:01:34.259> demon's<00:01:34.829> souls<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
like well i played demon's souls and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
like well i played demon's souls and
dark<00:01:35.670> souls<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.630> game<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.869> gonna<00:01:37.140> be

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
dark souls so this game is gonna be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.229 
to the 1up article that talks about it
but<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.600> problem<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.790> definitely

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
but the problem is is that it definitely

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.330 
but the problem is is that it definitely

another Nintendo note Shigeru Miyamoto
it<00:03:28.530> has<00:03:28.709> claimed<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.190> he<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.489> going<00:03:29.670> to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
it has claimed that he is going to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.880 
it has claimed that he is going to
retire<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.630> it's<00:03:30.780> not<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> standard

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
retire but it's not a standard

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.979 
retire but it's not a standard
retirement<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.910> more<00:03:33.060> accurate<00:03:33.299> way<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.720> say

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
retirement the more accurate way to say

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.240 
retirement the more accurate way to say
it<00:03:34.019> would<00:03:34.200> be<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.470> he<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.769> stepping<00:03:35.100> down

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
it would be that he is stepping down

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.160 
it would be that he is stepping down
from<00:03:35.400> his<00:03:35.610> position<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.480> he<00:03:36.690> can<00:03:36.840> work<00:03:37.019> on

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
from his position so that he can work on

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.840 
from his position so that he can work on
some<00:03:37.380> smaller<00:03:37.620> games<00:03:37.920> with<00:03:38.220> younger<00:03:38.489> teams

work<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.600> projects<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.079> aren't<00:03:40.260> going<00:03:40.470> to

work on projects that aren't going to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.949 
work on projects that aren't going to
take<00:03:40.739> years<00:03:41.400> worth<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.209> effort<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.750> maybe

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
take years worth of effort and maybe

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.410 
take years worth of effort and maybe
just<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.530> year<00:03:44.430> worth<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.850> efforts<00:03:45.239> from

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
just a year worth of efforts from

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.210 
just a year worth of efforts from
reading<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.930> what<00:03:46.170> he<00:03:46.380> said<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.890> sounds<00:03:47.160> like
