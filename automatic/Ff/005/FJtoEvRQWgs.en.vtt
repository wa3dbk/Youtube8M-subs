00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.270
 Well open 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.429
 what we are going to do is write what 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.119
 next in this case paste what is 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:29.840
 the space being of two diagonal points 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:32.499
 moto and on fast boot script win32 and we give 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.499
 entire 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.880
 after giving it to enter 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.310
 We happened to paste the following 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.909
 what is moto with fast boot extra point 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.229
 space flash space provided a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.590
 space of princeton dot ing after 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.560
 of this we press enter again we 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.210
 will appear waiting for device in this 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.509
 moment we connect our usb or youtube 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.260
 to our phone to start 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.319
 make an acknowledgment of him 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.140
 ok once we connect our 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.689
 phone through the ibex bi we will 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.689
 appear what is this 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.180
 we will appear up here motor 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.300
 fast boot win32 what we are going to 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.900
 do after this right away we're going to 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.470
 paste the engine script fast boot exe 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.040
 space reboot this is to restart the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.490
 obviously this whole process is 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.220
 the one I already made on my phone 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.870
 obviously I will not do it again 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.560
 but here I am based to do 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.650
 the tutorial ok once we gave it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.670
 reboot we hope that our phone will 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.790
 restart completely 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.410
 when restarting when it's on, do not 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.180
 let's disconnect from louisville by 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.190
 Of course not 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.560
 once it has already restarted well already 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.040
 read the drivers again our 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.950
 computer will write after 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.690
 he the wall of facebook 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.950
 win32 let's write the space eid 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.950
 file and we're going to give you enter 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.290
 because this is not going to appear 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.750
 be on broadway t.co wing 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.219
 and these paths will appear to be 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.700
 it was successful ok 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:46.770
 after this we go 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.830
 next to this sign we are going to put 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:55.180
 diagonal diagonal princeton 2 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.180
 we are going to give you enter 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.819
 if it is not if we do not recognize this the 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:08.000
 first what we are going to do is put 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:11.390
 this diagonal princeton diagonal sub 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.370
 ok preferable better this is the one that 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.320
 it was the previous one 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.540
 probably you will find it effective 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.410
 but personally this was the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.410
 profit path 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.050
 since we gave diagonal diagonal that 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.720
 is the one that I recommend 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.360
 let's write immediately after 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.669
 of the east sign of number one will be very 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.480
 ok but let's put diagonal rim 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:43.430
 diagonal montt 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.820
 it's a screenplay with zero reimond space 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.750
 coma 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.030
 rw space script system 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.980
 and in the same way we will give it again 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.760
 enter 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.560
 once we gave it to enter this we go 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.409
 to write it the same immediately 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.209
 after the sign d 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:13.889
 the cat let's write cp space 

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:13.889
 diagonal princeton diagonal that space 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:23.390
 diagonal diagonal bin diagonal system 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.410
 again we will do the same 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.410
 we press enter 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.670
 and from there this one is going to come out again on 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:37.589
 same number symbol and let's put 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:46.370
 what are we going to wear hmo d 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:50.710
 space 67 55 space script system 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.710
 diagonal diagonal bin 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.770
 again we are going to give you enter once 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.800
 we read enter we will leave here 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.820
 again after the number symbol 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.930
 of the cat 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.930
 let's put peace 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:12.680
 th capital letters equal diagonal system 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:16.969
 diagonal bin two points 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.460
 that is the symbol of dollars dollars of 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:23.400
 money 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:28.470
 again space pm space urged 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.470
 diagonal princeton space 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.480
 superior diagonal next to pk this is 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.590
 to give him the order so he does not 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.720
 install now yes that the 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.800
 the application of the superuser of 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.449
 our phone 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:49.280
 ok once we gave him this 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:52.560
 this last order 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.130
 we press enter again 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.169
 and this message will come out once 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.080
 that we had already done everything 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.969
 this process we disconnect our 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.569
 phone 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.819
 and we restart it again 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:12.409
 although if you followed the letter 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:15.590
 the instructions your phone will be 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:19.850
 completely rooted 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:22.060
 ok thank you very much for your attention up 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.060
 then
