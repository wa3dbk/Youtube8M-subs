00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:18.210
 I prepared a masking tape released from a domestic business style x. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 18 mm 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.330
 An 18 mm masking tape. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.109
 With a price of 3000 won 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.940
 It's set. Let's look at the features. 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.540
 Product Features When sprayed with other paint on the world 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 Masking tape used to protect the face of the tooth in a different color to be protected 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.989

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.890
 It protects the surface of the part being produced, or even use parts of the temporarily assembled primary contact, etc. 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.670
 can 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 I mean, what this means is that I've now rageona resin kit Air For Henderson 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 Like a computer that makes fate 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.719
 When I cut my inner joint to paint, 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.700
 I want you to stick it in so I can check it out. 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:13.560
 Yes Type of tape Granted unit mm 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.150

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.340

 US Army Number Five 24 30 up to 50mm 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.159
 Masking tape 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.180
 The qr code next to it is probably made by Star 1 x 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.799
 # Ying official Probably will go more express agreement to Shop 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.030
 Yes, I do. So what are you going to do with this today? 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.350
 I used to tell you how to use masking tape in the past. 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:46.720
 Tamiya 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:50.740
 4 Masking tape Together with how good adhesion is, how strong it is now 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.850
 Senge or I 'll let you check it once . 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:00.039
 So let's get started in earnest. 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.509
 Oh, one thing to prepare for the test now so like the original red color 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.600
 I ate, but I 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.459
 Iron Gray put a little scattered 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.370
 There is a runner like this. 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.600
 Attaching a masking tape to come firmly 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.510
 I will learn so I feel the bond I feel and feel 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.430
 How much additional 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.330
 That is one more check to see that it Maybe peeled off the surface of a painting 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.360
 Edgar 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:34.090
 I'll test it with two masking tapes on it. 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.610
 Let's start. 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:44.080
 I used to be the one I used to play in Tamia before. 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:51.040
 So let's put this guy first. 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:53.800
 The meantime, another two days I use almost no written almost not this guy 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.740
 The feel of the sheep Tamiya 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:04.280
 What should i say 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.360
 I've a bit of Scotch tape adhesive adhesion wonder I feel a little like this disappears 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.590
 I want to 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.590
 Here's what I'm doing. 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:19.900
 Let's put the Star 1x on the other side. 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:22.260
 The guy is really tearing the feelings first. 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.030
 What is it? 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:34.170
 It looks a little more sticky than a ride . 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:36.230
 Rather, it makes sense not to try to strengthen the expectation that that would 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.230
 Yes 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:46.470
 Oh, and for now, this part of the test should reflect 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.400
 Wider masking tape if the broad sense is a little bit adhesion Sen 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:55.920
 For've tried from the very thick masking That is Te 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.940
 Uh strongly enough to get a real sense of duct tape it was a big ask 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.110
 I wrote it. 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.750
 So interesting that under the premise that there is a hanging thick adhesive can be better 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.900
 I have to test it. 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.750
 Do not be too prejudiced. 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.959
 If it's about this time, 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.489
 So then rub sseuni 4 of 4 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.489
 I'll see you in three or more times. 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.880
 So much so that just like a Scotch tape fell out of the top 1 adhesion 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.730
 I fell. 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.350
 I was not afraid. 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:36.150
 Yes I am deaf so I hwaryeongeun box bruise dried 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:41.510
 4 I do not have such a dry feeling, but I did not bury it. 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.510
 Next, let's take a look at some of the songs from the x 8 release. 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.930
 I'm sure that looks like a little bit more pointed than the adhesive 4 cases 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.650
 I feel it. 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.100
 In the same way , 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:00.830
 There was no paint on the scene. 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.360
 If so, then it would certainly be better to have a less expensive style. 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:09.110
 Let's think about it . 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:14.900
 As we know that the word received between 4 such as resin, even now during assembly kit 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:17.720
 I can use it when I try to do it. 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.860
 Even when used in painting 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:27.050
 Now the world is shielding not shielding but splitting the color 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:32.240
 It's good enough to be used to paint two worlds . 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.280
 And again , it is cheaper than imports 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.870
 Domestic would be better. 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.980
 I'll never gave instructions that thing Then I emphasized in the past 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.330
 When you store it with masking tape, how it is not through the re-wrapping paper 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.950
 Put 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.310
 It is better to put it in the wrapping paper again or prepare the case separately . Masking 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.310
 The tape 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:01.000
 When you paint, you prevent the error from flowing in. 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.750
 But now I put it in the corner too far into the first corner, 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.950
 I do not have it. 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:11.800
 4 If you look closely, you see these dust particles in these areas. 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:15.790
 When yireonge accumulate it is now a part of the end portion side of the air paint 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.330
 You'll have the possibility to flow in. You have to be careful. 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:24.510
 So as much as I can bag 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:28.900
 Notify me or I'll see you separately k3 Prepare and seal completely 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.070
 Securely hold the masking tape securely even after a 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:36.040
 Availability 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:40.920
 Be sure to keep it around when you keep it. 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.920
 Well, let's finish it now. 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.340
 Ah 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.819
 A three-pole pole 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.529
 222 Gundam Hollick 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:03.360

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:08.220
 Masking tape, two 18 year place bwatneundeyo subtract Reviews preview 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:11.490

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:15.630
 And it gave him the same feeling of high performance 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:20.520
 Uh, personally, if there's something you'd like of the fourth Lex, 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:24.630
 I do not know, but I've been looking for a masking tape before. 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:29.520
 Kid as much as I want to be able to write to the tear tape Scotch Buddha 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:33.180
 The full sheets that organizations can use eopdeoraguyo should just do it 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.420
 Cases that do control so that you can use as a stick Scotch tape 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.440
 I wish I had that. 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:44.010
 There's no point in getting out of your hands a little bit harder. 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:48.570
 Yes , I'll be back today and I'll be back next time. 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:52.350
 Maybe next time, maybe Maya Maya 2 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:54.900
