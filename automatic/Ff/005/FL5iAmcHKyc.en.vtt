00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.320 

it<00:03:34.430> did<00:03:34.790> glow<00:03:35.740> which<00:03:36.740> kind<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.310> mean<00:03:37.490> indicates

it did glow which kind of mean indicates

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.699 
it did glow which kind of mean indicates
to<00:03:38.690> me<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:40.450> in<00:03:41.450> some<00:03:41.840> way<00:03:42.050> you<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.470> get
