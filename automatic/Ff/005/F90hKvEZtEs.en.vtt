00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
real Scottish Fold move maybe not the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.930 
real Scottish Fold move maybe not the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
most tiger like creature out there but

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.890 
most tiger like creature out there but
he<00:01:41.840> can<00:01:41.990> get<00:01:42.110> around<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:46.390> here's<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.600> robot

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
he can get around and here's the robot

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.389 
he can get around and here's the robot
toy<00:01:48.160> let's<00:01:49.160> see<00:01:49.310> how<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.580> matches<00:01:49.759> up<00:01:50.090> as<00:01:51.399> you

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
toy let's see how it matches up as you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.420 
toy let's see how it matches up as you
can<00:01:52.550> see<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:53.020> barks<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.270> forward

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
can see it barks and that is forward

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.450 
can see it barks and that is forward
walk<00:01:58.430> slow<00:01:58.790> just<00:01:59.119> like<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.479> Scottish<00:01:59.810> Fold<00:02:00.460> so

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
walk slow just like the Scottish Fold so

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.450 
walk slow just like the Scottish Fold so
what's<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:01.790> battle<00:02:02.180> think<00:02:02.390> about<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:03.460> who

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
what's this battle think about this who

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.100 
what's this battle think about this who
doesn't<00:02:04.789> seem<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.210> impress<00:02:07.869> he's<00:02:08.869> probably

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
doesn't seem to impress he's probably

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.620 
doesn't seem to impress he's probably
thinking<00:02:09.350> this<00:02:10.130> toy<00:02:10.369> looks<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:11.060> bit<00:02:11.090> like<00:02:11.420> me

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
thinking this toy looks a bit like me

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.199 
thinking this toy looks a bit like me
but<00:02:12.850> no<00:02:15.190> doesn't<00:02:16.190> match<00:02:16.310> up<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.760> real<00:02:16.910> deal

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.949 

in<00:02:20.709> typical<00:02:21.709> Scottish<00:02:21.950> Fold<00:02:22.310> fashion<00:02:22.730> his<00:02:23.390> no

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
in typical Scottish Fold fashion his no

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.559 
in typical Scottish Fold fashion his no
ears<00:02:24.200> move<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.590> little<00:02:24.740> bit<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.130> that's<00:02:25.790> as<00:02:26.060> big

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
ears move a little bit and that's as big

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.750 
ears move a little bit and that's as big
as<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.840> reaction<00:02:27.290> gets<00:02:28.450> if<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.920> ask<00:02:31.100> basil<00:02:31.550> it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
as the reaction gets if you ask basil it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.970 
as the reaction gets if you ask basil it
is<00:02:32.000> much<00:02:32.330> more<00:02:32.569> fun<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.959> lie<00:02:33.110> upside<00:02:33.530> down<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
is much more fun to lie upside down and
