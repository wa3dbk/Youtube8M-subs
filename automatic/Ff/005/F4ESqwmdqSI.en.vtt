00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
like I said it's so simple to do this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.979 
like I said it's so simple to do this
just<00:02:39.310> kind<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.820> split<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.510> your<00:02:40.720> jeans

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
just kind of like a split in your jeans

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.160 
just kind of like a split in your jeans
and<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:42.010> will<00:02:42.250> get<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.209> lot<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.900> people

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
and you will get this a lot of people

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.690 
and you will get this a lot of people
asked<00:02:44.560> how<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.739> do<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.430> don't<00:02:45.610> really

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
asked how you do it and I don't really

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.280 
asked how you do it and I don't really
understand<00:02:46.180> why<00:02:46.390> because<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.020> really

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
understand why because it's really

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.010 
understand why because it's really
simple<00:02:47.709> but<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:49.030> how<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.270> do<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.810> you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
simple but that is how you do it you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.310 
simple but that is how you do it you
just<00:02:50.440> cut<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> slit<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.390> we're<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:53.080> while

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
just cut a slit in it and we're a while

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.110 
just cut a slit in it and we're a while
and<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.310> how<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:54.580> going<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.790> show<00:02:54.940> up

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
and this is how it's going to show up

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.110 
and this is how it's going to show up
and<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.830> guess<00:02:56.830> that's<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.640> really<00:02:58.090> hope

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
and I guess that's it so I really hope

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.910 
and I guess that's it so I really hope
that<00:02:58.480> helped<00:02:59.310> helped<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:02.500> how<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.709> do

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
that helped helped and that's how you do

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.320 
that helped helped and that's how you do
both<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.190> these<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.030> go<00:03:04.390> try<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:06.330> hopefully

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
both of these so go try it and hopefully

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.680 
both of these so go try it and hopefully
that<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:09.070> will<00:03:09.250> come<00:03:09.459> out<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.730> same<00:03:09.910> way<00:03:09.970> so

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
that that will come out the same way so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.650 
that that will come out the same way so
