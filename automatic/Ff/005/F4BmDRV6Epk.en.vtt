be a little different from what you're

I'm<00:00:06.390> having<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:07.020> bit<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.290> trouble<00:00:07.470> getting<00:00:08.280> my

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370

left4dead game to load and I think it
has<00:00:10.830> something<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.160> do<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.580> fact<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:11.880> I

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
has something to do with the fact that I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.870

it's<00:01:55.140> WASD<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.370> have

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
it's WASD and then you have

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.700 
it's WASD and then you have
to<00:01:57.740> melee<00:01:58.700> or<00:01:59.060> push<00:01:59.659> somebody<00:01:59.900> back<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.229> each

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
issue so you would H they're kind of the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.170 
issue so you would H they're kind of the
middle<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.310> key<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.850> actually

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
middle of the key and then it actually

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.240 
middle of the key and then it actually
disappears<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:12.650> take

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
disappears you take

no try to be a slick about it as
possible<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.230> be

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
possible like this you have to be

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.350 
possible like this you have to be
completely<00:02:48.710> perpendicular<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.210> an

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
completely perpendicular just like an

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.980 
completely perpendicular just like an
old<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:52.400> he's<00:02:52.580> not<00:02:52.760> even<00:02:52.790> feeling<00:02:53.360> my<00:02:53.660> push

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
old like he's not even feeling my push

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.880 
old like he's not even feeling my push
because<00:02:54.890> he's<00:02:55.459> not<00:02:55.820> at<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> complete<00:02:56.690> angle<00:02:57.080> so

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
because he's not at a complete angle so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.800 
because he's not at a complete angle so
I<00:02:57.920> lost<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.370> bit<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.610> health<00:02:58.940> there

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810

is gonna tear me up so wait I'm safe

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.180 
is gonna tear me up so wait I'm safe
house<00:05:38.960> weather<00:05:39.260> is<00:05:39.470> on<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.830 

I<00:05:43.220> guess<00:05:43.760> that<00:05:43.970> just<00:05:44.000> means<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.660> level

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
I guess that just means that the level

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.070 
I guess that just means that the level
is<00:05:45.050> over<00:05:45.320> but<00:05:45.680> actually<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.280> know<00:05:47.080> safety

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
is over but actually you know safety

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.079 
is over but actually you know safety
from<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.530> undead

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.089 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.850
