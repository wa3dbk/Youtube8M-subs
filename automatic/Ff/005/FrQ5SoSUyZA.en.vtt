00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
on cut down any mistakes that we then we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.240 
on cut down any mistakes that we then we
made<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> first<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.320> games<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.070> did

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
made the first two games I think we did

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.770 
made the first two games I think we did
that<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.460> made<00:01:08.610> big<00:01:08.790> big<00:01:09.060> steps<00:01:09.360> towards<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
that we made big big steps towards that

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.050 
that we made big big steps towards that
and<00:01:11.020> really<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:12.460> can<00:01:12.520> see<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:12.909> in<00:01:13.000> the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
and really you can see that in the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.530 
and really you can see that in the
result<00:01:13.390> there<00:01:13.540> we<00:01:13.659> managed<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.140> get<00:01:15.540> better

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
result there we managed to get better

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.450 
result there we managed to get better
performances<00:01:17.200> out<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.860> majority<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.340> the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
performances out of the majority of the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.710 
performances out of the majority of the
team<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.640> think<00:01:18.909> we<00:01:19.119> should<00:01:19.150> have<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> lot<00:01:19.690> of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
team I think we should have a lot of

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.450 
team I think we should have a lot of
character<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.140> come<00:01:20.350> back<00:01:20.500> from<00:01:20.770> 32<00:01:21.159> down<00:01:21.340> and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
character and come back from 32 down and

character and come back from 32 down and
having<00:01:21.640> been<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.940> one<00:01:22.090> up<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.750> come<00:01:22.869> back<00:01:23.020> late
