00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
let's just start out by priming my face

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.200 
let's just start out by priming my face
I'm<00:00:26.189> actually<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> use<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> Laura

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
I'm actually going to use the Laura

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.529 
I'm actually going to use the Laura
Mercier<00:00:27.990> foundation<00:00:28.550> primer<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.090> radiance

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
Mercier foundation primer in a radiance

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.830 
Mercier foundation primer in a radiance
along<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.800> foundation<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.360> really

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
along with this foundation just I really

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.750 
along with this foundation just I really
like<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.290> primer<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
like this primer and I think when you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.150 
like this primer and I think when you
use<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.149> primer<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.660> conjunction<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
use the primer in conjunction with the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
use the primer in conjunction with the
foundation<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> good

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
foundation you really can get a good

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
foundation you really can get a good
feel<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:40.980> how<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.730> supposed<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> perform

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
feel for how it's supposed to perform

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600 
feel for how it's supposed to perform
not<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> can't<00:00:43.890> use<00:00:44.070> something<00:00:44.430> else

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
not that you can't use something else

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.470 
not that you can't use something else
but<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:46.140> love<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.250> primer<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.300> gives

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
but I love this primer it really gives

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.740 
but I love this primer it really gives
my<00:00:48.719> skin<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.530> radiance<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.550> okay<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
my skin like a radiance to it okay and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.270 
my skin like a radiance to it okay and
now<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.110> gonna<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.620> I've<00:00:52.770> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.070> already

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
now I'm gonna go in I've kind of already

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.090 
now I'm gonna go in I've kind of already
started<00:00:53.430> putting<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.329> face<00:00:54.360> um<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
started putting it on my face um the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.840 
started putting it on my face um the
original<00:00:56.219> footage

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
original footage

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
original footage
I<00:00:57.000> shot<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.500> didn't<00:00:58.829> hit<00:00:58.980> record

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I shot of this like I didn't hit record

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.119 
I shot of this like I didn't hit record
and<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:00.750> already<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.920> layer

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and so I actually already have one layer

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
and so I actually already have one layer
on<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.359> utter<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.930> total

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
on I know if this is utter and total

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.190 
on I know if this is utter and total
fail<00:01:04.860> um<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.390> gonna<00:01:06.540> tell<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
fail um but what I was gonna tell you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
fail um but what I was gonna tell you
was<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:08.070> layer<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.610> enough<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.030> me

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
was that one layer is not enough for me

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
was that one layer is not enough for me
you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.450> still<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.080> imperfections<00:01:10.799> kind

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you can still see my imperfections kind

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.530 
you can still see my imperfections kind
of<00:01:11.189> through<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> buildable

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
of through and so this is a buildable

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
of through and so this is a buildable
foundations<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:13.950> gonna<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.369> back<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.760> with

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
foundations so I'm gonna go back in with

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.630 
foundations so I'm gonna go back in with
a<00:01:15.090> second<00:01:15.810> layer<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.189> put<00:01:17.400> some<00:01:17.549> on

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
a second layer which I just put some on

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
a second layer which I just put some on
the<00:01:17.759> back<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.119> my<00:01:18.210> hand<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.869> once<00:01:19.590> again<00:01:19.740> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the back of my hand and once again I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
the back of my hand and once again I
forgot<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> hit<00:01:20.759> record<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
forgot to hit record it's been one of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.210 
forgot to hit record it's been one of
those<00:01:22.860> days<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:24.210> am<00:01:24.659> applying<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.650> second

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
those days and I am applying a second

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.539 
those days and I am applying a second
layer<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.100> see

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
layer here so that you can actually see

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
layer here so that you can actually see
cuz<00:01:29.820> after<00:01:30.240> all<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> whole<00:01:31.740> point

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
cuz after all that was the whole point

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.270 
cuz after all that was the whole point
of<00:01:32.189> me<00:01:32.340> doing<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:33.270> oh<00:01:33.680> what<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> day<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
has been so I am just going to build up

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.859 
has been so I am just going to build up
this<00:01:38.970> foundation<00:01:39.890> putting<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.869> second

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
this foundation putting on a second

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
layer I do find that I tried to apply

this a few times with a brush but my

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.100 
preferred method to apply this
foundation<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.820> damp<00:01:54.119> Beauty<00:01:54.810> Blender

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
foundation is with a damp Beauty Blender

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.539 
foundation is with a damp Beauty Blender
it<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.640> um<00:01:57.320> dewy<00:01:58.320> luminous<00:01:59.250> type

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it is a very um dewy luminous type

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.539 
it is a very um dewy luminous type
finish<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.659> find<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.649> Beauty

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
finish and I just find that the Beauty

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.840 
finish and I just find that the Beauty
Blender<00:02:02.719> really<00:02:03.719> helps<00:02:04.490> marry<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
Blender really helps marry the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.000 
Blender really helps marry the
foundation<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.780> your

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
foundation to your

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.390 
foundation to your
face<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.690> just<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.260> the<00:02:09.440> overall<00:02:09.950> look<00:02:09.979> of

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
face and I just like the overall look of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.460 
face and I just like the overall look of
it<00:02:10.550> better<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.120> find<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.780> blends<00:02:12.140> better

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
it better I find that it blends better

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.910 
it better I find that it blends better
it's<00:02:12.830> not<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.400> like<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.960> brush<00:02:15.200> was<00:02:15.440> making<00:02:15.800> it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's not as like the brush was making it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.460 
it's not as like the brush was making it
look<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.430> little<00:02:16.580> cakey<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.660> don't<00:02:18.170> think

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
look a little cakey and I don't think

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.730 
look a little cakey and I don't think
that's<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.860> intended<00:02:19.550> way<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.300> look

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
that's the intended way for it to look

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.770 
that's the intended way for it to look
obviously<00:02:21.740> it's<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.760> very<00:02:22.790> moisturizing

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
obviously it's a very moisturizing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.460 
obviously it's a very moisturizing
foundation<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.750> damp<00:02:27.050> Beauty

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
foundation and so the damp Beauty

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.370 
foundation and so the damp Beauty
Blender<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:28.010> really<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:29.780> makes<00:02:30.110> my<00:02:30.320> skin

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
Blender just really like makes my skin

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.590 
Blender just really like makes my skin
look<00:02:30.830> likes<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.640 
you I think if you have oily skin you
