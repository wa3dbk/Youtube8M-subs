so<00:00:07.150> now<00:00:07.270> we're<00:00:07.390> going<00:00:07.480> to<00:00:07.540> start<00:00:07.780> to<00:00:07.960> assess

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
so now we're going to start to assess

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.959 
so now we're going to start to assess
the<00:00:08.590> distance<00:00:09.070> that<00:00:09.160> you<00:00:09.400> should<00:00:09.610> be<00:00:09.700> standing

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
the distance that you should be standing

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.390 
the distance that you should be standing
away<00:00:10.480> from<00:00:10.750> the<00:00:10.840> golf<00:00:10.990> ball<00:00:11.320> again<00:00:12.100> this<00:00:12.250> is

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
away from the golf ball again this is

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.040 
away from the golf ball again this is
another<00:00:12.670> one<00:00:12.820> of<00:00:12.850> those<00:00:13.030> variables<00:00:13.480> that<00:00:13.780> will

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.050 
another one of those variables that will

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.170 
another one of those variables that will
change<00:00:14.470> as<00:00:14.890> you<00:00:14.950> change<00:00:15.099> the<00:00:15.550> clubs<00:00:15.820> for<00:00:16.029> your

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
change as you change the clubs for your

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.120 
change as you change the clubs for your
shot<00:00:16.480> but<00:00:17.200> when<00:00:17.320> you<00:00:17.439> look<00:00:17.650> at<00:00:17.680> your<00:00:17.890> golf

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
shot but when you look at your golf

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.380 
shot but when you look at your golf
because<00:00:18.340> when<00:00:18.550> they're<00:00:18.700> sitting<00:00:18.849> in<00:00:19.090> the<00:00:19.180> bag

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
because when they're sitting in the bag

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.760 
because when they're sitting in the bag
you'll<00:00:19.840> see<00:00:20.080> that<00:00:20.170> they<00:00:20.290> are<00:00:20.439> all<00:00:20.650> of

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
you'll see that they are all of

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.100 
you'll see that they are all of
different<00:00:21.130> lengths<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.660> I<00:00:22.690> need<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:23.020> be

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
different lengths so I need to be

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.450 
different lengths so I need to be
standing<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.560> slightly<00:00:23.830> different<00:00:24.310> distance

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
standing a slightly different distance

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.849 
standing a slightly different distance
away<00:00:24.850> from<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.300> golf<00:00:25.600> ball<00:00:25.930> for<00:00:26.109> different

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
away from the golf ball for different

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.650 
away from the golf ball for different
shots<00:00:27.190> otherwise<00:00:27.850> I'm<00:00:28.029> going<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.210> be<00:00:28.270> cramped

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
shots otherwise I'm going to be cramped

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.929 
shots otherwise I'm going to be cramped
up<00:00:28.750> like<00:00:28.990> this<00:00:29.199> or<00:00:29.650> stretching<00:00:30.160> out<00:00:30.460> like<00:00:30.699> this

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
up like this or stretching out like this

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.580 
up like this or stretching out like this
depending<00:00:31.660> on<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.869> club<00:00:32.080> that<00:00:32.199> I'm<00:00:32.290> playing

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
depending on the club that I'm playing

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.619 
depending on the club that I'm playing
again<00:00:33.519> I<00:00:33.580> want<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.820> try<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.090> keep<00:00:34.210> things<00:00:34.390> as

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
again I want to try and keep things as

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.509 
again I want to try and keep things as
consistent<00:00:35.440> as<00:00:35.559> possible<00:00:35.650> right<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.430> way

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
consistent as possible right the way

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.210 
consistent as possible right the way
through<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.850> bag<00:00:37.470> so<00:00:38.470> as<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:38.650> set<00:00:38.860> up<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:39.100> this

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
through the bag so as I set up to this

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.610 
through the bag so as I set up to this
golf<00:00:39.460> ball<00:00:39.670> now<00:00:39.989> taking<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.110> correct<00:00:41.409> width

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620

golf ball now taking the correct width
of<00:00:41.830> stance<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.790> good<00:00:42.970> alignment<00:00:43.570> and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
of stance and the good alignment and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.450 
of stance and the good alignment and
then<00:00:44.409> just<00:00:44.589> going<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.769> check<00:00:44.979> that<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.159> have<00:00:45.309> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
then just going to check that I have the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.460 
then just going to check that I have the
correct<00:00:45.699> knee<00:00:45.940> flex<00:00:46.269> I'm<00:00:46.930> going<00:00:47.080> to<00:00:47.170> start

correct knee flex I'm going to start

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.649 
correct knee flex I'm going to start
doing<00:00:47.680> this<00:00:47.860> by<00:00:48.070> initially<00:00:48.760> locking<00:00:49.239> my<00:00:49.390> legs

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
doing this by initially locking my legs

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.020 
doing this by initially locking my legs
out<00:00:49.960> pushing<00:00:50.830> my<00:00:51.040> legs<00:00:51.250> right<00:00:51.519> back<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.940> the

out pushing my legs right back to the
legs<00:00:52.210> are<00:00:52.360> straight<00:00:52.659> as<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.409> do<00:00:53.589> that<00:00:53.769> look

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
legs are straight as you do that look

heels now from that position just make a

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.840 
heels now from that position just make a
slight<00:00:58.570> flexing<00:00:59.379> action<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.890> the<00:00:59.979> knees<00:01:00.190> and

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
start to feel a bit more balanced that's

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.599 
start to feel a bit more balanced that's
really<00:01:10.719> enough<00:01:11.079> knee<00:01:11.320> flex<00:01:11.649> we<00:01:12.280> don't<00:01:12.460> really

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:12.609 
really enough knee flex we don't really

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.459 
really enough knee flex we don't really
want<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:12.880> see<00:01:13.060> too<00:01:13.270> much<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.630> seated

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
want to see too much of a seated

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.380 
want to see too much of a seated
position<00:01:14.680> here<00:01:15.219> and<00:01:15.369> sitting<00:01:15.609> down<00:01:15.939> too<00:01:16.210> much

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
position here and sitting down too much

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.990 
position here and sitting down too much
it's<00:01:16.899> just<00:01:17.109> a<00:01:17.259> very<00:01:17.469> slight<00:01:17.890> knee<00:01:18.159> flex<00:01:18.490> and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
it's just a very slight knee flex and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.209 
it's just a very slight knee flex and
that<00:01:19.149> would<00:01:19.270> be<00:01:19.390> enough<00:01:19.719> they<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:20.859> to<00:01:20.979> check

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
that would be enough they have to check

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.590 
that would be enough they have to check
that<00:01:21.340> on<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.579> right<00:01:21.759> distance<00:01:22.090> away<00:01:22.270> from<00:01:22.390> the

that on the right distance away from the
golf<00:01:22.810> ball<00:01:23.109> I<00:01:23.320> take<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:23.890> slight<00:01:24.340> knee<00:01:24.549> flex

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
golf ball I take that slight knee flex

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.690 
golf ball I take that slight knee flex
and<00:01:26.380> then<00:01:26.469> just<00:01:26.649> lower<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.100> handle<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.670> the

as it lands here against my front thigh

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.099 
as it lands here against my front thigh
it's<00:01:33.579> just<00:01:33.820> an<00:01:33.939> inch<00:01:34.240> above<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.899> kneecap

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
it's just an inch above the kneecap

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.099 
it's just an inch above the kneecap
position<00:01:35.859> if<00:01:36.789> I<00:01:36.969> was<00:01:37.149> too<00:01:37.359> close<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.899> golf

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109
