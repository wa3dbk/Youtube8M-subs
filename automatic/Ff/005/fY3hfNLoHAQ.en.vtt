00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.320
 as the letter is a hero clearly inspired by comic books 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.470
 your adventures through the city in peace shirin has a super-man warming thing 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.429
 a spider man 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.559
 your mission could not be different save mankind from a terrible 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.619
 threat 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.460
 this clear threat is another superhuman 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 known simply as 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.290
 face with gravitational powers and measuring about 100 meters in height 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.360
 the last two were player attitudes 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.070
 influence in the way that computer-controlled characters commission 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.430
 however this time this functionality has more impact on the history of the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.210
 game 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.719
 making changes are not the powers of leather 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.299
 but also defined who will be your partner in the adventures through the city 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.589
 trust me paulo when you have just worked with the future scholarship 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.550
 to work 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.410
 calm down like 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.600
 When we get there, you'll just party. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.940
 beer 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.300
 economic 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.910
 the city of inhumas is a really interesting place 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.370
 are crisp the inspirations of new throw of his French air 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.920
 but also to sites that show the bad side 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 such as flooded areas and others that show industrial areas 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.820
 all these places are quite different from each other 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.860
 and bring variety to the game landscape 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.500
 which helps to maintain the will to explore 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.400
 also the team very well animated mainly in the scenes of cut what 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.619
 is a breakthrough compared to first sick 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.559
 so I hope to quit the sport 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.919
 since its beginning in the first chapter - come on 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.589
 the proposal is out of shape 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.259
 the pleasures 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.259
 ae 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.310
 now coutinho more contact with the buildings that scale 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.459
 movements to climb a wall or hold a 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.629
 natural 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.609
 open world game are really difficult becomes varied but the 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.069
 work team has managed to do good missions that exploit the 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.629
 colo powers and their allies 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.959
 there are lesions ranging from following a subject in the muted way 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.730
 and have a hidden place in the scenario even against certain 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.659
 enemies 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.810
 this time brazil shares hit the hand and managed to do a good job 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.049
 dubbing 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.060
 the voice of cole very similar to its North American version 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.520
 and three minutes of chat and everything I want to lose, you can practically say 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.980
 that everyone you 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.119
 You are the demon trembling. 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.739
 the river will be a good start for us 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.980
 When going blank on the acre, ten people are trapped in the action. 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.829
 especially when trying to get the hands of the carmem forum 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.149
 What are you going to do 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.479
 frankfurt 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.550
 the cat leaps and we have two 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.310
 is in the inclusion of missions created by users with them the game won 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.610
 a special attraction 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.240
 but it is possible to create from simple goal to completely 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.559
 new 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.300
 the creation tool is simple to use 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.300
 and anyone can create an 'adventure' in less than 30 minutes 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.259
 Of course many injuries are not much fun there but beat the time of 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.769
 receive expelled material 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.129
 by super planting is fun will be guaranteed 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.510
 if the main missions are quite varied the same can not be said of the 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.959
 secondary objectives that recur to exhaustion 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.840
 even though these missions are secondary, they are practically obligatory 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.359
 only through them that it is possible to reach the maximum level of 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.359
 Hero the front ear 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.199
 the show 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.129
 but the fight only works in three open places 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.520
 in tight areas such as warehouses 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.779
 or in narrow streets for example 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.779
 it becomes frustrating to end the money was used 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.029
 more than being a simple continuation efec - two improves all 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:02.380
 the aspects of its predecessor and add more depth to the choices 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.409
 of the player 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.830
 with them the player decides 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.420
 Who will be your helper? 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.490
 and with that 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.949
 what will be the path traveled until the end of history 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.889
 The negative side is that the team is bewildered by enemies that may end up 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.029
 with you with few votes 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.850
 forcing the player to be hiding all the time 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.850
 a dignified veronica attitude 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.379
 amy there will be is a game that will please fans of stories in 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.869
 comics because it really can match the heroes of the publishers 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.089
 marrelli dc comics 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:56.589
 I do not know if you've already received someone. 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.439
 it was a surprise failures 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.379
 crises are moments that you
