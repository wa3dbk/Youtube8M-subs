00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the moment is a medium which is number

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.640 
the moment is a medium which is number
three<00:00:26.609> because<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.840> order<00:00:28.109> Nick's<00:00:28.289> online

three because you order Nick's online

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.109 
three because you order Nick's online
it's<00:00:28.800> kind<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.010> hard<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.220> tell<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> color<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it's kind of hard to tell the color and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's kind of hard to tell the color and
I<00:00:30.570> saw<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.109> fish<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.619> i<00:00:31.679> bought<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.369> darker

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
I saw the fish that i bought in a darker

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.610 
I saw the fish that i bought in a darker
shade<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.020> winter<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
shade but I think for winter at the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.340 
shade but I think for winter at the
moment<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.130> quite<00:00:35.399> fine<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.930> this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
moment it's quite fine so that is this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.010 
moment it's quite fine so that is this
is<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> medium<00:00:38.100> shade<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:39.930> really

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
is the medium shade so I don't really

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.990 
is the medium shade so I don't really
need<00:00:40.290> too<00:00:40.680> much<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> bronzing<00:00:41.610> looking

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
need too much of a bronzing looking

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.779 
need too much of a bronzing looking
winter<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.140> enough<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.789> it's

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
winter but it's just enough and it's

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
winter but it's just enough and it's
matt<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> love<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> lot<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
matt so I love that because a lot of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
matt so I love that because a lot of
bronzers<00:00:47.250> contain<00:00:47.610> shimmer<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.149> Matt<00:00:48.660> looks

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
bronzers contain shimmer and Matt looks

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.420 
bronzers contain shimmer and Matt looks
more<00:00:49.110> natural<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.530> me<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> love<00:00:50.219> using

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
more natural for me and I love using

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
more natural for me and I love using
this<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> everyday<00:00:51.180> basis<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> actually

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this on it everyday basis and actually

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.170 
this on it everyday basis and actually
if<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> medium<00:00:53.280> color<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.969> bad

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
if I in the medium color is not that bad

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
if I in the medium color is not that bad
because<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.719> gives<00:00:55.050> me<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.230> right

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
because it just gives me that right

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.500 
because it just gives me that right
amount<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:57.350> color<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.160> face

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
amount of color that I need to my face

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
amount of color that I need to my face

this and big recommendation if you like
to<00:01:13.439> wear<00:01:13.590> eyeliner<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.580> top<00:01:14.790> lash<00:01:14.970> line

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to wear eyeliner on your top lash line

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.810 
to wear eyeliner on your top lash line
up<00:01:15.420> bottom<00:01:16.080> lash<00:01:16.259> line<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.400> much<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
up bottom lash line not so much on the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.160 
up bottom lash line not so much on the
waterline<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> doesn't<00:01:18.750> hold<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:18.990> as

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
waterline because it doesn't hold up as

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
waterline because it doesn't hold up as
well<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.650> i<00:01:19.799> don't<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.100> use<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
well but i don't really use it for that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.320 
well but i don't really use it for that
so<00:01:21.119> that's<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> problem<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.439> me<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.330> the
