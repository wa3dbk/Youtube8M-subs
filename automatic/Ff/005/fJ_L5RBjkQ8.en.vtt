00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.210
 hi friends from youtube I would talk to you if 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.850
 in this video we are going to learn the hill 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.730
 of tronic at the request of a subscriber 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.769
 I had thought of doing the song with the 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:17.910
 reese but the classic 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 in this better not 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.100
 doing this way will not make us very 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.500
 well it looks like it has an edit 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.430
 electrical and it does not do the case yes that what 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.070
 let's do with the chords 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.810
 conventional ones agree a certain very 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.460
 easy to turn anyone 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.610
 and good 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.610
 would be like that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.040
 with the problem that is done with a 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.450
 instrument if I'm not wrong it must be 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.980
 the organ then to do this and here 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.110
 which I know we'll have to fine-tune the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.430
 rope and leave it in rba the web will continue 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.430
 because in the background except 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.620
 and we're not going to do an octave because 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 it would not be at all then the intro 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.799
 solved that we are going to do so with the in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 the sixth space the third and in the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.130
 fifth in the lajita we do 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.210
 this the higher level 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.579
 then to air the sect 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.579
 we see then that there is so 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.060
 ah 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.060
 when they are only going to enter 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.439
 very easy the good song and the radio what 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.110
 Let's make it super easy to be 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.290
 conventional 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.050
 and two down 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:50.280
 2 up down and up 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.280
 from bottom to top nothing more 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.190
 and the exquisite ones in C major 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.490
 and good 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.220
 the least 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.150
 greater sun 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.150
 fabio 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.280
 but 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.870
 dust the song very easy the can 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.280
 leave to anyone so the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.970
 way in practice and we will solve 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.970
 any pain 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.260
 as more complex yes I hope 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.550
