hi an antagonist is like a the wrong key

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.060 
hi an antagonist is like a the wrong key
that<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.960> keyhole<00:01:16.440> but<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that will go into the keyhole but it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
that will go into the keyhole but it
will<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.490> turn<00:01:17.940> therefore<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.140> message

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
will not turn therefore the message

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
will not turn therefore the message

wrong house okay this information is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710 
wrong house okay this information is
important<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.460> nurses<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
important for nurses to know because you

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
important for nurses to know because you
may<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.990> giving<00:01:28.350> drugs<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.009> act<00:01:29.160> as<00:01:29.340> an

may be giving drugs that can act as an

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
may be giving drugs that can act as an
agonist<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:30.780> promote<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
agonist which will promote a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
agonist which will promote a
physiological<00:01:32.040> response<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.640> continue<00:01:33.180> or

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
physiological response to continue or

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
physiological response to continue or
you<00:01:34.259> might<00:01:34.440> be<00:01:34.619> giving<00:01:34.800> an<00:01:35.040> antagonist<00:01:35.759> which

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you might be giving an antagonist which

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150 
you might be giving an antagonist which
will<00:01:36.300> make<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> physiological<00:01:37.350> response<00:01:37.710> stop

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
will make a physiological response stop

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.790 
will make a physiological response stop
an<00:01:38.640> example<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.170> person<00:01:40.500> has<00:01:40.680> an

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
an example is when the person has an

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.770 
an example is when the person has an
allergic<00:01:40.979> reaction<00:01:41.310> they're<00:01:42.300> producing

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
allergic reaction they're producing

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.719 
allergic reaction they're producing
histamine<00:01:43.380> which<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.800> agonist<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.369> you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
histamine which is the agonist and you

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.820 
histamine which is the agonist and you
want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> give<00:01:45.300> them<00:01:45.479> an<00:01:45.690> antihistamine<00:01:46.350> which

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
want to give them an antihistamine which

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.620 
want to give them an antihistamine which
is<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> antagonist<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.910> stops<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> allergic

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is the antagonist and stops the allergic

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.380 
is the antagonist and stops the allergic
reaction<00:01:49.850> ha<00:01:51.979> here's<00:01:52.979> some<00:01:53.369> claritin<00:01:54.119> which

reaction ha here's some claritin which

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.540 
reaction ha here's some claritin which
will<00:01:54.539> stop<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.140> allergic<00:01:55.410> reaction<00:01:56.220> from

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
will stop that allergic reaction from

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.700 
will stop that allergic reaction from
happening<00:01:57.350> thanking<00:01:58.350> their<00:01:58.560> you're<00:01:59.100> welcome
