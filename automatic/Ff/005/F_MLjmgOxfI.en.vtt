okay so I'm starting with a little
review<00:00:51.719> over<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.320> we've<00:00:52.559> learned<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.100> make

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
review over what we've learned to make

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.119 
review over what we've learned to make
things<00:00:53.550> straight<00:00:54.210> okay<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.350> today<00:00:55.800> we're

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
things straight okay so today we're

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.060 
things straight okay so today we're
going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.489> deal<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> C<00:00:57.329> major<00:00:57.510> scale

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.910 

all<00:01:03.880> right<00:01:04.030> we<00:01:04.510> can<00:01:04.720> also<00:01:05.050> deal<00:01:05.410> with<00:01:05.710> all

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
all right we can also deal with all

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.190 
all right we can also deal with all
other<00:01:06.370> scales<00:01:06.820> but<00:01:07.060> I'm<00:01:07.240> choosing<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:07.990> scale

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
other scales but I'm choosing this scale

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.840 
other scales but I'm choosing this scale
because<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.500> starts<00:01:08.920> from<00:01:09.070> saying<00:01:09.400> goes<00:01:09.640> to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
because it starts from saying goes to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.480 
because it starts from saying goes to
see<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.690> has<00:01:11.020> only<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.740> white<00:01:11.920> key<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:12.400> it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
see and it has only the white key so it

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.120 
see and it has only the white key so it
makes<00:01:12.730> it<00:01:12.910> more<00:01:13.240> clear<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.440> eye<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.920> see

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
makes it more clear to the eye to see

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.830 
makes it more clear to the eye to see
what<00:01:15.370> I'm<00:01:15.490> talking<00:01:15.850> about<00:01:15.910> but<00:01:16.480> you<00:01:16.540> can<00:01:16.690> take

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
what I'm talking about but you can take

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.940 
what I'm talking about but you can take
any<00:01:17.020> other<00:01:17.320> scale<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.120> implement<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.240> same

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
any other scale and implement the same

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.700 
any other scale and implement the same
principles<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.370> same<00:01:21.580> manner<00:01:22.000> okay<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.410> I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
principles in the same manner okay so I

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.870 
principles in the same manner okay so I
told<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.460> C<00:01:24.820> major<00:01:25.030> scale<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:27.250> build<00:01:27.490> chords

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
told the C major scale we build chords

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.900 
told the C major scale we build chords
the<00:01:28.360> first<00:01:28.630> chord<00:01:28.870> would<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.950> tonic<00:01:30.400> the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
the first chord would the tonic the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.060 
the first chord would the tonic the
tonic<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.720> most<00:01:31.930> relaxed<00:01:32.530> chord<00:01:32.800> in<00:01:32.979> the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
tonic is the most relaxed chord in the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.770 
tonic is the most relaxed chord in the
scale<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.640> beginning<00:01:33.820> point<00:01:34.420> of<00:01:34.660> the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
scale it's the beginning point of the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.690 
scale it's the beginning point of the
scale<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.470> last<00:01:35.680> point<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.250> scale

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
scale and the last point of the scale

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.930 
scale and the last point of the scale
meaning<00:01:37.420> all<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:38.470> other<00:01:38.650> nodes<00:01:39.009> want<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.759> go

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
meaning all the other nodes want to go

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.350 
meaning all the other nodes want to go
to<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.330> tonic<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:42.040> way<00:01:42.250> or<00:01:42.490> another

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
to the tonic in that way or another

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.710 
to the tonic in that way or another
okay<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.320> C<00:01:44.590> major<00:01:44.800> is<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.340> tonic<00:01:45.790> chord<00:01:46.090> we

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
okay so C major is the tonic chord we

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.380 
okay so C major is the tonic chord we
continued<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:48.040> create<00:01:48.310> all<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:49.030> chords

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
continued to create all the chords

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.270 
continued to create all the chords
within<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.960> scale<00:01:50.259> this<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.860> second

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
within the scale this is the second

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.570 
within the scale this is the second
degree<00:01:51.369> D<00:01:51.759> minor<00:01:52.000> third<00:01:52.869> E<00:01:53.140> minor<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:54.280> fourth

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
degree D minor third E minor the fourth

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.490 
degree D minor third E minor the fourth
degree<00:01:54.759> was<00:01:55.150> F<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.229> fifth<00:01:56.470> degree<00:01:56.680> was<00:01:57.340> G

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
degree was F and the fifth degree was G

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.990 
degree was F and the fifth degree was G
really<00:01:59.500> staying<00:01:59.890> for<00:02:00.160> a<00:02:00.190> moment<00:02:00.520> on<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.820> fifth

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
really staying for a moment on the fifth

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.510 
really staying for a moment on the fifth
degree<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:01.509> why<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.590> because<00:02:03.040> the

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
degree and why is that that because the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.450 
degree and why is that that because the
fifth<00:02:03.790> degree<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.720> considered<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.860> be<00:02:05.890> that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
fifth degree is considered to be that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.570 
fifth degree is considered to be that
dominant<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.750> scale<00:02:08.050> considered<00:02:09.010> to<00:02:09.160> be<00:02:09.280> it

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
dominant of a scale considered to be it

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.880 
dominant of a scale considered to be it
is<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.970> dominant<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.540> scale<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.080> why<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.590> that

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
is the dominant of scale and why is that

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.009 
is the dominant of scale and why is that
what's<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.459> dominant<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.269> dominant<00:02:13.750> chord

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
what's so dominant in a dominant chord

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.830 
what's so dominant in a dominant chord
in<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.350> fifth<00:02:14.590> degree<00:02:14.890> well<00:02:15.640> if<00:02:16.390> you'll<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
in a fifth degree well if you'll have a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.100 
in a fifth degree well if you'll have a
look<00:02:16.930> after<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.310> G<00:02:18.549> note<00:02:19.030> which<00:02:19.450> exists<00:02:19.900> both

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
look after the G note which exists both

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.250 
look after the G note which exists both
in<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:21.070> C<00:02:21.310> major<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.269> G<00:02:22.480> major<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.140> we

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
in the C major and the G major so we

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.080 
in the C major and the G major so we
don't<00:02:23.440> talk<00:02:23.560> about<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.980> too<00:02:24.130> much<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.940> next

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
don't talk about it too much the next

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.720 
don't talk about it too much the next
note<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.540> B<00:02:25.810> B<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.400> seventh<00:02:27.820> note<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:30.010> sa

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
note is B B is the seventh note in sa

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.479 
note is B B is the seventh note in sa
major<00:02:30.970> scale<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.019> it's<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.500> leading<00:02:32.799> tone<00:02:33.190> it

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
major scale so it's the leading tone it

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.410 
major scale so it's the leading tone it
leads<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.450> tonic<00:02:34.810> within<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.380> semitone<00:02:36.010> up

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
leads to the tonic within a semitone up

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.720 
leads to the tonic within a semitone up
therefore<00:02:37.440> because<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.590> has<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.980> semitone<00:02:39.400> and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
therefore because it has a semitone and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.090 
therefore because it has a semitone and
it<00:02:39.910> leads<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.420> tonic<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.019> is<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.890> most

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
it leads to the tonic it is the most

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.930 
it leads to the tonic it is the most
tensed

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
tensed

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.580 
tensed
note<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.810> scale<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:45.040> by<00:02:45.850> knowing<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.590> we

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
note in a scale so by knowing that we

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.120 
note in a scale so by knowing that we
know<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.799> lot<00:02:48.100> about<00:02:49.290> voice<00:02:50.290> leadings<00:02:50.769> right

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
know a lot about voice leadings right

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.360 
know a lot about voice leadings right
because<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.200> most<00:02:53.410> tense<00:02:53.769> point<00:02:54.070> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
because this is the most tense point and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.340 
because this is the most tense point and
after<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.790> we<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.330> go<00:02:55.480> home

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
after that we have to go home

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.220 
after that we have to go home
therefore<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.400> along<00:02:58.330> with<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.630> D<00:02:58.810> note<00:02:58.989> that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
therefore and along with the D note that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.620 
therefore and along with the D note that
leads<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.680> e<00:02:59.709> which<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.400> also<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> relaxed<00:03:01.450> note

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
leads to e which is also a relaxed note

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.110 
leads to e which is also a relaxed note
in<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.989> similar<00:03:02.440> scale<00:03:02.650> because<00:03:03.040> c<00:03:03.670> e<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:03.910> g

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
in a similar scale because c e and g

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.050 
in a similar scale because c e and g
which<00:03:04.930> are<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.410> notes<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:06.070> create<00:03:06.820> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
which are the notes that create the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.690 
which are the notes that create the
chord<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.870> tonic<00:03:08.320> are<00:03:08.890> considered<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.670> be

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
chord of the tonic are considered to be

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.070 
chord of the tonic are considered to be
the<00:03:09.850> most<00:03:10.090> relaxed<00:03:10.630> notes

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the most relaxed notes

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.910 
the most relaxed notes
the<00:03:11.170> C<00:03:11.350> major<00:03:11.530> scale<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:13.390> D<00:03:14.020> leads<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.500> e<00:03:14.530> which

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
the C major scale so D leads to e which

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.040 
the C major scale so D leads to e which
is<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.100> relaxed<00:03:15.550> note<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.940> billets<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.600> C<00:03:16.870> which

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
is a relaxed note and billets to C which

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.200 
is a relaxed note and billets to C which
is<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> relaxed<00:03:17.770> note<00:03:17.950> therefore<00:03:18.700> we<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:18.970> two

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
is a relaxed note therefore we have two

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.080 
is a relaxed note therefore we have two
tension<00:03:19.720> notes<00:03:19.930> -<00:03:20.620> dissonance<00:03:21.190> leading<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.060> a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
tension notes - dissonance leading to a

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.630 
tension notes - dissonance leading to a
consonant<00:03:22.750> note<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.410> two<00:03:23.490> tension<00:03:24.490> notes

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
consonant note so two tension notes

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.120 
consonant note so two tension notes
leading<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.150> relaxation<00:03:25.450> notes<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.710> far<00:03:26.920> so

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
leading to a relaxation notes so far so

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.660 
leading to a relaxation notes so far so
good<00:03:27.160> huh<00:03:27.370> okay<00:03:28.320> now<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:29.800> want<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> talk<00:03:30.520> about

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
good huh okay now I want to talk about

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.880 
good huh okay now I want to talk about
sus<00:03:31.090> chords<00:03:31.510> where<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.900> they<00:03:32.200> enter<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.770> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
sus chords where do they enter in the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.850 
sus chords where do they enter in the
picture<00:03:33.340> okay<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.030> when<00:03:34.360> we're<00:03:34.630> in<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.380> G<00:03:35.590> major

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
picture okay so when we're in a G major

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.720 
picture okay so when we're in a G major
chord<00:03:36.040> okay<00:03:36.880> right<00:03:37.660> now<00:03:37.960> these<00:03:38.590> are<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.310> notes

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
chord okay right now these are the notes

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.560 
chord okay right now these are the notes
that<00:03:39.910> consider<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.630> be<00:03:40.860> relaxed<00:03:41.860> in<00:03:41.980> that

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
that consider to be relaxed in that

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.920 
that consider to be relaxed in that
context<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:43.900> G<00:03:44.800> B<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.400> D<00:03:45.490> if<00:03:46.360> we<00:03:46.570> are<00:03:46.630> going<00:03:46.810> to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
context so G B and D if we are going to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.199 
context so G B and D if we are going to
take<00:03:47.170> any<00:03:47.440> other<00:03:47.710> nodes<00:03:48.040> but<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.400> G<00:03:48.640> B<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.060> D

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
take any other nodes but the G B and D

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.070 
take any other nodes but the G B and D
and<00:03:50.490> replace<00:03:51.490> them<00:03:51.730> with<00:03:51.760> third<00:03:52.330> we're<00:03:52.900> going

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
and replace them with third we're going

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.990 
and replace them with third we're going
to<00:03:53.170> create<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.530> sort<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:54.160> sustained<00:03:54.700> chord

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
to create a sort of a sustained chord

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.380 
to create a sort of a sustained chord
that<00:03:55.360> we<00:03:55.540> lead<00:03:55.690> us<00:03:55.840> directly<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.390> dominant

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
that we lead us directly to the dominant

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.870 
that we lead us directly to the dominant
chord<00:03:58.630> okay<00:03:59.500> so<00:03:59.590> if<00:03:59.800> I<00:03:59.890> take<00:04:00.010> AG<00:04:00.370> major<00:04:00.580> scale

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
chord okay so if I take AG major scale

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.320 
chord okay so if I take AG major scale
and<00:04:01.270> I<00:04:01.690> replace<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.230> third<00:04:02.500> with<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.830> second<00:04:03.430> so

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
and I replace the third with a second so

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.170 
and I replace the third with a second so
this<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.600> what<00:04:04.780> I'm<00:04:04.870> getting<00:04:05.050> G<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.130> D<00:04:06.430> we

anymore so you have to remember that a

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.420 
anymore so you have to remember that a
note<00:05:43.940> could<00:05:44.210> be<00:05:44.390> dissonant<00:05:44.930> in<00:05:45.440> one<00:05:45.740> context

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
note could be dissonant in one context

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.790 
note could be dissonant in one context
and<00:05:47.150> when<00:05:47.300> we<00:05:47.390> move<00:05:47.540> to<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.690> next<00:05:47.900> chord<00:05:48.290> it

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
and when we move to the next chord it

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.890 
and when we move to the next chord it
becomes<00:05:49.280> consonant<00:05:50.090> that's<00:05:50.720> quite

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900
