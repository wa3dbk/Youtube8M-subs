00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.370
 I am mario persona and these are the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.189
 answers that I gave to those who 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.170
 asked about the Bible that you 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.230
 wrote the news of a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.199
 supposed angel who would have appeared in a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.390
 picture taken with the cell phone in a church 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the city of maringá 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.949
 Good, you can not see much in the picture. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.199
 because it is low resolution 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.080
 but this kind of phenomenon happens with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.109
 cameras and poor quality 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.390
 interpretation of light and shadow made 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.160
 by the camera software because that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.460
 there is an interpretation that the software 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.149
 makes light and shade everything indicates in the photo that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.690
 You sent the whole angel, there's one that's 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.719
 rita oo maybe even that guitarist 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 who is next to the supposed angel whose 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.390
 image has created a luminous shadow 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.149
 This is not the manipulation of the photo, right? 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
 I got the profile of the supposed angel 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.930
 I drew the software, I did not have anything 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.180
 to make or receive 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.670
 I drew by suffers the profile of 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.799
 supposed angel and I took this profile 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.710
 I put shadow guitarist figure 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.090
 to see how the two said exactly 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.310
 same silhouette 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.200
 if it's an angel that my technique makes it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.409
 The other side he was playing guitar 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.150
 at the time of the photo and you can almost see the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.950
 his shoe appearing on over the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.130
 supposed everything and bright I do not remember 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.960
 to hear about shoe angels 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.150
 digital video cameras video 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 also digital cameras video 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
 low quality 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.579
 they are able to transform simple 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.780
 mosquitoes that fly by quickly 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.939
 inside the lens 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.649
 At night the families of these factors is 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.479
 researcher examined several videos of 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.060
 flying saucers discovered that nothing more 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.090
 is that the misinterpretation of the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.399
 video camera software at night from 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.210
 mosquitoes that pass quickly on 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.430
 tool 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 If I had the photo in the resolution 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.789
 original from this photo of supposed angel 45 and 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.060
 show that it is a defect disposal is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.849
 overlapping or is the subject 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.310
 people are things that attract 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.700
 crowds are eager to see something 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.380
 because the true faith that creates in the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.450
 The word of God is not enough to 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.360
 they and they want to have something 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.450
 visible to power and the gospels jesus 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.900
 he reprimanded me that I told him 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.230
 would be able to create this vice master 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.870
 jesus 29 said jesus because you saw me tomé 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.750
 He who blesses those who have not seen 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.850
 They believed, sir. 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.489
 in what would be the sun because of the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.200
 signs and miracles in joão 23 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.780
 We always talk when he's in 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.569
 jerusalem for the Passover during the festival 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.880
 many seeing the signs he made he created 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.980
 in his name but the same Jesus did not 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.200
 I trusted them because everyone who 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.510
 knew and did not need someone to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.280
 testimony comes from the man because he 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.860
 I knew there was name 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.480
 they are such things that they fill churches with 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.090
 there with people who believe in any 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.310
 anything nonsense that they presented 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.070
 the greatness and at the same time make the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.380
 gospel mock motive for 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.239
 anyone wins it has creed that has the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.730
 minimum of common sense 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.890
 Evangelicals have now decided to do 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.140
 that Catholics have been doing for centuries 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.100
 that is, to see angels in any 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.600
 blur 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.090
 soon someone will say that it was 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.090
 cured by the ju appeared there in that 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.920
 in that church and that's when the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.819
 getting a basilica 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.819
 in her place
