00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello and alaa four from the kernel roll 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 Cologne today is Rosenmontag and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.869
 we know that this is a big celebration 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.210
 It will be neat loud to the point 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.110
 there and that camels over camels 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.970
 to be thrown 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.470
 Reason enough as already for 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 Weberschnacht thought 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 what can it do about it? 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.960
 happen when his camel's eye 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 So does that means if you dare from 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 in the eye with a camera hit 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.460
 Some of them had to do that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.409
 courts namely the court aachen 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.269
 and the district court cologne, of course, already 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.159
 to deal with it and who say who 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.519
 must attend a carnival parade 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:54.629
 expect that he also from one 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:57.299
 object is hit so there goes 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.760
 it is about need and that you look up 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.139
 can adjust certain things as well 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.019
 a decision about carnival 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:06.570
 For a long time, quite a lot said that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.420
 to be against loud noises on 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 Rosenmontag can not fight back 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.270
 that is also very interesting there 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.710
 Of course, that's clear 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.080
 These doubts come jurisdiction 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.620
 and that if the train is approved then 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.270
 may be the also extremely loud 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.960
 more difficult though if you have a lot 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.520
 is not drinking the next bar 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 place or not the next grade 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.160
 toilet finds and in the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.290
 public urinates 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.760
 that can sometimes be punished 100 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.410
 Euros are no rarity 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.030
 and there you can not say it was 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.280
 Carnival I did not find a club 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.159
 then either drink less 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.840
 or near a locality 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.870
 are and final message to the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.610
 foolish season comes from olg 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.700
 Munich had a meeting in 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.210
 family events for the 11.11 at 11 o'clock 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.040
 11 days 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.330
 The lawyers found that unpleasant 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.620
 wanted to take action against it 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.080
 but it said that it was a bit of humor 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.930
 at least, but also calm of the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.540
 disputes a family matter 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.300
 so can the olg munich 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.920
 Judges may also have decided 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.860
 sometimes be foolish 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.770
 in this sense may celebrates from cologne 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.970
 we wish you a nice day 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.310
 Nice workday if you are not in 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.290
 one of the foolish strongholds since 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.150
 otherwise I thank you for watching 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.150
 Bye and bye until next time
