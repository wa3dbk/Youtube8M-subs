00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
centripetal acceleration of about eight

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.720 
centripetal acceleration of about eight
point<00:02:32.660> two<00:02:32.900> two<00:02:34.090> meters<00:02:35.440> per<00:02:36.440> second<00:02:36.860> squared

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.370 

hopefully<00:02:40.730> pretty<00:02:40.940> straightforward<00:02:41.660> let's

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
hopefully pretty straightforward let's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.699 
hopefully pretty straightforward let's
try<00:02:42.620> one<00:02:42.860> more<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.250> make<00:02:43.370> sure<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.670> have<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:43.970> in

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
try one more to make sure you have it in

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.590 
try one more to make sure you have it in
this<00:02:45.709> problem<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.340> combined<00:02:46.790> mass<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.420> race

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
this problem the combined mass of a race

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.890 
this problem the combined mass of a race
car<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.989> its<00:02:48.140> driver<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.620> 600<00:02:49.160> kilograms

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
car in its driver is 600 kilograms

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.090 
car in its driver is 600 kilograms
traveling<00:02:50.900> at<00:02:51.019> constant<00:02:51.470> speed<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.890> car

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
traveling at constant speed the car

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.830 
traveling at constant speed the car
completes<00:02:52.489> one<00:02:52.819> lap<00:02:53.030> around<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.630> circular

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
completes one lap around the circular

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.180 
completes one lap around the circular
track<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.470> radius<00:02:54.830> 160<00:02:55.610> meters<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.090> 36<00:02:56.720> seconds

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
track of radius 160 meters in 36 seconds

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.009 
track of radius 160 meters in 36 seconds
calculate<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.340> speed<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.850> car<00:02:59.030> yeah

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
calculate the speed of the car yeah

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.840 
calculate the speed of the car yeah
that's<00:03:00.260> kind<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.769> light<00:03:01.010> car<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.640> the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
that's kind of a light car but the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.559 
that's kind of a light car but the
alright<00:03:02.510> we'll<00:03:02.690> do<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> problem<00:03:04.450> speed<00:03:05.450> or

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
alright we'll do the problem speed or

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.810 
alright we'll do the problem speed or
the<00:03:05.630> car<00:03:05.870> let's<00:03:06.530> take<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.890> average<00:03:07.070> speed<00:03:07.579> is

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
the car let's take the average speed is

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.580 
the car let's take the average speed is

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
going to be distance traveled divided by

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.729 
going to be distance traveled divided by
