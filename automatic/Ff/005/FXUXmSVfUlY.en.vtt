00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
negative points for me are the fact you

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.349 
negative points for me are the fact you
have<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.950> assemble<00:04:15.280> everything<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:16.030> would<00:04:16.269> have

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
have to assemble everything I would have

they've<00:04:18.790> obviously<00:04:18.910> got<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.239> reason<00:04:19.419> for

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
they've obviously got the reason for

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.390 
they've obviously got the reason for
doing<00:04:19.959> that<00:04:20.109> because<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:20.560> need<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.830> adjust<00:04:20.950> it

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
doing that because you need to adjust it

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.850 
doing that because you need to adjust it
to<00:04:21.580> your<00:04:21.760> own<00:04:21.940> particular<00:04:22.300> needs<00:04:22.600> as<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.650> say<00:04:23.830> I

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
to your own particular needs as I say I

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.050 
to your own particular needs as I say I
would<00:04:24.130> have<00:04:24.160> liked<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.430> have<00:04:24.669> seen<00:04:24.850> it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
would have liked to have seen it

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.460 
would have liked to have seen it
preassembled<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.900> then<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.140> would<00:04:26.290> make

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
preassembled and then you would make

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.280 
preassembled and then you would make
adjustments<00:04:27.160> if<00:04:27.280> necessary<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.810> other<00:04:28.990> thing

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
adjustments if necessary the other thing

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.860 
adjustments if necessary the other thing
is<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.620> quite<00:04:29.950> heavy<00:04:30.280> now<00:04:31.240> it's<00:04:31.419> built<00:04:31.780> like

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
is it is quite heavy now it's built like

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.290 
is it is quite heavy now it's built like
this<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.710> accommodate<00:04:33.340> really<00:04:33.669> heavy<00:04:33.850> cameras

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
this to accommodate really heavy cameras

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.820 
this to accommodate really heavy cameras
but<00:04:34.450> there's<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.690> lot<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.050> way

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
but there's a lot of way

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.219 
but there's a lot of way
in<00:04:35.889> all<00:04:36.129> of<00:04:36.310> these<00:04:36.430> parts<00:04:36.940> already<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:38.080> you're

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
in all of these parts already so you're

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.710 
in all of these parts already so you're
already<00:04:38.650> already<00:04:39.009> carrying<00:04:39.669> quite<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.419> big

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
already already carrying quite a big

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.869 
already already carrying quite a big
weight<00:04:41.020> around<00:04:41.440> your<00:04:41.860> waist<00:04:42.099> before<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.610> even

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
weight around your waist before you even

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.999 
weight around your waist before you even
added<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.150> camera<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.629> it<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.710> there's<00:04:44.919> a

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
added a camera to it so there's a

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.159 
added a camera to it so there's a
negative<00:04:45.370> point<00:04:45.879> in<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.240> way<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:47.020> this

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
negative point in the way that this

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.760 
negative point in the way that this
comes<00:04:47.710> in<00:04:47.949> that<00:04:48.069> already<00:04:48.220> but<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:50.080> has<00:04:50.379> to<00:04:50.620> be

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
comes in that already but it has to be

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.159 
comes in that already but it has to be
made<00:04:51.009> robust<00:04:51.490> because<00:04:51.759> it's<00:04:52.000> built<00:04:52.419> to<00:04:52.900> carry

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
made robust because it's built to carry

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.589 
made robust because it's built to carry
a<00:04:53.289> professional<00:04:54.159> level<00:04:54.460> camera<00:04:54.879> so<00:04:55.509> you've

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
a professional level camera so you've

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.330 
a professional level camera so you've
got<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.750> camera<00:04:56.020> with<00:04:56.379> a<00:04:56.409> zoom<00:04:56.710> lens<00:04:56.949> you<00:04:57.190> might

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
got a camera with a zoom lens you might

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.279 
got a camera with a zoom lens you might
have<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.520> thousand<00:04:58.120> two<00:04:58.389> thousand<00:04:58.870> pounds

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
have a thousand two thousand pounds

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.670 
have a thousand two thousand pounds
around<00:05:00.069> your<00:05:00.310> waist<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:01.080> so<00:05:02.080> this<00:05:02.289> has<00:05:02.440> got<00:05:02.560> to

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.379 
be very well engineered and it's got to

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:07.980
