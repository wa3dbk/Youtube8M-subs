00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:06.633
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:11.733
 Today we are going to discuss with you the Soviet 5th-order fighter LaGG-3. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.033
 This fighter is very interesting in many ways. 

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:28.567
 It was the first fighter in the Lavochkin fighter branch and opened the way to the Yakovlev branch. 

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.100
 In addition, it has many configurations 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.133
 But first, important 

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.433
 Its predecessor in this branch is I-16 (late model) 

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:46.200
 Unfortunately, LaGG-3 only inherits the RS-82 rocket and has the opportunity to remove one of the 12.7 mm BS machine guns. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.267
 In addition, LaGG-3 does not have the incredible mobility of I-16. 

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:59.800
 In contrast, the LaGG-3 has doubled its blood volume, is faster, and can be fitted with cannons up to 37 mm in size. 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.600
 Sounds great 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.600
 LaGG-3 looks pretty good compared to other fighters in the same class. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.267
 Its durability is second only to Focke-Wulf and American fighters. 

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.167
 It's very mobile 

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:16.633
 In this respect only A6M2 Zero and Yak-1 outperform it 

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:22.867
 LaGG-3 has a wide selection of weapons, and you can adjust its characteristics to suit your personal flight style. 

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:29.300
 With all available weapons installed, the LaGG-3 has the strongest firepower and lowest speed compared to its competitors. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.267
 The highest configuration of the LaGG-3 is second only to the P-40 and Fw.109V, but its weaponry is poor. 

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:45.967
 We recommend a 23-mm VYa-23 cannon and two 12.7 mm BS machine guns. 

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:49.200
 You may ask, why not install a 37 mm cannon? 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.067
 Unfortunately, its accuracy and rate of fire are very low, and it is prone to overheating. 

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:58.433
 Well, now that we understand the fighter, we also chose its configuration. 

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.567
 Then start fighting. 

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:04.833
 We are the first in the list 

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:10.400
 According to its specifications, the best flight height of LaGG-3 is 1050 meters. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.467
 However, it can also easily fly at altitudes of up to 1500 meters. 

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:20.400
 At the beginning of the battle, fly to the enemy with a group of Allied fighters at a height of 500 meters. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.600
 You can play forwards during the battle, or you can launch attacks in the second or third wave. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.400
 Only when there is support from the Allied fighters can you devote yourself to a large-scale melee. 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.600
 When flying alone, the LaGG-3, like the same fighter, can easily become the target of attack. 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.233
 Should attack enemy aircraft with better mobility first 

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:42.633
 They are more threatening than high-altitude aircraft 

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:48.133
 Try to intercept them as they fly through them, or shoot down planes that try to attack their teammates from behind. 

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:51.033
 For those enemy aircraft that are not so good, you can take a frontal attack. 

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.367
 The next target should be the US and German fighters. 

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.467
 Avoid the boom-zoom attacks they launch 

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:58.800
 Later we will tell you how to do this. 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.267
 Fight with them, don't let them climb to the sky 

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:04.133
 Avoid frontal attacks on them 

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:08.133
 190V armed equipment is as good as LaGG-3 

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.133
 Heavy fighters are harder to fight back 

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.500
 Try to win with strategy, don't let them speed up and run away 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.800
 Don't stay too long behind heavy fighters, or their rear gunners will destroy you. 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.900
 Destroying the attack machine is very easy 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.700
 But don't distract yourself, because a bomb can attack you. 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.133
 Sometimes LaGG-3 may also be at the bottom of the list. 

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.767
 However, this is not a problem for this fighter. 

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:42.300
 At this point, you should stay behind the higher-ranking Allied fighters and choose the target more carefully. 

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:49.400
 Monitor the situation around you at any time, so as not to fall into the enemyâ€™s fierce fire and stay with the large group of Allied aircraft. 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.667
 LaGG-3's sophisticated weapons and good maneuverability make it easier to deal with such battles. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.100
 Let's summarize 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.100
 LaGG-3 is a very well controlled aircraft 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.167
 With a wide selection of components, players can choose any tactic they like while maintaining good mobility. 

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:10.700
 This adaptability makes LaGG-3 successful against almost all of the same class aircraft. 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.900
 If you are still not sure which branch you want to study, today the protagonist of our story will help you make the right choice. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So experiment and make the best choice 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.067
 LaGG-3 will help you achieve this
