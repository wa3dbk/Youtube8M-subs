00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.370
I’m going to take you through how to assemble
a typical gas lift bar stool.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.870
The good news is it’s incredibly quick and
easy.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.910
Unpack your bar stool, and lay each piece
out in front of you.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.220
A typical gas lift stool consists of six different
components: the base, the hydraulic column,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.390
the footrest column, the seat, and four screws.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.160
Some also have a decorative collar like this.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.440
We also include an Allen key- the only tool
you’ll need to put your stools together.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.520
You’ll notice a small plastic protective
cap on top of the hydraulic column.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.200
This is a safety feature to protect the hydraulic
mechanism during transit, and it’s important

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.620
you remove it before assembling your stool.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.750
Put the hydraulic column into the base, and,
if there’s a decorative collar, drop it

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.700
over the top.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.469
Next, the seat needs to be attached to the
footrest column.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.730
The easiest way to do this is by turning the
seat upside down, and placing it on a flat

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.730
surface.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.430
Take the footrest column and place it on top
of the seat, making sure that the footrest

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.770
aligns with the front of the seat, and that
your screw holes are all aligned.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.660
You can screw in the screws using the Allen
key, and make sure that they’re nice and

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.370
tight so that the seat and the column are
secure.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.990
Now, you’re ready to put it all together.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.460
Lower the seat and the footrest over the hydraulic
column.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.550
And to secure it all in place, just sit down
and lift the handle beneath. That will activate

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.709
the gas lift mechanism.
To increase the height, get off the stool

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.640
and lift the handle again.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.580
You might notice a slight bounce on the seat
as you get on and off. This is completely

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.450
normal and just shows that the gas lift mechanism
is working as it should.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.750
If you’ve got any questions, don’t hesitate
to get in touch.
