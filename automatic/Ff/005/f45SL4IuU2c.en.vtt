00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:15.520
 can not imagine what things we talk about 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.460
 is in our special site how is 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.640
 fashionable in guys and that was going to creation 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 the mercedes good if you do I already think that 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.089
 more or less two years in workshops and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.429
 the principle always provided that 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:33.280
 minus one person and it's chemistry with that 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.140
 person is an amazing mine I always 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.490
 she said she is a person with a lot 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.650
 light is pure is sincere is sensitive and is 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.690
 innocent and unless I'm full 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.960
 soul then I want to love her and 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.550
 protect it every time we always 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.500
 we laugh a lot because we get along very 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.210
 well what united us very much also 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.610
 because they have put us together in the same 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.010
 dressing room then we saw after the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.420
 experiences inside the dressing room always 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.650
 we are talking between changes and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.750
 changes and we have to change 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.670
 very fast we are talking here 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.140
 very good private also by 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.880
 walls that can not be said but the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.189
 true that they are experiences of friends 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.110
 that are super cute without end and always 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.680
 lie for me 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.600
 I'm always kind of my dressing room or me 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.900
 something happens or cry because I'm that 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.540
 sensitive that guy has gone what happens is 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.580
 that still does not finish putting the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.710
 joy and the issste has changed as 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.510
 20 minutes ago and it's fine only 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.400
 with looking at us we do not understand everything 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.300
 what do we want to say to her today and 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.290
 she says 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.290
 I think the same 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.910
 and do not give up, you can 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.740
 the difference is incredible between the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.870
 fiction and reality because in 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.690
 supposedly dsk we should not study 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.700
 and quite the opposite we want and is 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.470
 simple and complicated to work additional 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.330
 It is complicated because there is so much 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.250
 connection between us that the sessions 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.060
 we sat down because there are some things and 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.490
 we understand 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.490
 and there are times that it is kind for them 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:26.260
 it's connection between you and me 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:31.720
 on the back of this song 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.700
 it's so different this is a person that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.319
 It's there when you're going to need an area 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 where the morning of 4 in the morning and 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.599
 can come to your house of seven friends I 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.790
 I am with you and help me and listen to their 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.069
 advice is like listening with advice 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.370

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.930

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.620
 Havana pleasure consider now that I'm 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.349

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.519
 a co -worker also because 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.260
 I feel myself and that I learn to do 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.829
