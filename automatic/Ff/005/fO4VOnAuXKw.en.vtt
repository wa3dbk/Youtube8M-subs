shows that this is a pretty good device
in<00:02:21.300> terms<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.690> gaming<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:23.030> multitasking<00:02:24.170> so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
in terms of gaming and multitasking so

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.930 
in terms of gaming and multitasking so
that<00:02:25.290> was<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> gullible<00:02:26.720> benchmark<00:02:27.720> west
