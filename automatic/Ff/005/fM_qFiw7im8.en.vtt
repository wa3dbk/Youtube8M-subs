00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello welcome example with 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.660
 my childrens toy 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.880
 you see smart play and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.309
 that's my five favorite 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.780
 integrated smart playdough and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.820
 I want to tell you today we show 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.690
 meanwhile have a big collection 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.340
 over 15 plasticine and yes these five have 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.380
 I also just picked the one 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.180
 i like the best why i like it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.930
 best I 'll like that now 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.599
 Again, these strawberry shake show 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.160
 intelligent kneading I think that's great 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.020
 because that can change the color though 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.950
 even if the color does not change 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.540
 It looks really great 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 sued directly for strawberry from eltmann 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.070
 but you also consider that directly 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 after honors report and where to put these 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.230
 almost right 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.829
 I think every time anew the must 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.399
 but strawberries always crumbled 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.410
 beautiful 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.350
 and that can change the color 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.680
 besides, of course, that has the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 intelligent plasticine properties 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.619
 like all of them you can make this beautiful 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.909
 pull apart 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.560
 and how can you tear in any case 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.869
 I like this one very well 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.970
 this one that makes the color change 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.850
 can and that stop without changing color 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.409
 I already look so beautiful for you 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 effect also gladly again before 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.600
 I have hot water here and there 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.600
 I just dove once my dough 1 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.430
 and then you see an easy fold 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.140
 transition it's a sms and it's dark 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.630
 when it's cold 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.210
 So that was the strawberry shake and now 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.140
 come one that is really a great one 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.000
 colour 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.360
 that's why i love the here so it is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.590
 pacific and the drivers are easy 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.070
 only beautiful 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.170
 that's a great blue shimmer 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.640
 and a few more glitter particles 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.869
 depending on how you hold it, you think 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 sometimes you still see a bit 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.910
 green and it really reminds me 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.160
 right on such a Pacific islands great 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.940
 dial more 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.760
 shine to this great glitz year's 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.910
 blue because of that it really is one 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 my dearest with intelligent 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.450
 glued masses 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.489
 she does not have a special one right now 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.320
 property therefore has the typical 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.570
 that you can just pull them 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.780
 like chewing gum that you tear apart 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.780
 can 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.480
 but otherwise she just thrills me 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.370
 only because of the great color because of 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.409
 their color inspires me here this 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.200
 e.on braids which we have brand new and 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:47.470
 that is so unbelievably devilish of color 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.650
 where I am always excited when 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.250
 I open that is so bright 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.900
 and so tight 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.639
 I have never seen something like that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.069
 even a highlighter is not like that 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.379
 glowing and how does it feel somehow 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.000
 also very agile and the 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.650
 I really like it too 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.129
 she does not have a special one either 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.689
 property except this great color like 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.849
 she always looks a bit orange 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:16.959
 or pink depending on how you use them 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:21.340
 really shines totally in now 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:25.060
 compared to both pink and the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.930
 shines so unbelievable so also one 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.849
 my favorite intelligent playdough 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.699
 also an absolute darling of mine is 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.099
 the magnetic we have here in two 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:39.190
 Colors in black are in blue and me 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.340
 but the black likes something better and 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.720
 I think they are just so good because they are so 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.479
 is interesting and so great 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.810
 has properties in here is yes 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:52.959
 a magnet hidden 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:57.670
 and the strong magnetic one can do that 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:00.220
 just lift these magnets up 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.129
 and if you do it this way 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.650
 then this magnet eats into the 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.480
 smart climbing and sometimes 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.560
 if you open the box then it looks 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.890
 even so oh so funny 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.510
 great surface so so handsome 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.609
 a bit because there are just little ones 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.850
 Iron particles are in this play dough 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.330
 and they just like to react a lot 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.889
 this little magnet and that belongs 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.630
 really also to my dearest in 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:37.210
 let stick gently and spares come 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.800
 me to the last glacier 1 that is too 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.330
 a beautiful color as I think 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.350
 I also like it so much 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.199
 And this is also one of the color 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.000
 can change and glow in the dark 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.210
 So this is a very special has 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.130
 two very special features and 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.900
 how she can change her color 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.310
 course, of course, if show again 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.330
 you finally get out of the packaging 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.669
 have rauskriegen of the totally years 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.740
 is a really nice need I think 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:12.010
 or you see the magnetic is that 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.010
 a really nice blue and I think great 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.280
 can shine from the dark and now 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.130
 Let's try it 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.460
 I have the water still here as the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.610
 your color can change easily 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.500
 keep water clean and you see 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.050
 light blue and a little darker blue so 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.510
 It's just like the earthquake 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:41.639
 it is cooler and it is something cooler 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:45.840
 warmer it's light for those five 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.950
 I decided I can not too 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.020
 do not decide which mine 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.880
 absolute favorite city believe this 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.570
 choose the color for me 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.190
 unbelievably beautiful is the neon flash bin 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.960
 I also always great from the color 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.940
 because that's just something special 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.150
 it just stands straight in the eye and 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.950
 I like that 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.660
 the two of them are great because of me 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.330
 just change the colors and 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:15.270
 simply interesting and exciting 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:17.460
 are and it shows the newly 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.770
 the changed their structure is said 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.370
 The completely pure and looks like this 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.010
 bit state then even off and 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.080
 how can you really be the most beautiful? 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.850
 I think I'm doing it 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.640
 really fun with the magnetic 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.320
 smart play 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.910
 yes that was my favorite 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.320
 intelligent playdoughs that are too 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.660
 my recommendation if you maybe 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.570
 want a plasticine does give 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.850

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.820
 Ocean but it is the Pacific ocean

 or is it the strawberry shake it is 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.910
 closer and flash is the glacier ice 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:34.680
