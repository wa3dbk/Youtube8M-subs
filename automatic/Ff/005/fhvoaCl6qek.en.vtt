 we are at 9:40 with coefficients of 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.210
 55 on this end of rising tide the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 offshore wind and aprons is south 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.020
 is an ace of Beaufort his own and we 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.790
 has a crowd that was the average to

 digs pretty waves on the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.210
 best sandbank and there are none 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 a lot because it closes anyway 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 a lot but on the best ben he 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 there are still pretty waves to have scored 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 the competition is launched there is already 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.320
 evolution show for the rest of the

 day 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.400
 the pic is already on the burqa

 luck was almost midnight with a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.090
 meter thirty and six seconds it's not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.500
 very beefy the cash drink is already at 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.420
 down to 1 m and 6 seconds 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 where it should stay until the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 mid day then start to run out of steam 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 in the evening with a wind that is planned 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560
 on keeping offshore until the beginning 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.430
 afternoon 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.080
 possibility of thermal breezes this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.299
 afternoon but attention index 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.420
 low confidence for the wind this 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.369
 afternoon we wait at 13h 80 cm west to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.210
 West North West 9 Second Van Period 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.250
 den 1 of Beaufort and at 17:50 80 cm can 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.460
 to be a little less or the west and west 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460
 North West 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.250
 or 9 second period with a year that is 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.230
 expected north of three good fort but who 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.550
 maybe take ambriz maybe 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.890
 stay with an offshore trend 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.030
 uncertain to watch next point 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.030
