00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.120
 gigabyte yes this is a beginner 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.990
 tablet what it currently for 69 euros

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.349

 Megapixel camera for front facing and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.780
 a 2 megapixel rear camera for 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.140
 Well, smaller snapshots I say 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.660

 does not fit sim card in that synonymous only 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 a wifi capitals for the couch and me 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.000
 think for 69 euros you can not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.000
 do a lot of wrong 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
 yes this outer packaging is around 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.829
 these little black stories 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.930
 carton and I want it too 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.630
 Let's see what I'm in there 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.799
 because the once hides the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.439
 bill still from meedia 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.250
 I 've already opened the tablet 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.350
 or the carton I have 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.220
 ever opened the tablet for me 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.909
 this hell out of the packaging and that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.450
 is that this is the black variant 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.720
 and it looks like it is very easy 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 still a display foil on it 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.930
 yes and the back is here 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.159
 I say ribbed 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.229
 Well carbon optics would almost say feel 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.140

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.110

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.219

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.649

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:13.110
 Once we had a fox a cleaning cloth 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.020
 for the display 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.020
 then, of course, the manual 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.050
 yes, then another one 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.550
 user manual and located here 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.160
 The socket adapter for the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.550
 domestic socket and for charging 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.720
 on the way and besides we still find 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.350

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.330

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.540
 display then on the right side 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.140
 we turn the microphone on and off 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 and the loud and quiet seesaw at the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.530
 bottom we have nothing on the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.130
 also not on the left side and up here 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.900
 we still have a headphone input for 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.049
 the 3 5 mm jack and of course the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:28.360
