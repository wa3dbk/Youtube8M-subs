look<00:02:14.100> right<00:02:14.250> there<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.700> mean<00:02:15.060> takes<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.110> little

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
look right there I mean takes a little

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.620 
look right there I mean takes a little
effort<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:16.740> they<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:16.920> bend<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:18.210> shoelaces

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
are waxed which in my opinion is better

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.010
