00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
hi I'm Sandra yonder with a naughty do

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.249 
hi I'm Sandra yonder with a naughty do
it<00:00:04.500> all<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.859> one<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.779> things<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:07.080> can

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
it all and one of the things you can

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.070 
it all and one of the things you can
make<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.830> double<00:00:08.370> strand<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:09.570> technique<00:00:09.929> is

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
make is a double strand the technique is

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290 
make is a double strand the technique is
different<00:00:10.260> from<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.130> single<00:00:11.550> strand<00:00:12.120> and

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
different from the single strand and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.580 
different from the single strand and
it's<00:00:12.450> definitely<00:00:12.690> different<00:00:12.929> from<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.290> multi

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it's definitely different from the multi

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.650 
it's definitely different from the multi
so<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.160> want<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.580> talk<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.630> know

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
so what I want to talk about is you know

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.570 
so what I want to talk about is you know
how<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:16.109> one<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.949> I'm<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.190> show<00:00:17.369> an

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
how to make one and I'm going to show an

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.599 
how to make one and I'm going to show an
example<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:18.539> how<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> used<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.039> double<00:00:20.220> strand

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
example of how I used a double strand

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300 
example of how I used a double strand
unit<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.180> part<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> component<00:00:22.650> piece<00:00:23.039> on

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
unit as part of as a component piece on

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.200 
unit as part of as a component piece on
a<00:00:23.369> necklace<00:00:24.060> which<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> did<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.859> so

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
a necklace which is what I did here so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
a necklace which is what I did here so
you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.330> make<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> shorter<00:00:28.140> units<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.920> use

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you can make a shorter units and use

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.930 
you can make a shorter units and use
them<00:00:29.250> as<00:00:29.369> components<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:32.070> materials

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
them as components and the materials

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.639 
them as components and the materials
that<00:00:33.030> I'm<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.420> using<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.590> to

depending on how tall you want your not

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.940 
depending on how tall you want your not
to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.320> record<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.710> thick<00:01:16.920> enough

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to be if the record is thick enough

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
to be if the record is thick enough
watch<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> could<00:01:18.150> slide<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
watch this you just you could slide your

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.890 
watch this you just you could slide your
needle<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.640> just<00:01:20.640> dust<00:01:20.909> slip<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.780> know

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
needle out and just dust slip you know

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.090 
needle out and just dust slip you know
your<00:01:22.049> cord<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:22.470> through<00:01:22.680> sometimes<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
your cord right through sometimes you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520 
your cord right through sometimes you
don't<00:01:23.189> even<00:01:23.310> need<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> needle<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
don't even need the needle so you just

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.940 
don't even need the needle so you just
don't<00:01:26.150> take<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.290> pull<00:01:28.680> on

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
don't take this out and then you pull on

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
don't take this out and then you pull on
this<00:01:29.130> side<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.579> tighten<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:32.270> let's<00:01:33.270> say

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this side to tighten it and let's say

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.499 
this side to tighten it and let's say
I'm<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.939> seven<00:01:35.939> inches<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.360> each

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
I'm going to go for seven inches on each

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.289 
I'm going to go for seven inches on each
side<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.710> I've<00:01:37.950> put<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.090> I'm

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
side so now that I've put that on I'm

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.179 
side so now that I've put that on I'm
going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> trim<00:01:42.770> you're<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> want<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
going to trim you're going to want to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
going to trim you're going to want to
leave<00:01:44.450> probably<00:01:45.450> about<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.600> maybe<00:01:45.899> two<00:01:46.140> or

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
leave probably about like maybe two or

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
leave probably about like maybe two or
three<00:01:46.409> inches<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> want<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.460> side<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
three inches if you want one side to be

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.249 
three inches if you want one side to be
two<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.420> three<00:01:48.479> inches<00:01:48.810> longer<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
two or three inches longer than the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.660 
two or three inches longer than the
other<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.399> clip<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:50.909> knot<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.670> then

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
other so you clip your knot and then

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.249 
other so you clip your knot and then
you're<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> take<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.119> longer<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you're going to take that longer one and

you take your glue and then you just
slide<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> rest<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> way<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:30.120> just

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.340 
let it dry and then you take that some
Clippers<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.480> just<00:02:33.750> come<00:02:33.990> in<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.260> you

Clippers so you just come in and you

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.010 
Clippers so you just come in and you
just<00:02:34.560> trim<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> sides<00:02:35.640> off<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:36.720> you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
just trim the sides off and then you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.780 
just trim the sides off and then you
know<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.410> your<00:02:37.800> double<00:02:38.280> strand<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
know you have your double strand and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.940 
know you have your double strand and
I'll<00:02:39.540> I'm<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.080> do<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.290> other<00:02:40.440> side<00:02:40.740> and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
I'll I'm going to do the other side and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.720 
I'll I'm going to do the other side and
I'm<00:02:41.040> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.190> show<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:43.130> when<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.340> connect

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
I'm going to show you when to connect

00:02:44.730 --> 00:03:16.070 
I'm going to show you when to connect
the<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.630> clasp<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:47.250> take<00:02:47.490> your<00:02:47.520> leather

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.660 

so<00:03:17.070> now<00:03:17.280> we're<00:03:17.550> going<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.910> find<00:03:18.690> our<00:03:18.900> long<00:03:19.200> end

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
so now we're going to find our long end

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.130 
so now we're going to find our long end
so<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.730> think<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:20.970> did<00:03:21.120> six<00:03:21.450> inches<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:21.870> each

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
so I think we did six inches so each

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.220 
so I think we did six inches so each
side<00:03:22.410> should<00:03:22.440> be<00:03:22.770> seven<00:03:23.130> inches<00:03:23.490> long<00:03:24.080> now<00:03:25.080> on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
side should be seven inches long now on

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.500 
side should be seven inches long now on
this<00:03:25.410> long<00:03:25.710> end<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:27.030> want<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.360> put

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
this long end is that you want to put

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:41.030 
this long end is that you want to put
your<00:03:27.660> clasp<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.420> go<00:03:33.720> once<00:03:34.790> twice

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.569 

you<00:03:41.579> take<00:03:41.849> this<00:03:42.120> out<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:44.180> pull<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.450> tighten

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
you take this out and pull to tighten

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.459 
you take this out and pull to tighten
basically<00:03:47.579> what<00:03:47.730> you've<00:03:47.909> done<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.540> this

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:49.469 
basically what you've done is this

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:51.589 
basically what you've done is this
you've<00:03:50.099> made<00:03:50.340> another<00:03:50.670> moose<00:03:51.000> knot<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.390> this

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
you've made another moose knot on this

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.229 
you've made another moose knot on this
and<00:03:51.870> except<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.890> have<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.579> second<00:03:53.939> cord<00:03:54.120> is

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
and except you have that second cord is

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.449 
and except you have that second cord is
going<00:03:54.299> right<00:03:54.629> through<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.260> Moose<00:03:55.469> knot<00:03:55.769> so

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
going right through the Moose knot so

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.640 
going right through the Moose knot so
maybe<00:03:56.730> that'll<00:03:57.000> help<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.629> visualize<00:03:58.620> what

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
maybe that'll help you visualize what

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.729 
maybe that'll help you visualize what
I'm<00:03:59.010> doing<00:03:59.340> better<00:03:59.549> so<00:04:00.329> now<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.930> come<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.260> here

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
finished so for this one what I did was

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.330 
finished so for this one what I did was
I<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.389> know<00:04:18.479> instead<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.810> having<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.410> double

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
I you know instead of having the double

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.960 
I you know instead of having the double
strand<00:04:20.910> as<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.120> component<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:22.639> it's<00:04:23.639> kind<00:04:23.880> of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
strand as a component I it's kind of

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.430 
strand as a component I it's kind of
sort<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.240> component<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:24.750> it's<00:04:24.870> mostly<00:04:25.080> it

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
sort of a component but it's mostly it

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.700 
sort of a component but it's mostly it
could<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.280> mostly<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:27.000> entire<00:04:27.330> necklace<00:04:27.780> so

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
could it's mostly the entire necklace so

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.710 
could it's mostly the entire necklace so
you<00:04:28.800> could<00:04:29.009> see<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.849> differences<00:04:30.509> in

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
you could see the the differences in

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.950 
you could see the the differences in
this<00:04:30.960> one<00:04:31.280> versus<00:04:32.280> this<00:04:32.490> one<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:32.880> it's<00:04:33.690> just

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
this one versus this one and it's just

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.779 
this one versus this one and it's just
part<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:34.349> you<00:04:34.530> know<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.680> versatility

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
part of you know the versatility

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.210 
part of you know the versatility
you<00:04:36.240> know<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.539> you<00:04:36.870> have<00:04:37.169> using<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:37.860> tools

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
you know that you have using this tools

that we can you get shortened things up
and<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.160> know<00:04:41.310> add<00:04:41.490> chain<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.389> here<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.050> used<00:04:43.710> a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
and you know add chain and here I used a

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.010 
and you know add chain and here I used a
macrame<00:04:44.190> slide<00:04:44.940> not<00:04:45.180> for<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.479> enclosure<00:04:45.780> and

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
macrame slide not for the enclosure and

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.950 
macrame slide not for the enclosure and
on<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.289> one<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:46.500> used<00:04:46.830> just<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.550> plain<00:04:47.849> ol<00:04:48.060> clasp

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
on this one I used just a plain ol clasp

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.140 
on this one I used just a plain ol clasp
and<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:49.409> used<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.919> loop<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.310> was<00:04:50.430> formed<00:04:50.909> from

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
and I used the loop that was formed from
