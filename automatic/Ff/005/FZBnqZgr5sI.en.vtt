00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
back since January it's a review on this

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.160 
back since January it's a review on this
device<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.650> called<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.519> Fitbit<00:00:12.170> basically

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
device here called the Fitbit basically

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
device here called the Fitbit basically
what<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.639> little<00:00:14.820> very

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
what it is is it's this little very

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.890 
what it is is it's this little very
small<00:00:16.490> device<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.520> gets<00:00:18.240> clipped<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.720> your

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
small device that gets clipped on your

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.800 
small device that gets clipped on your
belt<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.830> recommend<00:00:20.670> using<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.150> belt<00:00:21.570> clip

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
belt or I recommend using the belt clip

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.529 
belt or I recommend using the belt clip
that<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> comes<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:23.060> clip<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.300> your

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
that it comes with I clip it on your

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.929 
that it comes with I clip it on your
belt<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:25.050> pants<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:25.710> somewhere<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
belt your pants or somewhere on you and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.359 
belt your pants or somewhere on you and
it's<00:00:27.750> basically<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.230> glorified<00:00:28.410> pedometer

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
it's basically a glorified pedometer

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.999 
it's basically a glorified pedometer
pedometers<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> things<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.500> track

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
pedometers are the things that track

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.280 
pedometers are the things that track
every<00:00:32.340> step<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.300> basically<00:00:33.899> counts

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
every step you do and basically counts

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
every step you do and basically counts
up<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.559> many<00:00:34.739> steps<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.120> now

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
up how many steps so as of right now

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.869 
up how many steps so as of right now
I've<00:00:36.660> done<00:00:37.460> 2667<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.469> it<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.219> uses<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I've done 2667 I it but this uses the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.360 
I've done 2667 I it but this uses the
technology<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.200> wiimote<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> has

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
technology that's in a wiimote so it has

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
technology that's in a wiimote so it has
an<00:00:44.520> accelerometer<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.930> measures<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.770> only

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
an accelerometer so it measures not only

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.880 
an accelerometer so it measures not only
just<00:00:47.129> actual<00:00:48.000> steps<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.780> every<00:00:49.440> motion<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
just actual steps but every motion you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
just actual steps but every motion you
do<00:00:50.160> basically<00:00:50.610> measures<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> other<00:00:51.329> thing

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
do basically measures the other thing

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.610 
do basically measures the other thing
that<00:00:51.570> makes<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> different<00:00:52.260> than<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that makes it different than just a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.310 
that makes it different than just a
standard<00:00:52.980> pedometer<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.000> has<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> wireless

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
standard pedometer is it has a wireless

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.160 
standard pedometer is it has a wireless
sensor<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.120> long<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.420> you're<00:00:57.539> close

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
sensor here so as long as you're close

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.369 
sensor here so as long as you're close
to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.440> base<00:00:58.620> station<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.640> updates<00:01:00.260> or<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to the base station it updates or it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.700 
to the base station it updates or it
uploads<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:02.100> data<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.699> fitbit<00:01:03.390> com

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
uploads all your data to the fitbit com

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.469 
uploads all your data to the fitbit com
website<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.519> these<00:01:05.670> great<00:01:06.060> graphs

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
website and you get these great graphs

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
website and you get these great graphs
to<00:01:06.810> track<00:01:07.110> how<00:01:07.560> many<00:01:07.619> steps<00:01:08.070> you've<00:01:08.310> done<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to track how many steps you've done it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
to track how many steps you've done it
also<00:01:09.210> lets<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.570> enter<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> foods<00:01:10.860> you've

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
also lets you enter in the foods you've

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
also lets you enter in the foods you've
eaten<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.150> come<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.510> cloudy<00:01:12.810> scraps<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
eaten and to come so cloudy scraps so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
eaten and to come so cloudy scraps so
you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:14.000> basically<00:01:15.000> how<00:01:15.299> many<00:01:15.450> calories

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you can see basically how many calories

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.179 
you can see basically how many calories
you've<00:01:15.960> taken<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:16.799> how<00:01:17.009> many

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
calories you've burned on the device

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
calories you've burned on the device
itself<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.909> moved<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> around<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.810> but

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
itself so I moved it around a little but

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.609 
itself so I moved it around a little but
I<00:01:22.729> 2681<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:24.509> many<00:01:24.570> steps<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.200> took<00:01:25.229> now
