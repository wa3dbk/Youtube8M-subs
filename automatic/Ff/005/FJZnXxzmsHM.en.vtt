 Hi guys, there, beauty, what 's up? 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.100
 It's even for you that you want to know who you are. 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.199
 a cool camera tip for you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.640
 invest even to record videos to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.340
 You, the blogger, I like this thing. 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.279
 on the internet or also a good camera 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.390
 professional for you to have photos and videos 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.220
 legal with quality 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 The camera that I'm going to show you is that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.620
 not having 5 and that my new camera 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.660
 People give Christmas but the camera that I 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.750
 I always used this one that is recording 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.719
 now it's not here these 50 hours that is one 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.550
 Semi-professional camera has no way of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.800
 changing the lens this one is already a camera 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.920
 Can you change the lens right? 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.260
 now my next step is to buy one 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.420
 other lens I wanted to buy this one here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.719
 This improves the 55 boys I want 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 buying another is more difficult to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 in front of this camera you are recording 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.640
 it has no microphone in the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 microphone already built in then you 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.000
 you want 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 to attach a teacher of her to record 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 Better to have better audio quality 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 You will not succeed because she will be 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.689
 professional does not have this function to 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 You put the microphone, but this one. 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:29.180
 you already have this option that is here then 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.180
 Then you open it here. 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.399
 and you can attach a microphone right? 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.039
 according to the phone here and also put 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.649
 here on top of that microphone 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.960
 that is a good thing that I 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.090
 I also want to find what I want 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.069
 buy because it helps too loud 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.259
 mainly for example here now 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.229
 As a linked researcher, 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.350
 noise should listen to one of her cool 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.110
 is that you can focus on the object 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.140
 and I will focus on the background and it can stay 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.250
 automatically has the option here 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.280
 you may not be able to focus manually 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.500
 or focus automatically as you go 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.230
 It's filming, right? 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.079
 for you an example I beauty 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:36.760
 now i will put my hand in front 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:39.959
 he will focus now he is focused but 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.959
 anyway she has this functionality 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:54.100
 they do not have this focus functionality 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.250
 Automatic object to a fund to 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.660
 focus the object 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:04.780
 then it has an advantage of five and one 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.599
 little better in this legal aspect of it is 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.700
 she had then you can move 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.669
 her functions here on the screen 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.630
 you can not always touch the functions 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.569
 her here 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.169
 the same on the screen then this is 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:26.200
 cool, you can do that too 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:29.650
 whether it is automatic or manual focus 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.700
 You got here and here you are tightening. 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.590
 here you look at it by here 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.730
 or if you look here to focus on 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.030
 manually 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.560
 manually this agreement of schengen laughter 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.470
 to be able to touch these leather things and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.150
 lighting in the manual but I left it 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.159
 not automatic, now there's no card 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.000
 because if the pt here has not changed to the 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.860
 It 's because the captain is there. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.120
 option to record full HD movies is the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.980
 not so much quality movie so minor 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.620
 normal, I guess any camera you 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.140
 get this functionality 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.840
 but one thing I did not know I stayed 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.040
 July to you I did not know that 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.650
 camera memory card has 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.650
 Classification has class class 1 2 3 4 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.449
 5 6 which means implies that the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.750
 card speed 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.400
 in this camera is the 32 gig card nec 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.810
 and a half when I won the game was called 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.650
 here with my machine see a card 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.710
 30 turns 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.340
 but that machine that did not work she 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.020
 stayed there at most 30 seconds and a half and 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.539
 I'm talking mine what 's wrong with 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.220
 that mark and farm radu hence the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.410
 friend told me and then the manual book 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.690
 not also that it has this business of 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.430
 card speed then a card goes 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.620
 Exit is 32 gigs 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.030
 but he will not let the movie anymore 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.490
 30 seconds here because the speed 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.479
 the machine very slow and very card 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.340
 faster 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.919
 so it will speak more than the second movie 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.620
 30 seconds to shoot for alone 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.470
 automatically then I that card 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.820
 memory class 2 I think then to this 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.550
 machine that has to be at least with the 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.380
 56 you know and I did not know that for this 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.880
 that today I 'm not filming a letter 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.430
 Magna too but could not show 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.760
 that the way is an endless thing and 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.530
 You're buying a machine like that. 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.630
 when you went to win a 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.900
 memory already asks or if you buy 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.820
 popular if that is class 2 346 because 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.000
 it may be that the card is inserted and not 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.610
 it worked out and it did not work 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.940
 a 30 second movie card 44 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.590
 automatically but okay so I just 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.750
 I wanted to show you that this brand 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.000
 Thank you, I really like it 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.800
 I liked her a lot and eating like that 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.270
 Do you want to buy a camera and Mexican? 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.370
 we especially have the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.200
 better I hear too technical with more 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.740
 one for son that 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.360
 I think that I personally like is yourself 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.130
 illegal that can take right lens 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.760
 if you want to find other buy 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:01.300
 lenses have another objective neither 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.640
 It's cold there are details or some 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.520
 other things you can change the 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.410
 lenses that each lens has a 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.030
 functionality that is this 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.550
 in fact so if you want to invest 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.040
 in a blog machine to say that the 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.610
 illegal internet beauty use but so 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.020
 nowadays you do not necessarily need 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.120
 have a professional machine or 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.130
 semi-professional for you to smoke can 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.500
 shoot any little ones same 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.430
 option is more cheap can shoot with 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.560
 the cell phone 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.410
 nowadays there do not think 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.480
 there is already mobile support for 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.160
 shoot and you're going to come out of a light 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.310
 stronger or something 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.840
 Anyway, I think you need strength. 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.680
 of will if you want to smoke movie with 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.020
 that you have 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.640
 if it worked out, you did not invest 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.470
 a buck everything you get clothes 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.260
 a machine or raising money for 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.880
 buy a machine better anyway is everything 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.340
 a matter of time a matter of 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.200
 willpower okay i'm very 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.030
 happy right because this camera is 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.450
 filming was not mine, it's my mother's 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.580
 This one here is who does not though 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.200
 provided by her but now goes 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.510
 buying a memory card is good, right? 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.570
 at least speed and class I do not know 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.260
 with 60 looks to get another 20 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.850
 seconds because you do not have to call 31 ta 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.020
 without recording anything but that's it people waiting 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.990
 I enjoyed the video hope 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.940
 helped in fact just to show a 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.500
 machine features 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.780
 for you to know so you know 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.330
 which is also does not need to have a machine 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.430
 deny professional to shoot your blog
