 ebay pushed his following our case a person said 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.250
 not only could I pull you 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.830
 in the future I do not remember what I was getting drunk 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.569
 what do we know that the affected red is free 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.400
 so I will show you published 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 but this time produces to cuche while death 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.550
 last year 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.239
 signed a split screen 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.009
 but at least it's raining 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.009
 while you are alone 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.009
 for me all I have I'm Breton I was good 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
 we showed 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.490
 where I want to show that the first 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.200
 so everything is going pretty much that way 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.120
 I do not know yet to be too great 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 so apart my daughters if some 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 I will teach you to go up there 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.430
 great to filter the water 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.530
 and I'm going to teach you something 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.760
 what did we say about collecting these small traders 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.870
 baby has a lot of good things montpellier hÃ©rault 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.350
 graphically very easily 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.810
 we will learn that I received 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 if but if you look good 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.310
 but he admits 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
 as for 35% a release of extensions 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.950
 two platforms 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.640
 those who will lose what they do 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.610
 have lived 10 years in full swing 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.360
 I recommend various magog 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.820
 all right on them 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 but on our site 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.300
 a lot a lot a lot backed up once a second phase 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 it's very hard to do 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 for the moment I can not manage very well 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.970
 because it works 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.100
 That's what happens 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.010
 you do earlier 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.560
 the mouloudia the multipares 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.020
 hugo everywhere 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.730
 so very close 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.520
 to mount this assassination could be 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.479
 it's in vain 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.899
 2m 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.859
 I am in the office towards crans-montana 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.099
 and in full studio 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.689
 This is not rocket science 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.729
 earlier 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.419
 but for counterfeiting and congo 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.699
 and several slices 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.079
 so there you want so greens you have a big advantage 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.709
 skela 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.269
 I am someone who has a lot of time through death 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.039
 but then if the cup 8 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.039
 and then 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.449
 I'm warning you 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.209
 gayon running by there 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.459
 it is absolutely necessary a well a patch is free 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.759
 this delay I believe that costs 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.759
 why so many deaths art 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.059
 this is year 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.049
 here is Africa do not do 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.929
 to undertake something 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.259
 this book makes that he was tempted 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.259
 you have life on board 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.379
 so the attitude of the top doubs 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.229
 Melanie Laurent 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.089
 when I have to call him sooner
