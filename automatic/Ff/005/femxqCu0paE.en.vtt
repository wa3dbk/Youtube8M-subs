00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.599
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.030
 how to make this pretty bag that we can 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.619
 do with a facial wipe and that 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.990
 we can give as a memory of some 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.670
 some good holiday or event, 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.600
 materials that we are going to use are the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.570
 next we will occupy a wipe like 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.570
 is that regularly the size it brings 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.940
 they are 30 x 30 centimeters 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.460
 we will also need 50 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.890
 centimeters of the ribbon to do what 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.310
 is the handle of the sachet 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.720
 scissors 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.720
 needle with linden 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.199
 our skewer stick to mark 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.000
 foami that we will need our rule and 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.879
 how did I mention them a piece of 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.640
 Foami either in the color of the washcloth 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.820
 or it can be white the measures that 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.070
 We are going to need our hobby is a 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.450
 bit that has 15 points 5 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.800
 centimeters wide x 27 points 5 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.780
 centimeters long 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.850
 here I put the measure also 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.610
 we will need a little flower like this 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.590
 which is made with felt I leave the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.409
 link to the video where I showed how 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.920
 do them in case you like to put this guy 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.200
 as decoration 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.700
 we will also need good scissors 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.580
 so let's start then to do 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.860
 our pretty little bag 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.200
 The first thing we are going to do is place 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.170
 our comic about the towel but before 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.540
 we have to cut two the two corners 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.630
 from here for that let's measure three 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.300
 centimeters from here to here in both 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.300
 sides and 4.5 throughout 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.110
 - that in this way of the sachet 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.880
 Here he shows you the measurements again 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.620
 they have to cut 3 centimeters of 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.970
 here to here 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.970
 and then we are going to cut 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.010
 here previously and had marked 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.240
 to accelerate a little bit the time in the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.750
 good video now we put it on 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.670
 this way the edges have to be 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.130
 these that come in the wipe has 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.250
 to be on the sides and let's put 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.480
 our piece of foami so this one has 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.790
 to go to the bottom 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.790
 and now we are going to fold in this way 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.670
 and it has to be like that 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.010
 now let's double this part more or 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.580
 less towards the middle 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.580
 A) Yes 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.510
 pulling these corners very well so that 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.220
 it is well right of this part and not 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.180
 excel what is the towel on 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.180
 then better formed 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.590
 now here in this part we are going to set 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.910
 our towel 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.910
 and we are going to do this 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.980
 let's double from here 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.700
 here we do the same thing we make sure 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.900
 well that is the angle and we pull and we 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.900
 there has to be something like that 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.569
 and finally this part that we were left 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.879
 yes what is the little piece of foami 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.950
 it was so that we can double it from this 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:39.569
 way and it is already well-off and 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.650
 cover now we're just going to 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 close 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.209
 and look at it this way, there will be us 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.730
 been formed what is the sachet and 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.270
 you do not notice anything at all 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.610
 folds of the towel 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.220
 and nothing else now like it's a washcloth 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.840
 possibly they are going to reuse it 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.320
 for that is that we are going to occupy instead 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.390
 Glue a little bit of what kilo 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.540
 let's do is here 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.670
 let's put at once what is the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.730
 little flower 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.950
 so let's put here and we will 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.049
 Stitch him once with everything 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.549
 and what is the flower so that already 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.549
 everything is united 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.690
 we try that the stitch is in this 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.690
 part so you do not notice 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.310
 and already this petal will cover the stitch 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.460
 in this way, look, there will be 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.940
 fully formed what is the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.650
 sachet now sets the bar we are going to 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.889
 do the following we're going to pass it on 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.889
 here 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.729
 and the same thing we can paste or we're going 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.139
 to also give him some stitches so that 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.300
 stay united and afterwards only 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.300
 we go through this part here in 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.830
 Now you only have to cook the 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:35.510
 this part here to stay together 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.340
 completely as is this other and 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.260
 good to put a point of attack and 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.690
 look, we are much more confident 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.420
 and we will not be disarmed at the time 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.740
 the person who is the give away because 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.190
 I took like this 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.660
 well let's go then 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:55.480
 to meet you on both sides 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.140
 nothing more in if they are a few dimensions nothing more 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:03.660
 about three or so and it's here in the 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.660
 just little nothing else here 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.760
 grabbing this part this and the one below 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.569
 so that it fits 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.889
 we hide well what is the mudito 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.889
 not that way 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.060
 in fact the thread is not noticeable 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.680
 and as I mentioned they can make you 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.009
 I meditate or can cut him nothing further back 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.089
 from here 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.089
 and it will look good 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.710
 and now, look how easy and fast 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:05.450
 already our little bag 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.450
 and completely formal 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.660
 good friends, I hope that this 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.390
 craftsmanship is to your liking especially 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.250
 that they like their girls very much and we 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.430
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.430
 then
