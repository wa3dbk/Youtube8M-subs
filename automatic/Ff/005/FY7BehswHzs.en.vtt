foam<00:02:34.350> pad<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.800> very<00:02:35.070> hard<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:36.240> by<00:02:36.990> heating<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
foam pad is very hard but by heating it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.380 
foam pad is very hard but by heating it
up<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.830> by<00:02:38.010> polishing<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.700> will<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.150> very

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
up and by polishing it will get very

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.870 
up and by polishing it will get very
soft<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.410> hard<00:02:40.770> part<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.460> will<00:02:41.760> do

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
soft with the hard part of it I will do

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.060 
soft with the hard part of it I will do
the<00:02:42.000> abrasive<00:02:42.480> part<00:02:42.720> with<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.350> fine<00:02:43.530> part<00:02:43.860> I

the abrasive part with the fine part I

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.390 
the abrasive part with the fine part I
will<00:02:44.460> get<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> high<00:02:44.850> gloss<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.780> pad<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.320> a

pattern cut it inside a buffing pad out
of<00:02:52.410> foam<00:02:55.820> I'll<00:02:56.820> put<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.240> on<00:02:57.330> my<00:02:57.510> machine<00:02:57.930> I<00:03:00.230> put

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
of foam I'll put it on my machine I put

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.259 
of foam I'll put it on my machine I put
some<00:03:01.500> compound<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.730> pad

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:16.910 

now<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.329> want<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.290> smooth<00:03:11.590> everywhere

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.059 

and<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.640> will<00:03:18.819> start<00:03:19.060> polishing<00:03:20.700> with<00:03:21.700> around

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
and I will start polishing with around

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.949 
and I will start polishing with around
1700<00:03:24.069> rpm<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.730> can<00:03:27.939> do<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.180> by<00:03:28.329> hand<00:03:28.510> as<00:03:28.720> well

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
1700 rpm you can do it by hand as well

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.830 
1700 rpm you can do it by hand as well
but<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.379> will<00:03:29.560> take<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> lot<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.370> time<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
but it will take you a lot of time to

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.470 
but it will take you a lot of time to
get<00:03:31.989> out<00:03:32.049> these<00:03:32.799> sand<00:03:33.430> marks<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.120> now<00:03:37.359> I'm

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
get out these sand marks so now I'm

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.670 
get out these sand marks so now I'm
going<00:03:37.629> to<00:03:37.719> start<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.139> machine

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
going to start the machine

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.280 
going to start the machine
I<00:03:38.709> use<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.639> Rufus<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.359> big<00:03:40.540> foot<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.959> new<00:03:41.079> one

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
I use the Rufus the big foot the new one

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.129 
I use the Rufus the big foot the new one
with<00:03:41.590> twelve<00:03:41.859> millimeter<00:03:42.810> orbital<00:03:46.139> polishing

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
with twelve millimeter orbital polishing

00:03:47.139 --> 00:04:13.720 
with twelve millimeter orbital polishing
I<00:03:47.379> will<00:03:48.099> put<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> little<00:03:48.519> pressure

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.240 

in<00:04:13.790> my<00:04:14.420> first<00:04:14.720> step<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.260> have<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.800> use<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:15.980> little

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
in my first step I have to use a little

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.050 
in my first step I have to use a little
bit<00:04:16.370> pressure<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:18.739> get<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.280> hard<00:04:19.519> sanding

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
bit pressure to get the hard sanding

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.750 
bit pressure to get the hard sanding
marks<00:04:20.239> out<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:23.770> move<00:04:24.770> constantly<00:04:25.100> with<00:04:25.730> the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
marks out I move constantly with the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.800 
marks out I move constantly with the
machine<00:04:26.240> over<00:04:26.660> my<00:04:26.780> surface<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:28.360> I'm<00:04:29.360> going<00:04:29.690> to

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
machine over my surface and I'm going to

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:41.950 
machine over my surface and I'm going to
polish<00:04:30.200> over<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.560> edge<00:04:30.800> right<00:04:30.830> now

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.470 

everybody<00:04:42.889> can<00:04:43.160> see

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.780 

that<00:04:47.380> my<00:04:47.560> compound<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:49.770> not<00:04:50.770> getting<00:04:51.160> dry<00:04:51.460> and

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
that my compound is not getting dry and

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.960 
that my compound is not getting dry and
it<00:04:52.720> will<00:04:52.930> not<00:04:53.080> stick<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.680> surface<00:04:53.970> also

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
it will not stick to the surface also

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.780 
it will not stick to the surface also
the<00:04:55.120> surface<00:04:55.330> is<00:04:55.870> not<00:04:56.230> hot<00:04:56.530> because<00:04:57.220> we<00:04:57.610> use<00:04:57.760> a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
the surface is not hot because we use a

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.920 
the surface is not hot because we use a
very<00:04:58.360> special<00:04:58.900> foam<00:04:59.190> that<00:05:00.190> lets<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
very special foam that lets the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.770 
very special foam that lets the
temperatures<00:05:02.560> just<00:05:03.460> go<00:05:03.640> away<00:05:03.790> I<00:05:06.570> did<00:05:07.570> now<00:05:07.720> the

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
temperatures just go away I did now the

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.110 
temperatures just go away I did now the
first<00:05:08.140> part<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.590> polishing<00:05:09.160> I<00:05:09.310> took<00:05:09.790> out<00:05:09.940> the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
first part of polishing I took out the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.930 
first part of polishing I took out the
sand<00:05:10.360> marks<00:05:10.650> what<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.680> have<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.100> do<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.460> want<00:05:12.820> to

sand marks what I have to do I want to
have<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.120> high<00:05:13.360> gloss<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.140> I<00:05:14.170> put<00:05:14.560> up<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.860> speed

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
have a high gloss so I put up the speed

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:23.400 
have a high gloss so I put up the speed
and<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:16.270> go<00:05:16.450> very<00:05:16.720> gentle<00:05:17.260> over<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.740> surface

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.820 

you<00:05:24.410> have<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.860> do<00:05:24.980> it<00:05:25.130> with<00:05:25.310> passion<00:05:26.560> take<00:05:27.560> your

you have to do it with passion take your
time<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.460> watch<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.540> machine<00:05:30.100> how<00:05:31.100> it<00:05:31.340> will

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
time and watch the machine how it will

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.339 
time and watch the machine how it will
pass

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.670 

so<00:05:38.889> ladies<00:05:39.309> and<00:05:39.490> gentlemen<00:05:39.999> I<00:05:40.210> am<00:05:40.930> think<00:05:41.439> I
