over<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> last<00:00:39.570> couple<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> years<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> now

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
over the last couple of years and is now

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.819 
over the last couple of years and is now
really<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.460> taking<00:00:41.850> over<00:00:42.829> ionization

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
really kind of taking over ionization

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.799 
really kind of taking over ionization
alarms<00:00:44.129> use<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> very<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.940> tiny<00:00:45.239> amount<00:00:45.660> of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
alarms use a very very tiny amount of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.200 
alarms use a very very tiny amount of
radioactive<00:00:46.469> material<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
radioactive material and they use that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
radioactive material and they use that
to<00:00:48.420> detect<00:00:48.870> charged<00:00:49.230> particles<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.489> come

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to detect charged particles that come

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.990 
to detect charged particles that come
off<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.090> fire<00:00:52.219> they're<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> sort<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> particles

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
off a fire they're the sort of particles

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.770 
off a fire they're the sort of particles
that<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.239> mainly<00:00:54.870> come<00:00:55.110> off<00:00:55.260> come<00:00:56.010> off<00:00:56.160> flames

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
that are mainly come off come off flames

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.139 
that are mainly come off come off flames
which<00:00:57.780> means<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.440> ionization<00:00:59.280> alarms<00:01:00.030> are

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
which means that ionization alarms are

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.150 
which means that ionization alarms are
really<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.539> at<00:01:00.629> detecting<00:01:01.140> fast<00:01:01.559> flaming

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
really good at detecting fast flaming

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.529 
really good at detecting fast flaming
fires<00:01:02.399> where<00:01:02.760> there's<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> flame

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
fires where there's a lot of flame

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929 
fires where there's a lot of flame
really<00:01:03.899> quickly<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:05.129> later<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.640> some

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
really quickly and then later on some

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.550 
really quickly and then later on some
smoke<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.810> we're<00:01:06.930> talking<00:01:07.020> about<00:01:07.200> grease

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
smoke so we're talking about grease

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.660 
smoke so we're talking about grease
fires<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> kitchen<00:01:08.479> maybe<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> paper<00:01:09.869> fire

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
fires in a kitchen maybe a paper fire

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
fires in a kitchen maybe a paper fire
something<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.150> photoelectric<00:01:12.689> alarms

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
something like that photoelectric alarms

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
something like that photoelectric alarms
work<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> different<00:01:14.549> principle<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
work on a different principle that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.630 
work on a different principle that
actually<00:01:15.479> detects<00:01:16.020> larger<00:01:16.830> particles<00:01:17.369> which

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
actually detects larger particles which

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
actually detects larger particles which
are<00:01:17.790> typically<00:01:18.210> large<00:01:18.780> particles<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.409> smoke

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
are typically large particles of smoke

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.070 
are typically large particles of smoke
and<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.580> sort<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> particles<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.750> come<00:01:21.930> off

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and the sort of particles that come off

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170 
and the sort of particles that come off
in<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> fire<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.759> means<00:01:23.970> they're

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
in it in a fire this means they're

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
in it in a fire this means they're
really<00:01:24.299> good<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.659> detecting<00:01:25.040> smoky

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
really good at detecting smoky

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
really good at detecting smoky
smoldering<00:01:26.700> sorts<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> fires<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.720> those<00:01:27.840> are

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
smoldering sorts of fires and those are

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
smoldering sorts of fires and those are
actually<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:29.549> respects<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.060> much<00:01:30.240> more

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
actually in some respects a much more

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.780 
actually in some respects a much more
dangerous<00:01:30.630> sort<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.259> fire<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.740> clearly<00:01:32.400> flame

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
dangerous sort of fire I clearly flame

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.760 
dangerous sort of fire I clearly flame
is<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.329> dangerous<00:01:33.570> thing<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.049> when

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
is a really dangerous thing that when

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.560 
is a really dangerous thing that when
you<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> grease<00:01:35.280> fire<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> paper<00:01:36.240> fire

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you get a grease fire or a paper fire

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.999 
you get a grease fire or a paper fire
it's<00:01:36.750> almost<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.259> people<00:01:37.530> someone's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it's almost all people someone's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.280 
it's almost all people someone's
actually<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> has<00:01:39.000> caused<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
actually there and has caused it so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.600 
actually there and has caused it so
there's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> human<00:01:40.860> being<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
there's a human being right there and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.789 
there's a human being right there and
they<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.090> there's<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> fire<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.680> then

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
they know that there's a fire and then

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
they know that there's a fire and then
they<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.130> deal<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.759> escape<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
they can deal with it or escape the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.210 
they can deal with it or escape the
photoelectric<00:01:46.380> alarm<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.799> good<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.130> the

photoelectric alarm is good for the
smouldering<00:01:47.670> fire<00:01:47.939> which<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.390> happen<00:01:48.509> when

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
smouldering fire which can happen when

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.690 
smouldering fire which can happen when
for<00:01:49.079> example<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.470> an<00:01:49.560> electrical<00:01:50.100> short<00:01:50.340> or

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
for example if an electrical short or

builds<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.509> more<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.869> more<00:01:57.930> smoke<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.530> then

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
builds up more and more smoke and then

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.499 
builds up more and more smoke and then
eventually<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.700> could<00:01:59.850> be<00:01:59.969> hours<00:02:00.149> later

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
eventually it could be hours later

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
eventually it could be hours later
sometimes<00:02:01.049> gets<00:02:01.860> hot<00:02:02.009> enough<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.369> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
sometimes gets hot enough and it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.889 
sometimes gets hot enough and it
suddenly<00:02:02.640> erupts<00:02:03.119> into<00:02:03.240> flame<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.600> then

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
suddenly erupts into flame and then

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.899 
suddenly erupts into flame and then
you've<00:02:04.020> got<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.799> big<00:02:05.070> problem<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
you've got a really big problem the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.950 
you've got a really big problem the
trouble<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.270> you've<00:02:06.390> had<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:06.719> big

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
trouble is you've had a really big

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.510 
trouble is you've had a really big
problems<00:02:07.320> before<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.069> well<00:02:08.250> because

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
problems before then as well because

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.440 
problems before then as well because
you've<00:02:08.670> had<00:02:08.789> such<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> layer<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.750> toxic

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
you've had such a layer of toxic

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.420 
you've had such a layer of toxic
my<00:02:10.569> build<00:02:10.899> up<00:02:11.050> but<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:11.890> has<00:02:12.040> happened<00:02:12.340> at

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
my build up but if this has happened at

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.850 
my build up but if this has happened at
night<00:02:12.610> which<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.180> often<00:02:13.420> does<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:14.560> you're<00:02:14.769> in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
night which it often does and you're in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
breathing the smoke in it's harder and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.229 
breathing the smoke in it's harder and
harder<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.190> wake<00:02:18.400> up<00:02:18.610> because<00:02:18.819> you've<00:02:19.090> had

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
harder to wake up because you've had

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.119 
harder to wake up because you've had

less and less oxygen to breathe and

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.619 
less and less oxygen to breathe and
suddenly<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.580> wake<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.330> house<00:02:22.450> is

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
suddenly you wake up and the house is

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.970 
suddenly you wake up and the house is
full<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.900> smoke<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.410> panicked<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
full of smoke and you panicked and you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.309 
full of smoke and you panicked and you
don't<00:02:24.190> know<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.430> way<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.610> go<00:02:24.879> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
don't know which way to go the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.270 
don't know which way to go the
photoelectric<00:02:26.319> alarm<00:02:26.620> will<00:02:26.800> detect<00:02:27.099> that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
photoelectric alarm will detect that

photoelectric alarm will detect that
situation<00:02:28.000> almost<00:02:28.599> always<00:02:28.989> far<00:02:29.590> far<00:02:29.890> sooner

situation almost always far far sooner

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.610 
situation almost always far far sooner
than<00:02:30.459> an<00:02:30.550> ionization<00:02:30.880> alarm<00:02:31.569> will<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.349> that's

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
than an ionization alarm will and that's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.559 
than an ionization alarm will and that's
like<00:02:32.830> really<00:02:32.860> important<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.540> have

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
like really important if you have

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.330 
like really important if you have
photoelectric<00:02:35.349> alarms<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.010> your<00:02:36.040> house

photoelectric alarms in your house

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.110 
photoelectric alarms in your house
because<00:02:37.209> those<00:02:38.110> smoky<00:02:38.739> smoldering<00:02:39.310> fires<00:02:39.640> are

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
because those smoky smoldering fires are

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.420 
because those smoky smoldering fires are
real<00:02:40.360> killers<00:02:40.810> there's<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.560> lot<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:41.950> death<00:02:42.190> from

smoke inhalation in in household fires
it's<00:02:45.790> good<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.269> have<00:02:46.390> an<00:02:46.510> ionization<00:02:46.810> alarm<00:02:47.440> as

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
it's good to have an ionization alarm as

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
it's good to have an ionization alarm as
well<00:02:47.769> if<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.340> think<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.510> might<00:02:49.690> be

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
well if you think that might be

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.660 
well if you think that might be
important<00:02:50.349> they<00:02:51.040> are<00:02:51.190> more<00:02:51.400> prone<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
important they are more prone to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.610 
important they are more prone to
nuisance<00:02:52.180> alarms<00:02:52.329> typically<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.349> sort<00:02:53.530> of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
nuisance alarms typically the sort of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.930 
nuisance alarms typically the sort of
they're<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> sort<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.250> alarm<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.610> typically

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
they're the sort of alarm that typically

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.789 
they're the sort of alarm that typically
goes<00:02:55.180> off<00:02:55.390> when<00:02:55.599> you've<00:02:55.750> got<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> toaster<00:02:56.680> go

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
goes off when you've got the toaster go

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.860 
goes off when you've got the toaster go
in<00:02:56.980> for<00:02:57.130> example<00:02:57.610> that's<00:02:58.329> because<00:02:58.660> it's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
in for example that's because it's

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.750 
in for example that's because it's
producing<00:02:59.230> those<00:02:59.530> sorts<00:02:59.890> of<00:02:59.980> particles<00:03:00.670> that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
producing those sorts of particles that

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.550 
producing those sorts of particles that
I<00:03:00.880> mentioned<00:03:01.239> earlier<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.569> an<00:03:01.780> ionization

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
I mentioned earlier that an ionization

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.990 
I mentioned earlier that an ionization
detector<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.040> really<00:03:03.310> good<00:03:03.459> at<00:03:03.549> picking<00:03:03.670> up

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
detector is really good at picking up

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.699 
detector is really good at picking up
but<00:03:04.510> if<00:03:04.599> your<00:03:04.720> toaster<00:03:05.049> actually<00:03:05.319> catches

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
but if your toaster actually catches

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.809 
but if your toaster actually catches
fire<00:03:06.010> sure<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.610> need<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.180> know<00:03:07.390> about<00:03:07.510> that

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
fire sure you need to know about that

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.069 
fire sure you need to know about that
but<00:03:09.819> if<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.060> all<00:03:10.209> it's<00:03:10.390> doing<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.690> cooking<00:03:10.840> your

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
but if it all it's doing is cooking your

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.600 
but if it all it's doing is cooking your
toast<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.620> you're<00:03:11.709> standing<00:03:12.099> there<00:03:12.130> watching

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
toast and you're standing there watching

toast and you're standing there watching
a<00:03:12.849> cook<00:03:13.060> toast<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.900> alarm<00:03:14.200> goes<00:03:14.440> off

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
a cook toast and the alarm goes off

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.160 
a cook toast and the alarm goes off
that's<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.549> nuisance<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.750> happens

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
that's a nuisance and then that happens

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.900 
that's a nuisance and then that happens
too<00:03:17.350> often<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.829> take<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.160> batteries<00:03:18.609> out<00:03:18.730> of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
too often you take the batteries out of

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.780 
too often you take the batteries out of
the<00:03:19.030> alarm<00:03:20.069> suddenly<00:03:21.069> you're<00:03:21.190> not<00:03:21.220> protected

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
the alarm suddenly you're not protected

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.490 
the alarm suddenly you're not protected
from<00:03:21.910> fire<00:03:22.180> anymore<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:23.230> why<00:03:23.380> an

from fire anymore that's why an

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.289 
from fire anymore that's why an
ionization<00:03:23.829> alarm<00:03:24.489> shouldn't<00:03:24.819> be<00:03:24.880> put<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.209> in

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
ionization alarm shouldn't be put to in
