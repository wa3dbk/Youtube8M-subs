my<00:00:52.590> god<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> messed<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.800> performance<00:00:59.690> what<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
my god so messed up performance what the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
my god so messed up performance what the
hell<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> single<00:01:03.690> core<00:01:04.019> phone<00:01:04.519> I'm

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
hell is this a single core phone I'm

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.950 
hell is this a single core phone I'm
pretty<00:01:06.270> sure<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.200> oh<00:01:11.479> very<00:01:12.479> poor

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
pretty sure that is it oh very poor

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.270 
pretty sure that is it oh very poor
performance<00:01:13.670> definitely<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.850> playable

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
performance definitely not playable

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.420 
performance definitely not playable
let's<00:01:17.280> try<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.960> play<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.680> even

pretty sure about that you can check my

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.710 
pretty sure about that you can check my
channel<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.580> made<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> video<00:01:26.970> about<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.680> but<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
channel I made a video about that but I

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.850 
channel I made a video about that but I
can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:31.020> fire<00:01:33.259> what<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> hell<00:01:34.680> has

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
can see some fire what the hell has

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
can see some fire what the hell has
happening

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.470 

oh<00:01:39.810> my<00:01:40.620> god<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.280> performance<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.880> so-so

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
oh my god the performance is so-so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:57.170 
oh my god the performance is so-so
unoptimized<00:01:45.710> performance<00:01:47.510> what<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.750> hell

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.700 

let's<00:01:58.180> try<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.480> lower<00:01:58.900> some<00:01:59.200> settings<00:01:59.530> may<00:01:59.680> be

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
let's try to lower some settings may be

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.450 
let's try to lower some settings may be
running<00:02:00.250> on<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.520> max<00:02:00.900> I'm<00:02:01.900> not<00:02:02.260> sure<00:02:04.050> gain

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
running on the max I'm not sure gain

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.320 
running on the max I'm not sure gain
traffic<00:02:06.460> mode<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.240> light<00:02:08.789> let's<00:02:09.789> change<00:02:10.090> some

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
traffic mode to light let's change some

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.770 
traffic mode to light let's change some
more<00:02:10.509> settings<00:02:10.780> here<00:02:11.260> display<00:02:11.920> setup<00:02:12.780> visual

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
more settings here display setup visual

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
effects to low resolution to this then

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.220 
effects to low resolution to this then
everything<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.760> good<00:02:21.970> let's<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:22.780> if<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.110> have

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
everything is good let's see if we have

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.560 
everything is good let's see if we have
an<00:02:23.410> improvement<00:02:23.709> or<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.160> oh<00:02:26.940> my<00:02:27.940> god<00:02:28.180> I've<00:02:28.360> set

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
an improvement or not oh my god I've set

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.180 
an improvement or not oh my god I've set
the<00:02:28.720> settings<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:30.000> low<00:02:31.000> oh<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.980> can<00:02:33.340> see<00:02:33.520> now

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the settings to low oh you can see now

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.640 
the settings to low oh you can see now
when<00:02:36.190> there's<00:02:36.430> less<00:02:36.820> things<00:02:37.140> then<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.320> good

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
when there's less things then it's good

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.420 
when there's less things then it's good
but<00:02:39.209> actually<00:02:40.209> not<00:02:40.750> good<00:02:41.020> it's<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.310> know

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
but actually not good it's just you know

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.800 
but actually not good it's just you know
normal<00:02:42.850> but<00:02:44.250> as<00:02:45.250> soon<00:02:45.489> as<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.730> turn<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.390> here

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
normal but as soon as I turn on here

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.870 
normal but as soon as I turn on here
when<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.380> lot<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.950> stuff<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.250> happening<00:02:48.489> you

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
when you a lot of stuff is happening you

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.790 
when you a lot of stuff is happening you
can<00:02:48.940> see<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.270> performance<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.530> much

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
can see the performance is so so much

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.360
