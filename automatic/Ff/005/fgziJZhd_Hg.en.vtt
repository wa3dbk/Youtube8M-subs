00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
into hollows so far this so hopefully we

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.420 
into hollows so far this so hopefully we
don't<00:00:16.199> break<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.619> cycle<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.160> get<00:00:17.250> another

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
don't break that cycle and get another

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.519 
don't break that cycle and get another
hollow<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.060> video<00:00:18.359> see<00:00:19.020> these<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.260> from

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
hollow in this video see these are from

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.769 
hollow in this video see these are from
Toronto<00:00:20.100> calm<00:00:20.550> shallow<00:00:21.150> go<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.480> way<00:00:21.570> people

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Toronto calm shallow go that way people

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.320 
Toronto calm shallow go that way people
I<00:00:22.170> guess<00:00:22.439> people<00:00:22.470> listen<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.310> don't<00:00:24.180> have<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I guess people listen or don't have the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.429 
I guess people listen or don't have the
sound<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:24.810> i<00:00:24.840> watch<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.019> video<00:00:25.199> or

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sound on when i watch the video or

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.779 
sound on when i watch the video or
something<00:00:25.560> because<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.980> sometimes<00:00:26.490> still<00:00:26.640> get

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
something because I sometimes still get

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.910 
something because I sometimes still get
questions<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.689> yeah<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.019> logo<00:00:28.380> helps<00:00:28.650> prevent

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
questions so yeah the logo helps prevent

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.120

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
I guess three packs eyes are closed you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.479 
I guess three packs eyes are closed you
guys<00:00:35.250> can't<00:00:35.460> tell<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> no<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.149> still<00:00:37.489> think

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you go we got one of each this time I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410 
you go we got one of each this time I
said<00:00:43.829> getting<00:00:44.070> doubles<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.329> now

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
said getting doubles like we have now

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.069 
said getting doubles like we have now
let's<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.910> guess<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:49.070> not<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.579> this

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079
