that day and antimatter deck has a very
very<00:07:02.790> high<00:07:03.090> chance<00:07:03.660> of<00:07:03.930> winning<00:07:04.350> Nationals

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
very high chance of winning Nationals

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.820 
very high chance of winning Nationals
because<00:07:05.930> everyone's<00:07:06.930> playing<00:07:07.080> chaos<00:07:07.440> dragons

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
because everyone's playing chaos dragons

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.880 
because everyone's playing chaos dragons
is<00:07:07.980> the<00:07:08.250> cheapest<00:07:08.670> it's<00:07:08.910> easy<00:07:09.780> it<00:07:10.260> plays

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890 
is the cheapest it's easy it plays

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.120 
is the cheapest it's easy it plays
itself<00:07:12.140> because<00:07:13.140> again<00:07:13.380> down<00:07:13.710> a<00:07:13.740> rabbit<00:07:14.040> is

itself because again down a rabbit is

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.710 
itself because again down a rabbit is
great<00:07:14.370> it's<00:07:14.760> a<00:07:14.880> little<00:07:15.120> bit<00:07:15.240> more<00:07:15.450> expensive

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
great it's a little bit more expensive

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.780 
great it's a little bit more expensive
not<00:07:16.500> everyone<00:07:16.860> has<00:07:17.010> it<00:07:17.220> and<00:07:17.340> people<00:07:17.490> have

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:17.790 
not everyone has it and people have

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.280 
not everyone has it and people have
started<00:07:18.420> to<00:07:18.570> give<00:07:18.750> up<00:07:18.930> with<00:07:19.110> it<00:07:19.260> because

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
started to give up with it because

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.830 
started to give up with it because
realistically<00:07:20.000> not<00:07:21.000> everyone<00:07:21.420> can<00:07:21.540> win<00:07:21.690> with

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
realistically not everyone can win with

realistically not everyone can win with
it<00:07:21.960> and<00:07:22.550> in<00:07:23.550> the<00:07:23.640> diamond<00:07:24.360> rabbit<00:07:24.600> matchup

your opponent don't know chaos dragon no
offense<00:07:36.540> but<00:07:36.810> it<00:07:37.320> requires<00:07:37.620> a<00:07:37.740> lot<00:07:37.950> less<00:07:38.160> skill

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
offense but it requires a lot less skill

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.450 
offense but it requires a lot less skill
you<00:07:39.510> draw<00:07:39.720> better<00:07:39.930> hands<00:07:40.350> you<00:07:40.680> go<00:07:40.890> explosive

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 
you draw better hands you go explosive

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.580 
you draw better hands you go explosive
