to accommodate rock boots so you're

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.149 
to accommodate rock boots so you're
starting<00:01:42.420> you'll<00:01:42.659> find<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.950> foot

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159

you<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:56.130> extenders<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.090> these

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you do get little extenders so these

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
you do get little extenders so these
unscrew<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> side<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.740> fit<00:01:59.009> one
