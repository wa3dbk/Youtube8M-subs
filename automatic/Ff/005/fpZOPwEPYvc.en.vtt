00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:09.460
 so the bus can be like today again 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.650
 so match attax 2013/2014 cards from 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.019
 topscorer not much to say except that 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.440
 we have something special here this time 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.020
 and a package with ten players 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.300
 with ten players in it so ten cards 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.539
 in there and so here, so to speak 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.289
 we open here four booster a5 cards 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.869
 the cost is two euros instead of one euro 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.130
 but for sure you have club card and 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.690
 there player in it 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.480
 one or both cost two 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.700
 euro instead of 1 eur 16 players in it but it 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 it's worth it 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.590
 It's really worth it than you 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.840
 already opened two of them 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.340
 Unfortunately, without video we have to 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.610
 example this map pulled here 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.860
 once stefan kießling club 100 though 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.899
 also in such a bus with ten 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.000
 We are going to make similar players 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.379
 Pohl today if we said enough if you 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.439
 have questions just write one 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.999
 But comments should be everywhere 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.639
 to buy what the normal booster 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:15.490
 are we begin with the first year 

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:18.189
 Let's take a look at her there 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.709
 here are two are turned over the 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.299
 I'll lie down right now 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:25.950
 So mostly club card and star player is 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:33.179
 just in my head 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:40.539
 why catch nets so papadopoulos franz 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:43.709
 westermann elia and chipcard then 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.479
 once the club card is once 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.149
 düsseldorf and my power card is 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:54.689
 Once there, the book has also 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:59.590
 ever worth even match winner 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:03.909
 group as already said star player 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.770
 and logo definitely in there but us 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.909
 were lucky and have one right away 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.129
 pulled matchwinner 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.459
 very nice we come to the second 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.459
 booster 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:32.540
 once jip off once julien 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:38.260
 Once upon a time ben benira once 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.260
 peterson once sad but awesome if 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.940
 benaglio apologize once church like that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.959
 Now we come to the power cards 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.510
 once this one here as you like 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.579
 star player and we can see 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.139
 this time there is no club card 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.760
 Let's hope that's something else 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:03.819
 nice round and once ramos 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.129
 match winner 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.680
 we have now bought the extra 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.239
 with the ten players in it because we're in 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.909
 with these normal boosters 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.530
 five cards had little luck in it 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.269
 I think we had 10 brewsters there 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.169
 in total and not a matchwinner 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.919
 drawn 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.989
 and yes we can see 2 booster alike 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.060
 two matchwinners 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.010
 and as I said without joke last 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.629
 sometimes without video synonymous one to two 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.040
 piece opened and there even came 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:37.730
 club 100 out so you always have one 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.739
 logo card plus a star player or 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.319
 it half raises and you get 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.159
 matchwinner club 100 does what you think 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.079
 can get everything 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.109
 and what should we say to a pool 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.949
 I found him very nicely has 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.109
 definitely worth it 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:55.030
 and yes it often failed the video 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.030
 until next time euro-bus channel
