00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.539

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.470

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.470
 do not 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.980

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.050

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.109
 truth is that very good is liking a 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.879
 bunch and I think it's a video 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.729
 no, I do not think it represents 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.219
 much the roll of yes with a little this 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.219
 simple and very well written 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.310
 by name 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.270
 the truth is that I think you have to be 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.460
 positive in everything that in the end when one 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 is positive and tries to see things with 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.109
 that book energy that life brings you 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.590
 nice things and me now the truth I 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.590
 Is bringing 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.980
 but sometimes love us with our 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.340
 routes will get 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.079
 huecco 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.079
 and so how do we feel 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.020
 you can say a little bit that it consists of the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.119
 participation always 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.360
 but good that you do not know anything so that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.470
 you see there will be some collaboration very 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.420
 pretty and it's a very beautiful academy and the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.170

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.980
 artists yes yes yes yes me do not take me out 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.980
 from my paper 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.290
 is a girl who deserves it because a 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.420
 very sensitive and I think it's a 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.830
 scholarship that is going to come incredibly 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.830
 well to take everything inside 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.260
