00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
back then if this was a bubble or

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
back then if this was a bubble or
Romania<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.259> expect<00:01:43.619> gold<00:01:43.920> stocks<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
Romania you would expect gold stocks to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
Romania you would expect gold stocks to
be<00:01:44.670> outperforming<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.630> metal<00:01:46.200> because

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
be outperforming the metal because

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
be outperforming the metal because
that's<00:01:46.860> where<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.189> speculative<00:01:47.820> money

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that's where all the speculative money

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
that's where all the speculative money
flows<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> fact<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.409> nobody<00:01:49.829> has

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
flows but the fact that nobody has

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.399 
flows but the fact that nobody has
confidence<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.850> gold<00:01:51.149> enough<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> buy<00:01:52.170> these

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
confidence in gold enough to buy these

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
confidence in gold enough to buy these
stocks<00:01:52.740> shows<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> there's<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:53.970> much<00:01:54.119> fear

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
stocks shows that there's so much fear

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
stocks shows that there's so much fear
in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.899> gold<00:01:55.140> market<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.070> greed<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
in the gold market it's not greed and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120 
in the gold market it's not greed and
that's<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> antithesis<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.110> bubble<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.950> how

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that's the antithesis of a bubble so how

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.770 
that's the antithesis of a bubble so how
high<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.610> gold<00:01:59.969> prices<00:02:00.180> should<00:02:00.570> be

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
high do you think gold prices should be

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.800 
high do you think gold prices should be
I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.799> they're<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.310> higher<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.360> you

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I think they're going higher and you

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
I think they're going higher and you
know<00:02:03.899> there's<00:02:04.049> no<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.259> said<00:02:04.770> there's<00:02:04.920> no<00:02:05.070> floor

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
know there's no I said there's no floor

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119 
know there's no I said there's no floor
to<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.750> fiat<00:02:07.079> currencies<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.799> they<00:02:07.950> keep

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
to these fiat currencies if they keep

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.919 
to these fiat currencies if they keep
printing<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.610> particularly<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> dollar<00:02:09.360> so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
printing on particularly the dollar so

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.540 
printing on particularly the dollar so
there's<00:02:10.110> no<00:02:10.289> ceiling<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.950> price<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.430> gold

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
there's no ceiling to the price of gold

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.670 
there's no ceiling to the price of gold
but<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.270> if<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.870> look<00:02:13.050> at<00:02:13.200> gold

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
but really you know if you look at gold

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.589 
but really you know if you look at gold
is<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.159> a<00:02:14.189> thermometer<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.299> economy

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
is like a thermometer on the economy

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.240 
is like a thermometer on the economy
it's<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.019> I'm<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.200> doctor<00:02:16.620> takes<00:02:17.069> your

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's like I'm a doctor takes your

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.149 
it's like I'm a doctor takes your
temperature<00:02:17.609> and<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.819> got<00:02:17.939> 105<00:02:18.569> he<00:02:19.469> can't<00:02:19.739> he

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
temperature and you got 105 he can't he

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.800 
temperature and you got 105 he can't he
can't<00:02:20.189> just<00:02:20.579> send<00:02:20.939> you<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.209> way<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.540> mean

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
can't just send you on your way I mean

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.179 
can't just send you on your way I mean
obviously<00:02:22.230> there's<00:02:22.530> something<00:02:22.829> wrong<00:02:22.950> with

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
obviously there's something wrong with

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.190 
obviously there's something wrong with
you<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.609> you<00:02:23.760> wouldn't<00:02:23.939> have<00:02:24.000> 105<00:02:24.629> temperature

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
you or you wouldn't have 105 temperature

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.470 
you or you wouldn't have 105 temperature

yield<00:03:20.280> was<00:03:20.340> pretty<00:03:20.639> biggest<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.569> pay

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
yield was pretty biggest you have to pay

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.259 
yield was pretty biggest you have to pay
taxes<00:03:22.349> on<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.590> interest<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.729> course<00:03:23.909> the

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
taxes on that interest and of course the

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.030 
taxes on that interest and of course the
government<00:03:24.449> is<00:03:24.810> lying<00:03:25.079> about<00:03:25.440> inflation

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
government is lying about inflation

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.309 
government is lying about inflation
inflation<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.970> much<00:03:27.180> worse<00:03:27.449> than<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.079> three

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
inflation is much worse than the three

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.800 
inflation is much worse than the three
point<00:03:28.590> six<00:03:28.829> percent<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.819> CPI<00:03:30.180> shows<00:03:30.569> i

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
point six percent that the CPI shows i

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.869 
point six percent that the CPI shows i
think<00:03:31.199> is<00:03:31.319> closer<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.769> ten<00:03:32.069> percent<00:03:32.459> i<00:03:32.609> know

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
think is closer to ten percent i know

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.429 
think is closer to ten percent i know
what's<00:03:33.090> interesting<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.659> if<00:03:33.780> people<00:03:34.290> remember

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
what's interesting is if people remember

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.460 
what's interesting is if people remember
back<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.609> 1970s<00:03:36.180> when<00:03:36.599> richard<00:03:37.439> nixon

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
back to the 1970s when richard nixon

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.069 
back to the 1970s when richard nixon
imposed<00:03:38.310> wage<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.849> price<00:03:38.939> controls<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.810> was

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
imposed wage and price controls it was

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.439 
imposed wage and price controls it was
because<00:03:40.379> inflation<00:03:40.650> got<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.189> four<00:03:41.430> percent<00:03:41.609> so

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
because inflation got to four percent so

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
we were so worried about inflation of

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.009 
we were so worried about inflation of
the<00:03:44.489> four<00:03:44.729> percent<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.509> we<00:03:45.629> did<00:03:45.780> something

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the four percent that we did something

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.170 
the four percent that we did something
as<00:03:46.259> crazy<00:03:46.439> as<00:03:46.799> wage<00:03:47.009> and<00:03:47.250> price<00:03:47.310> controls<00:03:47.430> now

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
as crazy as wage and price controls now

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.030 
as crazy as wage and price controls now

that<00:06:31.890> there<00:06:32.040> may<00:06:32.160> not<00:06:32.280> be<00:06:32.340> enough<00:06:32.790> physical

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
that there may not be enough physical

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.750 
that there may not be enough physical
gold<00:06:33.590> yeah<00:06:34.590> that<00:06:34.800> might<00:06:34.950> be<00:06:35.160> the<00:06:35.190> case<00:06:35.340> they

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
gold yeah that might be the case they

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.980 
gold yeah that might be the case they
might<00:06:35.970> be<00:06:36.120> worried<00:06:36.450> that<00:06:36.480> some<00:06:36.810> of<00:06:36.900> these

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
might be worried that some of these

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.870 
might be worried that some of these
depositories<00:06:37.830> have<00:06:37.980> least<00:06:38.250> that<00:06:38.430> gold<00:06:38.700> out

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
depositories have least that gold out

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.830 
depositories have least that gold out
and<00:06:39.120> that<00:06:39.750> maybe<00:06:39.900> they<00:06:40.110> don't<00:06:40.200> actually

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
and that maybe they don't actually

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.450 
and that maybe they don't actually
have<00:06:41.169> it<00:06:41.410> or<00:06:41.530> they'll<00:06:41.740> have<00:06:41.889> difficulty

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
have it or they'll have difficulty

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.860 
have it or they'll have difficulty
getting<00:06:42.490> it<00:06:42.790> back<00:06:42.940> because<00:06:43.120> maybe<00:06:43.389> the<00:06:43.600> people

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
getting it back because maybe the people

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.050 
getting it back because maybe the people
they<00:06:43.990> leased<00:06:44.230> it<00:06:44.440> to<00:06:44.470> have<00:06:45.040> sold<00:06:45.370> it<00:06:45.520> and<00:06:45.669> maybe

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
they leased it to have sold it and maybe

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.939 
they leased it to have sold it and maybe
they<00:06:46.510> don't<00:06:46.660> have<00:06:46.870> the<00:06:47.050> ability<00:06:47.650> to<00:06:47.710> buy<00:06:47.889> it

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
they don't have the ability to buy it

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:48.990 
they don't have the ability to buy it
back<00:06:48.220> there<00:06:48.520> could<00:06:48.669> be<00:06:48.699> a<00:06:48.790> lot<00:06:48.850> of

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
back there could be a lot of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.180 
back there could be a lot of
counterparty<00:06:49.720> risk<00:06:49.750> so<00:06:50.590> that's<00:06:50.949> you<00:06:51.160> know

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
counterparty risk so that's you know

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.370 
counterparty risk so that's you know
people<00:06:51.850> just<00:06:52.090> want<00:06:52.270> to<00:06:52.419> have<00:06:52.570> the<00:06:52.780> gold<00:06:53.050> I<00:06:53.260> mean

sitting<00:07:14.169> in<00:07:14.260> a<00:07:14.320> warehouse<00:07:14.440> someplace<00:07:15.100> but<00:07:16.060> the

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
sitting in a warehouse someplace but the

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.140 
sitting in a warehouse someplace but the
only<00:07:17.050> thing<00:07:17.139> you<00:07:17.350> have<00:07:17.530> is<00:07:17.710> shares<00:07:18.040> in<00:07:18.310> the<00:07:18.760> ETF

only thing you have is shares in the ETF
and<00:07:19.360> the<00:07:19.900> question<00:07:20.229> is<00:07:20.320> what<00:07:20.530> if<00:07:20.620> that<00:07:20.770> goal

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:20.979 
and the question is what if that goal

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:22.650 
and the question is what if that goal
isn't<00:07:21.190> there<00:07:21.460> what<00:07:21.790> if<00:07:21.910> there's<00:07:22.120> Summit

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
isn't there what if there's Summit
