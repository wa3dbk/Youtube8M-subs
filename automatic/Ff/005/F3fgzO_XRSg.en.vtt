I think I need a new pair because my

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
I think I need a new pair because my
lashes<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.890> aren't<00:01:47.220> curling<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:47.939> well<00:01:48.060> as

curved upwards there it's got plastic

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
curved upwards there it's got plastic
bristles<00:02:09.090> which<00:02:09.360> are<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:09.629> favorite<00:02:10.080> type<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
bristles which are my favorite type of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.290 
bristles which are my favorite type of
bristles<00:02:10.849> never<00:02:11.849> thought<00:02:11.970> I'd<00:02:12.060> say<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
bristles never thought I'd say that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.520 
bristles never thought I'd say that
sentence<00:02:12.629> before<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:13.050> favorite<00:02:13.379> type<00:02:13.500> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
sentence before my favorite type of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.970 
sentence before my favorite type of
bristle

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
bristle

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.920 
bristle
so<00:02:14.520> we're<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> apply<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.480> coat<00:02:15.750> now

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
so we're just going to apply a coat now

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.530 
so we're just going to apply a coat now
and<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.410> how<00:02:16.440> we<00:02:16.680> go

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.839 

so<00:02:26.170> far<00:02:26.470> I'm<00:02:26.650> noticing<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.189> it<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.519> literally

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
so far I'm noticing that it is literally

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.399 
so far I'm noticing that it is literally
grabbing<00:02:28.390> every<00:02:29.049> single<00:02:29.680> lash<00:02:31.409> effortlessly

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
grabbing every single lash effortlessly

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.780 
grabbing every single lash effortlessly
usually<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:33.189> to<00:02:33.280> kind<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.489> go<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.700> at

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
usually I have to kind of go in at

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.490 
usually I have to kind of go in at
different<00:02:33.939> angles<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:35.079> get<00:02:35.200> all<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.409> little

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
different angles to get all the little

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.110 
different angles to get all the little
lashes<00:02:35.739> because<00:02:36.069> some<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:36.760> some<00:02:36.909> of<00:02:37.000> my

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
lashes because some because some of my

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.670 
lashes because some because some of my
lashes<00:02:37.480> are<00:02:37.629> short<00:02:37.900> some<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> them<00:02:38.349> are<00:02:38.470> long

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
lashes are short some of them are long

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.170 
lashes are short some of them are long
so<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.129> stick<00:02:39.370> different<00:02:39.790> ways<00:02:39.939> of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
so I'm going to stick different ways of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.119 
so I'm going to stick different ways of
just<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> most<00:02:40.659> awkward<00:02:40.959> lashes<00:02:41.260> ever<00:02:41.409> but

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
just the most awkward lashes ever but

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.800 
just the most awkward lashes ever but
this<00:02:42.250> seems<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.610> be<00:02:42.640> grabbing<00:02:43.090> like<00:02:43.239> every

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
this seems to be grabbing like every

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.660 
this seems to be grabbing like every
single<00:02:44.140> little<00:02:44.620> lash<00:02:44.860> with<00:02:45.250> very<00:02:45.489> little

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
single little lash with very little

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.360 
single little lash with very little
effort<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.590> far<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:53.980> good

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
effort so far so good

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.250 
effort so far so good
I'm<00:02:55.120> just<00:02:55.299> going<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.510> apply<00:02:55.689> to<00:02:55.810> my<00:02:56.019> other<00:02:56.170> eye

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
I'm just going to apply to my other eye

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.280 
I'm just going to apply to my other eye

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.879 
one coat of the mascara have to say very
very<00:03:03.220> impressed<00:03:03.909> the<00:03:04.629> formula<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.319> quite<00:03:05.500> dry

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
very impressed the formula is quite dry

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.470 
very impressed the formula is quite dry
it's<00:03:06.129> not<00:03:06.310> very<00:03:06.519> wet<00:03:06.730> which<00:03:06.909> i<00:03:07.060> think<00:03:07.329> is<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
it's not very wet which i think is a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.449 
it's not very wet which i think is a
fantastic<00:03:07.690> thing<00:03:08.109> my<00:03:08.409> eyelashes<00:03:08.980> are<00:03:09.010> really

fantastic thing my eyelashes are really

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.369 
fantastic thing my eyelashes are really
difficult<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.940> keep<00:03:10.150> curls<00:03:10.569> so<00:03:10.810> wet<00:03:11.019> lashes

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
difficult to keep curls so wet lashes

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.589 
difficult to keep curls so wet lashes

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
formula is really what I'm looking for

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.309

and<00:03:15.639> I'm<00:03:15.819> really<00:03:16.030> liking<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.569> spoon<00:03:16.810> shape<00:03:17.139> of

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
and I'm really liking the spoon shape of

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.899 
and I'm really liking the spoon shape of
the<00:03:17.409> one<00:03:17.560> because<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.040> literally<00:03:18.310> curves<00:03:18.670> kind

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
the one because it literally curves kind

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.520 
the one because it literally curves kind

more effortless to grab every lash I'm

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.479 
more effortless to grab every lash I'm
going<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.079> apply<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.620> second<00:03:24.129> coat<00:03:24.190> now<00:03:28.349> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
this is with a second coat I know it's a

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.930 
this is with a second coat I know it's a
little<00:03:32.709> bit<00:03:32.949> difficult<00:03:33.129> to<00:03:33.430> see<00:03:33.489> because<00:03:33.760> I

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
little bit difficult to see because I

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.420 
little bit difficult to see because I
have<00:03:34.120> quite<00:03:34.329> thick<00:03:34.599> eyeliner<00:03:34.989> on<00:03:35.230> today<00:03:35.530> but

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
the second coat added a little bit of

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.369 
the second coat added a little bit of
volume<00:03:39.780> while<00:03:40.780> it's<00:03:40.959> not<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.230> most

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
volume while it's not the most

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.050 
volume while it's not the most
volumizing<00:03:42.040> mascara<00:03:42.129> I've<00:03:42.519> ever<00:03:42.669> seen<00:03:42.879> in<00:03:43.030> my

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
volumizing mascara I've ever seen in my
