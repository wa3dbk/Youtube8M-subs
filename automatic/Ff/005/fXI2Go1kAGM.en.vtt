00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 to win it of coffee today we try one 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 blend of maya coffee to give rimoldi 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.950
 a handmade roasting of como 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.580
 the mixture we are experiencing today is the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.990
 blend from family bar means that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.199
 he did n't make it with coffee from a bar but 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.269
 with a slightly more robust note 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.300
 note of robust coffee for all 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.329
 days for the regions for beretta there 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.640
 now we have it with the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.879
 grinding from home espresso 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.760
 this mixture is composed of a 75 per 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.530
 one hundred of Arabica and 25 percent of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 robust so it's not nearly a total 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 100 per 100 Arabica but the robust serves 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.239
 to give thickness also give a little 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 creaminess to the mixture that yes 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.540
 can also consume home with a great one 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.530
 these are the grains 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.530
 ok let's pour 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.630
 you see there are reveals and tours 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.840
 however your structure is different 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.070
 made separately with a toasting 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.409
 manual gas then toasting and if it is 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.409
 just another artisan structure yes 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.319
 see the various types of 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.170
 click here there are some robusta beans 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:35.439
 and also that of Arabica 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.780
 now we grind it for the machine 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.780
 espresso from home and we try it 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.959
 we have 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:22.170
 we pour it and finish grinding 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.170
 now we enter 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.620
 capsule 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.620
 perhaps 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.590
 the cream is seen the layer of cream 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.000
 good looking is often due to the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.820
 greater percentage of robust cream 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.260
 however, the le is very uniform 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:03:00.530
 bubbles are very subtle fragrance 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.530
 the scent is just as intense as it is 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.470
 the other version at home, however, is heard 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.180

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.120
 suitable for both everyday but 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.329

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.849
