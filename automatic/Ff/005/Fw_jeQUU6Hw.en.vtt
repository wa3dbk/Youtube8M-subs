00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
so here's an update on the mule the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.309 
so here's an update on the mule the
garage<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.589> complete<00:00:05.250> mess<00:00:06.049> just<00:00:07.049> because

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
garage is a complete mess just because

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.410 
garage is a complete mess just because
I've<00:00:07.440> been<00:00:07.470> working<00:00:07.830> on<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.189> junk<00:00:09.179> here<00:00:09.510> but

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
I've been working on this junk here but

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.939 
I've been working on this junk here but
well<00:00:13.009> there's<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.250> old<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:15.529> there's<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.800> new

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
well there's the old one there's the new

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.929 
well there's the old one there's the new
one<00:00:17.720> involved<00:00:18.720> prettiness<00:00:19.789> you<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
one involved prettiness you got a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.640 
one involved prettiness you got a
problem<00:00:21.240> though<00:00:21.539> I'm<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.050> getting<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.410> switch

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
problem though I'm not getting to switch

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.519 
problem though I'm not getting to switch
twelve<00:00:22.980> volts<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.670> solenoid<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> won't

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
twelve volts to the solenoid so it won't

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.570 
twelve volts to the solenoid so it won't
turn<00:00:25.769> over<00:00:25.910> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> switch<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:29.250> think<00:00:29.490> it's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
turn over on the switch and I think it's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.089 
turn over on the switch and I think it's
defaulting<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:31.050> sensing<00:00:31.619> something

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
defaulting like it's sensing something

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.680 
defaulting like it's sensing something
is<00:00:32.340> wrong<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:33.360> far<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:34.020> safety<00:00:34.590> feature<00:00:34.950> wise

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
is wrong as far as safety feature wise

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.600 
is wrong as far as safety feature wise
it's<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.840> oil<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:38.100> doesn't<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
it's got oil in it it doesn't have the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.810 
it's got oil in it it doesn't have the
torque<00:00:38.850> converter<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.480> yet<00:00:40.820> hooked

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
torque converter on it yet hooked

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
torque converter on it yet hooked
everything<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:43.260> far<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.800> needs<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
everything up as far as what needs to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.540 
everything up as far as what needs to
get<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> started<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.420> trottle<00:00:46.050> works<00:00:46.550> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
get it started the trottle works the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.119 
get it started the trottle works the
choke<00:00:47.850> works<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:51.980> we're<00:00:52.980> not

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
choke works but you can see we're not

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.270 
choke works but you can see we're not
getting<00:00:53.489> anything<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.960> start<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
getting anything to start it with so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
getting anything to start it with so
something's<00:00:56.670> defaulting<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:58.230> isn't

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
something's defaulting out which isn't

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
something's defaulting out which isn't
good<00:00:59.210> but<00:01:00.210> uh<00:01:01.160> yeah<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.550> does<00:01:02.789> suck

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
good but uh yeah it really does suck

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
good but uh yeah it really does suck
work<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> hard<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.680> piece<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.010> jump

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
work that hard to get this piece of jump

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.580 
work that hard to get this piece of jump
in<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.549> did<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.270> 5:30<00:01:07.140> o'clock<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.560> the

worked until about 5:30 in the morning
got<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> engine<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:15.049> I<00:01:16.049> got<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.680> more

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
got the engine in and I got two more

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
got the engine in and I got two more
mounting<00:01:17.340> bolts<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> put<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.450> for<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
mounting bolts I need to put on for the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.490 
mounting bolts I need to put on for the
engine<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.580> got<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> tighten<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
engine and then I got to tighten up the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.330 
engine and then I got to tighten up the
torque<00:01:22.500> converter<00:01:23.689> plate<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.310> put<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
torque converter plate and put the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
torque converter plate and put the
torque<00:01:26.580> converter<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.530> try<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> find<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
torque converter back on try to find a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.300 
torque converter back on try to find a
way<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> start<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.829> yeah<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.159> should

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
way to start it and yeah then it should

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.880 
way to start it and yeah then it should
be<00:01:32.430> running<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> figure<00:01:34.770> out

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
be running but then I got to figure out

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
be running but then I got to figure out
what's<00:01:35.100> wrong<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.640> switch<00:01:36.270> 12<00:01:36.630> volts

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
what's wrong with that switch 12 volts

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.160 
what's wrong with that switch 12 volts
and<00:01:39.229> yeah<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.560> can't<00:01:40.860> figure<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
and yeah if I can't figure it out then I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
and yeah if I can't figure it out then I
don't<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.530> kind<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> suck<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.060> uh

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
don't know I kind of suck but uh

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.410 
don't know I kind of suck but uh
hopefully<00:01:46.079> we'll<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.409> figured<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
hopefully we'll get it figured out and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
hopefully we'll get it figured out and
get<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.509> started<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:49.680> we're<00:01:50.340> suppose

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
get it started up because we're suppose

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.590 
get it started up because we're suppose
we<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> ton<00:01:51.030> more<00:01:51.090> snow<00:01:51.509> tonight<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
we get a ton more snow tonight and it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
we get a ton more snow tonight and it
would<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.110> awesome<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:55.920> there

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
would be really awesome to go out there

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.899 
would be really awesome to go out there
and<00:01:56.850> try<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.270> thing<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.070> but<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.790> see

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and try this thing in it but I don't see

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.209
