00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.229
Sloths: you probably know them as the most
adorable creatures on the planet.

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:12.520
But, you might want to think twice before
snuggling with one, because their fur is actually

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.350
home to whole communities of organisms—some
of them not so cute.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.130
To begin with, sloths are often covered in
green symbiotic algae, which keeps them camouflaged

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.560
in the trees where they live.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.949
But that's not all—their fur is also home
to sloth moths.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.000
Over 120 sloth moths have been found on a
single sloth at a time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.579
There are a few different species, but most
of them have pretty similar lifestyles.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.340
They live in the sloth's fur, and feed on
the algae, along with sloth skin secretions.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.200
They even mate on the sloth.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.381
On three-toed sloths, when it's time for the
females to lay their fertilized eggs, they

00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:00.510
wait until the sloth takes a bathroom break.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.409
This doesn't happen very often—three-toed
sloths only climb down from their tree about

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.780
once a week to poop—when they do, the female
moths lay their eggs in the poop.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.610
Soon the eggs hatch, and coprophagous, or
poop-eating moth larvae emerge.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.200
And, when the larvae mature, they fly up into
the trees looking for another sloth to colonize.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.460
This is all very well for the moths, but this
bizarre bathroom behavior has puzzled scientists

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.720
for years—being close to the ground makes
sloths vulnerable to predators, so why bother

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.510
leaving the canopy for a trip to the toilet?

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.340
Recently, scientists suggested that the sloths
are actually getting a meal out of this deal.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.090
It turns out that the moths may help cultivate
the fur algae by providing it nutrients.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.810
And the algae may do more than just camouflage—the
sloths may actually eat it, as well.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860
It's a tiny ecosystem, all in the fur of a
sloth.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.490
But, algae and poop-eating sloth moths are
just the beginning.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.629
Sloths also harbor scarab beetles in their
fur—as many 980 of them on a single sloth!—along

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.890
with mites that live in their skin and in
their butts.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.629
And on top of that, they have been known to
carry a variety of human diseases, including

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.510
leishmaniasis, a single-celled parasite that
causes major skin lesions.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.459
Of course, this menagerie living in their
fur makes sloths an important part of the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.579
Central American ecosystem.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.650
So, while we should do our parts to preserve
sloths and their habitats, you might want

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.790
to think twice before hugging one.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:53.920
Unless you'd like to snuggle with a few moths,
as well.
