00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
going to be involved in the entranceway

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.819 
going to be involved in the entranceway
because<00:01:44.880> let's<00:01:45.119> face<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.570> guys<00:01:45.750> even<00:01:46.740> though

because let's face it guys even though

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.800 
because let's face it guys even though
we<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.250> got<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> entrance<00:01:48.000> wager<00:01:48.540> matches

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
we can got the entrance wager matches

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.600 
we can got the entrance wager matches
that's<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> lot<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> stuff<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> do

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that's really not a lot of stuff to do

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.420 
that's really not a lot of stuff to do
up<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.659> added<00:01:52.170> some<00:01:52.470> oh<00:01:52.619> my<00:01:52.740> god<00:01:52.920> moments

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

up there so added some oh my god moments
the<00:01:53.759> kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.240> general<00:01:54.600> area<00:01:54.780> but

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the kind of that general area but

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.859 
the kind of that general area but
basically<00:01:56.070> give<00:01:56.369> us<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.610> reason<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.060> finally

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
basically give us a reason to finally

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.350 
basically give us a reason to finally
use<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.100> may<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> those<00:02:00.060> could

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
use it so it may be one of those could

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.450 
use it so it may be one of those could
be<00:02:00.390> throwing<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.320> opponent<00:02:01.950> from<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> mini

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
be throwing your opponent from the mini

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
be throwing your opponent from the mini

in<00:02:05.189> John<00:02:05.369> Cena<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.210> all<00:02:06.390> made<00:02:06.689> sense<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
in John Cena but all made sense and that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.070 
in John Cena but all made sense and that
one<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.280> kind<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.789> cool<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.239> another

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
one would be kind of cool to see another

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.290 
one would be kind of cool to see another
one<00:02:10.289> would<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.950> again<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> same<00:02:12.030> area

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
one would be in again in the same area

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.080 
one would be in again in the same area
in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
in

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.410 
in
Boldin<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.480> big<00:02:13.750> WWE<00:02:14.709> logo<00:02:14.970> maybe<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.300> can

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
Boldin the big WWE logo maybe you can

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.699 
Boldin the big WWE logo maybe you can
sell<00:02:16.629> your<00:02:16.690> opponent<00:02:17.140> crashing<00:02:17.470> through<00:02:17.650> that

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
sell your opponent crashing through that

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.440 
sell your opponent crashing through that
light<00:02:18.430> will<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.670> kind<00:02:18.879> of<00:02:18.910> cool<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.120> see<00:02:19.330> as

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
light will be kind of cool to see as

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.990 
light will be kind of cool to see as
well<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.440> think<00:02:20.650> both<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.920> those<00:02:21.190> would<00:02:21.790> make

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
well so I think both of those would make

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.449 
well so I think both of those would make
sense<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.360> add<00:02:22.629> like<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.319> said<00:02:23.709> generally

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
sense to add like I said generally

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.640 
sense to add like I said generally
speaking<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.690> too<00:02:25.870> much<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.230> do<00:02:26.440> up

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
speaking there's not too much to do up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.040 
speaking there's not too much to do up
in<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.860> entranceway<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.970> having<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.239> couple<00:02:28.599> of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
in the entranceway so having a couple of

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.720 
in the entranceway so having a couple of
all<00:02:29.230> my<00:02:29.349> gold<00:02:29.590> moments<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.190> would<00:02:30.610> be

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
all my gold moments of that would be

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.059 
all my gold moments of that would be
definitely<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:31.330> cool<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.890> another<00:02:32.890> one

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
definitely be cool to see another one

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.309 
definitely be cool to see another one
actually<00:02:33.190> involved<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.030> area<00:02:34.239> again<00:02:34.660> for

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
actually involved in that area again for

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.259 
actually involved in that area again for
the<00:02:35.379> same<00:02:35.560> reasons<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.519> be<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.819> oh<00:02:36.940> my<00:02:37.120> god

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
the same reasons would be it oh my god

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.780 
the same reasons would be it oh my god
moment<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.900> FRU<00:02:38.140> opponent<00:02:38.680> actually<00:02:39.489> got<00:02:39.640> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
moment the FRU opponent actually got the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.449 
moment the FRU opponent actually got the
stage<00:02:40.060> maybe<00:02:40.690> even<00:02:41.080> at<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> table<00:02:41.620> or<00:02:42.099> into<00:02:42.430> the

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
stage maybe even at a table or into the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.550 
stage maybe even at a table or into the
electorate<00:02:42.970> or<00:02:43.120> something<00:02:43.390> like<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.560> again

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
electorate or something like that again

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.410 
electorate or something like that again
we've<00:02:44.860> seen<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.250> plenty<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.610> times<00:02:45.700> over<00:02:46.299> the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
we've seen that plenty of times over the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.720 
we've seen that plenty of times over the
years<00:02:46.510> in<00:02:46.900> ewwe<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.430> one<00:02:48.579> would

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
years in ewwe so that one would

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.309 
years in ewwe so that one would
definitely<00:02:49.060> made<00:02:49.239> sense<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:49.810> definitely

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
definitely made sense and definitely

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.800 
definitely made sense and definitely
have<00:02:50.799> some<00:02:51.099> potential<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:52.329> what<00:02:52.510> would<00:02:52.660> make

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
have some potential and what would make

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
the chokes time through the ring like we

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.410 
the chokes time through the ring like we
talked<00:03:26.920> about<00:03:27.010> before<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:28.000> one<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.299> actually

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
talked about before this one is actually

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.050 
talked about before this one is actually
a<00:03:28.690> cutscene<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.799> can<00:03:30.040> be<00:03:30.190> used<00:03:30.459> in<00:03:30.670> Korea

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
a cutscene that can be used in Korea

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.270 
a cutscene that can be used in Korea
story<00:03:31.389> mode<00:03:31.630> on<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> previous<00:03:32.290> games<00:03:32.560> both

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
story mode on the previous games both

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.789

think<00:03:33.670> having<00:03:33.880> this<00:03:34.090> animation<00:03:34.590> actually<00:03:35.590> in

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
think having this animation actually in

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.710 
think having this animation actually in
the<00:03:36.099> match<00:03:36.340> rather<00:03:37.060> than<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.389> separate

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
the match rather than a separate

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.930 
the match rather than a separate
cutscene<00:03:38.170> would<00:03:38.739> definitely<00:03:39.130> be<00:03:39.280> cool<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.700> see

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
to be talking about on this one is
