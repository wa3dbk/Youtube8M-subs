here<00:01:05.810> in<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.020> West<00:01:06.229> we<00:01:06.950> have<00:01:07.400> begun<00:01:07.939> to

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
here in the West we have begun to

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.170 
here in the West we have begun to
articulate<00:01:08.960> for<00:01:09.170> brainwave<00:01:10.100> States<00:01:10.490> those

four brainwave states have direct
correspondences<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.079> states<00:01:15.619> of

consciousness from the Pranava the four
brainwave<00:01:18.890> states<00:01:19.220> are<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:20.450> beta<00:01:20.810> or<00:01:21.140> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
brainwave states are the beta or the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.700 
brainwave states are the beta or the
waking<00:01:22.130> state<00:01:22.640> now<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.540> beta<00:01:23.810> brainwave<00:01:24.350> is

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
waking state now the beta brainwave is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.580 
waking state now the beta brainwave is
actually<00:01:25.400> vibrating<00:01:25.909> a<00:01:26.060> 12<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.630> 30<00:01:26.900> Hertz<00:01:27.290> or

actually vibrating a 12 to 30 Hertz or
vibrations<00:01:28.340> per<00:01:28.640> second<00:01:29.080> then<00:01:30.080> we<00:01:30.229> move<00:01:30.380> to

vibrations per second then we move to

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.830 
vibrations per second then we move to
the<00:01:30.590> alpha<00:01:31.100> brainwave<00:01:31.520> state<00:01:31.850> which<00:01:32.120> is<00:01:32.150> 8<00:01:32.510> to

12 Hertz or vibrations per second then
we<00:01:36.140> move<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.500> theta<00:01:36.920> brainwave<00:01:37.460> state

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
we move to the theta brainwave state

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.460 
we move to the theta brainwave state
which<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.120> four<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.540> eight<00:01:38.780> Hertz<00:01:39.080> or

deep<00:01:58.159> sleep<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.780> you'll<00:01:59.960> start<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.590> see<00:02:00.680> that

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
deep sleep so you'll start to see that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.190 
deep sleep so you'll start to see that
there<00:02:01.490> are<00:02:01.520> parallels<00:02:02.210> between<00:02:02.360> these<00:02:02.930> two

pieces and what happens is the brain

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.840 
pieces and what happens is the brain
waves<00:02:06.110> as<00:02:06.439> we<00:02:06.590> move<00:02:06.799> through<00:02:06.830> these<00:02:07.220> states<00:02:07.610> of

mind or consciousness are literally

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.820 
mind or consciousness are literally
slowing<00:02:10.849> down<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.900> goes<00:02:12.080> from<00:02:12.230> beta<00:02:12.560> which

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
slowing down so it goes from beta which

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.670 
slowing down so it goes from beta which
is<00:02:12.860> 12<00:02:13.549> to<00:02:13.670> 30<00:02:13.939> Hertz<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.930> delta<00:02:15.349> which<00:02:15.530> is
