one of the important steps in regulating

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.430 
one of the important steps in regulating
pianos<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.220> some<00:00:05.750> regulating<00:00:06.750> or<00:00:06.870> adjusting

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
pianos is some regulating or adjusting

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.370 
pianos is some regulating or adjusting
the<00:00:07.710> hammer<00:00:07.950> blow<00:00:08.189> distance<00:00:09.200> here<00:00:10.200> where

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the hammer blow distance here where

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.330 
the hammer blow distance here where
we've<00:00:10.710> got<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.920> view<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.630> piano<00:00:12.630> from<00:00:13.080> above<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
we've got a view of piano from above the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.519 
we've got a view of piano from above the
Hammers<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.839> see<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> distance

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
Hammers so you can see the distance

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.279 
Hammers so you can see the distance
between<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.789> Hammers<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.869> we've<00:00:18.990> got<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
between the Hammers here we've got the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.929 
between the Hammers here we've got the
Hammers<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.070> front<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.430> Hammers<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
part that strikes the strings and right

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
part that strikes the strings and right
over<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> strings

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
over here we have the strings

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.800 
over here we have the strings
okay<00:00:25.170> now<00:00:25.970> having<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.449> correct

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
okay now having this the correct

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.380 
okay now having this the correct
distance<00:00:28.380> between<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.640> face<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.150> hammer

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
distance between the face of the hammer

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.709 
distance between the face of the hammer
and<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> string<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:32.360> crucial<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.570> that's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and the string is crucial and that's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.250 
and the string is crucial and that's
part<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.910> part<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> regulation<00:00:36.660> process

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
part of part of the regulation process

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.130 
part of part of the regulation process
now<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.129> first<00:00:38.790> show<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.140> how

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
now here we're gonna first show you how

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.160 
now here we're gonna first show you how
to<00:00:40.200> measure<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.980> check<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
to measure and check to see what the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.930 
to measure and check to see what the
what<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.780> blow<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.200> blow<00:00:46.440> distance<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
what the blow and blow distance is and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
what the blow and blow distance is and
then<00:00:48.120> we'll<00:00:48.239> show<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> regulate<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
then we'll show you how to regulate that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400 
then we'll show you how to regulate that
or<00:00:49.770> adjust<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.969> needed<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
or adjust it if it's needed now in this

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740 
or adjust it if it's needed now in this
here<00:00:52.739> I've<00:00:52.920> got<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> six<00:00:54.030> inch<00:00:54.239> stainless<00:00:54.510> steel

here I've got a six inch stainless steel

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.410 
here I've got a six inch stainless steel
rule<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.500> both<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.370> millimeters<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
rule which both has millimeters and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.799 
rule which both has millimeters and
inches<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:59.489> close<00:00:59.730> as<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> thirty<00:01:00.329> seconds

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
inches up as close as the thirty seconds

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.609 
inches up as close as the thirty seconds
of<00:01:00.899> an<00:01:01.020> inch<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:03.210> we're<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.449> show<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
of an inch and here we're gonna show the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
of an inch and here we're gonna show the
distance<00:01:05.810> from<00:01:07.310> from<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> hammer<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
distance from from the hammer to the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.359 
distance from from the hammer to the
string<00:01:09.540> which<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.110> again<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.860> called<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
string which would again be called the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.399 
string which would again be called the
the<00:01:11.610> blow<00:01:11.790> distance<00:01:12.330> okay<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.320> I'm

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the blow distance okay now what I'm

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.999 
the blow distance okay now what I'm
gonna<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.950> put<00:01:14.189> my<00:01:15.320> mustiness<00:01:16.320> steel<00:01:16.740> rule

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
gonna do is put my mustiness steel rule

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.450 
gonna do is put my mustiness steel rule
here<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.520> between<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:19.189> hammer<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
here down between the hammer and the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.940 
here down between the hammer and the
string<00:01:22.189> as<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:27.829> now<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
string as you can see it's about now you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
string as you can see it's about now you
want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> make<00:01:29.280> sure<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.729> you're<00:01:30.329> gonna<00:01:30.540> your

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
want to make sure that you're gonna your

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.660 
want to make sure that you're gonna your
your<00:01:31.170> ruler<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.860> straight<00:01:32.310> across

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
your ruler is going straight across

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219 
your ruler is going straight across
because<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.479> angled<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
because if you have it angled like this

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.370 
because if you have it angled like this
either<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.790> that's<00:01:36.030> gonna<00:01:36.170> skew<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
either down or up that's gonna skew the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.499 
either down or up that's gonna skew the
the<00:01:37.799> measurement<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.360> can

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the measurement for you but as we can

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.530 
the measurement for you but as we can
see<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.020> we're<00:01:40.860> looking<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.280> about<00:01:41.540> 42

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
see here we're looking at about 42

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.999 
see here we're looking at about 42
millimeters<00:01:43.409> okay<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.210> if<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> were<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> put<00:01:46.009> my

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
millimeters okay or if I were to put my

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.200 
millimeters okay or if I were to put my
slider<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.880> 42<00:01:48.420> millimeters<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:50.210> can

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
slider here on 42 millimeters you can

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.920 
slider here on 42 millimeters you can
see<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:52.610> 42<00:01:53.610> millimeters<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.420> about<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
see that 42 millimeters is about the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.280 
see that 42 millimeters is about the
same<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.299> over<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:58.140> in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
same it's just a little over one in

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.620 
same it's just a little over one in
five-eighths<00:01:58.799> okay<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.450> one

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
five-eighths okay or it's gonna be one

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.359 
five-eighths okay or it's gonna be one
in<00:02:00.780> twenty<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.290> thirty<00:02:01.649> seconds<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
in twenty one thirty seconds now the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.889 
in twenty one thirty seconds now the
exact<00:02:03.320> amount<00:02:04.320> isn't<00:02:04.770> necessarily<00:02:05.280> crucial

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
exact amount isn't necessarily crucial

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.570 
exact amount isn't necessarily crucial
as<00:02:06.899> much<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.680> getting<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.190> hammer<00:02:08.369> blow

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
as much as it is getting the hammer blow

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.999 
as much as it is getting the hammer blow
distance<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.200> line<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
distance to be in line with what it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.850 
distance to be in line with what it
needs<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:12.540> relation<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
needs to be in relation to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.990 
needs to be in relation to
the<00:02:14.370> key<00:02:14.580> dip<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:16.050> know<00:02:16.140> which<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.100> also<00:02:17.820> be

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the key dip you know which would also be

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.570 
the key dip you know which would also be
the<00:02:18.210> after<00:02:18.360> touch<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.110> amount<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.580> lost

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
the after touch the amount of lost

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
the after touch the amount of lost
motion<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> key<00:02:21.540> or<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> jack<00:02:22.200> gap<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.770> what

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
motion in the key or a jack gap is what

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.490 
motion in the key or a jack gap is what
they<00:02:23.100> call<00:02:23.310> it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
they call it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500 
they call it
so<00:02:25.500> that's<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.310> that's<00:02:26.430> how<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.700> measure<00:02:27.000> now

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
so that's but that's how to measure now

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.470 
so that's but that's how to measure now
this<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> spinet<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:29.730> sorry<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.970> spend

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
this is a spinet there I'm sorry I spend

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
this is a spinet there I'm sorry I spend
about<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.660> console<00:02:31.170> piano<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:31.850> pianos<00:02:32.850> like

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
about a console piano but pianos like

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.490 
about a console piano but pianos like
spinning<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.480> console<00:02:33.900> pianos<00:02:34.080> they<00:02:34.350> have

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
spinning in console pianos they have

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.760 
spinning in console pianos they have
compressed<00:02:35.130> actions<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.840> general<00:02:37.290> rule<00:02:37.530> is

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
compressed actions the general rule is

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.680 
compressed actions the general rule is
it<00:02:37.920> should<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.160> maybe<00:02:38.820> you're<00:02:39.030> around<00:02:39.270> one<00:02:39.540> in

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
it should be maybe you're around one in

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.990 
it should be maybe you're around one in
five<00:02:39.960> eighths<00:02:40.170> which<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.740> what<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.490> close

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
five eighths which is what this is close

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.750 
five eighths which is what this is close
to<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:43.620> know<00:02:43.710> could<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.100> little<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.520> one

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
to you know could be as little as one

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.000 
to you know could be as little as one
and<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.940> half<00:02:45.120> inch<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.810> needs<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.890> be

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and a half inch if it needs to be

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.330 
and a half inch if it needs to be
adjusted<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.760> again<00:02:48.200> as<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.260> general<00:02:49.800> rule<00:02:49.830> one

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
adjusted but again as a general rule one

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.180 
adjusted but again as a general rule one
in<00:02:50.490> five<00:02:50.760> aces<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.690> good<00:02:51.960> good<00:02:52.440> rule<00:02:53.160> to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
in five aces is a good good rule to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.400 
in five aces is a good good rule to
follow<00:02:53.360> did<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.450> at<00:02:54.540> least<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.840> starting<00:02:55.230> point

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
follow did or at least a starting point

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.690 
follow did or at least a starting point
now<00:02:58.410> if<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.590> find<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.190> need<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.550> make

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
now if you find that you need to make

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.300 
now if you find that you need to make
adjustments<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.710> hammer<00:03:02.070> blow

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
adjustments to the to the hammer blow

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.770 
adjustments to the to the hammer blow
distance<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:04.140> way<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> do<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.040> would<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.460> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
distance the way to do that would be to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.380 
distance the way to do that would be to
make<00:03:06.780> adjustments<00:03:06.960> here<00:03:07.890> where<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.730> hammer

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
make adjustments here where the hammer

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.780 
make adjustments here where the hammer
rail<00:03:09.690> which<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.470> hammer<00:03:10.680> rail<00:03:10.980> comes

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
rail which this is the hammer rail comes

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.810 
rail which this is the hammer rail comes
down<00:03:12.060> onto<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.600> action<00:03:12.960> brackets<00:03:13.820> generally

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
down onto the action brackets generally

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.360 
down onto the action brackets generally
there's<00:03:15.000> three<00:03:15.420> or<00:03:15.720> four<00:03:15.770> action<00:03:16.770> brackets<00:03:17.250> in

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
there's three or four action brackets in

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.850 
there's three or four action brackets in
a<00:03:17.460> piano<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.090> they<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.960> rail<00:03:19.200> rests<00:03:19.680> on

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
a piano that they have a rail rests on

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.610 
a piano that they have a rail rests on
here<00:03:20.610> we've<00:03:20.760> got<00:03:20.910> one<00:03:21.150> over<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.810> on<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
here we've got one over on the on the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.010 
here we've got one over on the on the
base<00:03:22.770> end<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.910> one's<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.360> middle<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
base end this one's in the middle and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.410 
base end this one's in the middle and
then<00:03:25.650> there's<00:03:25.800> also<00:03:25.980> one<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.300> high

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
then there's also one on the on the high

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.690 
then there's also one on the on the high
treble<00:03:27.780> end<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.770> has<00:03:28.950> actually

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
treble end so this one has actually

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.980 
treble end so this one has actually
three<00:03:30.560> action<00:03:31.560> brackets<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.720> know<00:03:33.810> once

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
three action brackets and you know once

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.510 
three action brackets and you know once
when<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.350> make<00:03:34.530> an<00:03:34.710> adjustment<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:35.340> one

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
when you make an adjustment to one

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.740 
when you make an adjustment to one
you'll<00:03:35.730> want<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:35.970> make<00:03:36.090> sure<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.480> make

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
you'll want to make sure you make

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.990 
you'll want to make sure you make
adjustments<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.500> others<00:03:37.890> know<00:03:38.130> as<00:03:38.940> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
adjustments to the others know as a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.790 
adjustments to the others know as a
preliminary<00:03:39.420> thing<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.230> you're<00:03:40.470> as<00:03:40.770> you're

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
preliminary thing as you're as you're

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.860 
preliminary thing as you're as you're
trying<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.730> figure<00:03:41.910> out<00:03:42.060> what<00:03:42.480> your<00:03:42.690> best

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
trying to figure out what your best

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.320 
trying to figure out what your best
hammer<00:03:43.200> blows<00:03:43.500> distance<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.190> gonna<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.640> what<00:03:45.300> I

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
hammer blows distance is gonna be what I

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.140 
hammer blows distance is gonna be what I
usually<00:03:45.510> use<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.440> rubber<00:03:46.710> mute<00:03:47.150> rubber

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
usually use is a rubber mute rubber

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.580 
usually use is a rubber mute rubber
wedge<00:03:48.390> mute<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.080> if<00:03:49.740> I<00:03:49.860> need<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.780> usually<00:03:51.780> what

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
wedge mute and if I need to usually what

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.820 
wedge mute and if I need to usually what
happens<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.900> hammer<00:03:55.140> blow<00:03:55.350> distance

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
happens is the the hammer blow distance

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.620 
happens is the the hammer blow distance
needs<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.250> be<00:03:56.370> decreased<00:03:56.820> just<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.210> little<00:03:57.480> bit

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
needs to be decreased just a little bit

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.810 
needs to be decreased just a little bit
okay<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.200> what<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.380> can<00:03:58.620> do<00:03:58.800> is<00:04:00.830> put<00:04:01.830> my<00:04:02.040> rubber

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
okay and what I can do is put my rubber

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.170 
okay and what I can do is put my rubber
wedge<00:04:03.060> mute<00:04:03.500> because<00:04:04.500> it's<00:04:04.830> tapered<00:04:05.250> okay<00:04:05.970> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
wedge mute because it's tapered okay the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.720 
wedge mute because it's tapered okay the
further<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.510> put<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.870> put<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:08.400> more<00:04:08.610> it's

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
further I put in put it in the more it's

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.000 
further I put in put it in the more it's
gonna<00:04:08.820> prop<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.330> up<00:04:09.450> okay<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.170> there<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.620> knew

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
gonna prop it up okay but there I knew

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.160 
gonna prop it up okay but there I knew
there<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.220> can<00:04:11.400> put<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.820> little<00:04:12.090> bit<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.480> can

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
there I can put it in a little bit I can

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.590
