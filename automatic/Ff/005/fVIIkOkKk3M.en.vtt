downside I could say about it is leaving
it<00:01:50.420> for<00:01:50.540> 20-30<00:01:51.110> minutes<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.800> build<00:01:52.130> up<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.310> lot

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
it for 20-30 minutes you build up a lot

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.890 
it for 20-30 minutes you build up a lot
of<00:01:52.640> saliva<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.240> your<00:01:53.270> mouth

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
of saliva in your mouth

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.140

me I'm just a huge drooler I have no
idea<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.720> then<00:01:57.260> when<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:57.560> actually<00:01:58.130> take<00:01:58.730> out

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
idea and then when I actually take out

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.880 
idea and then when I actually take out
the<00:01:59.150> trees<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.750> usually<00:02:00.410> have<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.560> do<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.800> over

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
the trees I usually have to do it over

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.410 
the trees I usually have to do it over
the<00:02:01.010> sink<00:02:01.280> because<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:01.880> all<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.210> light

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
the sink because like all this light

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.440 
the sink because like all this light
which<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.720> Russian<00:02:03.140> patli<00:02:03.500> like<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> flood<00:02:04.820> if

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
which is a Russian patli like a flood if

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
you use a for the past three to four

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.139 
you use a for the past three to four
days<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.250> I've<00:02:07.370> actually<00:02:07.640> seen<00:02:07.970> results

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149
