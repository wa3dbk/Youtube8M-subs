a the the shop system is a bit

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.570 
a the the shop system is a bit

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
unbalanced at the moment I mean it is

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.339 
unbalanced at the moment I mean it is
beta<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.659> the<00:05:49.810> probably<00:05:50.050> can<00:05:50.139> have<00:05:50.229> to

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
beta so the probably can have to

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.920 
beta so the probably can have to
rearrange<00:05:50.889> these<00:05:51.250> prices<00:05:51.610> but<00:05:52.510> I<00:05:52.570> mean<00:05:52.720> if<00:05:52.840> you

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
rearrange these prices but I mean if you

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.950 
rearrange these prices but I mean if you
