00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 spongebob cartoon character 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.690
 square pants if you think not so 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.630
 itâ€™s really fictional 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:23.430
 in the kitchen if you carefully search there 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:24.480
 a sponge similar to him in sets of sponges 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.960
 for dish washing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.250
 often there is at least one 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.789
 bright yellow with her we will 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
 work 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.680
 let's start with making eyes for them 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.410
 cardboard or paper will do 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.350
 but if you have felt and felt then 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 better to use these materials 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:49.710
 cut out two white circles and then 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.309
 cut two more circles only 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.020
 smaller and blue color glue parts 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.020
 reliably help glue gun 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:08.040
 spout can be made from the blue prints 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:13.250
 bend it and then glue with acrylic 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.250
 draw a pupil and a wide smile 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.220
 shirt and pants I cut out of color 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.740
 felt 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.600
 but if you have a cloth then you can 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.600
 ease of felt replaced with a cloth 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.530
 let's start creating thin pens and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 legs 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.590
 they are also more convenient to do as pinos 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 Strong sticks twist the desired shape 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.740
 and glue 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:06.750
 a tie on a shirt and a belt on trousers 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.330
 paint with acrylic paint in large 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.849
 spongebob account is complete but if you 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.530
 want him to be steady then his 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.470
 will have to stick on any 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:30.900
 the surface in my case is the cap from 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:33.390
 cans your personal home sponge bob 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.730
 completed by the way if you try and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.950
 turn on that pink sponge 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.950
 can i make his friend patrick 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.950
 and
