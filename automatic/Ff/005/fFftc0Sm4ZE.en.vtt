 painting technology the whole procedure 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.910

 metal products and cars 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 The main feature of such a box 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 ventilation it provides normal 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 functioning of the whole system he 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.250
 takes the street 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.000
 stirs him yes there certain 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.150
 so much need 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 and the dryer on after me will be there 63 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.890
 painting 1820 here she keeps steadily 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.630
 temperature mode of operation 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 painting booth in painting mode 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.440
 is the next incoming 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 outside the air is cleared of dust passing 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.219
 through dust and blocking filters and already 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.260
 exhaust air which is special 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.090
 pumped out of the chamber again 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.649
 cleared only already clear paint and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.360
 solvent vapors for what 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.399
 designed and paint retarding 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.960
 filter and it turns out that painting 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.879
 the camera is almost environmentally friendly 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.730
 safe find for car lovers 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.010
 in front of us is a car she is prepared for 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.420
 paint 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 previously we pasted over in the morning 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.700
 pulled the film so as not to fall on the heat 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.470
 on the car paint is diluted 1 K1 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.810
 one hundred percent paint one hundred percent 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.850
 thinner you can start painting 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 but first turn on the camera to extract 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 worked for a while 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.509
 Here we have a control unit 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.340
 turn on the hood 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.369
 heating will reach 22 to 24 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.829
 degrees is the optimum temperature at 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.990
 painting begin to paint with 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.539
 sprayer after each layer do 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.820
 a break of 10-15 minutes depending on 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.770
 layer of paint the first layer do sprayed 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 It turns out that the grid will hold 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.569
 the remaining paint layers the gun need 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.610
 keep 15 20 centimeters from the elements 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.210
 and gently push side to side 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.210
 try 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.200
 by force on trying over here 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.009
 slow down 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.950
 thus we put five seven layers 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.289
 paints here this part we have door 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.600
 this where is the transition to color then 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.460
 did not differ on the adjacent element 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.560
 paint to about half after 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.120
 applying all paint layers, waiting for 20 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.370
 minutes and go through painted 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 element sticky cloth cleaning hairs 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.760
 and dust particles that could remain on 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.440
 paint then onto the work surface 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.280
 applied varnish in two layers 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.380
 work from the machine is completed remains 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.560
 dry and in the chamber pre 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.410
 heating the camera to 60 degrees drying 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.520
 damage occurs 45 minutes then we her 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.320
 expel polish collect and give 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.739
