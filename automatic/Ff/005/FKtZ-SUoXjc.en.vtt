that a try because that's always a go-to
color<00:00:18.990> around<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> murky<00:00:20.250> water

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
color around here with the murky water

and Narragansett Bay green always tends
to<00:00:23.279> work<00:00:23.460> well<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.240> high-visibility

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to work well it's a high-visibility

to work well it's a high-visibility
colorize<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.920> pink<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:27.840> I've

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
colorize is pink so as you can see I've

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.050 
colorize is pink so as you can see I've
just<00:00:28.349> taken<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.800> single<00:00:29.160> piece<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> squid<00:00:29.760> here

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.609 
just taken a single piece of squid here
and<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:30.689> put<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> hook

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and I've put it on the hook

and I've put it on the hook
not<00:00:31.800> double<00:00:32.070> triple<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> single<00:00:33.270> time

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
not double triple just a single time

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.470 
not double triple just a single time
over<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> hook<00:00:34.579> making<00:00:35.579> sure<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.120> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
little nice little bit of action rolling

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.750 
little nice little bit of action rolling
along<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> ground<00:01:06.630> sort<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.610> bouncing<00:01:08.610> along

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
along the ground sort of bouncing along

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.620 
along the ground sort of bouncing along
the<00:01:09.000> ground<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.960> fluke<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.770> sit

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
the ground like that a fluke will sit

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
the ground like that a fluke will sit
you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.710> tide<00:01:13.979> coming<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.520> like

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you know with the tide coming in like

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.910 
you know with the tide coming in like
this<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.299> fluke<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.840> facing<00:01:16.380> into<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this the fluke will be facing into the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
this the fluke will be facing into the
tide<00:01:17.159> an<00:01:18.020> opportunistically<00:01:19.020> taking<00:01:19.560> bait<00:01:19.770> as

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
tide an opportunistically taking bait as

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.510 
tide an opportunistically taking bait as
it<00:01:20.159> comes<00:01:20.340> by<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.790> go<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.420> here

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
it comes by here we go going right here

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.140 
it comes by here we go going right here
nice<00:01:23.520> dish<00:01:23.909> nice<00:01:24.750> fish<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.490> wind<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
nice dish nice fish so we got wind and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
nice dish nice fish so we got wind and
tide<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.540> our<00:01:27.600> favor<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> just

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
tide in our favor and you know that just

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
tide in our favor and you know that just
means<00:01:29.610> success<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> fluke

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
means success right there if the fluke

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
means success right there if the fluke
are<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.369> we're<00:01:32.579> drifting<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> have

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
are here and we're drifting if you have

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
are here and we're drifting if you have
the<00:01:33.689> wind<00:01:33.900> against<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> tide<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> do

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the wind against the tide you have to do

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
the wind against the tide you have to do
what's<00:01:35.400> called<00:01:35.549> stemming<00:01:36.210> either<00:01:36.450> stemming

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
what's called stemming either stemming

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
what's called stemming either stemming
the<00:01:37.020> tide<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.530> stemming<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.950> wind<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the tide or stemming the wind but

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.260 
the tide or stemming the wind but
typically<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.350> stemming<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> wind

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
typically it's it's stemming the wind

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.670 
typically it's it's stemming the wind
and<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> bring<00:01:42.780> us<00:01:42.930> fluke<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and when you bring us fluke up to the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.560 
and when you bring us fluke up to the
surface<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.850> real<00:01:45.240> nice

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
surface you just want to do it real nice
