00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.700
 it's everyone knows to score 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.660
 today I have a super glitch for 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.820
 you it will allow you to have 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.289
 really both free so when 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.340
 you will go into your phone on the 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.540
 websites to buy 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.610
 low vehicles will fire you all 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.020
 vehicles without really free for 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.430
 buy tons of adder and so go 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.800
 resell them so to start low 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.900
 you are going to go in online and so 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 you will launch the beta editor and so 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.170
 when you will be in the beta editor there 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.700
 will have to create a confrontation 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.050
 so this is the only drawback of this 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.880
 geek and so it will be two but 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.920
 good the person who will be with you their 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.570
 just invite you into his session 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.860
 so an invitation session will be 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.210
 better so once you have written 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.710
 the low confrontation it will be necessary to test it 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.600
 so like buying doing it 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.560
 you test the clash is so a 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.900
 once you're done 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.900
 well you go back to the editor 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.700
 beta and so it will return to the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.460
 game was abnormal so you 're not going 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.370
 launched gta online it will take teeth on 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.390
 gta in normal so that's where I am 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.220
 testing the clash 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.110
 send you told me he only one 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.609
 like that it's going fast you kill all and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.179
 then once it's over but that's it 

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:07.399
 you got there 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:08.899
 so once you're there you 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.460
 are going to leave 1 and so you go 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.469
 return to the editor at the very beginning 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.289
 so to not need to start a session 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.869
 online it will be necessary to launch a session 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.659
 normal so a career what then 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.399
 So here you go back to Gta 5 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.079
 1 you will not return to gt or in line 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.749
 so is once you go 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.130
 return badens here so you go 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.049
 happen that michael month it will create 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.189
 a backup so you feel other 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.469
 phones and so you go in 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.450
 backup so there you save and 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.829
 so once you've done that you 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.569
 go start again and you will go 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.979
 of challenge so you did you go 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.299
 replay the prologue mission 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.249
 so that's once you've launched 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.539
 this mission you will arrive in the 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.329
 mission she this is where your friend he 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.399
 bat will have to invite you into a session 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.869
 by invitation so when he will have done 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.909
 that's fine there you'll come in 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.229

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.389
 free so I'll show you that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.919
 so here it is I arrived in the 

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.929
