00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
gonna be showing you how to build the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.390 
gonna be showing you how to build the
fence<00:00:06.210> gate<00:00:06.509> ladder<00:00:06.810> now<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> new<00:00:08.099> form

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
fence gate ladder now this is a new form

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.520 
fence gate ladder now this is a new form
of<00:00:08.580> vertical<00:00:08.790> transport<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.870> certainly<00:00:10.290> not

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
of vertical transport is certainly not

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.890 
of vertical transport is certainly not
the<00:00:10.590> fastest<00:00:11.280> way<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.700> traveling<00:00:12.480> upwards

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the fastest way of traveling upwards

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570 
the fastest way of traveling upwards
it's<00:00:13.139> not<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> most<00:00:13.530> resource<00:00:13.950> friendly<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
it's not the most resource friendly and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.550 
it's not the most resource friendly and
it's<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> quietest<00:00:15.420> however<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it's not the quietest however it is a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
it's not the quietest however it is a
new<00:00:16.980> form<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.460> vertical<00:00:17.670> transport<00:00:18.510> now<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
new form of vertical transport now the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
new form of vertical transport now the
other<00:00:19.199> day<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> was<00:00:19.710> challenging<00:00:20.340> myself<00:00:20.760> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
other day I was challenging myself to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.160 
other day I was challenging myself to
try<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.180> come<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.570> different<00:00:21.630> ways<00:00:22.020> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
try and come up with different ways of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.960 
try and come up with different ways of
doing<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.220> thought<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.580> using<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
doing this and I thought of using the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.640 
doing this and I thought of using the
fence<00:00:24.300> gates<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> control

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
fence gates so we're going to control

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
fence gates so we're going to control
the<00:00:25.859> fence<00:00:26.070> gates<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:26.490> redstone<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.119> that's

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
the fence gates with redstone and that's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390 
the fence gates with redstone and that's
going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> make<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.170> easy<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.500> travel<00:00:29.010> upwards

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
going to make it easy to travel upwards

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.790 
going to make it easy to travel upwards
to<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> top<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.510> what<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.230> stand<00:00:31.560> on

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to the top so what we do is we stand on

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740 
to the top so what we do is we stand on
the<00:00:31.920> fence<00:00:32.130> post<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> bomb<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.329> press<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the fence post at the bomb we press the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.330 
the fence post at the bomb we press the
button<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.410> hold<00:00:34.710> down<00:00:34.890> spacebar

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
button and then we hold down spacebar

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.910 
button and then we hold down spacebar
and<00:00:35.820> now<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> fence<00:00:36.690> gates<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.230> closing<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and now the fence gates are closing and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.069 
and now the fence gates are closing and
opening<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.360> make<00:00:39.510> our<00:00:39.719> way<00:00:39.840> up

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
opening so that we can make our way up

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.290 
opening so that we can make our way up
to<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.410> top<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.940> hold<00:00:42.120> down

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
to the top like this so as we hold down

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
to the top like this so as we hold down
spacebar<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.170> below<00:00:43.410> us<00:00:43.559> closes<00:00:44.010> each

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
spacebar the one below us closes each

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
spacebar the one below us closes each
time<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> top<00:00:46.200> like

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
time and then we get to the top like

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.220 
time and then we get to the top like
that<00:00:46.739> she's<00:00:47.129> very<00:00:47.340> simple<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:48.480> obviously<00:00:48.930> as

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that she's very simple now obviously as

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
that she's very simple now obviously as
I've<00:00:49.410> said<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> very<00:00:50.160> resource

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
I've said this is a very resource

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.520 
I've said this is a very resource
friendly<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.629> very<00:00:51.840> practical<00:00:52.440> it's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
friendly it's not very practical it's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.740 
friendly it's not very practical it's
not<00:00:52.649> fast<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.090> those<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> like

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
not fast but for those of you that like

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.240 
not fast but for those of you that like
sank<00:00:55.050> fancy<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.530> your<00:00:55.649> base<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.039> thought<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
sank fancy in your base I thought I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
sank fancy in your base I thought I
would<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> tutorial<00:00:56.820> anyway<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:57.660> maybe

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
would do a tutorial anyway because maybe

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.180 
would do a tutorial anyway because maybe
you'd<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.230> something<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.010> show

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you'd like something like this to show

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
you'd like something like this to show
after<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.609> friends<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.809> said<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> not

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
after your friends but as I said is not

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
after your friends but as I said is not
very<00:01:01.739> practical<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:02.760> fast<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
very practical it is not fast and so I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.509 
very practical it is not fast and so I
really<00:01:04.500> wouldn't<00:01:04.680> recommend<00:01:04.949> building<00:01:05.250> this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
really wouldn't recommend building this

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.920 
really wouldn't recommend building this
however<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.119> pretty<00:01:06.330> cool<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> show<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
however it is pretty cool to show you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.800 
however it is pretty cool to show you
guys<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.409> new<00:01:07.860> way<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.040> travelling<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
guys a new way of travelling up so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
guys a new way of travelling up so
Before<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.260> jump<00:01:10.380> into<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> tutorial<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.790> going

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
Before we jump into a tutorial I'm going

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
Before we jump into a tutorial I'm going
to<00:01:11.970> explain<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> redstone<00:01:13.530> works

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to explain to you how the redstone works

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.530 
to explain to you how the redstone works
and<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> few<00:01:14.250> different<00:01:14.549> things<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> as

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and a few different things about this as

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
and a few different things about this as
well<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.560> obviously<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.189> starts<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.670> us

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
well so obviously this starts with us

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
well so obviously this starts with us
pressing<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> button<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> other

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
pressing the button and on the other

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
pressing the button and on the other
side<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> pulse<00:01:21.030> lympha<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.630> was

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
side of this is a pulse lympha that was

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.840 
side of this is a pulse lympha that was
shown<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> me<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.409> Fenneman<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.430> these<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.729> on

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
shown to me by Fenneman so these are on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
shown to me by Fenneman so these are on
subtract<00:01:24.330> mode<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.780> redstone<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
subtract mode the redstone is going to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
subtract mode the redstone is going to
go<00:01:26.040> around<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> loop<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.509> means<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
go around in a loop and that means the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.990 
go around in a loop and that means the
signal<00:01:28.770> strength<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.189> slowly<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
signal strength is slowly going to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
signal strength is slowly going to
degrade<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> makes<00:01:30.990> its<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.200> down<00:01:31.439> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
degrade so when it makes its way down to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.830 
degrade so when it makes its way down to
zero<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> redstone<00:01:33.360> torch<00:01:33.390> will

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
zero that's when the redstone torch will

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
zero that's when the redstone torch will
turn<00:01:33.990> back<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.710> acts<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> pulse<00:01:35.520> alone

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
turn back on so it acts as a pulse alone

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.370 
turn back on so it acts as a pulse alone
for<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.630> pulse<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.170> has<00:01:37.259> been

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
for now so that pulse that has been

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
for now so that pulse that has been
lengthened<00:01:37.590> goes<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> bottom<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
lengthened goes into the bottom here and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.359 
lengthened goes into the bottom here and
what<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.439> stacked<00:01:40.799> repeaters

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
what we have are some stacked repeaters

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
what we have are some stacked repeaters
that<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.060> around<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.570> circle<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.259> can

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that go around in a circle so you can

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
that go around in a circle so you can
see<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.369> signal<00:01:44.790> passes<00:01:44.970> through<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
see the signal passes through this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
see the signal passes through this
repeater<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> goes<00:01:46.950> through<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> torch

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
repeater then it goes through the torch

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.819 
repeater then it goes through the torch
to<00:01:48.119> send<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.479> through<00:01:48.509> another<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> then

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
to send it through another one and then

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.679 
to send it through another one and then
back<00:01:50.040> into<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.520> torch<00:01:50.820> again<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> front

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
back into a torch again so the front

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
back into a torch again so the front
side<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.009> always<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.610> output

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
side of this is always going to output

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
side of this is always going to output
power<00:01:54.540> which<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.170> keeps<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> these

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
power which is what keeps all of these

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.039 
power which is what keeps all of these
fence<00:01:56.579> gates<00:01:56.850> open<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.869> both

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
fence gates open you can see on both

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.749 
fence gates open you can see on both
sides<00:01:58.350> they're<00:01:58.619> powered<00:01:58.829> by<00:01:59.040> redstone<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
sides they're powered by redstone and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.940 
sides they're powered by redstone and
then<00:02:00.240> when<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> signal<00:02:00.899> travels<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> all

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
then when the signal travels for it all

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.590 
then when the signal travels for it all
of<00:02:02.189> these<00:02:02.280> torches<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.909> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> invert<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
of these torches are going to invert and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.030 
of these torches are going to invert and
the<00:02:03.719> redstone<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> front<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:04.920> going

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the redstone at the front here is going

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
the redstone at the front here is going
to<00:02:05.100> turn<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.520> bit<00:02:05.820> by<00:02:05.880> bit<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.750> have

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
to turn off bit by bit because we have

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
to turn off bit by bit because we have
the<00:02:07.500> delay<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.009> front<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.489> back<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the delay at the front and back from the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.150 
the delay at the front and back from the
repeaters<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.470> travels<00:02:10.950> all

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
repeaters and so then that travels all

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.010 
repeaters and so then that travels all
the<00:02:11.190> way<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> top<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.270> slowly<00:02:12.569> all<00:02:12.870> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the way up to the top so slowly all of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.490 
the way up to the top so slowly all of
the<00:02:13.080> fence

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the fence

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
the fence
it's<00:02:13.620> open<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.160> then<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.850> closes<00:02:15.150> again<00:02:15.570> now

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
it's open and then it closes again now

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.780 
it's open and then it closes again now
the<00:02:16.140> reason<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> fence<00:02:17.280> post<00:02:17.370> at

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the reason that we have a fence post at

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.460 
the reason that we have a fence post at
the<00:02:17.820> bottom<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.960> fence<00:02:19.170> gate

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the bottom is because the fence gate

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.770 
the bottom is because the fence gate
like<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.950> fence<00:02:20.160> post<00:02:20.460> when<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:20.850> closed<00:02:21.210> has

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
like the fence post when it's closed has

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.780 
like the fence post when it's closed has
the<00:02:22.020> one<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> half<00:02:22.620> high<00:02:22.860> hitbox<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.640> when

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the one and a half high hitbox so when

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.820 
the one and a half high hitbox so when
you're<00:02:23.910> standing<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.510> top<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.590> try

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you're standing on top of it and you try

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.890 
you're standing on top of it and you try
to<00:02:25.890> jump<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.820> next<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
to jump up to the next one you have the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.690 
to jump up to the next one you have the
extra<00:02:28.200> hitbox<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.740> jump<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.100> up<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.580> we

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
extra hitbox to jump you up so if we

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.400 
extra hitbox to jump you up so if we
didn't<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> fence<00:02:30.390> post<00:02:30.690> at<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.320> bottom

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
didn't have the fence post at the bottom

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.260 
didn't have the fence post at the bottom
here<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.100> we<00:02:32.190> wouldn't<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.520> able<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.850> jump<00:02:33.090> up

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
here then we wouldn't be able to jump up

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.660 
here then we wouldn't be able to jump up
onto<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.170> first<00:02:34.380> fence<00:02:34.709> gate<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.400> anyway

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
onto the first fence gate so anyway

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.430 
onto the first fence gate so anyway
let's<00:02:35.850> press<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.300> button<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.870> see<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.260> in

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
let's press the button and see this in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.710 
let's press the button and see this in
action<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.850> can<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.209> they're<00:02:39.360> closing

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
action so you can see they're closing

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.270 
action so you can see they're closing
one<00:02:39.870> by<00:02:40.050> one<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.410> we<00:02:40.500> go<00:02:40.650> around<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.950> back<00:02:41.100> here

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
one by one if we go around the back here

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.949 
one by one if we go around the back here
you<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.459> see<00:02:41.790> all<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> Redstone<00:02:42.570> turning

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
you can see all of the Redstone turning

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.140 
you can see all of the Redstone turning
off<00:02:43.080> as<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.890> extended<00:02:44.370> pulse<00:02:44.610> makes<00:02:44.880> its<00:02:45.090> way

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
off as that extended pulse makes its way

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.000 
off as that extended pulse makes its way
through<00:02:45.270> here<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.989> then<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
through here and then you can see the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.570 
through here and then you can see the
Redstone<00:02:47.430> turns<00:02:47.790> back<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.060> again<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.400> now

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
Redstone turns back on again so now

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.010 
Redstone turns back on again so now
we're<00:02:50.730> going<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.910> start<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> tutorial<00:02:51.510> in

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
we're going to start the tutorial in

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.570 
we're going to start the tutorial in
front<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.350> me<00:02:52.470> I've<00:02:52.560> marked<00:02:52.800> out<00:02:52.980> two<00:02:53.220> areas

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
front of me I've marked out two areas

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.040 
front of me I've marked out two areas
for<00:02:53.760> which<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.150> are<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.570> build<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.930> on

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
for which we are going to build in on

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.810 
for which we are going to build in on
the<00:02:55.470> Left<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.070> yellow<00:02:56.370> wall<00:02:56.640> which

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
the Left we have the yellow wall which

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.180 
the Left we have the yellow wall which
is<00:02:57.000> free<00:02:57.239> blocks<00:02:57.510> wide<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.050> five<00:02:58.650> blocks<00:02:58.950> deep

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
is free blocks wide and five blocks deep

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.710 
is free blocks wide and five blocks deep
this<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.700> where<00:03:00.060> we're<00:03:00.180> gonna<00:03:00.239> place<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
this is where we're gonna place the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.390 
this is where we're gonna place the
fence<00:03:00.959> gates<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.680> redstone<00:03:02.160> that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
fence gates and the redstone that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160 
fence gates and the redstone that
controls<00:03:02.820> them<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.870> see<00:03:04.020> we've

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
controls them and so you can see we've

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.810 
controls them and so you can see we've
already<00:03:04.380> placed<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.890> fence<00:03:05.160> post<00:03:05.459> at<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
already placed this fence post at the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.490 
already placed this fence post at the
front<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.239> above<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.720> where<00:03:07.290> you're<00:03:07.410> gonna

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
front it's above this where you're gonna

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.870 
front it's above this where you're gonna
place<00:03:07.770> down<00:03:08.010> your<00:03:08.040> fence<00:03:08.400> gates<00:03:08.670> for

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
place down your fence gates for

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.820 
place down your fence gates for
traveling<00:03:09.270> upwards<00:03:09.690> now<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.440> right<00:03:10.620> hand

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
traveling upwards now on the right hand

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.710 
traveling upwards now on the right hand
side<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.520> blue<00:03:11.700> area<00:03:12.150> which<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.510> two

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
side we have the blue area which is two

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.170 
side we have the blue area which is two
blocks<00:03:12.930> wide<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.560> five<00:03:14.070> blocks<00:03:14.370> deep<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
blocks wide and five blocks deep this is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.460 
blocks wide and five blocks deep this is
where<00:03:15.360> we're<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> build<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.989> redstone

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
where we're going to build the redstone

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.720 
where we're going to build the redstone
for<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.800> pulse<00:03:17.010> length<00:03:17.130> enough<00:03:17.549> that

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
for the pulse length enough that

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.820 
for the pulse length enough that
controls<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.239> redstone<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.470> yellow<00:03:19.799> area

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
controls the redstone in the yellow area

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.070 
controls the redstone in the yellow area
and<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> build<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.330> pulse<00:03:21.570> limb<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:21.959> nine

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
and so to build that pulse limb for nine

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.300 
and so to build that pulse limb for nine
you<00:03:22.260> were<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.560> need<00:03:22.650> nine<00:03:22.890> building

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you were going to need nine building

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.949 
you were going to need nine building
blocks<00:03:23.340> four<00:03:23.850> pieces<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.299> redstone<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
blocks four pieces of redstone a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.960 
blocks four pieces of redstone a
repeater<00:03:25.320> two<00:03:25.769> redstone<00:03:26.190> comparators<00:03:26.790> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
repeater two redstone comparators a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.479 
repeater two redstone comparators a
redstone<00:03:27.660> torch<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.530> button<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.400> we're

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
redstone torch and a button so we're

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.550 
redstone torch and a button so we're
going<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.640> start<00:03:29.880> off<00:03:29.970> by<00:03:30.000> placing<00:03:30.390> down<00:03:30.840> some

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
going to start off by placing down some

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.310 
going to start off by placing down some
building<00:03:31.890> blocks<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:34.019> shape

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
building blocks like this in this shape

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.690 
building blocks like this in this shape
and<00:03:34.560> then<00:03:34.950> we'll<00:03:35.100> come<00:03:35.220> around<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.670> front

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
and then we'll come around to the front

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.610 
and then we'll come around to the front
and<00:03:36.090> place<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.510> button<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.080> then<00:03:37.530> we're

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
and place the button and then we're

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.229 
and place the button and then we're
going<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.769> put<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.070> comparator<00:03:38.670> at<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.850> back<00:03:39.030> in

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
going to put a comparator at the back in

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.240 
going to put a comparator at the back in
that<00:03:39.330> direction<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.049> another<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.100> that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
that direction and another one in that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.130 
that direction and another one in that
one<00:03:41.400> put<00:03:41.640> both<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:41.850> those<00:03:42.120> on<00:03:42.390> subtract<00:03:42.959> mode

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
one put both of those on subtract mode

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.140 
one put both of those on subtract mode
and<00:03:43.410> then<00:03:43.829> place<00:03:44.100> down<00:03:44.370> our<00:03:44.579> redstone<00:03:44.790> which

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and then place down our redstone which

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.479 
and then place down our redstone which
goes<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.600> these<00:03:45.810> four<00:03:46.140> positions<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.920> then

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
goes in these four positions and then

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.160 
goes in these four positions and then
what<00:03:47.610> we<00:03:47.700> want<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.269> put<00:03:48.510> down<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.900> torch

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
what we want to do is put down a torch

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.530 
what we want to do is put down a torch
here<00:03:49.530> or<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.010> PITA<00:03:50.310> facing<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.120> direction

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
here or a PITA facing in that direction

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.600 
here or a PITA facing in that direction
and<00:03:52.079> then<00:03:52.500> last<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.950> all<00:03:53.070> we<00:03:53.190> need<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.340> place

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
and then last of all we need to place

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.340 
and then last of all we need to place
another<00:03:53.940> block<00:03:54.150> above<00:03:54.660> this<00:03:54.840> piece<00:03:55.110> of

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
another block above this piece of

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.130 
another block above this piece of
redstone<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.510> now<00:03:57.720> I'm<00:03:57.780> going<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.959> show<00:03:58.110> you

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
redstone so now I'm going to show you

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.960 
redstone so now I'm going to show you
how<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.410> build<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.950> Redstone<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.610> goes<00:03:59.760> in

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
how to build the Redstone that goes in

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.819 
how to build the Redstone that goes in
the<00:04:00.090> yellow<00:04:00.360> area<00:04:00.390> now<00:04:01.079> this<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.500> repetitive

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
the yellow area now this is repetitive

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.650 
the yellow area now this is repetitive
building<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:02.700> there's<00:04:02.880> actually<00:04:03.030> two<00:04:03.269> layers

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
building so there's actually two layers

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.240 
building so there's actually two layers
to<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.350> stack<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.799> top<00:04:04.829> of<00:04:05.130> each

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
to this that you stack on top of each

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.430 
to this that you stack on top of each
other<00:04:05.430> over<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.450> over<00:04:06.750> again<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.260> build

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
other over and over again and to build

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.780 
other over and over again and to build
those<00:04:07.590> two<00:04:07.860> layers<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.310> will<00:04:08.459> need<00:04:08.579> 15

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
those two layers you will need 15

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.240 
those two layers you will need 15

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
fence gates we want them to face in this

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.870 
fence gates we want them to face in this
direction<00:04:18.560> like<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.160> we<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.519> open

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
direction like so so that we can open

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.700 
direction like so so that we can open
them<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.209> stand<00:04:21.479> on<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.750> edge<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.320> be<00:04:22.500> able

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
them and stand on the edge and be able

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.279 
them and stand on the edge and be able
to<00:04:22.800> press<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.010> button<00:04:23.460> here<00:04:23.640> like<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.690> then

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
to press the button here like this then

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.030 
to press the button here like this then
when<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.530> place<00:04:25.740> those<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.220> want<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.460> put<00:04:26.580> 2

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
when you place those you want to put 2

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.130 
when you place those you want to put 2
surround<00:04:27.400> them<00:04:27.580> on<00:04:28.120> each<00:04:28.450> side<00:04:28.840> we're<00:04:29.050> gonna

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
surround them on each side we're gonna

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.190 
surround them on each side we're gonna
put<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.380> block<00:04:29.680> here<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.270> slab<00:04:31.630> in<00:04:31.900> this

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
put a block here and then a slab in this

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.020 
put a block here and then a slab in this
position<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:32.950> remove<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:33.400> one<00:04:33.610> there<00:04:33.850> and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
position so remove that one there and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.030 
position so remove that one there and
then<00:04:34.420> put<00:04:34.600> down<00:04:34.720> two<00:04:35.050> pieces<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.470> redstone<00:04:35.710> on

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
then put down two pieces of redstone on

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.610 
then put down two pieces of redstone on
this<00:04:36.220> side<00:04:36.460> two<00:04:37.120> pieces<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.510> redstone<00:04:37.900> on<00:04:38.380> that

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
this side two pieces of redstone on that

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.830 
this side two pieces of redstone on that
side<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.130> then<00:04:39.520> put<00:04:39.730> two<00:04:39.910> blocks<00:04:40.060> above<00:04:40.570> like

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
side and then put two blocks above like

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.360 
side and then put two blocks above like
that<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.350> that<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.590> redstone<00:04:42.010> doesn't

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
that so that the redstone doesn't

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.950 
that so that the redstone doesn't
connect<00:04:42.640> then<00:04:43.300> we're<00:04:43.420> going<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.570> build<00:04:43.720> the

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
connect then we're going to build the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.750 
connect then we're going to build the
next<00:04:44.170> bit<00:04:44.410> at<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.710> back<00:04:44.890> which<00:04:45.100> has<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.490> delay

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
next bit at the back which has the delay

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.240 
next bit at the back which has the delay
so<00:04:46.060> free<00:04:46.270> blocks<00:04:46.540> like<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:47.830> repeater

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
so free blocks like this so a repeater

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.980 
so free blocks like this so a repeater
here<00:04:48.520> on<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.790> fourth<00:04:49.030> setting<00:04:49.450> another<00:04:49.810> one

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
here on the fourth setting another one

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.600 
here on the fourth setting another one
there<00:04:50.200> also<00:04:50.440> on<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.800> fourth<00:04:51.010> setting<00:04:51.460> and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
there also on the fourth setting and

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.910 
there also on the fourth setting and
then<00:04:52.210> put<00:04:52.420> a<00:04:52.450> redstone<00:04:52.870> torch<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.650> block

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
then put a redstone torch on this block

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.790 
then put a redstone torch on this block
put<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.310> block<00:04:54.610> above<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.180> put<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> block<00:04:56.380> on<00:04:56.590> this

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
put a block above it put a block on this

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.010 
put a block above it put a block on this
side<00:04:57.040> of<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.370> repeater<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:58.030> then<00:04:58.570> on<00:04:58.780> that

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
side of the repeater and then on that

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.260 
side of the repeater and then on that
side<00:04:59.320> as<00:04:59.530> well<00:04:59.710> and<00:04:59.890> then<00:05:00.430> put<00:05:00.580> a<00:05:00.640> torch<00:05:00.940> here

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
side as well and then put a torch here

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.270 
side as well and then put a torch here
and<00:05:01.480> then<00:05:01.930> it's<00:05:02.050> all<00:05:02.230> ready<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.620> be<00:05:02.770> repeated

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
and then it's all ready to be repeated

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.700 
and then it's all ready to be repeated
over<00:05:03.490> again<00:05:04.110> so<00:05:05.110> I'm<00:05:05.200> going<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:05.410> build<00:05:05.530> another

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
over again so I'm going to build another

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.530 
over again so I'm going to build another
layer<00:05:06.190> on<00:05:06.280> top<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.610> this<00:05:06.790> one<00:05:06.970> just<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:07.330> you<00:05:07.420> can

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
layer on top of this one just so you can

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.970 
layer on top of this one just so you can
see<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.870> in<00:05:08.020> action<00:05:08.440> as<00:05:08.620> well<00:05:08.770> which<00:05:08.950> is

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
see that in action as well which is

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.830 
see that in action as well which is
always<00:05:09.280> useful<00:05:09.400> say<00:05:10.000> your<00:05:10.150> two<00:05:10.300> fence<00:05:10.540> gates

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
always useful say your two fence gates

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.210 
always useful say your two fence gates
then<00:05:11.560> we've<00:05:11.740> put<00:05:11.920> blocks<00:05:12.160> all<00:05:12.550> around<00:05:12.910> them<00:05:13.150> a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
then we've put blocks all around them a

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.470 
then we've put blocks all around them a
block<00:05:15.220> here<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.490> then<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.790> half<00:05:16.000> step<00:05:16.030> above

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
block here and then a half step above

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.530 
block here and then a half step above
and<00:05:17.490> then<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.580> can<00:05:18.760> place<00:05:18.940> down<00:05:19.150> those<00:05:19.330> two

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
and then you can place down those two

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.450 
and then you can place down those two
pieces<00:05:19.720> of<00:05:19.990> redstone<00:05:20.170> so<00:05:20.590> now<00:05:20.710> this<00:05:20.890> one<00:05:21.130> is<00:05:21.310> on

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
pieces of redstone so now this one is on

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.460 
pieces of redstone so now this one is on
top<00:05:21.490> of<00:05:21.790> the<00:05:21.850> half<00:05:22.030> slab<00:05:22.360> below<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.990> then

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
top of the half slab below and then

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.170 
top of the half slab below and then
around<00:05:23.740> on<00:05:23.860> this<00:05:24.070> side<00:05:24.130> it's<00:05:24.580> on<00:05:24.730> top<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:25.060> those

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
around on this side it's on top of those

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.550 
around on this side it's on top of those
two<00:05:25.390> blocks<00:05:25.630> which<00:05:25.900> we're<00:05:26.080> going<00:05:26.230> to<00:05:26.320> place

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
two blocks which we're going to place

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.830 
two blocks which we're going to place
now<00:05:26.890> for<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.220> next<00:05:27.550> layer<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.000> then<00:05:28.630> we<00:05:28.660> can

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
now for the next layer and then we can

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.240 
now for the next layer and then we can
place<00:05:29.050> down<00:05:29.260> those<00:05:29.440> free<00:05:29.680> blocks<00:05:29.980> at<00:05:30.220> the

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
place down those free blocks at the

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.320 
place down those free blocks at the
bottom<00:05:30.610> here<00:05:30.790> again<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.750> these<00:05:32.050> positions<00:05:32.710> and

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
bottom here again in these positions and

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.880 
bottom here again in these positions and
put<00:05:34.330> in<00:05:34.540> our<00:05:34.870> repeater<00:05:35.380> on<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.680> fourth

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
put in our repeater on the fourth

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.490 
put in our repeater on the fourth
setting<00:05:36.390> or<00:05:37.390> a<00:05:37.480> pizza<00:05:37.720> here<00:05:37.990> also<00:05:38.170> on<00:05:38.410> the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
setting or a pizza here also on the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.070 
setting or a pizza here also on the
fourth<00:05:38.710> setting<00:05:39.130> then<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.400> torch<00:05:39.790> with<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:40.690> block

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
fourth setting then a torch with a block

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.910 
fourth setting then a torch with a block
above<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.740> block<00:05:42.580> over<00:05:42.970> here<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:44.530> block<00:05:44.740> on

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
above a block over here and a block on

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.380 
above a block over here and a block on
that<00:05:44.950> side<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.550> repeater<00:05:45.820> as<00:05:45.970> well<00:05:46.150> and

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
that side of the repeater as well and

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.240 
that side of the repeater as well and
then<00:05:46.480> last<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:46.870> all<00:05:47.020> another<00:05:47.710> torch<00:05:47.980> right

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
then last of all another torch right

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.280 
then last of all another torch right
here<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.820> so<00:05:48.970> you<00:05:49.060> can<00:05:49.120> see<00:05:49.420> now<00:05:49.960> it's<00:05:50.110> ready

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
here and so you can see now it's ready

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.340 
here and so you can see now it's ready
for<00:05:50.440> you<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:50.650> build<00:05:50.860> another<00:05:51.190> layer<00:05:51.430> on<00:05:51.580> top<00:05:52.350> so

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
for you to build another layer on top so

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.050 
for you to build another layer on top so
now<00:05:53.380> built<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.920> couple<00:05:54.100> more<00:05:54.370> layers<00:05:54.640> on<00:05:54.850> top

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
now built a couple more layers on top

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.040 
now built a couple more layers on top
and<00:05:55.240> I<00:05:55.270> thought<00:05:55.450> I<00:05:55.510> should<00:05:55.720> give<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:55.870> a

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
and I thought I should give you a

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.870 
and I thought I should give you a
demonstration<00:05:56.260> that<00:05:56.770> this<00:05:57.010> works<00:05:57.280> accurately

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
demonstration that this works accurately

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.580 
demonstration that this works accurately
so<00:05:58.060> that's<00:05:58.210> stand<00:05:58.450> in<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:58.660> front<00:05:58.900> here<00:05:59.110> press

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
so that's stand in the front here press

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.830 
so that's stand in the front here press
the<00:05:59.740> button<00:06:00.010> and<00:06:00.130> hold<00:06:00.340> down<00:06:00.490> space<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:01.360> make

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
the button and hold down space and make

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.140 
the button and hold down space and make
our<00:06:02.050> way<00:06:02.260> up<00:06:02.470> to<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.800> top<00:06:03.040> so<00:06:03.760> when<00:06:03.910> you<00:06:04.000> finish

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
our way up to the top so when you finish

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.640 
our way up to the top so when you finish
building<00:06:04.450> this<00:06:04.720> and<00:06:04.900> you've<00:06:05.020> actually<00:06:05.140> got<00:06:05.500> to
