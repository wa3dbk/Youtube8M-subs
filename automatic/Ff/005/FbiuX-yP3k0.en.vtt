00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello everybody here is marcelo vido 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.770
 successful investor in this video or 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.590
 talk about day trade in trade is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.590
 easy money any year the truth 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.030
 about the 3 on the trade in the operations 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.710
 short-term 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.539
 So the first one I'll talk about is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.180
 day trade for those who do not know are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.220
 short-term operations 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 and sells an asset normally shares may 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.090
 be the future market at the same time on 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 that you bought in the morning there was a 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
 day and afternoon drive 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.500
 You sold your gain and half a percent. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.390
 percent you try to do well right 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.219
 there are also other modalities such as 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 suingue trade that are operations that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.180
 a few days are also operations 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.539
 short-term 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 so this is basically the trend 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.969
 there are some other different ways 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.430
 a longer term but greater 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.730
 part of the operations that return to this 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.039
 where trade has destroyed trade 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.350
 then how does the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.470
 operator is analyzing the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.640
 action is that the technical analysis in search of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.590
 opportunities 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.280
 technical analysis for those who do not know what 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.830
 is the study of graphs you analyze a 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 graph and try to understand through 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.009
 graph that is happening with the action 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.229
 and seek to find patterns that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 prove over time they repeat themselves 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.329
 some time ago 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.150
 today used these standards to try 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.110
 make money by hitting a move 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.850
 huh 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.250
 so we can identify 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 trends we can identify 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.829
 clearly what an asset is going up 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.200
 when he is falling when he has broken 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.829
 some important price 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.810
 the agency clearly sees what is 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.450
 happening in technical analysis techniques 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.100
 It is a very serious thing that really 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.340
 today all institutions use not only 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.079
 She alone but somehow to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.530
 understand what is happening to 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.380
 to help in some way the investments 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 So this is how you look for opportunity. 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.650
 analyzing the stock chart and other 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.650
 active 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.120
 so it works on day trade sim 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.170
 work by itself can work for you 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.060
 huh 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.310
 it is not all in 3d that will make money 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.269
 on the contrary a huge minority 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.890
 only it gains the immense immense majority of 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.450
 people who try to do this lose 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.430
 money because it is not easy to demand 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.310
 years of study and practice to become 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.049
 a binding operator is in such 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.230
 few people are going to spend years 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.440
 studying and practicing for the future 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.709
 become a short-term trader the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.220
 lucrative and hardly even when 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.450
 Can you become profitable? 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.660
 can hardly get over the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.430
 Profitability The Mouth Issues is very 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.709
 difficult very difficult 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.660
 There's going to be another person born to 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.299
 what is really going to become a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.790
 great operator and there you will 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.980
 very high returns it is possible to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.859
 possible but very difficult 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.350
 very few people there are too many weeks 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.319
 rare that happens but it can happen 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.120
 in some examples 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.950
 then it works the question is that 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.569
 have to go through this whole process 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.410
 most people will study for years 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.180
 practice for years to achieve 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.950
 make a profit even though it will not 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.060
 outperform a good portfolio 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.579
 of shares 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.310
 So what's the biggest trade problem? 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.299
 neco is a function that requires several hours 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.660
 daily 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.890
 NetÃ£o it interesting that right on up 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.450
 and goes down the market even though it has 11 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.000
 are involved and a lot of people are gone 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.150
 operating more as a fun as a 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.130
 casino, how it ends up being this year 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.050
 and getting involved with it has to take 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.569
 very careful because it really is 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.570
 cool is some fun and such 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.870
 But you have to be very careful about this. 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:15.130
 and then required several hours and that is 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.070
 a huge problem because the point you 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.049
 have to analyze eh eh thing 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.930
 are two things that are important to you. 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.730
 to enrich is to earn money and invest 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.340
 the money then the investment to 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.780
 profitability but has a goianinha and the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.760
 invest right 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.810
 so if you spend four hours by 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.000
 day five hours because doing trade and 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.590
 you will hardly get over a 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.630
 portfolio of its profitability 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.620
 stock portfolio will take 20 minutes 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.630
 per week 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.419
 not worth it if you take these 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.600
 four hours a day and invest this 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.930
 let's say whether it's your job on your 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.790
 business is to set up a 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.400
 do some kind of business where you can 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.390
 make a rule and if you invest this 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.320
 money will mount a portfolio of 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.740
 actions 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.100
 you will be very, very much but if you 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.650
 will have much more money in the end 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.890
 understood why profitability understands 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.479
 to exceed what is said to be minimal or 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.370
 whether it is a little smaller or less than 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.280
 you're a great delivery get 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.500
 follow great returns with 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.390
 investing a lot more money you go 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.970
 spend at the end the amount of money 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.040
 that you have at the end of the month the risk is 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.760
 much greater because who makes the 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.940
 trade 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.190
 so it really is a big problem the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.990
 time 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.669
 requires, in addition to other problems such as 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.830
 operational courses for those who are 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:46.700
 operating with frequency and everything 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:50.270
 so it really is s sells unfortunately 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.220
 much out there is how sidney trade was 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.170
 A very simple business, right? 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.200
 Have you learned a technique without 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.170
 magic one they call setup that the 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.230
 magic entry point and then you go there 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.850
 I learned the kil is just waiting. 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.790
 happen take a look at the chart 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.400
 fast in the morning happened you entered 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.340
 door there your profit goal of 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.530
 It hurts and it leaves you done your 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.960
 work one day your money to ensure 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.990
 if many are sold around 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.390
 this does not actually happen in the 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.320
 practical and profitable way 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.930
 what we see is who wins 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.350
 money study for years practice by 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.780
 several years to become understood 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.350
 I have never had much 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.510
 requiring a great area dedication then 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.810
 if it comes from many then very careful 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.510
 There are serious people doing in 3d little girl. 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.910
 selling course has but most is 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.490
 picking to sell an idea of 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.500
 as if it were easy and really is not 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.850
 It's not easy, it's okay. 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.040
 so this is what I had to say 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:03.430
 In this video you have to leave your comment 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.430
 below you liked and until the next 21
