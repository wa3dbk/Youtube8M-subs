learning the Aeolian mode for water okay
we'll<00:00:45.149> talk<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.420> them<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.200> anyone

we'll talk about them now so can anyone
name<00:00:46.620> remotes<00:00:53.809> okay<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
name remotes okay so like there's a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.529 
name remotes okay so like there's a
mnemonic<00:00:56.460> system<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> good<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.510> of

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
mnemonic system that is a good way of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
mnemonic system that is a good way of
memorizing<00:00:58.020> them<00:00:58.350> all<00:00:59.039> right<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> most<00:00:59.850> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
memorizing them all right so the most of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
memorizing them all right so the most of
the<00:01:00.030> major<00:01:00.149> scales<00:01:00.539> basically<00:01:01.050> come<00:01:01.260> from<00:01:01.500> at

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the major scales basically come from at

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.679 
the major scales basically come from at
the<00:01:01.739> major<00:01:01.949> scale<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.520> c<00:01:02.760> d<00:01:02.940> e<00:01:02.969> f<00:01:03.270> g<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.629> b<00:01:06.920> and

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
the major scale so c d e f g a b and

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.380 
the major scale so c d e f g a b and
what<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> major<00:01:10.049> scale<00:01:10.290> come<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.860> court<00:01:11.390> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
what the major scale come to court and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
what the major scale come to court and
so<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.920> first<00:01:14.130> them<00:01:14.490> will

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so with the first the first them will

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
so with the first the first them will
see<00:01:15.600> its<00:01:15.840> major<00:01:16.110> needed<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> minor<00:01:16.920> minor

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
see its major needed to minor minor

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580 
see its major needed to minor minor
major<00:01:17.820> dominant<00:01:18.630> mine<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> half<00:01:19.140> diminished

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
major dominant mine and half diminished

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.050 
major dominant mine and half diminished
it<00:01:19.710> because<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.460> before<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.939> with

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
it because of you to that before so with

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.990 
it because of you to that before so with
the<00:01:21.180> cenote<00:01:21.600> c<00:01:22.229> major<00:01:22.439> Simmons<00:01:22.920> even<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the cenote c major Simmons even the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.450 
the cenote c major Simmons even the
dates<00:01:24.240> deep

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
dates deep

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.810 
dates deep
and<00:01:25.580> then<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:29.830> g<00:01:30.830> two<00:01:31.700> dominant<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.860> minor<00:01:33.860> B

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
and then the g two dominant a minor B

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.149 
and then the g two dominant a minor B
half<00:01:35.000> diminished<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.080> basically<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.710> moat<00:01:36.920> of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
half diminished so basically the moat of

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.149 
half diminished so basically the moat of
the<00:01:37.280> scale<00:01:37.550> that<00:01:37.790> go<00:01:37.970> with<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.300> calls<00:01:38.800> in<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
the scale that go with the calls in the

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.190 
the scale that go with the calls in the
first<00:01:40.190> one<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.549> Ionian<00:01:41.210> Dorian<00:01:41.390> Phrygian

bubble<00:02:19.940> for<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.560> key<00:02:21.560> signatures<00:02:22.100> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
bubble for like key signatures and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.910 
bubble for like key signatures and
things<00:02:22.519> like<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.989> we<00:02:24.050> perform<00:02:24.500> all

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
things like that that we perform all

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.650 
things like that that we perform all
kinds<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.280> things<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.150> an<00:02:26.269> easy<00:02:26.420> way

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
kinds of things so it's just an easy way

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.050 
kinds of things so it's just an easy way
of<00:02:26.690> remembering<00:02:27.370> other<00:02:28.370> words<00:02:28.550> no<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.850> one

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
of remembering other words no this one

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.660 
of remembering other words no this one
is<00:02:29.110> another<00:02:30.110> good<00:02:30.260> way<00:02:30.440> as<00:02:30.590> repetition<00:02:31.190> just

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
is another good way as repetition just

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.460 
is another good way as repetition just
keep<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.090> over<00:02:32.329> and<00:02:32.570> over<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.350> that's

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
keep you on over and over so that's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.350 
keep you on over and over so that's
where<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.799> major<00:02:34.010> scale<00:02:34.220> comes<00:02:34.700> from<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> cave

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
where the major scale comes from a cave

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360 
where the major scale comes from a cave
so<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.410> see<00:02:36.620> we're<00:02:36.769> going<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.040> learn<00:02:37.130> all

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
so like I see we're going to learn all

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.470 
so like I see we're going to learn all
of<00:02:37.430> them<00:02:37.549> today<00:02:37.730> we're<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.060> going<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.329> get

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
of them today we're just going to get

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.870 
of them today we're just going to get
them<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.850> aeolian<00:02:40.850> shape<00:02:43.120> okay<00:02:45.579> so<00:02:46.579> with

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
them to the aeolian shape okay so with

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.870 
them to the aeolian shape okay so with
these<00:02:47.360> two<00:02:47.660> ways<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.200> learning<00:02:49.160> them<00:02:49.549> as<00:02:49.670> well

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
these two ways of learning them as well

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.819 
these two ways of learning them as well
be<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.150> derivative<00:02:50.420> approach<00:02:51.049> or<00:02:51.290> parallel

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
be is a derivative approach or parallel

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.110 
be is a derivative approach or parallel
approach<00:02:52.220> we're<00:02:52.549> going<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.760> we're<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.000> going

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
approach we're going to we're not going

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.460 
approach we're going to we're not going
to<00:02:53.180> get<00:02:53.269> too<00:02:53.450> much<00:02:53.480> into<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.930> because<00:02:54.079> it's<00:02:54.260> too

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
to get too much into it because it's too

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.380 
to get too much into it because it's too
much<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.860> deep<00:02:55.040> stuff<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.970> confusion

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
much and deep stuff and just confusion

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.270 
much and deep stuff and just confusion
so<00:02:57.079> we're<00:02:57.170> gonna<00:02:57.260> look<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.560> parallel<00:02:57.980> today

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
so we're gonna look at parallel today

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.120 
so we're gonna look at parallel today
and<00:02:58.459> as<00:02:58.549> we<00:02:58.700> go<00:02:58.820> on<00:02:58.850> about<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.530> will<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.890> start

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
and as we go on about it will you start

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.620 
and as we go on about it will you start
understanding<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.850> normal<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.239> basically

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
understanding of normal so basically

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.449 
understanding of normal so basically
we're<00:03:02.900> going<00:03:03.170> off<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.500> cord<00:03:03.799> when<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.430> a

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
we're going off the cord when we see a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.569 
we're going off the cord when we see a
major<00:03:04.820> chord<00:03:05.269> we<00:03:05.480> know<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.690> can<00:03:05.989> play<00:03:06.340> C<00:03:07.340> major

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
major chord we know you can play C major

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.819 
major chord we know you can play C major
when<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.030> see<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.239> minor<00:03:08.570> chord<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.140> know<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.530> can

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
when I see a minor chord I know I can

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.130 
when I see a minor chord I know I can
play<00:03:09.859> any<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.579> minor<00:03:10.820> scales<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.900> when<00:03:12.049> we

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
play any of the minor scales so when we

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.410 
play any of the minor scales so when we
see<00:03:12.320> it<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.530> minor<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.400> know<00:03:14.209> we<00:03:14.329> can<00:03:14.359> play

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
see it a minor I know we can play

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.260 
see it a minor I know we can play
and<00:03:16.420> we<00:03:16.570> talk<00:03:17.290> for<00:03:17.560> just<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:17.920> straight

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
what I hate about music so ailing can be

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.860 
what I hate about music so ailing can be
called<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.340> natural<00:03:24.700> minor<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.270> pure<00:03:25.540> minor

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
called the natural minor the pure minor

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.280 
called the natural minor the pure minor
the<00:03:26.620> minor<00:03:26.920> will<00:03:27.550> aeonium<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.110> rather

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
the minor will aeonium so I just rather

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.430 
the minor will aeonium so I just rather
call<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.590> minor<00:03:29.890> scale<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.280> my<00:03:30.400> own<00:03:31.440> but

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
call the minor scale to my own but

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.360 
call the minor scale to my own but
sounds<00:03:32.800> pretty<00:03:33.040> flesh<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.490> on<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:34.920> okay<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.220> so

through the book so we're going to be

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.160 
through the book so we're going to be
looking<00:03:53.950> at<00:03:54.190> page<00:03:54.370> 11<00:03:54.550> and<00:03:54.940> 12<00:03:55.180> but<00:03:55.660> every

all the same setup you'll see that it's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.220 
all the same setup you'll see that it's
the<00:04:02.560> exercises<00:04:03.220> on<00:04:03.340> one<00:04:03.580> page<00:04:03.880> scale<00:04:04.840> patterns

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
every key by two usually a tomb so we're

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.020 
every key by two usually a tomb so we're
just<00:04:56.020> going<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.380> look<00:04:56.710> at<00:04:56.950> one<00:04:57.190> shape<00:04:57.490> maybe<00:04:57.700> 22
