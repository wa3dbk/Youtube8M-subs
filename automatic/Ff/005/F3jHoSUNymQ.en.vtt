00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.550
 hello welcome to all of you on 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 casserole such today a new 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.510
 video presentation that focuses on a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.640
 case that we know well the silent 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 beautiful 802 big white but we have 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.840
 this time the window version with the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.340
 famous double glazing we offer 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.710
 as always a complete presentation 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.290
 of Gaultier's first characteristics 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 techniques with the 266 dimensions by 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 559 by 495 mm a weight of 9 points 3 kg 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.340
 a tea compatibility xx and a tariff 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.649
 of 149 euros for this version with the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.789
 glass door we go to the discovery 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 of this case that we already know well 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 impeccable finish materials of very 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.730
 good quality 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.629
 one starts with the limit front 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.129
 aluminum 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.980
 she is plastic that's fine 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.320
 realized we have two mesh grids around 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 from the facade we will find three bays 5 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.729
 25 inches insulating behind the door 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 then we have a door that he switches on 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 press on it falls forward hal 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.890
 is isolated at the back and we find a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.689
 filter that is removable 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.659
 if they have undone the filter we find 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.220
 two fans in 140 mm pure 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.280
 wings 2 who came on stage in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.270
 block we must all in place see that's 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.899
 simple 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.539
 we then go right with precisely 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.070
 this famous window that is duplicate 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.469
 glazing so we have two plates of 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.210
 plexiglass fit on top of each other and 7 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.369
 the first plate actually is mounted on 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.990
 a rubber seal so that is gray 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.549
 in our case that can be orange in 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.350
 the orange or black tarpaulin in the version 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.360
 marc it allows to have a door in fact 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.789
 who does not deliver simply then 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.890
 that a contrario very often wear them 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.659
 plexiglass round a slight annoying 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.149
 tendency to live and slightly 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.829
 here we find the dock we have the same 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.450
 the other foot side which actually allows a 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.520
 little to suspend the case is a 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.239
 little bit of flexibility and so it allows 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.640
 to fight against vibrations 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.099
 parasites 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.920
 at the back one to the grid to extract 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.959
 lime the fan of 120 mm in pure 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.150
 wings of the location of the plate 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.489
 Rigid motherboard seven slots 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.349
 extension to day and a fine grid 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.959
 the location of the power supply in the 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.360
 low around the edges and rubberized and we have 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.340
 here a filter that will protect 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.840
 feeding below the grid that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.930
 will allow the feeding of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.380
 eat in effect on the right side 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.090
 now we find the device 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.470
 the winds in fact that we can raise 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.060
 if we want to pass a little bit 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 of air at the back of the map tray 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.650
 mother we can also add if we want 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.940
 a slim 120mm fan 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.950
 we also have a small mesh filter 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.840
 we now go on top on the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.299
 on it on the activity diode the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.090
 Pommereuil 2 usb 3.0 the inputs and outputs 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.480
 2 usb 2.0 audio and grids 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.629
 of extraction under Poitiers 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.870
 we mainly have the fairing and so 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:15.519
 the two feet we already saw we're going 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.220
 now go inside this 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.319
 silent mouse 800 have already known 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.000
 you specify we have already tested the case 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.220
 there is a lot of time we will dismount 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.599
 the doors and so you talk a little 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:34.620
 little of the famous double glazing and screws to 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.620
 hand out very easily 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.299
 so first know that the door 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.640
 back and isolated with a material 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.269
 plastic a little soft this rather 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.400
 nice 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.470
 here we are at the 120 mm location for 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:57.250
 slim with the vent that we can push back 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.799
 and the mesh filter at the level of the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.700
 part then we see him no the loin to 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.799
 disassemble and so in fact we have vices 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.930
 and have to actually remove the first 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.430
 part of the plexiglass 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.889
 so that's it if we do not have enough of 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.480
 height without these buses for example but 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.769
 the idea is that both come without 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.450
 click it's on each other in 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.099
 done and it creates an air gap between 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.299
 two and so that allows to have a 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.160
 better insulation 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.900
 everything is mounted on a joint everywhere 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.849
 around and the other advantage is that it 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.660
 really gives a good good 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:30.250
 stiffness at the door which is enough 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.099
 rarely the case since most of the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.870
 time when you have a plexi glass on 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.120
 a steel door we lose all the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.240
 reality at the center level and so we 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.830
 loses in quality felt in any case at 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.900
 level of the door what is not there 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.960
 the case and in addition it will not 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.490
 lose in sound insulation then on 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.530
 the chassis itself is known to 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.639
 the front we have the three bays 5 25 inches 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.110
 the two cages hdd so three hdd for 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.510
 each of the cages 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.690
 we also have ssd slots here 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.310
 or on the top that are to be mounted by 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.840
 screw and we will have two locations 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.699
 the back but we'll come back 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.970
 for mounting hard drives on 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.410
 goes through rubber pads 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.720
 these that will allow for totally 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.030
 annihilated the vibrations of hdd 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.680
 in the front we have two fans of 140 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.979
 mm that will blow fresh air on 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.160
 precisely these hard drives in the bottom 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.540
 we have here a location in 120 140 mm 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.040
 additional the location of 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.550
 feeding with skates in 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.139
 rubber 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.960
 if we continue in the back we have the 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.570
 120mm fan in pure wings 2 and 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.370
 we also have seven expansion slots to 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.440
 note that on this version we have the 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.850
 regulator for the 120 mm fan 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.139
 which finally allows to have a little bit 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.790
 less noise on the 120 fan 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.680
 mm but the potter was already very 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.750
 silent at the beginning so that's 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.700
 always better but it's not 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.400
 indispensable in the top we have both 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.870
 locations in 120 140 mm iam m from 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.460
 height and especially a clearance to 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.850
 the front so no worries for them 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.590
 sales will go for wever radiators 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:05.050
 in 280 mm maximum in the end of 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.060
 the other side of the frame with donation 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.350
 always hide them the cages are 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.210
 totally removable 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.070
 we have lives his hand we can 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.530
 remove we tried two locations 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.120
 for ssd with trays they 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.220
 disassemble quite easily we remove the 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.440
 hand screw we dismount the plateau we see 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.630
 covers for cable management 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.860
 are gray the wide access backplate and 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:30.750
 the studs are already pre-molded it was 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.220
 the signed by 800 window it was on a 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.599
 cowcotland.com and on cocotte tv and on 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.050
 tell you very soon for 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.050
