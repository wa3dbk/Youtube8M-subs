 Charlie what do you mean a toilet roll I go 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.989
 a simple example for you 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.209
 to make 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.420
 so what's the most people way that 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.099
 if you really get the idea again and me 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.370
 can always decorate the way you want 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.019

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.019
 decorations thing you like best 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.140
 I grab a toilet roll and yes that roll pop in 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.549
 a piece of paper it doesn't matter which 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.290
 I just happen to color whitmarsh 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.920
 ban pink beautiful colors you can pink 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.840
 use 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.359
 well i have rom on because look how big 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.730
 this piece of paper must cut because it 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.359
 to use a piece of paper as an enveloped city 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.560
 the 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:12.750
 yes a nice color and that 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.269
 paper lines column fixed for a while 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.590
 pushing well is that otherwise it is stuck and 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.470
 we make the scissors at the bottom 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.039
 then a few of those cuts 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.199
 and he must but yes the glue 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.449
 then and I do that inside and then 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.699
 I line up so that the paper does not pass 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.039
 and the sides and this looks anyway 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.270
 neatly finished off by can both be the 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.599
 sides 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.520
 ok roll one off I already take two 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.400
 where I cut my roll through it 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.919
 and on the hollow say but this is what I am saying 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.490
 but use stick on this I wrap 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.490
 in the paper 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.169
 what you see here is one at my final 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.110
 black line at that line 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.699
 stopped role in addition you see a something 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.220
 lighter this 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.530
 I look at that seling paper even though 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.659
 that is also easy to bend to is less 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.360
 so I will also go into that firmly 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.520
 cut strips that you also saw 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.750
 on this bracelet holder is what I am 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.270
 here is that i don't have any paper 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.190
 kneaded green is much smarter to use in it 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.169
 paper with the rotkind toilet because then 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.030
 is sturdy 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.490
 if it can do but after a tip 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.820
 give is you had a note full of flavor 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.380
 with the scissors in the first toilet roll 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.030
 frunnik a bit and there i do the co2 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.490

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.120
 officially still a little lace 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.770
 imposed cheaply beautiful and then you can be poor 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.770
 other join safe base 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.600

 Of course you want a larger version 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.320
 also use a kitchen roll 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.970
