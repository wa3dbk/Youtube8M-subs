00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.660
 Hi everyone 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.660
 room listen a little had I not feel so good today 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.610
 I don't know how to sing fast anyway, but I wanted to make an old tavern 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.609
 by the means of the other week several people have not asked 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.499
 and here in this video we see how to insert 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.139
 you wouldn't be 4000 meters inside the peyote process 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.289
 that then a paste has been made, a triangle can also be used and that in any case 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.989
 for the angular bonfietti we have a simin band machining 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.140
 and then go to show the steps to include 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.060
 the 4mm swastika inside the work 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.260
 evolta understood the process for cars svaroschi a4 - bette 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.130
 include other measures in the processing 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.580
 then the first thing we need to do is create 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.740
 our peyote work I made a small nam nameplate here 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.479
 example 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.390
 friendly pages where we want to apply the word skype 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.030
 so we have to decide which side will be in correspondence with the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.720
 in the central corner b &amp; b conan 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.840
 this is where the equator is located 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.490
 let's say that I posted scraping oil centrally 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.799
 and they want it but reposition it to the height of this bead 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.230
 green 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.230
 therefore padova padova rosti is said to position 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.190
 this way you see 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.210
 colletta york which is the equator we own correspondence was for 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.710
 nothing indicated 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.660
 tamarreide there will be position of the sky landing 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.960
 keep working in yours 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.200
 creation 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 here I have alternated two daughters 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.970
 color and the reality of children is gray 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.180
 silverlight or something I don't remember 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.640
 work on your way up to the hay jackets you even have 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.920
 taken as a reference 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.729
 earth center of the word back 15euro at this point I need to insert the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.180
 Pepina we direct 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.799
 let's go inside 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.119
 the bead we took as a reference point you see without adding 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.250
 nothing else 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.520
 in this way 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.710
 and then of course they also go to the next page 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.830
 to be able to continue making our past 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:16.059
 how it goes in these other three spaces that remain to us 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.259
 I continued to include petrini di ge 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:23.989
 blessed finished life for allegedly 180-degree work page 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.249

 next one 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.989
 quiniela periagoge episode of the line I'm working on now 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.059
 and enter the weather with - in which you find inside this fancam 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.849
 and to say that the shape and its see why the holes 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.259
 I dedicate to us 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:07.399
 they fit perfectly within the width defined by these two 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.859
 executive beads 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.019
 which must be inserted I request this 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.689
 therefore I am satisfied seven dwarfs we will insert and gray beads in these 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.209
 spaces up to finish the tour 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.949
 I finished the tour 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.669
 dance around you work for practicality 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.909
 and return to insert email beads in this case green 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.259
 but before 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.259
 the second 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.499
 the third 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.469
 and then also a fourth 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:41.580
 and with the account 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.580
 entered the svaroschi 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.499
 for the other part in German always one night clean up 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.289
 the herbs and then go into the gray 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:56.949
 I continue until I finish the tour I finished in China and I work 180 times 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:01.169
 always, for practical reasons, insert new ones for the green line 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.049
 processing 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.009
 the first 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.989
 we insert on the volati panda green sedan then we enter inside both of the 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.299

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.949
 you see me plants pirates word sky second to the mind calls the son 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.789
 and we continue processing flat remove the row 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.319
 I finished the filangieri job print one hundred and eighty the hour to return to insert 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.309
 beads 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.059
 this time manager 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:37.149
 now I have to put on with a series of - they will also serve to cover 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.699
 this upper part of the tank shot species of hat 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.550
 the sequence of beads inserted in our case is exactly the same 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.490
 of the beads 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.550
 who formed the cook below 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.980
 so I miss you so much 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.800
 1 2 3 beep 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.159
 and then another life but of course this is one thing 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.309
 depends on this particular scheme newborn scheme 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.189
 you might have a sequence in the right hand 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.319
 however, I suggest you make a grid on cards so that 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.379
 in the summer italian film 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.289
 moments when you have to enter the various colors 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.130
 anyway 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.130
 basically you always have to enter 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.379
 5 pounds 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.330
 this is the thing that does not change I inserted my 5 sedan on the lake like 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.580
 see now I'm going to come back 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.580
 the next important green pool 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.580
 and then finish the tour 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.050
 excellent, of course, the launch of work and one hundred and eighty letter to the underworld 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.580
 and the executives beads 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.830
 first 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.080
 the second 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.889
 but with works within you go into the first by gray line meeting and then 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.510
 return with which the first three for the green line in the gray bowl 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:50.669
 next one 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.160
 done this I proceed with my classic world processing 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.389
 maceratalavoro start to insert the kitty petunias 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.819
 the second 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.520
 the third 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.009
 the fourth 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.009
 and then we return to the lake in the three green beads 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.379
 I finish the line 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:14.169
 I turned the work and returned to insert new beads on the cont 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.449
 the first 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.729

 philop. continue to enter pertinent until you finish lap 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.069
 all of this 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.400
 come back to work quietly at peyote 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.400

 but you have it was easy to make mistakes 

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:47.990
 in the case of the underlying processing we followed in the back 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.689
 in the case of processing 

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:52.999
 which is located at the top of the bicorne I should have inserted 

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:57.049
