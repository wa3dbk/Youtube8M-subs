00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:09.669

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.339
 We have to do that again now 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:15.289
 three days have been 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.030
 i do not know anything commission forever but 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.950
 there I am again and it is actually 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.370

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.950

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.790

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.149
 that itself is not so accurate and will 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.720

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:48.910
 maybe watch the case 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.339
 it's harder than you think 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:10.940
 Wood always gone maybe I think 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:17.770
 You can hear it without listening 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.770
 So you are more difficult than you think or 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.320
