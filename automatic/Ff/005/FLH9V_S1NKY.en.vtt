00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.670 

what<00:06:45.070> was<00:06:45.190> it<00:06:45.310> confusing<00:06:45.820> really<00:06:46.450> because<00:06:47.440> we

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
what was it confusing really because we

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.070 
what was it confusing really because we
have<00:06:47.770> to<00:06:47.890> rearrange<00:06:48.160> it<00:06:48.490> and<00:06:48.610> then<00:06:48.730> learn<00:06:48.970> it

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
have to rearrange it and then learn it

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.530 
have to rearrange it and then learn it
like<00:06:50.080> we<00:06:50.260> had<00:06:50.380> to<00:06:50.500> late<00:06:50.650> overlap<00:06:51.460> part<00:06:52.330> in<00:06:52.450> our

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
like we had to late overlap part in our

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.030 
like we had to late overlap part in our
brain<00:06:52.810> that<00:06:52.840> tells<00:06:53.200> us<00:06:53.380> to<00:06:53.500> play<00:06:53.710> it<00:06:53.890> the

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
brain that tells us to play it the

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.370 
brain that tells us to play it the
original<00:06:54.460> wait<00:06:54.640> got<00:06:55.330> to<00:06:55.480> erase<00:06:55.780> that<00:06:55.810> and

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
original wait got to erase that and

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.830 
original wait got to erase that and
learn<00:06:56.800> it<00:06:56.980> again<00:06:57.100> a<00:06:57.310> different<00:06:57.760> way<00:06:57.850> so<00:06:58.210> make

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
learn it again a different way so make

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.960 
learn it again a different way so make
sure<00:06:58.870> when<00:06:59.230> it<00:06:59.500> came<00:06:59.650> to<00:06:59.800> onstage<00:07:00.370> we<00:07:00.850> were

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970
