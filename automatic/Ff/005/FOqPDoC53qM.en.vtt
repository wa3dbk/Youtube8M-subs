00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
pretty standard chem on this map it this

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.919 
pretty standard chem on this map it this
Maps<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.790> little<00:00:12.000> bit<00:00:12.120> more<00:00:12.240> difficult<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.750> get

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
Maps a little bit more difficult to get

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.629 
Maps a little bit more difficult to get
cams<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.500> because<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.280> way<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.610> people

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
cams just because the way that people

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.760 
cams just because the way that people
sit<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.450> buildings<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.500> little<00:00:16.650> bit

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
sit in buildings and it's a little bit

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.580

more<00:00:17.039> difficult<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.730> my<00:00:17.880> opinion<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.439> if<00:00:19.439> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
more difficult in my opinion but if you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.439 
more difficult in my opinion but if you
find<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.160> right<00:00:20.279> lobby<00:00:20.580> where<00:00:20.880> people<00:00:21.210> aren't

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
find the right lobby where people aren't

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
really just sitting around and if you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.700 
really just sitting around and if you
can<00:00:23.910> kind<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.750> their<00:00:24.900> faces<00:00:25.230> then

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
can kind of get up in their faces then

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.880

your best choice in my opinion to get

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
your best choice in my opinion to get
your<00:01:16.409> 1st<00:01:16.619> kem<00:01:16.860> strike<00:01:17.100> either<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.520> or<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
your 1st kem strike either this or the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.010 
your 1st kem strike either this or the
honey<00:01:18.090> badger<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:18.840> pretty

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
honey badger there's some pretty

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.590 
honey badger there's some pretty
standard<00:01:19.560> guns<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.600> manageable

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
standard guns that have manageable

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
standard guns that have manageable
recoil<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.500> damage<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
recoil and pretty good damage so I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.070 
recoil and pretty good damage so I
recommend<00:01:23.340> finding<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.119> gun<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.780> use

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
recommend finding a gun that you can use

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
recommend finding a gun that you can use
really<00:01:25.650> really<00:01:26.189> easily<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> gown<00:01:27.240> best

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
really really easily like this gown best
thing<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.780> compare<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.409> ak-12<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.070> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
thing I can compare the ak-12 in this

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.130 
thing I can compare the ak-12 in this
game<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.700> probably<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> Galil<00:01:30.540> from<00:01:30.930> black

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
game to is probably the Galil from black

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.749 
game to is probably the Galil from black
ops<00:01:31.380> 1<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.159> feel<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
ops 1 and just feel like I think it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.370 
ops 1 and just feel like I think it
feels<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.390> gun<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:33.960> opinion<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
