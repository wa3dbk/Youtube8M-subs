00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
here the cable is relatively very loose

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.449 
here the cable is relatively very loose
here<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.350> don't<00:02:18.590> know<00:02:18.800> if<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.950> can<00:02:19.070> see<00:02:19.280> this

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
here the cable is very loose so you can

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.300 
here the cable is very loose so you can
plug<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.640> then<00:02:22.730> kind<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:24.310> and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
plug it in and then kind of see it and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.780 
plug it in and then kind of see it and
kind<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.700> seat<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.209> right<00:02:26.660> into<00:02:26.930> there<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.610> then

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
kind of seat it right into there so then

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.759 
kind of seat it right into there so then
that's<00:02:32.060> where<00:02:32.299> is<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.630> then<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.170> stylus<00:02:33.620> is

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
that's where is and then the stylus is

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.320 
that's where is and then the stylus is
basically<00:02:34.190> right<00:02:34.519> on<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> back<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.180> unit

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
basically right on the back of the unit

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.490 
basically right on the back of the unit
here<00:02:35.720> comes<00:02:36.709> right<00:02:36.980> out<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.690> then<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.840> draw

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.789 

and<00:02:42.500> then<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.980> can<00:02:43.100> actually<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:44.799> continue

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
and then you can actually like continue

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.400 
and then you can actually like continue
to<00:02:45.890> draw<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.130> can<00:02:46.370> actually<00:02:46.549> place<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.410> right

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410
