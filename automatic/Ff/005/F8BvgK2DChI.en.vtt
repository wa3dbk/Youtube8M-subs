00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.029
 Welcome to a new and boxing 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.860
 video today we look at the dvd 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.170
 family guy season ten 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.730
 we probably already had several 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.619
 had a long time in front of the lens and 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.760
 two of these parents is this no the 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.960
 can you have a look at the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.090
 I will link here in the picture and 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.130
 Now the season follows 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.839
 that is not the new one 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.699
 release of family guy for it 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.949
 meanwhile gives the season 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.509
 I already buy eleven or 711 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.859
 believe that is decided with march 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.550
 I wish you all wrong and here the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:38.050
 I think the last season is the last 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.190
 year appeared in april or may 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.230
 At least I think so too 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.670
 certainly in any case there was a long 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.160
 Time span between these trends 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.140
 eleven where they published 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.270
 have been 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 yes, why did I buy myself now? 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.920
 I have that last time at 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.750
 public citizen already said if one 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.060
 new season of family guy on dvd 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.680
 appear are the relatively expensive so 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.120
 the season eleven for example the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.579
 Currently available is the new one 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.080
 The price is 27 to 29 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.780
 99 I think that for a few follow 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.159
 america but already a heftier price 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.720
 in this trend I have been different 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.490
 That's why I wanted to wait until first 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.650
 the season has become a bit cheaper 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.210
 However, the price is 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.750
 unfortunately nothing was done so I have mine 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.100
 bought this season for 26 euros so 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.760
 the price varies depending on where you are 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.200
 the season next to buys and now 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.580
 I bought it and I wanted to stop 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.900
 In any case, know how it goes 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.590
 because i know i all follow from 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 family guy 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.990
 because I really want to dvd 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.549
 publication instead of waiting for me 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.100
 hope that once formally on TV 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.600
 runs and I really have to hope that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.330
 as a new episode comes and city 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.280
 repetitions and also the consequences 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.890
 on the dvds are uncut that 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.060
 means plus uncut plus levels 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.369
 uncut German dubbing 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.780
 so there are no places where on 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.159
 english umswitchen united we are 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 completely German dubbed what I am 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.290
 great find 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.110
 That's why I definitely want to 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.939
 dvd release wait as I said 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.520
 I'm curious how it goes on 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.080
 although yes I have with the others 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.940
 Publications also already said it 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.670
 is not really the season 10 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.680
 but at family they describe 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.530
 two seasons on it but actually are 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.870
 The sea ​​where volumes call shooting 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.880
 as I am correct in experience 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.260
 could bring twelve 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.850
 follow from the eighth season 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.970
 last twelve follow the eighth season 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.250
 as well as three follow the ninth season 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.070
 So yes with these you can 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.910
 probably only with the season 13 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.330
 open, I think if this 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.830
 release policy so 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.610
 what is going on with family guy is continued 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.280
 I think 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.840
 yes I'm told this way 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.450
 currently there are already 11 and I help 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.320
 I hope that soon another season 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.460
 release come that we 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.150
 really all follow in german 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.130
 on dvd I get what synonymous 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.440
 I hope that soon it will be family guy 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.900
 on blu ray there is the company 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.090
 film trilogy what does that mean laughed only 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.920
 damages fur would be, I believe these are 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.630
 yes the parodies to the star trek star 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.160
 wars movies this or one to three the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.750
 there are now on blu-ray 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.210
 or has been around for a while 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.240
 blu ray and family guy unfortunately so far only 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.400
 on dvd though i think from season 9 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.800
 will be the consequences in one at least 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 also aired in america in hd 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.130
 That's why I think I do not speak 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.180
 on the other hand, the further release on 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.780
 bring out blu ray 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.239
 you can only hope but you have to 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.989
 just wait was not good we look 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.989
 us the dvd 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.520
 something can be 16 logo but like me 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.350
 pretty sure as well as the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.200
 old movie released illegally and 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.250
 there is also a wendecover here 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.250
 but we will see at the same time 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.769
 read the back text by the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.239
 inhabitants of korok will be in the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.950
 mysterious estate of james woods 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.200
 invited and spend one there 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.670
 night with murder and homicide, of course 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.620
 survive that all guests and the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.269
 question is whether Peter can solve the case 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.519
 or if he still has everything as usual 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.350
 Worse, experience your family guy 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.209
 Never have them in this one before 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.880
 classic murder mystery and 14 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.750
 other totally funny as soden 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.389
 including the groundbreaking like 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.090
 controversial 150 episode as well as the family 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.160
 guy hit xxl medium where chris &amp; stories 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.650
 get lost in the forest and peter his 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.940
 psychic are discovered talent 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.470
 episodes on three discs and down here 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.780
 is just what I have already 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.539
 I exclusively said all persons in 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.860
 extended synchronized version what 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.720
 Of course I find bombastic and what 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.160
 also as I said as I also stands 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.630
 exclusively just on these dvds 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.449
 There is television on television 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.100
 they do not just follow so uncut 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.100
 some extras yet 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.070
 and what also find strange 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.210
 or maybe I would be me 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.220
 because it's a bit meaty too 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.260
 the dvds is a bit different here 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.110
 Picture format is in 43 and not even 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.550
 already said from season 9 that I 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.710
 I'm pretty sure it's 9th 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.660
 is the consequences in hd 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.820
 aired what means 16 9 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.650
 format therefore already three follow the new one 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.139
 scale well-contained, they must 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.660
 then actually be in 16 9 format or 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:29.530
 Well, I'm not sure maybe 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.350
 because most of the season here 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.940
 follow the season 8 are 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.530
 this just in 4 3 format because of it 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.210
 that maybe listed can be me 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.580
 err, I'm not sure but me 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.530
 have a look into the blu ray player 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.220
 a throw and what look if 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.430
 that is confirmed or not good if 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:52.930
 Let's take a look 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.860
 I think that's where the storage is 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.960
 certainly does not merit 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.820
 have changed great as the 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.820
 old dvd release of family 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.320
 guy what means to them like a kind 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.370
 the spindle will forget the 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.370
 started each other 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.480
 yes, as I thought 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.220
 here we have a bit of advertising, the 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.430
 we can just go straight to 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.020
 lay side 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.670
 we just have the three discs 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.690
 stacked on each other as he said the 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.690
 I want to get everyone out 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.210
 disc 1 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.420
 the 2nd 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:54.849
 and finally the last disc 3 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.070
 Well last but not least, let's have a look 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.330
 still allowed is a wendecover hat 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.600
 I doubt but well you can only 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.380
 look nothing costs 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.360
 but you can already see no here 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.220
 has wendecover you look in vain 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.580
 You have to take that with me 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.650
 the fsk 16 logo all clear 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.100
 that would first boxing video of family 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.450
 Guy you are on DVD 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.750
 I say goodbye and see you next 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.750
 times
