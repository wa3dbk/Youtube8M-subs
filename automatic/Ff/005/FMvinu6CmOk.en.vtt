00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
to kill Stanley two times and maybe we

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.960 
to kill Stanley two times and maybe we

opened<00:05:21.119> passageway<00:05:21.899> right<00:05:22.349> okay<00:05:23.249> so<00:05:23.309> this<00:05:23.429> is

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
opened passageway right okay so this is

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.809

so

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.499 

I<00:05:34.020> don't<00:05:34.860> know<00:05:34.949> what'll<00:05:35.130> happen<00:05:35.370> but<00:05:35.850> there

I don't know what'll happen but there
was<00:05:36.600> a<00:05:36.660> lot<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.960> computers<00:05:37.350> in<00:05:37.500> there<00:05:37.620> though

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
was a lot of computers in there though

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.070 
was a lot of computers in there though
so<00:05:39.229> we'll<00:05:40.229> see<00:05:41.030> what<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.060> can<00:05:42.240> find<00:05:42.479> if<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:42.930> just

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
so we'll see what I can find if I just

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.570 
so we'll see what I can find if I just
like<00:05:43.229> not<00:05:43.620> listen<00:05:43.949> to<00:05:44.039> the<00:05:44.130> dude<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.430> dude
