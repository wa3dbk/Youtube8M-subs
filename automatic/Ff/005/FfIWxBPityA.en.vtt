00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
pretty much you can have two people on

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.900 
pretty much you can have two people on
the<00:00:48.180> dirt<00:00:48.360> box<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.700> I'm<00:00:50.700> not

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the dirt box as you can see and I'm not

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.930 
the dirt box as you can see and I'm not
exactly<00:00:51.360> sure<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.559> would<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:53.340> balanced

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
exactly sure how this would be balanced

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
exactly sure how this would be balanced
because<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.649> engineer<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
because if you have an engineer in the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
because if you have an engineer in the
back<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.420> javelin<00:00:58.020> locking<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.920> either

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
back with javelin locking on to either

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.590 
back with javelin locking on to either
the<00:00:59.699> vehicle<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.960> carrying<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.039> flag<00:01:02.190> or

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the vehicle that is carrying the flag or

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
the vehicle that is carrying the flag or
the<00:01:03.600> dirt<00:01:03.840> bike<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> enemy<00:01:05.220> team<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.850> if

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the dirt bike on the enemy team and if

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.880 
the dirt bike on the enemy team and if
you<00:01:06.270> remember<00:01:06.750> javelins<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.439> actually<00:01:07.710> lock

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you remember javelins can actually lock

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.789 
you remember javelins can actually lock
on<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.310> jeeps<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.760> etc<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.080> battlefield

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
on two jeeps and etc in the battlefield

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.399 
on two jeeps and etc in the battlefield
3<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> lock<00:01:12.479> onto<00:01:12.630> those<00:01:13.080> vehicles

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
3 so if you can lock onto those vehicles

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.560 
3 so if you can lock onto those vehicles
which<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.920> list<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.000> gonna<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.240> like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
which I list and that it's gonna be like

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.140 
which I list and that it's gonna be like
you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.290> javelin<00:01:17.009> warfare<00:01:17.400> which<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:17.970> not

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you know javelin warfare which are not

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.929 
you know javelin warfare which are not
really<00:01:18.420> keen<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.979> playing<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.369> we'll<00:01:20.729> see<00:01:20.909> how

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
really keen to playing but we'll see how

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
really keen to playing but we'll see how
it<00:01:21.090> goes<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.689> hopefully<00:01:22.500> dice<00:01:23.040> knows<00:01:23.369> what

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it goes and hopefully dice knows what

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
it goes and hopefully dice knows what
they're<00:01:23.790> doing<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.630> new<00:01:24.810> game<00:01:25.049> mode

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.219 
basically the gist of this game type is
you<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.470> 425<00:01:35.159> jets<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.850> each<00:01:35.990> team<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you have 425 jets on each team and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
you have 425 jets on each team and
they're<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.950> facing<00:01:38.189> off<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
they're going to be facing off in the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.929 
they're going to be facing off in the
air<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.799> game<00:01:41.189> type<00:01:41.460> only

air this is going to be a game type only
for<00:01:42.180> jets<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.740> actually<00:01:43.920> capture

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
for jets and you can actually capture

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.440 
for jets and you can actually capture
flags<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.290> jet<00:01:46.649> while<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> air<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
flags in the jet while in the air this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990

you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.149> conquest<00:02:00.570> domination<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
you can in conquest domination and you

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.530 
you can in conquest domination and you
can<00:02:01.890> capture<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.280> flags<00:02:02.549> while<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> air

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
can capture the flags while in the air

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.249 
can capture the flags while in the air
in<00:02:03.990> de<00:02:04.170> jet<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.219> hot<00:02:06.090> air<00:02:06.360> balloons<00:02:06.960> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
in de jet and the hot air balloons that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.760 
in de jet and the hot air balloons that
are<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.799> air<00:02:07.979> those<00:02:08.520> are<00:02:08.729> pretty<00:02:09.030> much<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
are in the air those are pretty much the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.500 
are in the air those are pretty much the
equivalent<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.160> flags<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.390> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
equivalent of the flags and you have to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
equivalent of the flags and you have to
be<00:02:12.540> around<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.200> capture<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.830> obviously

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
be around it to capture it and obviously

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.210 
be around it to capture it and obviously
teammates<00:02:15.599> will<00:02:15.840> help<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.230> capture<00:02:16.410> faster

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
teammates will help you capture faster

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.720 
teammates will help you capture faster
so<00:02:17.819> far<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.300> looks<00:02:18.330> very<00:02:18.720> solid<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:20.099> kind<00:02:20.700> of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
so far it looks very solid but kind of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.990 
so far it looks very solid but kind of
couple<00:02:21.390> questions<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.989> bring<00:02:22.620> into<00:02:23.520> my<00:02:23.550> head

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
couple questions that bring into my head

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.720 
couple questions that bring into my head
while<00:02:24.450> watching<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.930> gameplay<00:02:25.379> was<00:02:25.730> heat

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
while watching the gameplay was heat

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.150 
while watching the gameplay was heat
seekers<00:02:27.300> now<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.230> remember<00:02:28.290> heat<00:02:28.830> seekers

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
seekers now if you remember heat seekers

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.420 
seekers now if you remember heat seekers
are<00:02:29.629> balanced<00:02:30.629> only<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:31.530> player<00:02:31.830> jets<00:02:32.190> on

are balanced only for two player jets on

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.330 
are balanced only for two player jets on

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
each team but to be honest i'm not

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.040 
each team but to be honest i'm not
exactly<00:02:35.790> sure<00:02:36.000> how<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.989> be

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
exactly sure how this is going to be

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.640 
exactly sure how this is going to be
balanced<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:38.180> game<00:02:39.180> type<00:02:39.480> where<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.319> have

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
locking on to you with heat seekers like

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.960 
locking on to you with heat seekers like
every<00:02:48.510> two<00:02:48.660> seconds<00:02:49.170> then<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.560> any<00:02:50.190> skilled

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
every two seconds then I any skilled

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.720 
every two seconds then I any skilled
pilot<00:02:51.390> will<00:02:51.989> not<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.500> able<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.890> evade<00:02:53.459> all

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
pilot will not be able to evade all

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.940 
pilot will not be able to evade all
those<00:02:54.330> heat<00:02:54.690> seekers<00:02:55.110> yeah<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.650> flares

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
those heat seekers yeah you have flares

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.699 
those heat seekers yeah you have flares
yeah<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.489> dodge<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.090> heat<00:02:57.269> seekers

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
yeah you can dodge the heat seekers

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.920 
yeah you can dodge the heat seekers
through<00:02:58.709> maneuver<00:02:59.340> techniques<00:02:59.760> bush<00:03:00.120> evasive

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
through maneuver techniques bush evasive

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.740 
through maneuver techniques bush evasive
maneuvers<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:02.069> think<00:03:02.909> he<00:03:03.269> seekers<00:03:03.629> are

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
maneuvers but I think he seekers are

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.720 
maneuvers but I think he seekers are
gonna<00:03:04.110> be<00:03:04.290> really<00:03:04.709> annoying<00:03:05.129> in<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.519> game

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
gonna be really annoying in this game

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.830 
gonna be really annoying in this game
type<00:03:05.940> I'm<00:03:06.180> really<00:03:07.400> surprised<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.640> they<00:03:09.450> are

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
type I'm really surprised that they are

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.050 
type I'm really surprised that they are
allowing<00:03:10.379> heat<00:03:10.860> seekers<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.580> game<00:03:11.790> type

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
allowing heat seekers in this game type

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.960 
allowing heat seekers in this game type
I<00:03:12.269> thought<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:13.050> was<00:03:13.110> supposed<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.159> be<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.519> game

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
I thought this was supposed to be a game

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.229 
I thought this was supposed to be a game
type<00:03:15.239> where<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:16.110> get<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.680> show<00:03:16.890> off<00:03:16.920> your<00:03:17.239> jet

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
type where you get to show off your jet

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.259 
type where you get to show off your jet
skills<00:03:18.659> and<00:03:19.069> not<00:03:20.069> how<00:03:20.370> many<00:03:20.430> times<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:21.030> can

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
skills and not how many times you can

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.509 
skills and not how many times you can
lock<00:03:21.450> onto<00:03:21.659> an<00:03:21.959> enemy<00:03:22.290> jet<00:03:22.590> with<00:03:22.800> heat<00:03:23.099> seekers

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
lock onto an enemy jet with heat seekers

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.670 
lock onto an enemy jet with heat seekers
I'm<00:03:24.150> not<00:03:24.269> really<00:03:24.480> sure<00:03:24.599> how<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.319> gonna<00:03:25.530> be

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
I'm not really sure how this is gonna be

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.619 
I'm not really sure how this is gonna be
playing<00:03:25.980> out<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.459> future<00:03:26.909> hopefully<00:03:27.239> dice
