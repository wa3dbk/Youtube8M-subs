00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello there i can sysadmin today i 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.109
 I will tell how the partition converter 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
 gpt to mbr 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.219
 but here's a banal situation you try 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.099
 install windows 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.680
 and it does not work out an installation error 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.630
 windows on this drive is not possible 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.900
 the selected disk has gpt partition style 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.320
 that is, the windows installer requires strength 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.310
 sections mbr you have a dpt 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 it happens if you try 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.320
 reinstall the computer or laptop with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.809
 windows 8 on windows 7 because 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.989
 windows 8 has a gpt partition style 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.170
 windows 7 has strongly mbr partition like 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.940
 fix it all for it in the very 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 windows installer need to run 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.890
 command line for this click 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.039
 shift and 10 and command line need 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.289
 run the diskpart utility for this in 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.469
 command line we write the diskpart command 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.379
 and press enter utility diskpart 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.030
 started now let's see the list 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.239
 installed hard drives on 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.430
 computer for this we write the list command 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.490
 disk 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.979
 have the drive and press enter my case 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.830
 I have only one disk on my computer 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.470
 which is called disk 0 let's get it 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 select for this we write the select command 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.220
 disk 0 click again bender disk 0 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.590
 now you need it completely 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.130
 clear it will completely remove everything 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.430
 To do this, we write a wedge command and press 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.189
 again 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.170
 enter diskpart cleared disk now 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.430
 let's convert it to a different style 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.600
 markup for this we write a command envelope 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.020
 mbr and click again 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.869
 enter and write and output that utility 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.439
 diskpart converted disk to mbr 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.149
 format now need to quit push exit 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.180
 and exit again 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.380
 all can now safely continue 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 install windows 7 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 because the hard drive was converted to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.610
 another sat markup and no errors about 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 the fact that the wrong forces markup times 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.479
 the hard disk will not be at the same time I 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.370
