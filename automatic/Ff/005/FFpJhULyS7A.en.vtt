00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a 1.8 inch drive the sort of thing you'd

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450 
a 1.8 inch drive the sort of thing you'd
find<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:09.720> ipod<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.220> choose<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
have 64 gigabytes of solid-state if

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.480 
have 64 gigabytes of solid-state if
you've<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.820> lot<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> money<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.450> spend<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you've got a lot of money to spend it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
you've got a lot of money to spend it
also<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.450> doesn't<00:01:18.659> feature<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.530> optical<00:01:19.950> drive

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
also it doesn't feature an optical drive

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.840 
also it doesn't feature an optical drive
so<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.270> can't<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> DVD<00:01:22.890> player<00:01:22.920> but

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
so you can't use it as a DVD player but

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.940 
so you can't use it as a DVD player but
it<00:01:24.509> comes<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.049> great<00:01:25.110> software<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it comes with some great software that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.999 
it comes with some great software that
allows<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.850> use<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.659> optical<00:01:28.470> drive<00:01:28.710> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
allows you to use the optical drive in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.789 
allows you to use the optical drive in
another<00:01:29.159> mac<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:29.790> pc<00:01:29.900> elsewhere<00:01:30.900> wirelessly

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
another mac or pc elsewhere wirelessly

so if you want to install software it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.330 
so if you want to install software it's
not<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> problem<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.530> don't<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> buy<00:01:35.220> an

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
site from the from the dr thing is multi

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.880 
site from the from the dr thing is multi
touch<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.750> doesn't<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> touch<00:01:43.470> sensitive

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
touch it doesn't have a touch sensitive
screen<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> does<00:01:45.000> allow<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.630> use

zoom in and out using that call pinch
movement<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:51.060> I've<00:01:51.210> used<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.020> not

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
movement now I've used this it's not

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.219 
movement now I've used this it's not
quite<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.829> intuitive<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.970> iphone<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.720> but

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
quite as intuitive as the iphone and but

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.310 
quite as intuitive as the iphone and but
it<00:01:55.350> still<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.280> real<00:01:56.820> step<00:01:57.180> forward<00:01:57.240> into

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it still is a real step forward into

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.040 
it still is a real step forward into
