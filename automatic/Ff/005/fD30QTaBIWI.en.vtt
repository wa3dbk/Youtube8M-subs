00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 We are taking some measures that 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.089
 he probably does not like anything with 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.589
 an average protest proposal where 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.410
 they hung the flags and put the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.009
 bombs and put a poster now ask 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.410
 the resignation of the manager this are 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.050
 militants politics can not you 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.610
 we can not enter the game that here 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.289
 you can not do anything we have 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.930
 convictions we treat it and now in front 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.300
 we have asked for the support of the one who proceeds 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.150
 has given us I want to be sincere 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.230
 healthy based on the long meeting with the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.970
 Senior Commissioner RubÃ©n PÃ©rez 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.800
 and well we had made a 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.710
 a strategy in this regard we can not 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 continue like this we can not have the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.570
 flags that are the flags are 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.910
 immense there are inside can hide 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.580
 anything and I can not within a 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.650
 club property where I the president 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.500
 tomorrow something may appear that does not 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.960
 We use malparados signs or with 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.460
 no partner who is going to swim does not leave his 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.360
 bag inside the club when it goes to your 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.800
 house because to go to the boat save 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.600
 the little bag that I go to the court and I come 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.090
 the panty and extending it seems to me that 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.920
 we should consider the bars as we already 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 what we say they are partners were is a 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.650
 common partner 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 exactly this was a use and custom 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.510
 of previous arrangements that were saved 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.500
 the flags there sent to take out that 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.050
 were notified through the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.200
 first police station of avellaneda sent 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.590
 to draw flags that were from others 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.830
 clubs were their own I asked that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.290
 they will also take their own 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.240
 well I know there was a discussion after 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.160
 the party because they said it does not have 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.080
 where to put it so from a few days 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.270
 even in another place where you keep them 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.130
 well there the police made an act that 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.640
 we were working on that in that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.729
 sense we are inflexible 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.020
 and we've already talked about Gonzalo and remember 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.290
 very well some words of yours that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.290
 I want 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 I'll have to pay the right to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 author what was shown above after 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.850
 the party that when the bar did not sing 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.850
 or did not want to make the party the court 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 it was a party maybe like never before and 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.810
 there without flags what we have to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.280
 to do now is to try to make it easier for 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.210
 the fans a flag to go for what 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.370
 more girl what was 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.409
 people want to see football the team the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.659
 second time was 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.099
 good he attacked on all fronts 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.409
 won the game the people were 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.349
 very happy we do not need a group 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.969
 come and tell us how to make a party 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.069
 soccer exists with fiesta de hace 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.480
 many years and I can do the same 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.590
 I want to solve this issue for the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.370
 independent partners for fans 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.049
 commons that want to go to encourage me 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.879
 I felt supported the measures were taken 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.430
 that you have to take 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.400
 I think this is just beginning I think 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.400
 they have started a career that serves as 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.750
 said today denouncing a manager because 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.049
 a salary manager with bull 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.560
 salary and works 11 11 hours per day 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.180
 above is a personal friend not for 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.709
 lucky the selection to grams us and 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.970
 the managers put them and we take it out 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.560
 we are going to say from outside 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.530
 that what we have to do and a lot 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.140
 less those who lived applauding the 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.300
 previous management by silencing 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.910
 those who criticized the management 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.880
 previous in the matches they crossed 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.160
 tribune to tribune to silence them and 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.340
 well we are going to take measures 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.180
 simple humbly but very firm not 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.180
 let's take a step back
