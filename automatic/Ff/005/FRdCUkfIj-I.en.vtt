hi I'm Johannes of new gadgets of the e
and<00:00:12.170> i'm<00:00:12.320> here<00:00:12.560> at<00:00:12.710> the<00:00:12.740> cv<00:00:13.150> 2011's<00:00:14.150> booth<00:00:14.660> here

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
and i'm here at the cv 2011's booth here

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.290 
and i'm here at the cv 2011's booth here
at<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:15.890> array<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:16.400> station<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.060> we<00:00:17.090> have

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
at the array the station so we have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.940 
at the array the station so we have
ereader<00:00:18.160> gr<00:00:19.330> 900<00:00:20.330> it's<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.600> 9-inch<00:00:21.140> new<00:00:21.710> reader

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
ereader gr 900 it's a 9-inch new reader

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.920 
ereader gr 900 it's a 9-inch new reader
with<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.430> electronic<00:00:22.970> paper<00:00:23.180> display<00:00:23.689> and

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
with the electronic paper display and

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.019 
with the electronic paper display and
the<00:00:23.960> resolution<00:00:24.560> of<00:00:24.770> 1024<00:00:25.700> x<00:00:25.820> 768<00:00:26.540> and<00:00:28.029> 150

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
the resolution of 1024 x 768 and 150

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.530 
the resolution of 1024 x 768 and 150
points<00:00:29.599> per<00:00:29.840> inch<00:00:29.990> pixel<00:00:30.650> fringe<00:00:31.419> so<00:00:32.419> it

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
points per inch pixel fringe so it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.880 
points per inch pixel fringe so it
supports<00:00:32.689> two<00:00:33.620> gigabytes<00:00:34.100> of<00:00:34.340> internal<00:00:35.210> flash

only experimental we have a file manager
set<00:01:53.670> up<00:01:53.819> sketch<00:01:54.119> pad<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.080> let's<00:01:55.380> check<00:01:55.679> out<00:01:55.800> the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
set up sketch pad so let's check out the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.240 
set up sketch pad so let's check out the
sketch<00:01:56.280> pad

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
sketch pad

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.120 
sketch pad
they<00:01:58.820> hope<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.120> will<00:01:59.150> work

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.270 

ok

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.850 

as<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.090> see<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.630> electronic<00:02:10.500> paper<00:02:10.679> is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
as you can see the electronic paper is

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
as you can see the electronic paper is
not<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.370> fastest<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.360> works<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.319> for

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
not the fastest one but it works so for

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.340 
not the fastest one but it works so for
small<00:02:14.630> sketches<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:16.410> quite<00:02:16.830> okay

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.080 

let's<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> quick<00:02:23.400> look<00:02:23.430> around<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
let's have a quick look around the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.600 
let's have a quick look around the
device<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.650> top<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:26.010> have<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.310> power

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
device so on top we have the power

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.160 
device so on top we have the power
button<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.720> turn<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.530> off
