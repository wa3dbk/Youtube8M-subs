00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
once it's all set you just hit the start

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.560 
once it's all set you just hit the start
button<00:01:35.859> and<00:01:36.859> then<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.189> goes<00:01:37.340> now<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.450> the

time to prepare your boots for the
molding<00:01:42.649> process<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.450> want<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.689> make<00:01:44.840> sure

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
molding process so you want to make sure

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.749 
molding process so you want to make sure
every<00:01:45.469> single<00:01:45.649> button<00:01:46.070> buckle<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.880> undone<00:01:47.420> and

every single button buckle is undone and

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.639 
every single button buckle is undone and
you<00:01:49.759> want<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.060> check<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.570> inside<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
you want to check that the inside of the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.730 
you want to check that the inside of the
liner<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.219> completely<00:01:53.149> empty<00:01:53.359> because<00:01:54.289> quite

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
liner is completely empty because quite

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.099 
liner is completely empty because quite
often<00:01:55.009> there's<00:01:55.280> going<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:55.460> be<00:01:55.780> materials<00:01:56.780> from

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
often there's going to be materials from

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.069 
often there's going to be materials from
the<00:01:57.649> gear<00:01:57.950> manufacturer<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:59.899> going<00:02:00.020> to

the gear manufacturer that is going to

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.440 
the gear manufacturer that is going to
be<00:02:00.200> left<00:02:00.350> behind<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.039> make<00:02:02.030> sure<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.329> the

be left behind and make sure that the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.590 
be left behind and make sure that the
insoles<00:02:02.780> are<00:02:02.960> taken<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.530> boots<00:02:04.600> so

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
insoles are taken out of the boots so

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.109 
insoles are taken out of the boots so
now<00:02:06.049> if<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.320> boots<00:02:06.499> are<00:02:06.679> opened<00:02:07.009> up<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.700> shell

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
now if the boots are opened up the shell

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.600 
now if the boots are opened up the shell
is<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.720> walk<00:02:08.929> mode<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.440> can<00:02:09.649> get<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.890> really

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
is in walk mode so you can get it really

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.110 
is in walk mode so you can get it really
nice<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:10.909> open

following<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.790> curve<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.660> tube<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.550> see

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
following the curve of the tube and see

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.440 
following the curve of the tube and see
that<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.870> set<00:02:33.110> on<00:02:33.230> there<00:02:33.410> properly<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.450> that

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
of the liner and it's also gonna create

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.199 
of the liner and it's also gonna create
a<00:03:51.440> little<00:03:51.680> pocket<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.190> warm<00:03:52.400> air<00:03:52.639> so<00:03:52.910> your<00:03:53.060> toes

are going to stay much warmer so the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.500 
are going to stay much warmer so the
boots<00:03:55.130> have<00:03:55.310> just<00:03:55.519> finished<00:03:55.670> their<00:03:55.940> 12<00:03:56.239> minute

everything is aligned properly you
really<00:05:05.570> want<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.900> take<00:05:06.050> extra<00:05:06.530> care<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:07.220> take<00:05:07.640> a

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
really want to take extra care to take a

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.480 
really want to take extra care to take a
look<00:05:08.030> at<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:09.260> tongue<00:05:09.560> of<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.860> liner<00:05:10.220> here

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
look at the the tongue of the liner here

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.010 
look at the the tongue of the liner here
because<00:05:10.850> this<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.180> where<00:05:11.330> things<00:05:11.570> can<00:05:11.900> get

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
because this is where things can get

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:20.110 
because this is where things can get
buggered<00:05:12.500> up<00:05:18.220> nice<00:05:19.220> tight<00:05:19.520> seal<00:05:19.760> with<00:05:20.090> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
buggered up nice tight seal with the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.590 
buggered up nice tight seal with the
liner<00:05:20.630> on<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.930> upper<00:05:21.380> cuff<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:22.390> it's<00:05:23.390> usually

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
liner on the upper cuff and it's usually

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.410 
liner on the upper cuff and it's usually
a<00:05:23.840> good<00:05:24.170> idea<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.920> get<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.430> power<00:05:25.760> strap<00:05:26.150> on

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
a good idea to get the power strap on

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.420 
a good idea to get the power strap on
first<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.290> will<00:05:27.470> help<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.770> pull<00:05:28.250> the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
first and that will help to pull the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.140 
first and that will help to pull the
shell<00:05:28.670> together

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
shell together

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.390 
shell together
so<00:05:29.840> when<00:05:30.020> buckling<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.560> boots<00:05:30.770> this<00:05:31.040> is<00:05:31.220> where

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
so when buckling the boots this is where

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.130 
so when buckling the boots this is where
you<00:05:31.520> really<00:05:31.970> want<00:05:32.180> to<00:05:32.300> take<00:05:32.480> some<00:05:32.660> extra<00:05:32.930> care

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
you really want to take some extra care

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.470 
you really want to take some extra care
and<00:05:33.260> attention<00:05:33.430> because<00:05:34.430> this<00:05:34.760> is<00:05:34.940> gonna

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
and attention because this is gonna

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.360 
and attention because this is gonna
determine<00:05:35.750> your<00:05:36.200> final<00:05:36.560> fit<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.130> liner

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
determine your final fit of the liner

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.420 
determine your final fit of the liner
when<00:05:37.940> it's<00:05:38.090> when<00:05:38.450> it<00:05:38.540> solidifies<00:05:39.160> if<00:05:40.160> you<00:05:40.280> have

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430
