it<00:00:34.320> works<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.510> what<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it works for now and what it is is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.400 
it works for now and what it is is
pistons<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.399> hit<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.110> cut<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
pistons or hit here which will cut the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.950 
pistons or hit here which will cut the
red<00:00:40.559> stone<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.610> middle<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.030> these<00:00:42.210> two<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
red stone in the middle so these two the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
red stone in the middle so these two the
top<00:00:43.170> two<00:00:43.379> will<00:00:43.800> fall<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.910> bottom<00:00:45.180> one

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
top two will fall and the bottom one

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.580 
top two will fall and the bottom one
will<00:00:45.420> stay<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.660> keep<00:00:45.840> growing<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> water

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
will stay and keep growing and the water

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.900 
will stay and keep growing and the water
brings<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> down<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.670> call<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
brings it down here you just call the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.529 
brings it down here you just call the
home<00:00:48.030> collect<00:00:48.300> them<00:00:50.149> basically<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.300> i<00:00:51.329> did

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
home collect them basically what i did

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
home collect them basically what i did
there<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> bunch<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> pistons<00:00:52.530> with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
there is a bunch of pistons with

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.770 
there is a bunch of pistons with
redstone<00:00:53.670> repeaters<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> redstone

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
redstone repeaters and then the redstone

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380 
redstone repeaters and then the redstone
connects<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.340> side<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
connects them over this side which is a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.840 
connects them over this side which is a
bunch<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.079> other<00:00:58.199> Pistons<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:59.430> summer<00:00:59.670> peter

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
bunch of other Pistons my summer peter

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.130 
bunch of other Pistons my summer peter
and<00:01:00.170> then<00:01:01.170> over<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.920> made<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> Blood<00:01:02.520> switch

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
and then over here I made a Blood switch

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.340 
and then over here I made a Blood switch
so<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.189> read<00:01:05.580> grows<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.869> hits

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so that when this read grows and hits

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
so that when this read grows and hits
this<00:01:07.890> block<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.060> don't<00:01:09.479> want<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this block right here I don't want to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.490 
this block right here I don't want to
show<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.049> everything<00:01:10.409> will

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
show it to you because everything will

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
show it to you because everything will
cut<00:01:10.680> well<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.610> lit<00:01:12.439> this<00:01:13.439> wall<00:01:14.040> stress<00:01:14.640> on

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
cut well I will lit this wall stress on

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.920 
cut well I will lit this wall stress on
pulse<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.650> it'll<00:01:16.650> activate<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.930> these

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
pulse and it'll activate this these

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.240 
pulse and it'll activate this these
Pistons<00:01:19.350> which<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.710> cut<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> red<00:01:20.070> stone

these<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> top<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:28.140> let's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
these are all at the top now let's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.800 
these are all at the top now let's
pretend<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.979> block<00:01:29.520> group<00:01:32.090> all<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.180> it'll

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
pretend this block group all right it'll

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.069 
pretend this block group all right it'll
restart<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.560> piston<00:01:34.920> cut<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
restart because that piston cut it and

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.640 
restart because that piston cut it and
now<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> these<00:01:38.310> are<00:01:38.520> cut<00:01:39.259> which<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.290> pretty

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
now all of these are cut which is pretty

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.300 
now all of these are cut which is pretty
sick<00:01:41.090> someone<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.210> stuck<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:43.130> not<00:01:44.130> too

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
sick someone get stuck up here not too

wrestling tortured then you want to put

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.370 
wrestling tortured then you want to put
a<00:04:59.950> block<00:05:00.370> arrest<00:05:00.610> on<00:05:00.760> there<00:05:00.940> put<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.990> block<00:05:02.350> here

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
a block arrest on there put a block here

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.280 
a block arrest on there put a block here
and<00:05:02.890> then<00:05:03.850> stack<00:05:04.270> up<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.870> that<00:05:04.900> and

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
and then stack up to you like that and

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.780 
and then stack up to you like that and
break<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.560> first<00:05:05.770> one<00:05:05.980> so<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.520> can<00:05:06.550> put<00:05:06.760> a

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
break the first one so you can put a

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.270 
break the first one so you can put a
torch<00:05:07.090> under<00:05:07.480> then<00:05:08.260> you<00:05:08.380> jump<00:05:08.680> up<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.130> put

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
torch under then you jump up and you put

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.960 
torch under then you jump up and you put
a<00:05:09.310> redstone<00:05:09.490> dust<00:05:09.790> there<00:05:11.460> then<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.550> cross<00:05:12.790> it

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
a redstone dust there then you cross it

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.070 
a redstone dust there then you cross it
over<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:14.100> put<00:05:15.100> a<00:05:15.130> repeater<00:05:15.520> there<00:05:15.850> and

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
over and you put a repeater there and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.659 
over and you put a repeater there and
then<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.230> land<00:05:17.470> that<00:05:17.680> guy<00:05:17.860> so<00:05:18.340> when<00:05:18.430> block

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
then you land that guy so when block

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.200 
then you land that guy so when block
updates<00:05:20.280> it'll<00:05:21.280> go<00:05:21.460> up<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:21.730> down<00:05:21.820> this<00:05:22.000> and

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
updates it'll go up and down this and

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.490 
updates it'll go up and down this and
the<00:05:22.270> pulses<00:05:22.570> like<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.900> if<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.290> know<00:05:23.380> what<00:05:23.470> I

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
the pulses like that if you know what I

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.430 
the pulses like that if you know what I
mean<00:05:23.530> ketchum<00:05:24.190> adrift<00:05:24.370> you<00:05:24.550> know<00:05:25.320> all<00:05:26.320> right

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
mean ketchum adrift you know all right

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.440 
mean ketchum adrift you know all right
so<00:05:26.680> what<00:05:27.190> we're<00:05:27.400> going<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:27.580> use<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.760> pulse<00:05:28.180> to

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
so what we're going to use that pulse to

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.630 
so what we're going to use that pulse to
cut<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:29.200> red<00:05:29.380> stone<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.220> here's<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.610> thing

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
cut the red stone so here's the thing

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.050 
cut the red stone so here's the thing
that<00:05:30.940> makes<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.210> fully<00:05:31.540> automatic<00:05:32.910> i'm<00:05:33.910> going

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
that makes it fully automatic i'm going

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.340 
that makes it fully automatic i'm going
to<00:05:34.150> put<00:05:34.300> i'm<00:05:34.450> going<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.660> start<00:05:34.840> growing<00:05:35.110> around

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
to put i'm going to start growing around

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.170 
to put i'm going to start growing around
here<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:36.280> i'm<00:05:36.940> going<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.180> put<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.390> piston<00:05:37.840> here

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
here and i'm going to put a piston here

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.110 
here and i'm going to put a piston here
you<00:05:40.180> bastard<00:05:40.720> and<00:05:41.310> then<00:05:42.310> we'll<00:05:42.700> connect<00:05:43.000> this

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
you bastard and then we'll connect this

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.640 
you bastard and then we'll connect this
redstone<00:05:45.690> all<00:05:46.690> all<00:05:47.140> i'm<00:05:47.260> doing<00:05:47.320> is<00:05:47.590> just

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
redstone all all i'm doing is just

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.760 
redstone all all i'm doing is just
bringing<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.100> redstone<00:05:48.430> closer<00:05:48.760> and<00:05:49.770> i'm

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
bringing the redstone closer and i'm

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.159 
bringing the redstone closer and i'm
going<00:05:50.890> to<00:05:50.980> put<00:05:51.160> a<00:05:51.310> repeater<00:05:51.850> here<00:05:51.970> because<00:05:52.840> it

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
going to put a repeater here because it

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.380 
going to put a repeater here because it
won't<00:05:53.800> reach<00:05:54.220> that<00:05:54.490> far<00:05:54.760> i'm<00:05:54.970> pretty<00:05:55.210> sure<00:05:55.330> if

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
won't reach that far i'm pretty sure if

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.300 
won't reach that far i'm pretty sure if
it<00:05:55.450> exceeds<00:05:55.810> the<00:05:56.110> limit<00:05:56.440> but<00:05:56.830> this<00:05:56.980> one<00:05:57.130> what

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
it exceeds the limit but this one what

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.240 
it exceeds the limit but this one what
we<00:05:57.430> find<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:59.470> way<00:05:59.590> you<00:05:59.650> want<00:05:59.919> to<00:06:00.010> connect

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
we find and the way you want to connect

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.010 
we find and the way you want to connect
those<00:06:00.370> but<00:06:00.610> first<00:06:00.940> what<00:06:01.300> we<00:06:01.419> want<00:06:01.600> to<00:06:01.690> do<00:06:01.840> is

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
those but first what we want to do is

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.710 
those but first what we want to do is
you<00:06:02.050> want<00:06:02.169> to<00:06:02.410> put<00:06:02.560> a<00:06:02.830> are

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
you want to put a are

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.430 
you want to put a are
they're<00:06:05.080> called<00:06:05.290> but<00:06:05.440> they<00:06:05.500> change<00:06:06.390> when<00:06:07.440> when

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
they're called but they change when when

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.720 
they're called but they change when when
this<00:06:08.650> gets<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:08.950> pulse<00:06:09.220> that<00:06:09.340> will<00:06:09.460> turn<00:06:09.580> off

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
this gets the pulse that will turn off

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.280 
this gets the pulse that will turn off
this<00:06:09.880> will<00:06:10.030> turn<00:06:10.180> on<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.510> start<00:06:10.750> it<00:06:10.840> up<00:06:10.930> just

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
this will turn on and start it up just

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
right here because then the block won't

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.920 
right here because then the block won't
update<00:06:59.890> like<00:07:00.100> that<00:07:00.340> and<00:07:00.550> you<00:07:01.419> just<00:07:01.570> connect

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
update like that and you just connect

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.640 
update like that and you just connect
them<00:07:02.160> so<00:07:03.510> you<00:07:04.510> might<00:07:04.660> want<00:07:04.900> to<00:07:04.960> hook<00:07:05.320> this<00:07:05.470> up
