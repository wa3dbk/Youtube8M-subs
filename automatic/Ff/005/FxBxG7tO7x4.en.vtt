believe they're getting back several

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.540 
believe they're getting back several
guys<00:00:59.150> on<00:00:59.420> defense<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.800> this<00:01:01.040> is<00:01:01.190> going<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.460> make

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
guys on defense so this is going to make

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.250 
guys on defense so this is going to make
them<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:02.089> bolster<00:01:02.480> them<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.809> plus<00:01:03.019> that

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
them and bolster them and plus that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.399 
them and bolster them and plus that
besides<00:01:03.620> that<00:01:03.739> they're<00:01:04.070> coming<00:01:04.309> off<00:01:04.550> of<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:05.030> bye

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
besides that they're coming off of a bye

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.899 
besides that they're coming off of a bye
so<00:01:06.409> tough<00:01:07.280> luck<00:01:07.520> for<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.880> Dolphins<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.450> that

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
so tough luck for the Dolphins on that

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.670 
so tough luck for the Dolphins on that
I'm<00:01:10.909> looking<00:01:11.240> for<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.900> Dolphins<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.470> have

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
I'm looking for the Dolphins to have

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.280 
I'm looking for the Dolphins to have
though<00:01:13.400> a<00:01:13.430> really<00:01:14.180> super<00:01:14.600> good<00:01:14.810> game<00:01:15.020> again<00:01:15.260> I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
though a really super good game again I

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.020 
though a really super good game again I
think<00:01:15.560> they've<00:01:15.710> got<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.010> forward<00:01:16.430> momentum<00:01:16.610> I

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
think they've got the forward momentum I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.380 
think they've got the forward momentum I
really<00:01:17.990> believe<00:01:18.229> in<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.409> team<00:01:18.530> now<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.390> if

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
really believe in this team now and if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.820 
really believe in this team now and if
they<00:01:20.570> don't<00:01:20.720> win<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:21.200> think<00:01:21.530> they're<00:01:21.650> going<00:01:21.740> to

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
they don't win I think they're going to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.860 
they don't win I think they're going to
make<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.159> very<00:01:22.520> close<00:01:22.880> game<00:01:22.909> it's<00:01:23.659> going<00:01:23.810> to

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
make it a very close game it's going to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.730 
make it a very close game it's going to
be<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.190> heartbreaking<00:01:25.190> loss<00:01:25.220> if<00:01:25.729> they<00:01:25.880> do<00:01:25.940> lose

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
be a heartbreaking loss if they do lose

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.520 
be a heartbreaking loss if they do lose
I<00:01:27.820> just<00:01:28.820> though<00:01:29.150> think<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.110> Dolphins

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
I just though think that the Dolphins

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.710 
I just though think that the Dolphins
they<00:01:30.650> have<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.100> momentum<00:01:31.400> now<00:01:31.730> so<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:32.630> think

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
they have the momentum now so I think

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.610 
they have the momentum now so I think
they're<00:01:32.960> gonna<00:01:33.080> do<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:34.390> injury-wise

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
they're gonna do this injury-wise

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.740 
they're gonna do this injury-wise
dolphins<00:01:36.620> are<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:36.890> great<00:01:37.280> shape<00:01:37.750> nobody's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
dolphins are in great shape nobody's

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.530 
dolphins are in great shape nobody's
really<00:01:39.370> you<00:01:40.370> know<00:01:40.460> Knowshon<00:01:40.880> Moreno<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:41.420> he's

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
really you know Knowshon Moreno but he's

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.200 
really you know Knowshon Moreno but he's
out<00:01:41.690> for<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:41.930> year<00:01:42.110> we<00:01:42.260> know<00:01:42.440> that<00:01:42.730> I<00:01:43.730> think

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
out for the year we know that I think

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.030 
out for the year we know that I think
they're<00:01:44.420> okay<00:01:46.150> there<00:01:47.150> have<00:01:47.300> been<00:01:47.330> no<00:01:48.040> injuries

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
they're okay there have been no injuries

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.630 
they're okay there have been no injuries
during<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.400> practice<00:01:49.580> week<00:01:50.120> so<00:01:50.930> far<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.640> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
during the practice week so far and I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.060 
during the practice week so far and I
think<00:01:53.000> they're<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.300> be<00:01:53.420> ready<00:01:54.070> they're

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
think they're going to be ready they're

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.530 
think they're going to be ready they're
going<00:01:55.340> there<00:01:55.490> with<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.670> purpose<00:01:56.890> if<00:01:57.890> they<00:01:58.130> win

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
going there with a purpose if they win

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.500 
going there with a purpose if they win
they're<00:01:59.540> going<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.160> remain<00:02:01.160> just<00:02:02.030> two<00:02:02.270> games

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
they're going to remain just two games

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.580 
they're going to remain just two games
back<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.350> New<00:02:03.770> England<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:06.170> never<00:02:06.380> know

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
back of New England and you never know

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.759 
back of New England and you never know
they<00:02:07.010> have<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.250> game<00:02:07.490> with<00:02:07.730> New<00:02:07.910> England<00:02:08.330> and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
they have a game with New England and

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.949 
they have a game with New England and
New<00:02:09.769> England<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.369> could<00:02:11.300> still<00:02:11.569> stumble

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
New England is could still stumble

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.140 
New England is could still stumble
somewhere<00:02:12.379> along<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.709> way<00:02:12.739> if<00:02:13.280> they<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.910> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
somewhere along the way if they have a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.559 
somewhere along the way if they have a
two-game<00:02:14.750> sweep<00:02:15.069> over<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.099> New<00:02:16.340> England<00:02:16.569> over

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
two-game sweep over the New England over

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.020 
two-game sweep over the New England over
the<00:02:17.660> Patriots<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.519> they<00:02:19.519> have<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.790> same

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the Patriots and they have the same

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.420 
the Patriots and they have the same
record<00:02:20.629> well<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.709> dolphins<00:02:22.099> win<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
record well the dolphins win the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.530 
record well the dolphins win the
division<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:23.569> that's<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.959> key<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.760> see<00:02:26.300> good

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
division so that's the key so I see good

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.339 
division so that's the key so I see good
things<00:02:26.569> for<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.080> dolphins<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:28.190> predict<00:02:28.909> a

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
things for the dolphins and I predict a

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.040 
things for the dolphins and I predict a
big-time<00:02:30.349> win<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.730> going<00:02:31.909> to<00:02:31.970> be<00:02:32.060> one<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
big-time win this is going to be one the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.320 
big-time win this is going to be one the
Dolphins<00:02:33.920> are<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.310> say<00:02:34.490> that<00:02:35.000> was<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
Dolphins are going to say that was the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.130
