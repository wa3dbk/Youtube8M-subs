declared their roles in the professional
development<00:01:56.969> program<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.020> become

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
development program and it become

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.749 
development program and it become
flattened<00:01:58.740> designated<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.430> their<00:01:59.579> roles

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
flattened designated in their roles

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.860 
flattened designated in their roles
already

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
already

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.410 
already
yeah<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:02.010> overall<00:02:02.460> how<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.030> transition

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
yeah so overall how is the transition

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.720 
yeah so overall how is the transition
been<00:02:03.690> accepted<00:02:04.080> by<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.260> industry<00:02:04.500> well<00:02:05.100> again

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
been accepted by the industry well again

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.460 
been accepted by the industry well again
the<00:02:05.940> transition<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.020> important

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
the transition and a really important

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.469 
the transition and a really important
lesson<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.800> us<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.130> learn<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
lesson for us to learn was is that you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.820 
lesson for us to learn was is that you
know<00:02:09.600> if<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:09.900> developed<00:02:10.350> by<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.500> industry

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
know if it's developed by the industry

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.860 
know if it's developed by the industry
and<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.220> transition<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:12.030> part<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and the transition was part of the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.570 
and the transition was part of the
development<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.500> whole<00:02:13.710> process<00:02:13.950> was

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
development of this whole process was

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.010 
development of this whole process was
developed<00:02:14.760> by<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.180> industry<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:15.870> been

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
developed by the industry so it's been

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.950 
developed by the industry so it's been
very<00:02:16.140> natural<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:16.890> far<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.280> good<00:02:17.310> okay<00:02:17.960> and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
very natural so far so good okay and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.600 
very natural so far so good okay and
does<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.560> does<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.920> industry<00:02:20.220> feel<00:02:20.400> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
does the does the industry feel that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.100 
does the does the industry feel that
this<00:02:20.700> has<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.570> improved<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
this has really improved the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.210 
this has really improved the
effectiveness<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.860> training<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
effectiveness of the training that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
effectiveness of the training that
they're<00:02:23.430> receiving<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.720> industry<00:02:25.320> told

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
they're receiving the the industry told

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.590 
they're receiving the the industry told
us<00:02:25.890> from<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> very<00:02:26.430> beginning<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.450> was

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
us from the very beginning that what was

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.360 
us from the very beginning that what was
really<00:02:27.750> important<00:02:28.350> was<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
really important was is you know the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.490 
really important was is you know the
training<00:02:29.730> classes<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.240> one<00:02:30.480> element<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
training classes is one element the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.680 
training classes is one element the
second<00:02:31.890> element<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> organization<00:02:33.480> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
second element is is the organization of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.150 
second element is is the organization of
the<00:02:33.930> training<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.470> such<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> way<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:34.890> it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the training in such a way that it

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.250 
the training in such a way that it
actually<00:02:35.360> connects<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.630> dots<00:02:36.840> between

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
actually connects the dots between

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.650 
actually connects the dots between
sending<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.400> employees<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.970> training<00:02:39.510> and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
sending your employees to training and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.020 
sending your employees to training and
having<00:02:40.350> got<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.770> safer<00:02:41.280> more<00:02:41.430> complete<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
having got a safer more complete and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.330 
having got a safer more complete and
safe<00:02:42.300> repair<00:02:42.750> having<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.860> improved

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
safe repair having on improved

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.950 
safe repair having on improved
operational<00:02:44.820> efficiencies<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.810> that's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
operational efficiencies and that's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.690 
operational efficiencies and that's
really<00:02:46.110> what<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.500> program<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.400> about

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
really what the program is really about

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.160 
really what the program is really about
them<00:02:47.940> well<00:02:48.480> thank<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:48.840> much<00:02:48.990> for<00:02:49.110> your
