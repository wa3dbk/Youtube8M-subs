and today I'm bringing to you one of the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.820 
and today I'm bringing to you one of the
new<00:00:05.940> maps<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.720> just<00:00:06.930> released<00:00:07.080> with<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
new maps that was just released with the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.030 
new maps that was just released with the
resurgent<00:00:08.540> resurgence<00:00:09.540> map<00:00:09.929> pack<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.620> modern

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
resurgent resurgence map pack for modern

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.169 
resurgent resurgence map pack for modern
warfare<00:00:11.340> 2<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.750> kind<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.110> all<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:15.150> I

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
warfare 2 and that is kind of all so I

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.660 
warfare 2 and that is kind of all so I
think<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.690> like<00:00:15.870> my<00:00:16.250> third<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:17.430> fourth

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
think this is like my third or fourth

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.240 
think this is like my third or fourth
time<00:00:17.760> playing<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.480> map<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.770> him<00:00:19.890> right<00:00:20.100> when

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
time playing this map got him right when

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.560 
time playing this map got him right when
they<00:00:20.340> came<00:00:20.490> out<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:20.939> once<00:00:21.359> they<00:00:21.510> were

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
they came out or once they were

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
they came out or once they were
available<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.289> i<00:00:23.039> ended<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.580> getting<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> nuke

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
available and i ended up getting a nuke

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.550 
available and i ended up getting a nuke
so<00:00:24.930> that's<00:00:25.080> pretty<00:00:25.260> cool<00:00:26.390> using<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.560> ak-47

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so that's pretty cool using the ak-47

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.020 
so that's pretty cool using the ak-47

like i said before i really like the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.740 
like i said before i really like the
ak-47<00:00:40.620> i've<00:00:40.860> been<00:00:41.070> using<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.489> quite<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
ak-47 i've been using it quite a lot and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
ak-47 i've been using it quite a lot and
it's<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> only<00:00:43.950> thing<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.460> really

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it's the only thing that's really

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.810 
it's the only thing that's really
preventing<00:00:45.690> me<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.340> prestiging<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> with

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
preventing me from prestiging so with

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.020 
preventing me from prestiging so with
this<00:00:50.969> game<00:00:51.270> i<00:00:51.539> didn't<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:52.110> into<00:00:52.140> here

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
this game i didn't really go into here

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.400 
this game i didn't really go into here
planning<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.120> getting<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.570> nuke<00:00:54.719> i<00:00:54.989> happen<00:00:55.199> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
planning on getting a nuke i happen to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.569 
planning on getting a nuke i happen to
just<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.770> my<00:00:56.370> new<00:00:56.550> killer<00:00:56.879> gun<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:59.070> i<00:00:59.160> was

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
just have my new killer gun and i was

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.080 
just have my new killer gun and i was
playing<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.820> further

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
playing but as it kind of got further

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
playing but as it kind of got further
into<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> match<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.930> started<00:01:04.559> thinking<00:01:04.860> more

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
into the match it started thinking more

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.200 
into the match it started thinking more
about<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> might<00:01:05.760> happen<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
about it like it might happen and so the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.410 
about it like it might happen and so the
gameplay<00:01:10.369> turns<00:01:11.369> out<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.970> that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
gameplay turns out not to be that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870 
gameplay turns out not to be that
exciting<00:01:13.170> opening<00:01:13.979> round<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.549> play

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
exciting opening round I just play

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.609

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
pretty defensive protecting our plants

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
I did I didn't really do much research

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.410 
I did I didn't really do much research
on<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:40.250> because<00:01:40.369> I<00:01:40.970> haven't<00:01:41.240> been

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
on it just because I haven't been

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.960 
on it just because I haven't been
playing<00:01:42.039> modern<00:01:43.039> warfare<00:01:43.070> 2<00:01:43.580> that<00:01:43.759> much

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
playing modern warfare 2 that much

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.179 
playing modern warfare 2 that much
recently<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:44.840> since<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.320> reach<00:01:45.619> beta<00:01:45.649> and

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
recently like since the reach beta and

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.310 
recently like since the reach beta and
then<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.429> just<00:01:46.610> never<00:01:46.729> really<00:01:47.090> fully<00:01:47.810> got<00:01:48.110> back

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
then I just never really fully got back

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.620 
then I just never really fully got back
into<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.729> knew<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.119> map<00:01:50.270> pack<00:01:50.479> was

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
into it so I knew the map pack was

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.560 
into it so I knew the map pack was
coming<00:01:50.929> out<00:01:51.049> but<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:52.369> wasn't<00:01:53.270> aware<00:01:53.420> of

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
coming out but I just I wasn't aware of

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.850 
coming out but I just I wasn't aware of
all<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.840> map<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.229> didn't<00:01:54.409> even<00:01:54.470> know<00:01:54.679> they

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
all the map so I didn't even know they

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.389 
all the map so I didn't even know they
were<00:01:54.890> bringing<00:01:55.220> back<00:01:55.479> vacant<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.659> strike<00:01:57.399> two

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
were bringing back vacant and strike two

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.130 
were bringing back vacant and strike two
really<00:01:58.700> good<00:01:58.819> maps<00:01:59.119> would<00:01:59.569> have<00:01:59.690> been<00:01:59.780> cool<00:01:59.990> to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
really good maps would have been cool to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.020 
really good maps would have been cool to
see<00:02:00.380> bog<00:02:02.500> but<00:02:03.500> now<00:02:03.649> getting<00:02:04.490> sort<00:02:04.729> of<00:02:04.759> three

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
see bog but now getting sort of three

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.999 
see bog but now getting sort of three
new<00:02:05.209> maps<00:02:05.390> because<00:02:05.899> everybody<00:02:06.619> obviously

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
new maps because everybody obviously

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.620 
new maps because everybody obviously
knows<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.810> strike<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:08.989> vacant<00:02:09.049> from<00:02:09.709> cod4

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
knows a strike and vacant from cod4

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.000 
knows a strike and vacant from cod4
three<00:02:11.630> new<00:02:11.840> maps<00:02:12.019> I<00:02:12.260> think<00:02:12.470> all<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.650> them<00:02:12.799> are

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
three new maps I think all of them are

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.809 
three new maps I think all of them are
pretty<00:02:13.310> good<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.910> think<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.470> far<00:02:15.640> I'm<00:02:16.640> enjoying

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
pretty good I think so far I'm enjoying

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.650 
pretty good I think so far I'm enjoying
them<00:02:17.299> more<00:02:17.540> than<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.500> first<00:02:18.739> three<00:02:19.069> new<00:02:19.310> maps

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
them more than the first three new maps

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.190 
them more than the first three new maps
from<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.750> stimulus<00:02:21.290> package<00:02:21.709> map<00:02:22.430> pack<00:02:23.200> I

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
from the stimulus package map pack I

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.180 
from the stimulus package map pack I
think<00:02:24.620> carnival<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.930> heard<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.019> lot<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.230> saw

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
think carnival it's I heard a lot of saw

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.890 
think carnival it's I heard a lot of saw
a<00:02:28.220> lot<00:02:28.459> of<00:02:28.489> people<00:02:28.819> complaining<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.269> forms<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
a lot of people complaining on forms and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.560 
a lot of people complaining on forms and
other<00:02:30.080> YouTube<00:02:30.859> channels<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.400> stuff<00:02:31.670> about

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
other YouTube channels and stuff about

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.400 
other YouTube channels and stuff about
just<00:02:33.260> how<00:02:33.430> random<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.690> many<00:02:35.780> spots<00:02:36.170> to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
just how random and so many spots to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.440 
just how random and so many spots to
hide<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.980> or<00:02:37.160> whatever<00:02:37.310> but<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.970> don't<00:02:38.150> think

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
hide in or whatever but I don't think

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.160 
hide in or whatever but I don't think
it's<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.959> think<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.380> works<00:02:39.799> works<00:02:40.220> out<00:02:40.400> fine

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
it's I think it works works out fine

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.440 
it's I think it works works out fine
it's<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.350> medium<00:02:42.709> sized<00:02:42.980> level<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.239> then

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it's the medium sized level and then

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.599 
it's the medium sized level and then
there's<00:02:44.630> also<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.930> trailer<00:02:45.230> park<00:02:45.319> which<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
there's also a trailer park which is the

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.789 
there's also a trailer park which is the
small<00:02:47.120> size<00:02:47.390> level<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.049> really<00:02:48.680> like<00:02:48.829> that<00:02:48.890> map

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
small size level I really like that map

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.699 
small size level I really like that map
you<00:02:51.799> know<00:02:51.920> it's<00:02:52.130> not<00:02:52.880> too<00:02:53.150> big<00:02:53.359> or<00:02:54.109> rather<00:02:54.470> not

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
you know it's not too big or rather not

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.400 
you know it's not too big or rather not
too<00:02:54.920> small<00:02:55.220> but<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:56.269> too<00:02:56.420> big<00:02:56.660> forces<00:02:57.530> combat

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
too small but not too big forces combat

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.910 
too small but not too big forces combat
well<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:59.670> haven't<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:00.480> private<00:03:00.900> map<00:03:01.230> no

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
well I haven't that's private map no

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.620 
well I haven't that's private map no
actually<00:03:02.280> I've<00:03:02.370> played<00:03:02.610> fuel<00:03:02.970> probably<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
actually I've played fuel probably the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.470 
actually I've played fuel probably the
least<00:03:03.890> trailer<00:03:04.890> park<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.700> second<00:03:06.360> at

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
least trailer park is the second at

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.390 
least trailer park is the second at
least<00:03:06.660> map<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.470> played

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
least map I played

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.160 
least map I played
and<00:03:09.519> I've<00:03:09.939> only<00:03:10.120> played<00:03:10.299> fuel<00:03:10.629> like<00:03:10.930> three

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and I've only played fuel like three

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.800 
and I've only played fuel like three
times<00:03:11.379> i<00:03:11.769> think<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:13.000> i'm<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.360> liking<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
times i think but i'm really liking that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.009 
times i think but i'm really liking that
map<00:03:14.019> too<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:15.370> only<00:03:15.700> discovered<00:03:16.569> like<00:03:16.750> that

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
map too I just only discovered like that

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.490 
map too I just only discovered like that
large<00:03:17.439> field<00:03:17.890> area<00:03:18.360> last<00:03:19.360> time<00:03:19.599> playing<00:03:20.319> that

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
large field area last time playing that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.039 
large field area last time playing that
map<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.640> seems<00:03:21.970> like<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.510> biggest

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
map so that seems like it's the biggest

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.080 
map so that seems like it's the biggest
map<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:24.010> package<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:27.659> excuse<00:03:28.659> me<00:03:28.810> I

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
map in this package and excuse me I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.520 
map in this package and excuse me I
think<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.239> one's<00:03:31.420> pretty<00:03:31.629> good<00:03:31.840> as<00:03:31.959> well<00:03:31.989> so

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
think that one's pretty good as well so

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.460 
think that one's pretty good as well so
overall<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.040> think<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:34.269> whole<00:03:34.390> map<00:03:34.659> pack<00:03:34.900> was

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
overall I think the whole map pack was

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.190 
overall I think the whole map pack was
definitely<00:03:35.890> worth<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.430> time<00:03:36.989> still<00:03:37.989> with

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
definitely worth it this time still with

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.059 
definitely worth it this time still with
just<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.650> two<00:03:39.359> maps<00:03:40.359> to<00:03:41.230> old<00:03:41.440> maps<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.920> we

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
just the two maps to old maps that we

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.640 
just the two maps to old maps that we
got<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.329> mean<00:03:43.599> it's<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.840> same<00:03:44.049> as<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.530> last

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
got but I mean it's the same as the last

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.890 
got but I mean it's the same as the last
one<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:45.099> just<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:45.940> overall<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.450> quality<00:03:46.870> and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
one I just think overall the quality and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.509 
one I just think overall the quality and
that<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.590> better<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.530> yeah<00:03:50.680> we<00:03:51.010> just<00:03:51.190> ended

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
that so I better so yeah we just ended

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.089 
that so I better so yeah we just ended
up<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.670> round<00:03:52.150> right<00:03:52.510> there<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:53.769> this<00:03:53.829> is

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
up that round right there now this is

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.629 
up that round right there now this is
where<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.670> start<00:03:55.150> thinking<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:57.010> getting<00:03:57.370> the

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
where I start thinking about getting the

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.960 
where I start thinking about getting the
new<00:03:57.819> just<00:03:58.450> because<00:03:58.629> I<00:03:58.689> got<00:03:58.780> harriers<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.650> I

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
new just because I got harriers and I

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.920 
new just because I got harriers and I
haven't<00:04:00.970> really<00:04:01.060> been<00:04:01.269> touched<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.689> much

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
haven't really been touched that much

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.660 
haven't really been touched that much
haven't<00:04:02.650> really<00:04:02.920> been<00:04:03.010> going<00:04:03.189> into<00:04:03.430> combat

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
haven't really been going into combat

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.280 
haven't really been going into combat
either<00:04:06.120> but<00:04:07.120> at<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.269> same<00:04:07.450> time<00:04:07.599> I<00:04:07.659> figure<00:04:08.049> I

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
either but at the same time I figure I

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.599 
either but at the same time I figure I
might<00:04:08.829> as<00:04:08.920> well<00:04:09.069> try<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.459> here<00:04:11.129> so<00:04:12.129> my<00:04:12.250> harriers

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
might as well try it here so my harriers

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.110 
might as well try it here so my harriers
will<00:04:12.939> do<00:04:13.449> the<00:04:13.599> work<00:04:13.750> for<00:04:13.780> me<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.440> get<00:04:15.120> chopper

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
will do the work for me to get chopper

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.050 
will do the work for me to get chopper
gunner<00:04:16.949> and<00:04:17.949> then<00:04:18.459> once<00:04:18.609> i<00:04:18.699> get<00:04:18.820> chopper

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
gunner and then once i get chopper

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.250 
gunner and then once i get chopper
gunner<00:04:19.329> it's<00:04:20.199> pretty<00:04:20.560> good<00:04:20.829> on<00:04:20.949> this<00:04:21.099> map

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
gunner it's pretty good on this map

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.960 
gunner it's pretty good on this map
there's<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.620> few<00:04:23.860> places<00:04:24.010> they<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.610> hide<00:04:24.790> and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
there's a few places they can hide and

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.630 
there's a few places they can hide and
stuff<00:04:25.210> but<00:04:25.540> besides<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.350> you<00:04:27.280> could<00:04:27.460> pretty

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
stuff but besides that you could pretty

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.200 
stuff but besides that you could pretty
much<00:04:27.760> get<00:04:28.180> them<00:04:28.360> wherever<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.830> because<00:04:30.210> it's

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
much get them wherever just because it's

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
me and get a little paranoid because I

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.410 
me and get a little paranoid because I
don't<00:04:48.160> want<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.400> have<00:04:48.520> my<00:04:48.670> chopper<00:04:48.940> gunner<00:04:49.240> and

don't want to have my chopper gunner and
then<00:04:49.570> died<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.460> i'm<00:04:51.520> debating<00:04:51.700> whether<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.320> run

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
then died so i'm debating whether to run

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.410 
then died so i'm debating whether to run
out<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.530> here<00:04:53.710> towards<00:04:54.010> my<00:04:54.130> teammates<00:04:54.550> or<00:04:54.880> just

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
out of here towards my teammates or just

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.890 
out of here towards my teammates or just
try<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.660> fight<00:04:55.900> them<00:04:55.990> off

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.710 

this<00:04:59.470> seemed<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.650> be<00:05:00.070> black<00:05:00.970> coming<00:05:01.360> towards

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
last thing is it almost gets me killed

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.279 
last thing is it almost gets me killed
because<00:05:14.270> I<00:05:14.360> have<00:05:14.509> to<00:05:14.599> stay<00:05:14.810> up<00:05:14.840> there<00:05:15.020> in<00:05:15.199> a

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
because I have to stay up there in a

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.800 
because I have to stay up there in a
second<00:05:15.789> and<00:05:16.789> I<00:05:17.120> don't<00:05:17.180> know<00:05:17.389> where<00:05:17.539> that<00:05:17.569> guy

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
second and I don't know where that guy

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.330 
second and I don't know where that guy
really<00:05:17.990> shot<00:05:18.319> me<00:05:18.469> from<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:18.860> think<00:05:19.009> it<00:05:19.099> was<00:05:19.219> from

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
really shot me from I think it was from

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.999 
really shot me from I think it was from
the<00:05:19.520> top<00:05:19.699> castle<00:05:20.210> but<00:05:20.479> I<00:05:20.740> popped<00:05:21.740> chopper

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
the top castle but I popped chopper

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.920 
the top castle but I popped chopper
gunner<00:05:22.189> because<00:05:22.370> I<00:05:22.400> figure<00:05:22.759> that's<00:05:23.509> the<00:05:23.689> best

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
gunner because I figure that's the best

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.519 
gunner because I figure that's the best
place<00:05:24.110> i'll<00:05:24.349> get

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.369 

and<00:05:29.069> so<00:05:29.279> not<00:05:30.089> really<00:05:30.269> too<00:05:30.599> sure<00:05:30.629> this<00:05:31.169> is<00:05:31.259> my

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
and so not really too sure this is my

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.309 
and so not really too sure this is my
first<00:05:31.619> job<00:05:31.799> we've<00:05:31.949> got<00:05:32.069> around<00:05:32.249> the<00:05:32.339> map<00:05:33.319> not

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
first job we've got around the map not

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.199 
first job we've got around the map not
too<00:05:34.499> sure<00:05:34.619> who<00:05:34.769> were<00:05:34.889> to<00:05:35.009> fire<00:05:35.219> and<00:05:35.789> where

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:36.209 
too sure who were to fire and where

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:40.239 
too sure who were to fire and where
they're<00:05:36.299> going<00:05:36.419> to<00:05:36.479> be<00:05:36.569> spawning

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:40.249 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.080 

it<00:05:40.789> ends<00:05:41.299> up<00:05:42.549> getting<00:05:43.549> a<00:05:43.729> job<00:05:43.969> done

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
right as i get out of chopper and so I'm

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.900 
right as i get out of chopper and so I'm
kind<00:06:28.520> of<00:06:28.580> debating<00:06:28.910> Oh<00:06:29.360> shudders<00:06:30.020> call<00:06:30.229> it<00:06:30.349> in

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.820
