exactly the exact setup that I'll be

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.520 
exactly the exact setup that I'll be
using<00:02:07.560> today<00:02:08.509> like<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> say<00:02:09.869> today<00:02:10.080> we're<00:02:10.410> going

to<00:02:10.590> pacifically<00:02:11.340> look<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.940> tone<00:02:12.330> down

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
to pacifically look at this tone down

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.710 
to pacifically look at this tone down
palek<00:02:13.349> Wagler<00:02:13.680> setup<00:02:14.159> if<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.060> was<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> match<00:02:15.510> I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
palek Wagler setup if this was a match I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.570 
palek Wagler setup if this was a match I
would<00:02:15.900> still<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.260> my<00:02:16.379> normal<00:02:16.530> Magnus<00:02:17.099> setup

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
would still have my normal Magnus setup

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.119 
would still have my normal Magnus setup
but<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.540> definitely<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.110> method<00:02:19.500> later<00:02:19.799> on

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
but this is definitely a method later on

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.399 
but this is definitely a method later on
in<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> day<00:02:20.610> or<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.629> day<00:02:21.780> starts<00:02:22.230> off<00:02:22.379> very

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
in the day or if the day starts off very

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.759 
in the day or if the day starts off very
difficult<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.400> will<00:02:23.489> get<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> few<00:02:24.120> bites

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
difficult it will get you a few bites

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
can change the depth quite easily as you

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.699 
can change the depth quite easily as you
can<00:03:41.579> see<00:03:41.819> there<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.569> not<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> messy<00:03:43.109> fan<00:03:43.530> of

can see there I'm not a messy fan of

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.319 
can see there I'm not a messy fan of
changing<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.280> depth<00:03:44.519> as<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.849> probably<00:03:45.090> know

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
changing the depth as you probably know

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.210 
changing the depth as you probably know
from<00:03:45.599> when<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:45.840> fished<00:03:46.079> up<00:03:46.260> Eric<00:03:46.560> Wagner<00:03:46.919> but

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
from when we fished up Eric Wagner but

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.680 
from when we fished up Eric Wagner but
that's<00:03:47.430> when<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.730> fish<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.090> really<00:03:48.120> have<00:03:48.569> in

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690

that's when the fish you really have in
it<00:03:48.840> like<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.500> say<00:03:49.889> this<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.639> specialist<00:03:51.530> twist

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
it like I say this is a specialist twist

caught and call and call are just being

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.180 
caught and call and call are just being
finicky<00:04:02.930> now<00:04:03.930> when<00:04:04.109> when<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.379> go<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.739> this<00:04:04.949> rod

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
finicky now when when I go on this rod

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.439 
finicky now when when I go on this rod
it's<00:04:05.549> quite<00:04:05.790> simple
