00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:19.380
 Say that Fuji Fool thing xq 1 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.810
 this 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.810
 The camera is 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.810

 By say compact digital camera 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.600
 Fujifilm's a so far 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.420
 I have never had a camera 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.420
 I was interested a little and purchased it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.150
 This camera is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.750
 The size of the sensor is 3 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.540
 In size 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 12 million pixels 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.380
 It is said that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.549

 Of the party 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.840

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.440
 Camera is low pass 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.900
 To say that structure 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.590
 Comparable to large sensors 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.270
 It can be expressed resolution 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.420
 Tower of 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.430
