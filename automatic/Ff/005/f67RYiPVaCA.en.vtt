openings so I've got genesect and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.439 
openings so I've got genesect and
volcarona<00:00:16.590> think<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:17.640> gonna<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
volcarona think I'm gonna go with the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.390 
volcarona think I'm gonna go with the
genocide<00:00:19.109> first<00:00:19.470> because<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:20.070> volcarona

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
genocide first because I think volcarona

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.599 
genocide first because I think volcarona
is<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> lot<00:00:21.029> better<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.380> I'll<00:00:23.039> kind<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.340> go<00:00:23.430> over

they<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.740> particular<00:00:32.130> theme

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
they really just this particular theme

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
they really just this particular theme
that<00:00:32.669> has<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.059> improved<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.290> has

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that has not improved the other one has

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.910 
that has not improved the other one has
some<00:00:34.739> much<00:00:34.890> better<00:00:35.100> cards<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:36.410> but<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
some much better cards in it but the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.860 
some much better cards in it but the
genesect<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.610> itself<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.329> pretty<00:00:39.570> interesting

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
genesect in itself is pretty interesting

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.430 
genesect in itself is pretty interesting
i<00:00:40.170> believe<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.930> trying<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> remember<00:00:43.110> i<00:00:43.260> had

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
i believe it's trying to remember i had

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.410 
i believe it's trying to remember i had
plenty<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> pre-release<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.210> it's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
plenty at the pre-release but it's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.529 
plenty at the pre-release but it's
there's<00:00:46.230> something<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:46.710> about<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.539> Tropius

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
there's something good about it Tropius

and<00:00:50.940> I'm<00:00:51.090> trying<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.110> Jenna

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and I'm trying to think of what Jenna

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.319 
and I'm trying to think of what Jenna
sip<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> uh<00:00:53.090> energy<00:00:54.090> acceleration<00:00:54.750> possibly

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
sip is uh energy acceleration possibly

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
sip is uh energy acceleration possibly
alright<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.160> in<00:00:59.160> case<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.370> didn't<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
rare so there seems like they're putting

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.060 
rare so there seems like they're putting
more<00:04:48.370> rares<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.850> here<00:04:49.200> also<00:04:50.200> there<00:04:50.920> we<00:04:50.980> go

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
more rares in here also there we go

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.230 
more rares in here also there we go

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
there's a non holloware that is

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.970 
there's a non holloware that is
typically<00:04:52.600> a<00:04:52.690> hollow<00:04:53.110> in<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.440> set<00:04:53.740> so

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
typically a hollow in the set so

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.220
