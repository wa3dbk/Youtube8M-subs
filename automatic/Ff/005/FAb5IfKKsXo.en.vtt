now<00:00:37.200> onto<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> fun<00:00:37.890> stuff<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.030> recall<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
now onto the fun stuff if you recall I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
now onto the fun stuff if you recall I
installed<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.079> AM<00:00:40.590> methanol<00:00:41.040> injection

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
installed an AM methanol injection

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.639 
installed an AM methanol injection
system<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> previous<00:00:42.570> episode<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
system in a previous episode with the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.799 
system in a previous episode with the
hopes<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.070> producing<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.760> power<00:00:44.820> reliably<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
hopes of producing more power reliably I

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
hopes of producing more power reliably I
decided<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.050> use<00:00:49.200> winter<00:00:49.739> windshield<00:00:50.190> washer

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
decided to use winter windshield washer

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
decided to use winter windshield washer
fluid<00:00:50.760> instead<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> water<00:00:52.110> methanol<00:00:52.680> mix

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fluid instead of a water methanol mix

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729 
fluid instead of a water methanol mix
and<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.030> curious<00:00:54.270> why<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:55.440> watch

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
and if you're curious why then watch

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
and if you're curious why then watch
this<00:00:56.399> episode<00:00:58.640> my<00:00:59.640> biggest<00:00:59.850> concern<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
this episode my biggest concern with the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.209 
this episode my biggest concern with the
meth<00:01:00.809> injection<00:01:01.350> kit<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
meth injection kit would be that it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
meth injection kit would be that it
would<00:01:02.280> run<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> fluid<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.539> some<00:01:03.780> sort

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
would run out of fluid or have some sort

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.539 
would run out of fluid or have some sort
of<00:01:04.080> failure<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.400> engine<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.119> boom

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
time to engage the meth injection and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.370 
time to engage the meth injection and
see<00:02:10.950> what<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.310> could<00:02:11.430> do

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.660 

it<00:02:18.380> would<00:02:18.590> take<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.800> few<00:02:19.099> poles<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.520> get

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
it would take a few poles to get

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.830 
it would take a few poles to get
everything<00:02:19.940> dialed<00:02:20.330> in

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
everything dialed in

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.900 
everything dialed in
since<00:02:21.050> meth<00:02:21.349> introduces<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.130> cooler<00:02:22.610> intake

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
since meth introduces a cooler intake

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.229 
since meth introduces a cooler intake
charged<00:02:23.270> with<00:02:23.810> more<00:02:24.110> knock<00:02:24.410> resistance<00:02:25.239> that

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
charged with more knock resistance that

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.479 
charged with more knock resistance that
means<00:02:26.510> Sasha<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.470> turn<00:02:27.709> up<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.860> boost<00:02:28.220> and

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
means Sasha can turn up the boost and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.850 
means Sasha can turn up the boost and
add<00:02:28.819> timing<00:02:29.510> while<00:02:29.690> reducing<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.410> fuel<00:02:30.650> level

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
add timing while reducing the fuel level

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.339 
add timing while reducing the fuel level
and<00:02:31.220> what<00:02:31.730> does<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:31.849> all<00:02:31.970> mean<00:02:32.120> more<00:02:32.989> juice

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
and what does that all mean more juice

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:44.240 
and what does that all mean more juice
to<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> wheels

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.730 

so<00:02:45.250> how<00:02:45.430> much<00:02:45.610> did<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:45.970> make<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.930> SR<00:02:47.290> belted

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
so how much did it make the SR belted

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.630 
so how much did it make the SR belted

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
me the lowdown on today's dyno session

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.800 
me the lowdown on today's dyno session
well<00:03:45.310> we<00:03:45.490> we<00:03:45.760> integrated<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.270> meth<00:03:46.420> system

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
well we we integrated the meth system

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.240 
well we we integrated the meth system
into<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.110> ECU<00:03:47.440> yep

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
into the ECU yep

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.680 
into the ECU yep
and<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.640> idea<00:03:48.970> what<00:03:49.090> we<00:03:49.150> were<00:03:49.270> trying<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.540> do

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
and the idea what we were trying to do

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.720 
and the idea what we were trying to do
here<00:03:49.900> was<00:03:50.110> protect<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.040> engine<00:03:51.160> in<00:03:51.400> case<00:03:51.550> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
here was protect the engine in case the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.920 
here was protect the engine in case the
meth<00:03:51.910> system<00:03:52.240> stopped<00:03:52.450> working

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
meth system stopped working

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.300 
meth system stopped working
however<00:03:53.260> there<00:03:53.590> was<00:03:53.710> something<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.160> was<00:03:54.280> a

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
however there was something that I was a

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.740 
however there was something that I was a
little<00:03:54.400> confused<00:03:54.850> about<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.120> terms<00:03:55.240> of<00:03:55.420> wiring

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
little confused about in terms of wiring

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.780 
little confused about in terms of wiring
it<00:03:55.840> up<00:03:55.900> for<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.290> failsafe<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:57.220> use<00:03:57.490> the

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
it up for the failsafe you use the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.330 
it up for the failsafe you use the
solenoid<00:03:58.360> driver<00:03:58.780> wire<00:03:59.170> yeah<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.250> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
solenoid driver wire yeah so the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.790 
solenoid driver wire yeah so the
solenoid<00:04:00.790> driver<00:04:01.060> wire<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:02.020> grounded<00:04:02.590> wire

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
solenoid driver wire is a grounded wire

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.250 
solenoid driver wire is a grounded wire
that<00:04:03.640> will<00:04:03.850> give<00:04:04.060> these<00:04:04.240> you<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.510> ground<00:04:04.810> signal

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
that will give these you a ground signal

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.350 
that will give these you a ground signal
whenever<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.830> meth<00:04:05.980> pump<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.400> running<00:04:06.550> okay

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
whenever the meth pump is running okay

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.390 
whenever the meth pump is running okay
so<00:04:07.420> with<00:04:07.690> this<00:04:07.870> signal<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:09.040> can<00:04:09.070> advance

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
so with this signal we can advance

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.390 
so with this signal we can advance
timing<00:04:09.940> add<00:04:10.360> boost<00:04:10.959> remove<00:04:11.709> fuel<00:04:11.980> everything

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
timing add boost remove fuel everything

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.490 
timing add boost remove fuel everything
we<00:04:12.459> need<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.640> do<00:04:12.730> with<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.940> map<00:04:13.380> whenever<00:04:14.380> the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
we need to do with the map whenever the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.130 
we need to do with the map whenever the
pump<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:14.830> running<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:15.940> we've<00:04:16.090> used<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.480> angle

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
pump is running so we've used that angle

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.620 
pump is running so we've used that angle
and<00:04:17.230> now<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.470> issue<00:04:17.859> runs<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.910> gas<00:04:19.090> map<00:04:19.419> no

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
and now the issue runs on the gas map no

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.699 
and now the issue runs on the gas map no
problem<00:04:20.019> all<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.260> time

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
problem all the time

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.290 
problem all the time
as<00:04:21.040> soon<00:04:21.190> as<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.310> meth<00:04:21.459> pump<00:04:21.700> starts<00:04:21.940> running

as soon as the meth pump starts running

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.760 
as soon as the meth pump starts running
it<00:04:22.660> gives<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.020> engine<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.260> timing<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
it gives the engine the timing and the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.620 
it gives the engine the timing and the
boost<00:04:24.040> and<00:04:24.310> remember<00:04:24.850> chase<00:04:25.000> when<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.390> flick

boost and remember chase when I flick

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.030 
boost and remember chase when I flick
the<00:04:25.750> switch<00:04:25.990> that's<00:04:26.380> when<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.620> changes<00:04:26.919> the

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
the switch that's when it changes the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.980 
the switch that's when it changes the
map<00:04:27.220> when<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:27.910> flick<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.240> switch<00:04:28.450> at<00:04:28.600> arms<00:04:28.900> a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
map when you flick the switch at arms a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.630 
map when you flick the switch at arms a
system<00:04:29.350> yeah<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.980> map<00:04:30.160> doesn't<00:04:30.190> really

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
system yeah the map doesn't really

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.250 
system yeah the map doesn't really
change<00:04:30.700> until<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.300> meth<00:04:31.540> starts<00:04:31.870> flowing<00:04:32.080> I

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
change until the meth starts flowing I

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.870 
change until the meth starts flowing I
see<00:04:32.500> okay<00:04:32.740> soon<00:04:33.040> as<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.190> meth<00:04:33.340> starts<00:04:33.640> flowing

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
see okay soon as the meth starts flowing

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.490 
see okay soon as the meth starts flowing
you<00:04:34.240> get<00:04:34.390> more<00:04:34.570> time<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.930> get<00:04:35.020> more<00:04:35.050> boost<00:04:35.350> you

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
you get more time and get more boost you

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.560 
you get more time and get more boost you
get<00:04:35.560> less<00:04:35.710> fuel<00:04:35.980> exactly<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> very

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
get less fuel exactly so it is a very

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.980 
get less fuel exactly so it is a very
fail-safe<00:04:38.260> method<00:04:38.500> yeah<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:39.880> made<00:04:40.060> 340<00:04:40.720> at

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
fail-safe method yeah so we made 340 at

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.659 
fail-safe method yeah so we made 340 at
the<00:04:41.410> wheel<00:04:41.560> as<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.770> final<00:04:42.160> number<00:04:42.400> which<00:04:42.550> is

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
the wheel as a final number which is

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.310 
the wheel as a final number which is
conservative<00:04:43.090> for<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.510> setup<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:43.900> said<00:04:44.200> it

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
conservative for the setup you said it

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.380 
conservative for the setup you said it
could<00:04:44.470> have<00:04:44.560> made<00:04:44.740> more<00:04:44.979> but<00:04:45.370> we<00:04:46.060> feel<00:04:46.240> the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
could have made more but we feel the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.540 
could have made more but we feel the
engine<00:04:46.690> at<00:04:46.930> this<00:04:47.140> point<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.620> is<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> safe

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
engine at this point is is that a safe

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.670 
engine at this point is is that a safe
power<00:04:49.270> level<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.930> be<00:04:50.050> reliable

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
power level to be reliable

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.890 
power level to be reliable
yeah<00:04:51.070> well<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.430> years<00:04:51.640> I've<00:04:51.820> raced<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.300> sr20

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
yeah well the years I've raced the sr20

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.540 
yeah well the years I've raced the sr20
have<00:04:53.020> found<00:04:53.290> that<00:04:53.440> 330<00:04:53.950> is<00:04:54.100> kind<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.430> magic

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
have found that 330 is kind of the magic

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.570 
have found that 330 is kind of the magic
number<00:04:54.760> for<00:04:55.800> being<00:04:56.800> able<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:56.979> run<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.160> season

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
number for being able to run a season

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.760 
number for being able to run a season
Momo<00:04:58.000> you're<00:04:58.780> only<00:04:58.900> doing<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.169> couple<00:04:59.410> laps<00:04:59.560> of

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
Momo you're only doing a couple laps of

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.830 
Momo you're only doing a couple laps of
time<00:04:59.979> but<00:05:00.250> 340<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.150> kind<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.450> happy<00:05:01.720> number

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
time but 340 is kind of a happy number

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.860 
time but 340 is kind of a happy number
yeah<00:05:02.320> so<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.800> guys<00:05:02.950> that<00:05:03.160> want<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.490> 375<00:05:04.150> we

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
yeah so the guys that want the 375 we

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.570 
yeah so the guys that want the 375 we
could<00:05:05.050> have<00:05:05.140> made<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.320> but<00:05:05.740> it's<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.400> not

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
could have made it but it's just not

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.350 
could have made it but it's just not
worth<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:06.850> chance

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
worth the chance

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.690 
worth the chance
we<00:05:07.419> made<00:05:07.570> 360<00:05:08.080> pretty<00:05:08.290> easily<00:05:08.710> yeah<00:05:08.830> sure<00:05:09.100> 375

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
we made 360 pretty easily yeah sure 375

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.610 
we made 360 pretty easily yeah sure 375
wouldn't<00:05:09.970> have<00:05:10.060> been<00:05:10.150> too<00:05:10.840> much<00:05:10.990> about<00:05:11.169> 20

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
wouldn't have been too much about 20

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.380 
wouldn't have been too much about 20
pounds<00:05:11.770> of<00:05:11.979> boost<00:05:12.070> or<00:05:12.280> whatever<00:05:12.520> yeah<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.300> you

pounds of boost or whatever yeah but you
know<00:05:13.510> you<00:05:13.810> won't<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.229> drive<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.590> car<00:05:14.740> and
