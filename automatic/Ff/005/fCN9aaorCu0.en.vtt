close to the lash line and release and
it's<00:02:23.319> really<00:02:23.500> important<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.280> put<00:02:24.700> your

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
it's really important to put your

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.240 
it's really important to put your
eyelash<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.390> right<00:02:26.110> after<00:02:26.379> you've<00:02:26.799> dipped<00:02:27.099> it

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
eyelash on right after you've dipped it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.640 
eyelash on right after you've dipped it
in<00:02:27.459> your<00:02:27.760> glue<00:02:28.030> because<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.170> glue<00:02:29.409> dries

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
in your glue because this glue dries

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.369 
in your glue because this glue dries
really<00:02:30.129> fast<00:02:33.480> now<00:02:34.480> at<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.870> point<00:02:35.079> in<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.349> eye

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
really fast now at this point in the eye

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.470 
really fast now at this point in the eye
I'm<00:02:36.129> going<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.609> take<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.819> tiny<00:02:37.150> pair<00:02:37.420> of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
I'm going to take a tiny pair of

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.770 
I'm going to take a tiny pair of
scissors<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.140> I'm<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.129> trim<00:02:39.760> them<00:02:40.000> just

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
scissors and I'm going to trim them just

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.970 
scissors and I'm going to trim them just
a<00:02:40.900> little<00:02:41.140> bit<00:02:41.290> because<00:02:41.500> we're<00:02:41.799> going<00:02:41.890> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
a little bit because we're going to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.099 
a little bit because we're going to
gradually<00:02:42.579> make<00:02:42.819> them<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> little<00:02:43.299> bit<00:02:43.690> shorter

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
gradually make them a little bit shorter

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.420 
gradually make them a little bit shorter
so<00:02:44.319> we're<00:02:44.650> going<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.799> give<00:02:44.950> them<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.190> slight

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
so we're going to give them a slight

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.330 
so we're going to give them a slight
trim<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.620> going<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.829> be<00:02:47.950> your<00:02:48.069> final

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
trim and this is going to be your final

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.069 
trim and this is going to be your final
