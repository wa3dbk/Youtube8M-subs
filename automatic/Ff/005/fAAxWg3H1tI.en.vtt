00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.300
 therefore runs 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.650
 but is not saying anything to Bocholt 7 reward not penalized now two points to the 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.629
 leadership 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.179
 very important to realize is that they see just like yesterday were not because 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.859
 ignore it 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.820
 because you keep running continuously 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.820
 is being able to correct treatment in the neighborhood 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.809
 he just says 100 that he will walk from a to b and if you mouth on one 

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.179
 He must also pay attention that the head is going to focus now 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.160
 he also looks at the environment 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.480
 But you also see that more and more that is going to adjust 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.310
 at that pace and the movements of arum 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.860
 and stones have had body language tuning 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 on the no with who runs 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 that cannot be given assignments 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.600
 the fact that the bosses are running and in the chalet relationship between him and his dog 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.340
 guarantees the fact that it is going to give attention 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.530
 yes that will reverse what is often prescribed it is one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 a hundred is quite different from human language 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.960
 her clothes are warm in human language 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.409
 but 100 years old he busy putting body language and body language together 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.350
 to speak 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.040
 we are body says i want to go there 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.380
 and you have to pay attention to me there are no words needed 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.610
 that dog raises its nose and 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.030
 And that there are many focused you look you were also body language 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 he sees 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.090
 even that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.410
 his dog 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.640
 bussum fitting them is measured by the fitting of his boss 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930
 You can see it in the syndrome system of walking 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.790
 that the passenger fulfilled 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.200
 makes the more and more syndrome with a passion for us 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.579
 with other dogs is a step by step that will be achieved in our 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.310
 to adjust his body language 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030
 and the body language of the boss in order to the language 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 that is always obeyed 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.030
 for more obedience is smelling together in the choir 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.969
 and focus more on your boss 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.520
 tutje also exists 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.520
 for the body language in the bathtub 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.979
 but the dog for which on or wait 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.919
 in finding a movement of what are we going to do 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.369
 so have those hands 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.809
 a dog can make the distinction that happens here 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.739
 and what's happening here 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.739
 the neighborhood fair for uithoorn on the left 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.089
 you can't do this with this 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.499
 the left arm etc but the three salvaged and remains standing 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.209
 so move the concrete proposals 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.209
 but as with the judge 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.309
 remained faithful 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.489
 so you can watch the dow in cannes 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.909
 know exactly what is going on 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.939
 whether it's the legs in the rain 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.379
 or the poor are in the ways 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.720
 and that he also means that looks 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.719
 what is the purpose of the cup is 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.219
 so despite the fact that someone for him apparently with very different things 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:57.990
 is busy 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.409
 it is now that out of focus 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.409
 He has that can always be one hundred percent the earth for us 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.839
 after all the cliffs are running 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.889
 you also see it immediately 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.230
 and the town also indicates that old is not really dissatisfied with 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 that he will do something with the boss 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.679
 and then you see but the sun apparently are very few 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.679
 that's not just a walk 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:27.799
 but our choice indeed able to cheer 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.830
 the information is released as the movements make 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.509
 extract shunting on the contractor 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.549
 left leg right leg 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.589
 the left and right hand and some students have body parts too 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:39.389
 want 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.919
 that there is also no abstract thinking 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.399
 being able to connect 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:44.639
 of hands 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.060
 arms and legs 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.330
 already plenty of premises and hind legs that is called distance thinking 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.509
 that's a certain it's a connection for necessary money left over 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.309
 underneath there are six that's clearly there is a signal but also 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.119
 yesterday's recipient 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.380
 to think 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.139
 from their perspective the 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.639
 to mirror 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.900
 to land all body language on a person 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.289
 who walk differently is different 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.559
 We also know that the movement come based on scent information 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.079
 and that is very special to come back to 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.329
 buy this to demonstrate 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.600
 can understand the odor emitted by a boss 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.659
 lilo stepped 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.360
 in evolution 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.270
 nothing too many animals can't think so 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.159
 no idea at all 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.860
 You can also cry again later 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.770
 He wants you to deliver products to your dog in front of the cameras 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.550
 but my son with his right foot and the step forward goes with his left 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.240
 walk 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.630
 pay close attention to what happens in the pcob movement that interaction between the the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.749
 body language of the head of such a dog 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.669
 m the movements of his legs 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.099
 because that's what it's about 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.460
 and pay attention to order pieces of nanosecond work 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.460
 first your right leg and then 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.129
 this has the leg 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.339
 anp ek 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.339
 also the right leg left leg 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.969
 you can see that the dog is always focused on basing 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.189
 the contact not simple exercises 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.260
 take a few steps 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.120
 later it's poor 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.219
 that is becoming increasingly intense 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.400
 what you can look at when you have a good look 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.030
 and that were with his right leg city remains to sit 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.740
 but i do normally 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.260
 that's his left leg 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
 is going to move and soul with the snout 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.270
 well there now bk of arm 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.289
 then breaks
