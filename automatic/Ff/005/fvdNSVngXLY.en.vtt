generally I find myself getting
consistent<00:02:24.710> kills<00:02:24.890> with<00:02:25.070> about<00:02:25.310> three<00:02:25.640> bursts

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
consistent kills with about three bursts

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.850 
consistent kills with about three bursts
with<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.330> thing<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:27.230> long<00:02:27.410> as<00:02:27.590> they<00:02:27.740> are

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
with this thing and as long as they are

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.410 
with this thing and as long as they are
actually<00:02:28.070> hitting<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.550> body<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.150> three

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
actually hitting the body it is a three

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.030 
actually hitting the body it is a three
shot<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.780> kill<00:02:29.900> two<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.710> got<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.830> great

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
shot to kill two and it's got a great

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.730 
shot to kill two and it's got a great
fire<00:02:31.370> rate<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.730> do<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.320> again<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.470> thing

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
fire rate to do that so again this thing

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.800 
fire rate to do that so again this thing
closest<00:02:34.370> resembles<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.000> read<00:02:35.180> Death<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:35.540> terms

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
closest resembles to read Death in terms

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.200 
closest resembles to read Death in terms
of<00:02:35.990> performance<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.950> it's<00:02:37.100> also<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.550> rare<00:02:37.970> so

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
of performance but it's also a rare so

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.240 
of performance but it's also a rare so
it<00:02:38.330> has<00:02:38.480> value<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:39.140> leaving<00:02:39.500> up<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.770> exotic

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
it has value in leaving up the exotic

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.830 
it has value in leaving up the exotic
slot<00:02:40.460> freeing<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.060> up<00:02:41.240> for<00:02:41.450> something<00:02:41.720> like

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
slot freeing that up for something like

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140 
slot freeing that up for something like
the<00:02:41.990> truth<00:02:42.230> or<00:02:42.650> something<00:02:43.040> else<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.490> PvP<00:02:44.030> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the truth or something else for PvP and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.440 
the truth or something else for PvP and
that's<00:02:44.720> enticing<00:02:45.110> that's<00:02:45.500> exciting<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:46.520> what

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
that's enticing that's exciting now what

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.910 
that's enticing that's exciting now what
does<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.690> thing<00:02:47.900> have<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.200> offer<00:02:48.350> for<00:02:48.650> Perks

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
does the thing have to offer for Perks

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.800 
does the thing have to offer for Perks
now<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.400> does<00:02:49.610> have<00:02:49.850> full<00:02:50.060> auto<00:02:50.270> another

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
now it does have full auto another

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.870 
now it does have full auto another
advantage<00:02:50.990> over<00:02:51.800> something<00:02:52.370> like<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.700> Red

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
advantage over something like the Red

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.790 
advantage over something like the Red
Death<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.450> great<00:02:53.780> with<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.050> decent<00:02:54.380> fire

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
Death that is great with a decent fire

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.980 
Death that is great with a decent fire
rate<00:02:55.130> weapon<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.670> again<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.600> said<00:02:56.630> three

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
rate weapon and again like I said three

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.660 
rate weapon and again like I said three
bursts<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.740> body<00:02:57.920> still<00:02:58.250> kill<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.459> person

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
bursts to the body still kill a person

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.910 
bursts to the body still kill a person
while<00:02:59.270> two<00:02:59.510> can<00:02:59.810> precisely<00:03:00.140> kill<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.740> head

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
while two can precisely kill in the head

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.850 
while two can precisely kill in the head
so<00:03:01.700> full<00:03:02.330> auto<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.750> not<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> half<00:03:03.260> bad<00:03:03.290> choice

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
so full auto is not a half bad choice

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.740 
so full auto is not a half bad choice

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.449 
heavily recommend you guys to work on
the<00:03:14.330> stability<00:03:14.480> range<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.740> important<00:03:16.280> but<00:03:16.400> I

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
the stability range is important but I

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.699 
the stability range is important but I
do<00:03:16.580> not<00:03:16.850> think<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.209> Trump's<00:03:17.540> out<00:03:17.660> needing<00:03:18.170> that

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
do not think it Trump's out needing that

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.820 
do not think it Trump's out needing that
availability<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.470> that's<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:21.620> me

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
availability to it so that's just me

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.280 
availability to it so that's just me
personally<00:03:22.040> now<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.239> final<00:03:23.420> perk<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.110> is

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
personally now the final perk on it is

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.199 
personally now the final perk on it is
pretty<00:03:24.709> much<00:03:24.890> it's<00:03:25.280> called<00:03:25.430> rewind<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.120> it

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
pretty much it's called rewind but it

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.290 
pretty much it's called rewind but it
seems<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.540> be<00:03:26.630> like<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.620> mulligan<00:03:28.370> perk<00:03:28.730> it's

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
seems to be like a mulligan perk it's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.390 
seems to be like a mulligan perk it's
actually<00:03:29.720> activates<00:03:30.290> mi<00:03:30.560> frequently<00:03:31.190> it's

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
actually activates mi frequently it's

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.729 
actually activates mi frequently it's
not<00:03:31.760> super<00:03:32.269> common<00:03:32.480> but<00:03:32.900> every<00:03:33.380> once<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.680> a

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
not super common but every once in a

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.199 
not super common but every once in a
while<00:03:33.860> if<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.130> missed<00:03:34.370> shots<00:03:34.610> they<00:03:35.030> will

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
while if you missed shots they will

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.780 
while if you missed shots they will
return<00:03:35.630> back<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.140> magazine<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:37.160> again<00:03:37.640> you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
return back to the magazine so again you

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.090 
return back to the magazine so again you
can't<00:03:38.030> like<00:03:38.330> prepare<00:03:38.989> for<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.410> or<00:03:39.530> plan<00:03:39.800> for

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
can't like prepare for it or plan for

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.190 
can't like prepare for it or plan for
there's<00:03:40.400> no<00:03:40.519> timer<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.660> guaranteed

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
there's no timer and you know guaranteed

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.690 
there's no timer and you know guaranteed
fact<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:42.830> going<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.100> register<00:03:43.580> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
fact that it's going to register and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.000 
fact that it's going to register and
activate<00:03:44.120> if<00:03:44.299> it<00:03:44.630> does<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:45.019> does<00:03:45.200> great<00:03:45.560> so

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
activate if it does it does great so

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.170 
activate if it does it does great so
it's<00:03:46.160> not<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.340> greatest<00:03:46.610> park<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.030> world

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
it's not the greatest park in the world

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.150 
it's not the greatest park in the world
and<00:03:47.420> that's<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.530> again<00:03:48.799> this<00:03:48.920> gun<00:03:49.130> is

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
and that's that so again this gun is

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.070 
and that's that so again this gun is
incredible<00:03:49.700> it's<00:03:49.910> very<00:03:50.269> much<00:03:50.480> like<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.900> Red

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
incredible it's very much like the Red

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.300 
incredible it's very much like the Red
Death<00:03:51.290> now<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.500> Red<00:03:51.680> Death<00:03:51.860> still<00:03:52.130> is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
Death now the Red Death still is

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.979 
Death now the Red Death still is
probably<00:03:52.790> king<00:03:53.120> simply<00:03:53.480> because<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.810> the

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
probably king simply because of the

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.110 
probably king simply because of the
health<00:03:54.170> regeneration<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:55.370> with<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.790> luxury

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
health regeneration but with the luxury

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.360 
health regeneration but with the luxury
of<00:03:56.209> having<00:03:56.390> full<00:03:56.750> auto<00:03:56.959> on<00:03:57.230> this<00:03:57.410> thing<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
of having full auto on this thing and it

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.210 
of having full auto on this thing and it
freeing<00:03:58.880> up<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.390> potential<00:04:00.320> area<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.950> having

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
freeing up the potential area of having

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.550 
freeing up the potential area of having
another<00:04:01.430> exotic<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.450> adds<00:04:02.660> extreme<00:04:03.230> value

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
another exotic that adds extreme value

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.440 
another exotic that adds extreme value
to<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.769> weapon<00:04:04.040> get<00:04:04.489> out<00:04:04.640> there<00:04:04.850> give<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.299> go
