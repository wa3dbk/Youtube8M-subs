 plus 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.710
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.960
 I am thirsty mendoza in my loquendo 46 today 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.420
 I bring you a still short analysis of 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.730
 computer animation that is 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.860
 based on one of the animated series of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.710
 television that marked the childhood of 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.650
 many good this time I bring you 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.320
 a short analysis of games courage a 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.960
 3-d animation short based on the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.480
 animated series of cartoon network courage 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.190
 the cowardly dog I 've already seen this 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.700
 short and now I will give you my opinion 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.530
 towards this good without saying more 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.630
 let's start first let's talk about what it's about 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.180
 the short as in any other episode 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.580
 of this series just find a 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.310
 sort of golden magic ring that what 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.289
 It looks very valuable but courage is very 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.570
 agreement that the ring belonged 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.670
 a person who is probably already 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.850
 dead soon near the house where 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.830
 they inhabit muriel courage and just appear 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.440
 a living haze that approaches 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.720
 Attack the characters because of the ring 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.530
 that he has just but he refuses to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.590
 give back 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.320
 then the mist attacks the house courage 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.630
 must stop it good now that I said 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.060
 the plot of the short now I'm going to give my 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.340
 dark fire opinion that I thought 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.680
 a good short since it keeps the same 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.810
 essence of courage the cowardly dog 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.060
 because the characters are still 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.030
 being the same as we know 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.640
 courage is still a somewhat shy dog 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.920
 but still he's still brave and 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.700
 is always on the lookout to save his 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.130
 family 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.500
 muriel is still that old woman with 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.170
 a sweet heart and a great affection that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.480
 feel towards courage and just still being 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 that bitter old man and swindler who does not 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.730
 to tell courage stupid dog 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.459
 there is 3-d animation but not the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.860
 I saw well executed in this short yet 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.690
 I found it very good animation due to 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.640
 the designs of the characters I 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.530
 they seemed excellent and better 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.170
 facts that other cartoon series 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.420
 network using the 3d humor follows 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.519
 being the same as that caricature that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.860
 have you seen during your childhood and that you 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.750
 keeps making people laugh 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.970
 story of the short did not seem so 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.519
 cliché because there is no other 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.860
 episode of courage the cowardly dog ​​that 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.230
 speak thus of a haze with life what 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.450
 only one thing that is cliché ado would be the idea 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.180
 that just finds something very valuable 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.040
 and that is actually haunted and arrives 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.980
 the spirit to attack the characters 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.170
 the voices in English are not bad 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.630
 because these voices sound very 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.579
 good and they listen to me well that's why I 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.950
 I used to watch some movies 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.980
 series or whatever in your language 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.350
 original something curious about this short is 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.900
 that here is just interpreted by 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.420
 guayas one a man who works doing 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.700
 voices in English to this mister I what 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.920
 I know for being the voice in English of rex 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.500
 the dinosaur of the trilogy of 'toy 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.780
 story ' the only bad thing about the short film would come 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.480
 being the ugly design of the haze that 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.940
 it comes out in the episode I look at it ugly 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.160
 and I imagine that this haze could have 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.799
 scared any little boy in 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.200
 this short but yes this mist does not 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.480
 it's as ugly and disturbing as the guy 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.400
 which says give me back the tablet is a 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.010
 very good short with which you can 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.230
 with your whole family and when it is short 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.930
 I leave Latin America I hope you get 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.329
 a good dubbing to the voices because 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.400
 currently many of the series of 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.860
 cartoon network use a very dub 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.140
 repetitive with voices like that what 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.629
 they show some series like mad a 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.549
 show more why I hope that this 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.400
 short they give you a very good dubbing in 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.470
 Latin Spanish with almost all the voices 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.720
 originals of the characters that 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.209
 we heard in the original series in 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.280
 conclusion of courage fobos is a very 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.169
 good short animation I know the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.539
 I recommend you to throw some 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.940
 laughter and if you went to those people 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.310
 that grew up seeing this character and not 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.830
 have you seen this short is recommended 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.500
 so that they see it and it is not final to this 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.840
 short is a 7 out of 10 a great short 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.000
 passable and good friends up here 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.229
