00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
another thing that I really like about

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.529 
another thing that I really like about
it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.510> nude<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:44.010> matte<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
it is it is nude and it's matte so the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
it is it is nude and it's matte so the
reason<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
reason I like that is if I'm going to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.740 
reason I like that is if I'm going to
use<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.670> example<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.360> line<00:00:48.539> my<00:00:48.719> waterline

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
use it for example to line my waterline

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.189 
use it for example to line my waterline
I<00:00:49.649> don't<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.789> nude<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> white

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
I don't want a nude I don't want a white

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
I don't want a nude I don't want a white
liner<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.969> too<00:00:54.149> stark

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
liner because it's going to be too stark

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
liner because it's going to be too stark
and<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.110> not<00:00:55.289> gonna<00:00:55.440> look<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.739> natural<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and it's not gonna look as natural but a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
and it's not gonna look as natural but a
nude<00:00:57.030> liner<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.260> do<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> better<00:00:58.800> job

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
nude liner is going to do a better job

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
nude liner is going to do a better job
of<00:00:59.190> brightening<00:00:59.850> your<00:00:59.879> eyes<00:01:00.120> making<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.660> look

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
of brightening your eyes making you look

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.920 
of brightening your eyes making you look
a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.079> bit<00:01:01.260> more<00:01:01.469> awake<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.629> looking<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
a little bit more awake and looking and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.350 
a little bit more awake and looking and
not<00:01:04.080> being<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.680> obvious<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.309> also<00:01:06.060> like

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
not being really obvious I also like

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.580 
not being really obvious I also like
that<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.630> matte<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.350> you're<00:01:07.500> going

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that it's matte because if you're going

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
that it's matte because if you're going
to<00:01:07.680> use<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.010> highlighting<00:01:08.640> purposes<00:01:09.210> if

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
to use it for highlighting purposes if

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.380 
to use it for highlighting purposes if
you<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.350> example<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.770> oily<00:01:11.250> skin<00:01:11.360> too<00:01:12.360> much

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you for example have oily skin too much

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.320 
you for example have oily skin too much
shimmer<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> look<00:01:13.500> oily<00:01:13.950> err<00:01:14.330> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
shimmer can make you look oily err and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.149 
shimmer can make you look oily err and
also<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.080> older<00:01:16.470> too<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:16.890> shimmer

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
also as you get older too much shimmer

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.370 
also as you get older too much shimmer
can<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.939> look<00:01:18.119> older<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.049> it'll

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
can make you look older because it'll

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.899 
can make you look older because it'll
settle<00:01:19.740> into<00:01:19.979> fine<00:01:20.009> lines<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.610> it'll<00:01:20.820> even

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
settle into fine lines or it'll even

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
settle into fine lines or it'll even
highlight<00:01:21.450> fine<00:01:21.720> lines<00:01:21.990> which<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.439> kind<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
highlight fine lines which is kind of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.890 
highlight fine lines which is kind of
the<00:01:23.520> opposite<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.360> trying<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the opposite of what you're trying to do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.830 
the opposite of what you're trying to do
I<00:01:25.310> also<00:01:26.310> love<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.030> multi-purpose<00:01:27.330> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I also love that it's multi-purpose I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
I also love that it's multi-purpose I
was<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.530> pleasantly<00:01:28.680> surprised<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.640> well

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
was really pleasantly surprised as well

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880 
was really pleasantly surprised as well
to<00:01:30.000> find<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> consistency<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.500> actually

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
to find that the consistency is actually

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.700 
to find that the consistency is actually
really<00:01:32.100> nice<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.750> incredibly<00:01:34.380> creamy

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
really nice it's not incredibly creamy

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
really nice it's not incredibly creamy
and<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:36.090> dry<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:36.720> say

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and it's not really dry I would say

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.460 
and it's not really dry I would say
maybe<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.650> consistency<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.720> Nyx's<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.110> lip

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
maybe the consistency of Nyx's or lip

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
maybe the consistency of Nyx's or lip
liners<00:01:40.920> which<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.549> bit<00:01:41.759> creamier

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
liners which are a little bit creamier

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
liners which are a little bit creamier
but<00:01:42.420> still<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.200> dry<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.680> about

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
but still a little bit dry it's about

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.490 
but still a little bit dry it's about
that<00:01:44.189> same<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.000> consistency<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.470> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that same kind of consistency and what I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710 
that same kind of consistency and what I
like<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.000> makes<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.450> easy

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
like about that is that it makes it easy

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.990 
like about that is that it makes it easy
to<00:01:49.049> apply<00:01:49.320> onto<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> skin<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.340> transfer<00:01:50.820> onto

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to apply onto the skin and transfer onto

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
to apply onto the skin and transfer onto
the<00:01:51.240> skin<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.140> also<00:01:52.380> easy<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.009> blend

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the skin and it's also easy to blend

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.429 
the skin and it's also easy to blend
alright<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.119> mentioned<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.259> love

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
alright I mentioned that I really love

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:55.850 
alright I mentioned that I really love
this

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380 
this
but<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:56.430> we're<00:01:56.579> doing<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.790> review<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.180> do

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
but because we're doing a review we do

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
but because we're doing a review we do
have<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.719> look<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.259> pros<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.740> cons<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.460> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
have to look at the pros and cons one of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
have to look at the pros and cons one of
the<00:01:59.579> cons<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.689> they<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:01.020> really

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the cons I don't know if they can really

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.090 
the cons I don't know if they can really
fix<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> could<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.969> would<00:02:03.799> because<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.950> use

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
fix but if I could I would because I use

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
fix but if I could I would because I use
it<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.520> many<00:02:05.549> things<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> go

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it for so many things I'm going to go

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.920 
it for so many things I'm going to go
through<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.259> really

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
through this really

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.080 
through this really
fast<00:02:08.350> on<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.009> plus<00:02:09.220> side<00:02:09.429> because<00:02:09.789> it's<00:02:09.940> less

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
fast on the plus side because it's less

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.150 
fast on the plus side because it's less
than<00:02:10.270> $5<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.990> pretty<00:02:11.200> easy<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.560> find<00:02:11.740> it's<00:02:11.980> not

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
than $5 and pretty easy to find it's not

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.880 
than $5 and pretty easy to find it's not
really<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> hassle<00:02:13.060> or<00:02:13.480> burden<00:02:14.320> to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
really going to be a hassle or burden to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.830 
really going to be a hassle or burden to
replace<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.460> what<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.850> do<00:02:15.940> think<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.570> it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
replace it what I do think is that it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.320 
replace it what I do think is that it
could<00:02:17.380> come<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.950> more<00:02:18.220> than<00:02:18.400> three<00:02:18.730> shades<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
could come in more than three shades the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.120 
could come in more than three shades the
light<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> little<00:02:20.320> bit<00:02:20.410> too<00:02:20.560> light<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:21.010> me

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
light is a little bit too light for me

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.950 
light is a little bit too light for me
and<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.580> medium<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:22.060> little<00:02:22.270> bit<00:02:22.390> too<00:02:22.510> dark<00:02:22.690> so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
and the medium a little bit too dark so

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.780 
and the medium a little bit too dark so
I<00:02:23.230> think<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.560> could<00:02:23.710> get<00:02:23.770> even<00:02:24.100> more<00:02:24.400> use

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
I think that I could get even more use

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.270 
I think that I could get even more use
out<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.300> if<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.890> could<00:02:26.890> get<00:02:27.070> something

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
out of it if I could get something

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
out of it if I could get something
that's<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.730> lot<00:02:28.030> closer<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.510> my<00:02:28.630> skin<00:02:28.690> tone<00:02:29.080> but

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
that's a lot closer to my skin tone but

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.080 
that's a lot closer to my skin tone but
because<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.280> little<00:02:30.520> too<00:02:30.670> light<00:02:30.910> and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
because it's a little too light and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.580 
because it's a little too light and
therefore<00:02:31.300> highlights<00:02:31.990> more<00:02:32.290> than<00:02:32.470> it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
therefore highlights more than it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
therefore highlights more than it
conceals<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.670> me<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.910> can't<00:02:34.360> really<00:02:34.480> use<00:02:34.630> it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
conceals for me I can't really use it

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.830 
conceals for me I can't really use it
for<00:02:35.490> spot<00:02:36.490> treatments<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.810> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
for spot treatments so if I have a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.780 
for spot treatments so if I have a
blemish<00:02:38.140> or<00:02:38.470> something<00:02:38.740> like<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.490> try

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
blemish or something like that and I try

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.780 
blemish or something like that and I try
to<00:02:40.470> conceal<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.650> using<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.310> because<00:02:42.550> it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to conceal it using this because it's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.180 
to conceal it using this because it's
going<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.940> be<00:02:43.060> small<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.480> easy<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.750> kind<00:02:44.050> of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
going to be small and easy to kind of

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.520 
going to be small and easy to kind of
draw<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.610> blemish<00:02:45.970> it's<00:02:46.870> basically<00:02:47.290> going

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
draw on the blemish it's basically going

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.140 
draw on the blemish it's basically going
to<00:02:47.620> highlight<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.700> not<00:02:48.910> really

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
to highlight it and that's not really

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.580 
to highlight it and that's not really
going<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.420> help<00:02:49.540> all<00:02:49.900> right<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.290> let's<00:02:50.470> talk

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.500 
going to help all right so let's talk
about<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.950> different<00:02:51.310> uses<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.910> have<00:02:52.209> for

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
about the different uses that I have for

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.900 
about the different uses that I have for
it<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.750> like<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.170> use<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:54.370> highlight

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
it so I like to use it to highlight

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.810 
it so I like to use it to highlight
under<00:02:55.209> my<00:02:55.330> brows<00:02:55.709> basically<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:56.739> just<00:02:57.040> draw<00:02:57.520> it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
under my brows basically I just draw it

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.670 
under my brows basically I just draw it
on<00:02:58.000> right<00:02:58.360> under<00:02:58.510> my<00:02:58.720> brow<00:02:58.930> exactly<00:02:59.500> where<00:02:59.650> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
on right under my brow exactly where I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.560 
on right under my brow exactly where I
want<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.760> blend<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.270> out<00:03:01.390> with<00:03:01.420> my

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
want it and then I blend it out with my

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.190 
want it and then I blend it out with my
fingers

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.770 

I<00:03:05.290> also<00:03:06.220> use<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.970> my<00:03:07.120> inner<00:03:07.330> corner<00:03:07.750> to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
I also use it in my inner corner to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.690 
I also use it in my inner corner to
highlight<00:03:08.349> my<00:03:08.530> inner<00:03:08.560> corner<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.310> brighten

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
highlight my inner corner and brighten

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.640 
highlight my inner corner and brighten
