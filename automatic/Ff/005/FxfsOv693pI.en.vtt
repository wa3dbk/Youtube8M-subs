00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.109 
picked up is this clock and thermometer
combination<00:01:50.079> this<00:01:51.040> was<00:01:51.250> probably<00:01:51.400> about<00:01:51.850> five

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
combination this was probably about five

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.020 
combination this was probably about five
dollars<00:01:52.360> as<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.680> can<00:01:53.799> see<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.189> has<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.700> clock

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
dollars as you can see it has a clock

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.999

and<00:01:55.240> thermometers<00:01:55.960> on<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.350> that's<00:01:56.770> why<00:01:56.979> I

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
and thermometers on it that's why I

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.219 
and thermometers on it that's why I
called<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.490> clock<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.880> thermometer<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.570> it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
called it a clock and thermometer and it

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.050 
called it a clock and thermometer and it
has<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.560> voltage<00:01:59.979> which<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.820> actually

has this voltage which is actually
surprisingly<00:02:01.390> useful<00:02:02.049> when<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.649> dry<00:02:02.890> camping

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
surprisingly useful when you dry camping

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.920 
surprisingly useful when you dry camping
so<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.970> can<00:02:04.119> tell<00:02:04.329> when<00:02:04.509> you're<00:02:04.630> running<00:02:04.899> down

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
so you can tell when you're running down

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.170 
so you can tell when you're running down
the<00:02:05.170> voltage<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.619> your<00:02:05.799> battery<00:02:06.180> however

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
the voltage of your battery however

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.550 
the voltage of your battery however
remember<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.990> voltage<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.410> your

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
remember that the voltage of your

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.139 
remember that the voltage of your

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
battery especially when you're loading

and<00:02:10.269> unloading<00:02:10.329> it<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:10.989> not<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> very<00:02:11.920> good

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
and unloading it is not a very good

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.410 
and unloading it is not a very good
indication<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.730> how<00:02:12.880> much<00:02:13.060> power<00:02:13.239> you

actually have left in your battery a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.280 
actually have left in your battery a
sudden<00:02:16.000> drain<00:02:16.209> will<00:02:16.420> drive<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.810> voltage<00:02:17.110> way

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290

down<00:02:17.560> when<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.040> still<00:02:18.280> may<00:02:18.459> actually<00:02:18.670> have

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
down when you still may actually have

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.000 
down when you still may actually have
plenty<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.330> power<00:02:19.510> left<00:02:19.660> once<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.709> remove

to<00:02:23.080> install<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.650> all<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.220> did<00:02:24.640> was<00:02:24.670> also

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
to install this all I did was also

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.540 
to install this all I did was also
connected<00:02:25.450> into<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.990> 12<00:02:26.230> volt<00:02:26.290> supply<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.130> it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
connected into the 12 volt supply and it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.100 
connected into the 12 volt supply and it
has<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> temperature<00:02:28.090> probe<00:02:28.480> for<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.750> outside

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
has a temperature probe for the outside

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.520 
has a temperature probe for the outside
temperature<00:02:29.410> which<00:02:30.220> comes<00:02:30.459> off<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.670> unit

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
temperature which comes off the unit

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.990 
temperature which comes off the unit
runs<00:02:32.530> through<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:32.860> cabinet<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.490> out

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
runs through this cabinet and out

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.540 
runs through this cabinet and out
through<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.270> emergency<00:02:34.870> exit<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:36.370> might

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
through the emergency exit you might

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.770 
through the emergency exit you might
wonder<00:02:36.730> why<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.060> went<00:02:37.300> out<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.569> emergency

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
wonder why I went out the emergency

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.670 
wonder why I went out the emergency
window<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.940> answer<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.180> very<00:02:40.300> simple<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
window and the answer is very simple it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.720 
window and the answer is very simple it
has<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.190> second<00:02:42.640> seal<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.620> wire<00:02:44.800> if<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.580> can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
has a second seal so the wire if you can

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.040 
has a second seal so the wire if you can
see<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.239> going<00:02:46.510> out<00:02:46.720> through<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
see this is going out through the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.890 
see this is going out through the
emergency<00:02:47.319> seal<00:02:48.010> which<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.330> not<00:02:49.360> normally

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
emergency seal which you do not normally

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.690 
emergency seal which you do not normally
move<00:02:50.410> when<00:02:50.709> you're<00:02:50.830> opening<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.250> closing<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.210 
move when you're opening and closing the
window<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.440> run<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> wire<00:02:53.890> through<00:02:53.920> a

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
window if you run the wire through a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.130 
window if you run the wire through a
window<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.760> opens<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.390> closes<00:02:55.600> you'll

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
window that opens and closes you'll

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.080 
window that opens and closes you'll
continuously<00:02:56.680> be<00:02:56.890> scissoring<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.489> wire<00:02:57.700> and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
continuously be scissoring that wire and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.880 
continuously be scissoring that wire and
after<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> couple<00:02:58.570> cycles<00:02:58.900> probably<00:02:59.560> cut<00:02:59.739> it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
after a couple cycles probably cut it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.130 
after a couple cycles probably cut it
you<00:03:00.700> don't<00:03:00.880> want<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> do<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.019> goes

you don't want to do that if it goes

you don't want to do that if it goes
