00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.059
 hello guys how are we and support and here 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.980
 we are in a new series that we call 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.629
 surviving as a rookie this series is 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.430
 where we will give you tips how to face 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.680
 those wild experiences of 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.779
 multiplayer with a different vision and 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.730
 not so much as a newbie and one of the 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.619
 first issues one of the details that 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.990
 more obsesses the player who starts 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.390
 in bar the purpose is to be unblocking 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.699
 weapons and more weapons to have all the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.800
 full scene I do not deny it because 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.270
 it's the first thing I do but there's a 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.220
 situation that puts us in trouble and is 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.710
 simply that many times the weapon that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.590
 we choose does not work for us or just 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.020
 let's say and say this weapon sucks ever 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.270
 will use it again and they have and do not 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.670
 they are right to say it but something that is not 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.130
 we take into account is that we should not 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.500
 obsess about having a weapon to 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.840
 all situations the same weapon does not 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.750
 will serve you always have to adapt 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.820
 if there are multipurpose weapons that serve 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.950
 in any situation shooting from 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.710
 the hip shooting aiming with the 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.749
 look or acm but there are others that stand out 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.760
 in short distances and that to long 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:09.980
 distances from those same weapons 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.260
 they serve much better spit out 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.120
 your enemy that being using that weapon there 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.600
 many factors that intervene in that 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.210
 kind of things and at least here we will see 21 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.190
 it's the distance we do not know what 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.530
 distance you will be working and 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.400
 possibly it's a bit abstract that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.990
 I arrived and they tell you short distances 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.850
 medium distances but in truth that 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.520
 is how much is the average distance when 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.840
 a short distance because obviously not 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.060
 it is the same to be working in the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.250
 operation what is in the dam of the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.190
 ncaa fuck even in gigantic things 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.590
 like the map of the silk route and very 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.960
 well short distances are less than 10 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.390
 meters medium distances are from 30 to 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.060
 40 meters and long distances 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.490
 We are considering 50 meters and more 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.950
 there more extreme things are for 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.560
 sniper like this is your enemy to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.010
 10 meters so your enemy looks at 30 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.630
 meters and so it will look at 50 meters ok 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.880
 we have those distances but what is the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.590
 another factor another one of the factors that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.300
 plays a very important role for 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.570
 classify weapons and how are you going to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.930
 use is the cadence because we can 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.849
 do 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.280
 the cadence by limiting your weapon a little 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.379
 and is that usually weapons with 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.180
 high rates tend to be imprecise 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.069
 by the setback that accumulates between 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.069
 each one of the shots and dispersion 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.049
 natural weapon what I will tell you 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.400
 below is a guide is not 100% 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.950
 effective because obviously you have to 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.730
 adapt but it will give you an idea of ​​why 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.500
 why sometimes you win those matchups 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.659
 a high cadence weapon will work 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.849
 perfectly in short distances 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.980
 we are talking about cadences from above 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.720
 of the 800 bullets per minute and per 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.939
 of course something that stands out a lot here 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.280
 in short distances and body combat 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.780
 body are the shotguns and when 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.269
 you love to be killed with 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.590
 true shotguns many of the weapons of 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.230
 engineer or personal defense weapons 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.879
 they have very high cadences and basically 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.700
 they are the queens of the meetings 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.439
 close or melee there are few 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.629
 things that exceed them in these 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.790
 encounters and is that if you face a 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.280
 enemy with a weapon of more cadence than the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.889
 you simply and simply lose the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.230
 duel because it will get you more bullets than 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.340
 that he had makes them come in contact with 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.580
 him by the simple cadence 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.310
 and he beats 800/900 he won 800 800 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.930
 wins 700 pure logic guys so in 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.390
 instead of getting angry because they ambushed you with 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.790
 a shotgun or with the famas uses the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.730
 same technique equip a weapon that works 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.519
 for that purpose it is not open it is not 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.019
 Sitting is simply and simply 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.540
 adapt to the conditions in which you 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.340
 you are working half distances 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.920
 we are talking about what you can use 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.390
 weapons with cadence less than 900 but 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.540
 more than seven hundred bullets per minute 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.920
 they are ideal they are quite controllable and 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.230
 in many cases they are considered 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.120
 fortunately all the SUVs 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.880
 houses or most have weapons that 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.739
 they fall into this range so you should not 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.079
 have many problems to find a 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.790
 weapon of these characteristics 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.099
 Now if you see that you have a map with 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.290
 very wide areas very open spaces 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.480
 Well, the best thing you can do is leave 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.060
 with a weapon of low or lower cadence 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.979
 700 bullets per minute these weapons so 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.560
 regular are very controllable because the 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.810
 bullets are more spaced apart and 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.940
 allows the cadence practically not 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.670
 accumulate if they have it in mind but it is 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.620
 less unstable than those of high cadence 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.680
 the problem until when you change 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.050
 areas from an open area to a short area 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.030
 you could have problems because although you 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.860
 Reaction time is very good your weapon 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.470
 it might not be up to the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.300
 situation and in this case you do not believe me 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.630
 look at the experiment we did here 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.850
 between shooting high and low rates to 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.150
 different distances who do you think 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.150
 I win 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.880
 you saw each weapon has its purpose and 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.430
 The best you can do is adapt to 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.380
 the situation and your style of play if 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.330
 you're aggressive, you're probably very 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.060
 close to the enemy so a cadence 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.060
 medium or high could work t more than 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.610
 well if you are reserved you think every step 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.860
 you cover yourself so much I could tell you with 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.750
 a weapon of low or medium cadence for 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.520
 control when you are attacking the 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.370
 enemy because usually those 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.170
 players are very cautious so 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.630
 simply and simply do not obsess 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.150
 to make your weapon work in all 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.520
 the situations because many times you 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.700
 will cause many problems and too many 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.740
 frustrations there are weapons that obviously 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.530
 do not fall into these rules and already 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.450
 We'll see later, so analyze your 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.670
 situation pays attention to these details 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.090
 and he survives as a rookie in the field of 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.030
 battle 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.500
 I hope these tips have served you 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.240
 Tell me about your experiences as a newbie 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.580
 what would you like us to review in the 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.380
 future and of course connect with 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.700
 us in our social networks of 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.410
 twitter and facebook 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.650
 I'm ninja support and see you the one
