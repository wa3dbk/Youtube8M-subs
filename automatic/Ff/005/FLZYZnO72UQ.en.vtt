00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.090 
went some of the things that happen the
little<00:00:37.760> landmarks<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:38.810> destinations<00:00:39.530> like

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
little landmarks and destinations like

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.090 
little landmarks and destinations like
the<00:00:40.700> crab<00:00:41.150> cooker<00:00:41.480> right<00:00:41.720> over<00:00:41.930> there

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.680 

pretty<00:00:46.100> much<00:00:46.250> Bob<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.760> Marty<00:00:47.150> could<00:00:47.360> live<00:00:47.540> in

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
pretty much Bob and Marty could live in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.850 
pretty much Bob and Marty could live in
any<00:00:47.840> one<00:00:48.110> of<00:00:48.140> these<00:00:48.320> houses

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
any one of these houses

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.810 
any one of these houses
Tracy<00:00:50.050> Todd<00:00:51.130> all<00:00:52.130> of<00:00:52.340> them<00:00:52.489> they<00:00:52.640> haven't

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
Tracy Todd all of them they haven't

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.069 
Tracy Todd all of them they haven't
changed<00:00:53.149> much<00:00:53.540> over<00:00:53.720> all<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.110> years

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
changed much over all the years

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.959 
changed much over all the years
I<00:00:56.140> think<00:00:56.859> that's<00:00:57.190> part<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.579> reason<00:00:57.850> why<00:00:57.940> I

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
I think that's part of the reason why I

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.450 
I think that's part of the reason why I
wanted<00:00:58.359> to<00:00:58.420> write<00:00:58.719> these<00:00:59.230> books<00:00:59.289> and<00:00:59.920> set<00:01:00.280> them

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
wanted to write these books and set them

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.610 
wanted to write these books and set them
at<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.609> place<00:01:00.760> like<00:01:00.909> this<00:01:01.210> because<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:02.379> things

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
at a place like this because the things

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.920 
at a place like this because the things
that<00:01:02.800> teenagers<00:01:03.100> go<00:01:03.429> through<00:01:03.460> over<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.360> years

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
that teenagers go through over the years

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.020 
that teenagers go through over the years
really<00:01:05.409> doesn't<00:01:05.799> change<00:01:05.860> that<00:01:06.490> sense<00:01:06.909> of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
really doesn't change that sense of

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.450 
really doesn't change that sense of
wanting<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.360> belong<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.840> find<00:01:08.830> friends<00:01:09.130> and

over the years some of them wrote and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.439 
over the years some of them wrote and
said<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.460> they've<00:04:25.610> done<00:04:25.820> things<00:04:26.090> just<00:04:26.330> like

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.150 
said that they've done things just like
Christy<00:04:26.870> where<00:04:27.139> they<00:04:27.260> try<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.500> eat<00:04:27.770> something

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
Christy where they try to eat something

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.129 
Christy where they try to eat something
and<00:04:28.460> they<00:04:28.580> get<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:28.820> on<00:04:28.940> their<00:04:28.970> face<00:04:29.330> that's

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
and they get it on their face that's

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.420 
and they get it on their face that's
what<00:04:30.289> happened<00:04:30.590> when<00:04:30.710> Christy<00:04:31.010> was<00:04:31.160> here<00:04:31.340> in
