00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
why they're so rare I certainly can

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.180 
why they're so rare I certainly can
build<00:06:01.330> anything<00:06:01.659> like<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.139> so<00:06:02.680> no<00:06:02.889> chance

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
build anything like it so no chance

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.240 
so where'd you get those any Vox founded
in<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.389> mine<00:06:13.659> along<00:06:13.960> with<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.199> lamp<00:06:14.409> thought

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
in the mine along with the lamp thought

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.820 
in the mine along with the lamp thought
it<00:06:15.400> was<00:06:15.490> part<00:06:15.699> of<00:06:15.789> the<00:06:15.909> lamp<00:06:16.090> at<00:06:16.270> first<00:06:16.830> didn't

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
it was part of the lamp at first didn't

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.499 
it was part of the lamp at first didn't
realize<00:06:18.190> what<00:06:18.400> I'd<00:06:18.520> actually<00:06:18.699> found<00:06:19.180> until
