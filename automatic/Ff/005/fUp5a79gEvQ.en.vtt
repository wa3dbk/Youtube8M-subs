00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
and then you'll see these like two

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.280 
and then you'll see these like two
concrete<00:02:19.170> feet<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.660> put<00:02:21.930> your<00:02:22.080> feet

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
concrete feet so that you put your feet

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
concrete feet so that you put your feet
on<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> right<00:02:22.980> left<00:02:23.340> foot<00:02:23.610> when<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:23.970> squat

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
on the right left foot when you squat

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.050 
on the right left foot when you squat
down<00:02:24.570> your<00:02:25.290> tailpipe<00:02:25.890> should<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.460> pretty<00:02:26.790> much

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
down your tailpipe should be pretty much

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.790 
down your tailpipe should be pretty much
over<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.630> hole<00:02:27.810> right<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.620> pretty

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
over the hole right so that's a pretty

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.980 
over the hole right so that's a pretty
easy<00:02:29.010> concept<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.610> get<00:02:29.850> right<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
easy concept to get right but the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.710 
easy concept to get right but the
problem<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.800> Brits<00:02:32.100> made<00:02:32.940> these<00:02:33.240> trains

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
problem is the Brits made these trains

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.720 
problem is the Brits made these trains
and<00:02:34.080> still<00:02:34.290> instead<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> having<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.440> squatter

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
and still instead of having the squatter

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.310 
and still instead of having the squatter
toilets<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.970> everybody<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.660> India's<00:02:39.990> used

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
thought well that's kind of odd why am I

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.949 
thought well that's kind of odd why am I
having<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.890> step<00:03:50.130> over<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.670> ledge<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.810> know

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.990 
having to step over this ledge you know
well<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.530> stepped<00:03:53.400> over<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.700> ledge<00:03:53.820> and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
well I stepped over the ledge and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.460 
well I stepped over the ledge and
remember<00:03:54.360> i'm<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.600> flip-flops<00:03:54.840> i<00:03:55.200> stepped

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
remember i'm in flip-flops i stepped

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.270 
remember i'm in flip-flops i stepped
over<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.890> ledge<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:57.440> directly<00:03:58.440> into<00:03:58.980> about

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
over the ledge and directly into about

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.720 
over the ledge and directly into about
an<00:03:59.580> inch<00:03:59.850> and<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.060> half<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.510> urine<00:04:01.730> because

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
an inch and a half of urine because

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.460 
an inch and a half of urine because
people<00:04:03.330> just<00:04:03.480> pissed<00:04:03.840> all<00:04:03.989> over<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.320> place

people just pissed all over the place
and<00:04:04.650> that's<00:04:04.739> why<00:04:04.920> they<00:04:05.040> build<00:04:07.250> legends<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
and that's why they build legends if the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.390 
and that's why they build legends if the
regular<00:04:09.030> rigger<00:04:09.810> things<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.590> I'm<00:04:10.830> stepping

and the site that icy chills me to my
very<00:04:35.380> core<00:04:35.820> because<00:04:37.230> nobody<00:04:38.230> was<00:04:38.440> used<00:04:38.710> to

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
very core because nobody was used to

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.190 
very core because nobody was used to
actually<00:04:39.130> sitting<00:04:39.520> down<00:04:39.790> on<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.570> porcelain

actually sitting down on a porcelain

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.420 
actually sitting down on a porcelain
throne<00:04:41.830> so<00:04:42.790> instead<00:04:43.300> they<00:04:43.720> had<00:04:44.140> climbed<00:04:44.680> up<00:04:45.040> on

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
throne so instead they had climbed up on

throne so instead they had climbed up on
top<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.830> seat<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:49.410> if<00:04:50.410> you<00:04:51.160> can<00:04:51.310> imagine

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.250 
in my tool at my house well the tailpipe
doesn't<00:05:00.160> exactly<00:05:00.460> end<00:05:00.880> up<00:05:01.240> point<00:05:01.810> down<00:05:02.050> in

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
doesn't exactly end up point down in

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.860 
doesn't exactly end up point down in
there<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.740> water<00:05:03.010> so<00:05:03.790> I<00:05:04.120> go<00:05:04.390> in<00:05:04.420> there<00:05:04.690> when

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
there to the water so I go in there when

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.230 
there to the water so I go in there when
I<00:05:04.900> turn<00:05:05.140> on<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.290> light<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.640> toilet

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
I turn on the light and the the toilet

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.220 
I turn on the light and the the toilet
seat<00:05:07.630> is<00:05:08.050> just<00:05:08.800> full<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:10.240> piles<00:05:10.840> of<00:05:11.760> excrement

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
seat is just full of piles of excrement

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.110 
seat is just full of piles of excrement
so<00:05:14.230> I'm<00:05:14.740> like<00:05:15.010> what<00:05:15.370> am<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.610> going<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:15.910> do<00:05:16.090> now

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
so I'm like what am I going to do now

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.330 
so I'm like what am I going to do now
because<00:05:16.900> I'm<00:05:17.140> certainly<00:05:17.410> not<00:05:17.650> going<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:17.980> sit

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
because I'm certainly not going to sit

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.500 
because I'm certainly not going to sit
on<00:05:18.400> that<00:05:19.200> so<00:05:20.460> basically<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:21.580> just<00:05:21.970> had<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.210> try

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
on that so basically I just had to try

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.330 
on that so basically I just had to try
to<00:05:22.570> climb<00:05:22.990> up<00:05:23.050> on<00:05:23.410> there<00:05:23.620> with<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:23.980> rest<00:05:24.160> of

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
to climb up on there with the rest of

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.480 
to climb up on there with the rest of
guys<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:24.850> do<00:05:25.030> my<00:05:25.180> business<00:05:25.480> on<00:05:25.930> there<00:05:26.490> but

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
guys and do my business on there but

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.670 
guys and do my business on there but
that<00:05:28.060> was<00:05:28.300> definitely<00:05:28.570> one<00:05:28.870> of<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.470> worst

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
that was definitely one of the worst

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.160 
that was definitely one of the worst
toilets<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.370> I've<00:05:30.520> ever<00:05:30.550> been<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.540> that

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
toilets that I've ever been to and that

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.030 
toilets that I've ever been to and that
was<00:05:32.380> another<00:05:32.680> story<00:05:33.220> tub
