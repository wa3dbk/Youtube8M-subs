first to learn how to do it um it's sort
of<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> an<00:00:42.660> axe<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.590> well<00:00:44.450> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
of a bit of an axe to do really well so

military pattern I found the picture

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.830 
military pattern I found the picture
earlier<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.170> quite<00:01:52.320> good<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:53.840> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
earlier it's quite good actually this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
earlier it's quite good actually this
shows<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> diff<00:01:55.350> that's<00:01:55.680> DPM<00:01:56.219> here

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
shows a diff that's DPM here

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.410 
shows a diff that's DPM here
and<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> looks<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.439> either<00:01:59.100> digital<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and this looks like either digital or a

tiger<00:02:00.930> stripe<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:02.299> can't<00:02:03.299> say<00:02:03.600> whatever<00:02:04.560> is

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
tiger stripe I can't say whatever is

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.069 
tiger stripe I can't say whatever is
it's<00:02:05.189> good<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.700> better<00:02:05.880> surroundings<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
it's good to better surroundings so you

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.260 
it's good to better surroundings so you
can<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.829> important<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.880> flushes

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
can see that how important can flushes

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.960 
can see that how important can flushes
for<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.569> surroundings<00:02:10.080> because<00:02:10.170> obviously

go on to digital KY now you can there's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.260 
go on to digital KY now you can there's
two<00:03:05.010> ways<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.280> doing<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.790> can<00:03:05.910> either<00:03:06.000> do
