before we get on to the actual turning
here<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:02.939> just<00:00:03.090> wanted<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.360> quickly<00:00:03.449> talk<00:00:03.810> about

well grips to work very well and and
turns<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.190> very<00:00:17.400> well<00:00:17.520> any<00:00:18.330> problem<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.779> if

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
turns it very well any problem is if

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.210 
turns it very well any problem is if
when<00:00:19.199> you're<00:00:19.320> learning<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
when you're learning and you have a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.820 
when you're learning and you have a
catch<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:21.210> keeps<00:00:21.689> moving<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.140> wood<00:00:22.410> without

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
catch it keeps moving the wood without

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.120 
catch it keeps moving the wood without
any<00:00:23.189> mercy<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.170> don't<00:00:25.439> use<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.859> very

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
any mercy at all so I don't use it very

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.560 
any mercy at all so I don't use it very
much<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.760> very<00:00:27.029> good<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.390> there's

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
much it's a very good one there's

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
much it's a very good one there's
nothing<00:00:27.869> nothing<00:00:28.050> wrong<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.680> don't<00:00:28.920> use

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
nothing nothing wrong with it don't use

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.429 
nothing nothing wrong with it don't use
it<00:00:29.070> very<00:00:29.369> much<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.080> got<00:00:31.289> off

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
it very much this is one that I got off

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.639 
it very much this is one that I got off
of<00:00:31.650> my<00:00:31.920> mini<00:00:32.160> lathe<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:34.170> only<00:00:34.410> thing

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
of my mini lathe and the only thing

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.630 
of my mini lathe and the only thing
that's<00:00:34.770> different<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's different about this one is it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
that's different about this one is it
does<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> removable<00:00:36.300> tip<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> stick<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
does have a removable tip you stick a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.569 
does have a removable tip you stick a
screwdriver<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.160> pop<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.550> out

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
screwdriver in there and pop that out

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.440 
screwdriver in there and pop that out
you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.030> remove<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.390> tip<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.739> do

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
you can remove that tip then you can do

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.430 
you can remove that tip then you can do
other<00:00:42.450> things<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> guess<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> don't

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
other things with it I guess I don't

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.580 
other things with it I guess I don't
know<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.590> again<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.129> use<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> very<00:00:44.550> often

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
know I again I don't use it very often

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.020 
know I again I don't use it very often
because<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.770> got<00:00:46.950> again<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.250> four<00:00:47.789> drive

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
because it's got again the four drive

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.549 
because it's got again the four drive
points<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:48.510> end<00:00:48.690> nothing<00:00:48.899> wrong<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
points which end nothing wrong with that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.770 
points which end nothing wrong with that
it's<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.950> traditional<00:00:50.460> thing<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
it's a traditional thing is just that it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
it's a traditional thing is just that it
is<00:00:51.930> rather<00:00:52.260> unmerciful<00:00:52.980> when<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> get<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
is rather unmerciful when you get a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
is rather unmerciful when you get a
catch<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.870> drive<00:00:55.079> center<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
catch the drive center that I do use a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
catch the drive center that I do use a
lot<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.640> two<00:00:56.940> main<00:00:57.239> reasons<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.020> one

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
lot for two main reasons is this one

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
lot for two main reasons is this one

makes and sells these but you can buy
this<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.570> steel<00:01:10.549> turning<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.540> steel<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this for steel turning and the steel is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
this for steel turning and the steel is
is<00:01:13.200> soft<00:01:13.560> enough<00:01:13.860> compared<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> high

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is soft enough compared to the high

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
is soft enough compared to the high
speed<00:01:15.150> steel<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.540> your<00:01:15.659> lathe<00:01:15.869> turning<00:01:16.350> tools

speed steel of your lathe turning tools

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
speed steel of your lathe turning tools
that<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.700> actually<00:01:17.850> turn<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.390> little

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that you can actually turn this little

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
that you can actually turn this little
cup<00:01:19.909> hope<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:22.159> this<00:01:23.159> little

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
cup on the end and tip on there in fact

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.929 
cup on the end and tip on there in fact
I've<00:01:28.500> returned<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> couple<00:01:29.460> times<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I've returned it a couple times if I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.270 
I've returned it a couple times if I
happen<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.049> must<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.799> mess<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.220> up

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
happen to you know must have mess it up

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.780 
happen to you know must have mess it up
a<00:01:32.460> bit

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a bit

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.289 
a bit
the<00:01:33.540> big<00:01:33.810> advantage<00:01:33.930> about<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.299> because

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the big advantage about this is because

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.929 
the big advantage about this is because
of<00:01:36.420> its<00:01:36.540> length<00:01:37.250> when<00:01:38.250> you're<00:01:38.400> working<00:01:38.790> on

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of its length when you're working on

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.810 
of its length when you're working on
spindle<00:01:39.810> turning<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:41.040> gets<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.610> much

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
spindle turning it gets it this much

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
spindle turning it gets it this much
further<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.180> from<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.600> headstock<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
further out from the headstock and the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
further out from the headstock and the
DVR<00:01:43.890> headstock<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.460> fairly<00:01:44.700> bulky<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
DVR headstock is fairly bulky one of the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.149 
DVR headstock is fairly bulky one of the
things<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.079> don't<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.470> about<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.799> lathe<00:01:46.920> but

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
things I don't like about the lathe but

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
things I don't like about the lathe but
it's<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> huge<00:01:47.759> handicap<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.720> are<00:01:48.840> ways

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it's not a huge handicap there are ways

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's not a huge handicap there are ways
to<00:01:48.960> work<00:01:49.200> around<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to work around it so because the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.330 
to work around it so because the
headstock<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.000> quite<00:01:51.299> bulky<00:01:51.710> it's<00:01:52.710> better<00:01:53.159> if

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
headstock is quite bulky it's better if

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.880 
headstock is quite bulky it's better if
it<00:01:53.460> gets<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.759> little<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.990> from

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
it gets a little bit from from the from

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.260 
it gets a little bit from from the from
the<00:01:56.040> headstock<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.700> course<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the headstock now of course you know the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.520 
the headstock now of course you know the
further<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.600> go<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.869> more<00:01:58.020> vibration

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
further you go out the more vibration

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.499 
further you go out the more vibration
you<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.740> etc<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.520> spindle<00:02:00.180> turning<00:02:00.299> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
you have etc but for spindle turning I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.350 
you have etc but for spindle turning I
find<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> an<00:02:01.740> issue

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
find that's not really much of an issue

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.830 
find that's not really much of an issue
one<00:02:03.360> way<00:02:03.540> sells<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:05.390> centre<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:06.689> they<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
one way sells a centre I think they I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.800 
one way sells a centre I think they I
believe<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.380> call<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.740> safety<00:02:08.099> center

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
believe they call this a safety center

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.300 
believe they call this a safety center
it's<00:02:09.810> got<00:02:10.050> several<00:02:10.289> advantages<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.099> it's

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it's got several advantages as well it's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.050 
it's got several advantages as well it's
got<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> removable<00:02:11.760> tip<00:02:12.270> which<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.840> one

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
got a removable tip which just one

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.890 
got a removable tip which just one
have<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:15.849> sell<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:16.780> is

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
have and they just sell it like it is

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.530 
have and they just sell it like it is
it's<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.700> yeah<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.760> says<00:02:18.970> when<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.239> write<00:02:19.420> on

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it's a yeah it says when we write on

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.050 
it's a yeah it says when we write on
there<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.380> disadvantage<00:02:21.310> with<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.520> one<00:02:21.790> of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
there the disadvantage with this one of

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.010 
there the disadvantage with this one of
course<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:24.069> it's<00:02:24.340> quite<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> bit<00:02:24.790> closer<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
course is it's quite a bit closer to the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.390 
course is it's quite a bit closer to the
headstock<00:02:26.380> that's<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.650> disadvantage<00:02:26.950> for<00:02:27.310> me

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
headstock that's a disadvantage for me

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.620 
headstock that's a disadvantage for me
with<00:02:27.550> my<00:02:27.700> lathe<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.209> different<00:02:28.480> kind<00:02:28.599> of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
with my lathe with a different kind of

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.759 
with my lathe with a different kind of
lathe<00:02:28.750> maybe<00:02:28.989> that's<00:02:29.200> not<00:02:29.319> such<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.530> big<00:02:29.709> deal

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
lathe maybe that's not such a big deal

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.120 
lathe maybe that's not such a big deal
but<00:02:30.610> on<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.030> DVR<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.500> difference<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
but on the DVR the difference in the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.890 
but on the DVR the difference in the
distance<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:33.970> sticks<00:02:34.180> out<00:02:34.330> from<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> lathe<00:02:34.720> is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
distance it sticks out from the lathe is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.020 
distance it sticks out from the lathe is
significant<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.250> way<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.550> overcome

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
significant so the way that I overcome

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.150 
significant so the way that I overcome
that<00:02:37.239> if<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.630> want<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.959> use<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> one-way<00:02:38.470> lathe<00:02:38.680> is

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
that if I want to use a one-way lathe is

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.009 
that if I want to use a one-way lathe is
I<00:02:39.280> bought<00:02:39.459> one<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.670> these<00:02:39.819> quill<00:02:40.209> extenders<00:02:40.780> I

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
I bought one of these quill extenders I

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.540 
I bought one of these quill extenders I
can't<00:02:41.560> remember<00:02:41.709> why<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:41.980> bought<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.489> the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
can't remember why I bought one of the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.370 
can't remember why I bought one of the
online<00:02:42.700> guys<00:02:43.209> woodcraft<00:02:43.780> or<00:02:43.989> someone<00:02:44.260> like

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
online guys woodcraft or someone like

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.949 
online guys woodcraft or someone like
that<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.330> stable<00:02:46.480> number

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
that and this is a more stable number

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.500 
that and this is a more stable number
two<00:02:47.140> goes<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.160> there<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.819> goes<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.239> there<00:02:49.420> I

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
two goes in there that goes in there I

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.240 
two goes in there that goes in there I
guess<00:02:49.720> me<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.110> would<00:02:50.590> actually<00:02:50.890> even<00:02:51.040> further

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
guess me I would actually even further

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.500 
guess me I would actually even further
than<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:51.730> from<00:02:51.880> jean-francois

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
than the one from jean-francois

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.930 
than the one from jean-francois
this<00:02:52.959> works<00:02:53.200> fairly<00:02:53.680> well<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.610> got<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.819> make

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
this works fairly well you got to make

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.220 
this works fairly well you got to make
sure<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.180> clean<00:02:55.450> otherwise<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.959> will<00:02:56.080> get<00:02:56.140> a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
sure it's clean otherwise you will get a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.930 
sure it's clean otherwise you will get a
bit<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.410> wobble<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.430> again<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.760> works

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
bit of wobble to it but again it works

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.400 
bit of wobble to it but again it works
very<00:02:58.090> well<00:02:58.209> for<00:02:58.390> extending<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.019> work<00:02:59.170> out

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
very well for extending the work out

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.740 
very well for extending the work out
past<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:00.400> beauty<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.790> these<00:03:01.090> kind<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.510> cup

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
past the beauty of these kind of cup

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.970 
past the beauty of these kind of cup
centers<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.319> that<00:03:03.010> they<00:03:03.670> have<00:03:04.830> really<00:03:05.830> good

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
centers is that they have really good

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.270 
centers is that they have really good
either

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
either

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.750 
either
is<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.970> because<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.870> design<00:03:08.459> they<00:03:09.459> have

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
is it because of this design they have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.559 
is it because of this design they have
the<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.080> cup<00:03:11.319> will<00:03:11.590> spin<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.849> you<00:03:13.090> get<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.269> catch

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
the the cup will spin if you get a catch

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.050 
the the cup will spin if you get a catch
which<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.560> very<00:03:14.769> good<00:03:14.950> for<00:03:15.160> beginners<00:03:15.250> if

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
which is very good for beginners if

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.430 
which is very good for beginners if
you're<00:03:16.209> teaching<00:03:16.780> someone<00:03:17.230> or<00:03:17.350> you're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
you're teaching someone or you're

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.349

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
underwear it just stops spinning and of

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.380 
underwear it just stops spinning and of
course<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.340> more<00:03:30.459> pressure<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.090> apply<00:03:31.120> with

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
course the more pressure you apply with

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.300 
course the more pressure you apply with
the<00:03:31.569> tailstock<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.560> tighter<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.100> will

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
the tailstock the the tighter it will

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.940 
the tailstock the the tighter it will
grip<00:03:33.609> but<00:03:34.239> for<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.480> most<00:03:34.660> part<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:35.590> works<00:03:35.769> very

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
grip but for the most part it works very

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.530 
grip but for the most part it works very
well<00:03:36.069> for<00:03:36.250> doing<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.880> lot<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.239> spindle

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
well for doing a lot of this spindle

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.720 
well for doing a lot of this spindle
turning<00:03:37.900> because<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.290> doesn't<00:03:38.590> grip<00:03:39.310> really

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
turning because it doesn't grip really

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.039 
turning because it doesn't grip really
really<00:03:39.940> tight<00:03:40.180> when<00:03:40.359> you're<00:03:40.510> learning<00:03:40.690> I

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
really tight when you're learning I

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.690 
really tight when you're learning I
think<00:03:41.470> if<00:03:41.560> you're<00:03:41.680> doing<00:03:41.769> production<00:03:42.190> work<00:03:42.340> or

think if you're doing production work or

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.830 
think if you're doing production work or

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
would use one of these because you don't

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.819 
would use one of these because you don't
want<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.329> don't<00:03:46.510> want<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.750> work<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.470> spin

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
want the you don't want the work to spin

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.800 
want the you don't want the work to spin
