00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everyone again it again it again i 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.120
 now go about living myths right away 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.069
 make a reservation I will not disassemble the myth 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 based on a fantasy clinic moles 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.759
 like a knife to me and my grandfather got them 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.530
 cut nails loosely and then calmly 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.389
 shaved today we'll talk about myths 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.160
 which are widely used difficult 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.810
 police as a provocation from which 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.619
 very convenient to start the divorce of suckers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.619
 therefore, I beg your attention to the myth 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.189
 number 1 reads like this 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.349
 blood flow 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.300
 let's start with macro east 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.759
 is not allowed to use the term 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.730
 synonymous with the term usd about it said 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.739
 terms and definition in clause 6 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 subparagraph 6.1. 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.210
 1.5.1 that is called a longitudinal recess 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 on bare not handled blood flow big 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.730
 big mistake 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.559
 individual king would give and witnesses 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 blood flow on the blade mobus rapture 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 proves what you can call and so 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.020
 so important to interlocutors each other 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.699
 understood in terms of brand histories 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.590
 senior household type diapers 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.969
 copier jeep and so on long 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.350
 there is nothing to talk about such people 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.120
 you just need to take for a cabinet do both 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.489
 Kittens poke nose GOST said 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.500
 inadmissible use of the term about what here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 generally argue the second myth of korra 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.840
 East says that if the blade 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 there is a cow stack a blade is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.009
 with cold arms the legs of a myth grow from 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 long-standing delusion which is essentially 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.150
 is the third world supposedly chrome mouth 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.640
 windows on the same serves to strengthen 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.950
 bleeding and if you stabbed a man 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.049
 did not leave our like I do not see 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.790
 need to simultaneously chew each 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.530
 beasts strong voiced instead i 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.509
 better put forward true to true theses you 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.369
 try to remember him if 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.110
 somebody have a contour of the document a little 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.820
 more likely than I read somewhere on the forum 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.850
 whether as a familiar cop explained 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.799
 welcome in the comments so the term 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.509
 krovostok is a commonplace myth 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.759
 flavored with a touch of thieves 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.170
 romance in fact it's longitudinal 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.030
 notch called dollars 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.009
 it serves solely to facilitate 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.899
 weight of the product and exercise design 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.880
 blade about any hemorrhage enhancement 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.829
 no sane person ever 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 won't talk like that 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.759
 that the presence of gave automatically cools 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.829
 knife but what facilitates dollars 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.670
 removing the blade if you suddenly pinch 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.430
 bones this fact 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.569
 and move on myth number two 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.060
 anatomical handle is a sure sign 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.739
 cold weapons not the most crazy myth 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.000
 however, it is worth a little dripping and from the myth is not 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.010
 will remain stone unturned 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.080
 in the first place you should immediately place two 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.640
 concepts anatomical handle like 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.670
 tailor made individually 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.660
 order for a specific hand of the owner and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.940
 an anatomical arm that just 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.590
 present under the finger grooves so 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.180
 here is an anatomical handle made by 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.250
 individual impression of the ownerâ€™s hand 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.290
 This is an extremely rare occurrence. 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.170
 having nothing to do with the definition 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.920
 cold weapons. 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.330
 anatomical handle which 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.550
 constructively podpaltseva 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.890
 notch knife itself cold steel 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.390
 do not need to clearly understand that 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.250
 structurally laid under the fingers 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.010
 notches of sufficient depth 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.390
 this is just one of the signs 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.040
 cold weapons which should 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.959
 attend simultaneously with 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.880
 other required features and 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.769
 This topic has already discussed if anyone 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.160
 interesting and incomprehensible something here 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.260
 video 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.090
 go further there is a myth that in 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.910
 Russian knives from the bottom of the hand opening 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.530
 adherents of this myth are very fond 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.569
 refer to article number 6 of the law on 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.160
 weapons that recently dismantled if 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.380
 in short, for this article in Russia 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.239
 prohibited frontal miscarriages and butterflies 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.420
 with a blade length of ninety one millimeter 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.549
 and more all folding knives with studs 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.930
 Assistant pockets hooks and flippers 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.940
 no one ever forbade 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.859
 so the myth does not stand simply 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.590
 no criticism in the face of his voice are looking for 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.290
 the right will give a spit on your 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.920
 discretion another world if you tie on 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.380
 lanyard knife 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.060
 then wear this knife can not of course 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.859
 the presence of lanyard calls additional 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.359
 questions if you suddenly became interested 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.030
 the police and you started a heart-to-heart conversation 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.459
 for the knife in your presence however 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.170
 the presence of lanyard in no way 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.959
 affects the implications push cold 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.720
 weapons or prohibited items therefore 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.160
 the myth of a damn is not worth another 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.079
 the myth that if you don't want problems 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.000
 with cops then it is better not to sharpen your knife 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.459
 unfortunately was born my own video that 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.019
 do if the police takes away the knife essence in 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.579
 that if you have enough 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.040
 theoretical and practical knowledge 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.319
 you have the exact system and stones 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.930
 allowing to bring sharpening to the state 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.000
 visually indistinguishable from the factory screw 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.099
 from someone who does not give you but if you have 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.890
 only grandmotherâ€™s sharpened arsenal 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.620
 worse grinding machine god forbid you 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.330
 take up perry . Masha recently 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.760
 Acquired hole junction or cold steel 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.590
 sheep blade spoil it secondly 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.760
 the presence of rough scratches on the blade 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.860
 can really serve as a signal 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.990
 to the policeman that at the worst for 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.610
 perry point you can get to the bottom 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.690
 this is all for today if anyone wishes 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.820
 join permission 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.510
 provocative and delusional myths waiting 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.510
 comment you 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.089
 and through 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.089
 is it a victory 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.190
 workshop 1 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.190
 sia 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.479
 one 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.479
