00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 You must have seen machines already. 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.820
 powerful overclocking 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 to dispute championships reaching brands 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 awesome but even all this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 demonstration of force may not be 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 enough to impress gamers 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 will it be that a video card with 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 overclocking makes a lot of difference in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.170
 time to play 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.390
 the overclocking ronaldo bossa ali came to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 curitiba and in the earth's headquarters byte 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.969
 carried out a comparison to take this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.890
 question once and for all the staff 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.010
 technician was there to follow the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 step by step the result of this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 dispute is what you now gives the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.640
 side of here we have a machine who 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 she has a last generation x 99 card 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.680
 gigabyte gb a game cooled with 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.860
 hydroculture h105 corser is 16 gb of 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 3,200 platinum dominator memory 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 megasex a gtx 480 gala video card 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 offene the source color serna with leftover 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 power for those who did not understand 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.689
 problem on this machine 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.509
 We'll run all the settings. 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.259
 in stock which means inventory of 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.360
 way it was installed on this other 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.850
 side we will have the same system of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.430
 feed everything just right 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.909
 is prepared for extreme overclocking is 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.810
 another mother board loves xv by boss i 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.530
 who will still be released is the memories 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.190
 they are an eco chic hynix m3 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.070
 four hundred megahertz is different and it is 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.740
 the same video card is important 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.080
 tell you that we do not have any 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 record breaking goal 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.580
 we are not going to force the cpu but do not 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.190
 an overclock seeking pet max only knots 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.800
 let's do it for the first time at least 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.270
 that I have knowledge of a machine 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.870
 under these conditions run games 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.630
 so that's what we're going to play more 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.030
 or less research we did and 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.670
 the staff talks a lot and has been coming for a long time 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.400
 Time and only talk like that to us, but this 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.870
 machines shows you see 4 record some 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.420
 thing like that first thing that people 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.459
 see wheel phrases 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.220
 let's see if the machine runs almost 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.560
 first thing the second thing is a game 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.569
 So we see the people asking 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.650
 because I wanted to buy a machine that 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.550
 wheel battlefield 4 to 60fps round to the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.600
 end out 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.060
 Turned, hit very hard, I'll find the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.810
 situation because you what we are 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.959
 making 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.980
 On the other side, I'm going to feed 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.570
 nitrogen the equipment is a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.000
 keep the temperature in thermometers 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.600
 here we have the instruments of 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.109
 measurement and multimeter are 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.079
 jackson is going to come software fit 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.870
 largest of the video card being that I 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.450
 I make a fine adjustment with the team inside and 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 the oxen pots here together 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.430
 with the little panel that we made to 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.820
 stress monitoring 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.160
 so what happens jo on my side 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.400
 this side here he will run everything in 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.739
 stock and / or jackson in here next to go 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.980
 move and overclock the 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.260
 video accelerate her frequency right to 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.959
 extreme overclocking and we will 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.230
 make this comparison is important you 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.170
 to know that we are not interested 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.730
 in a moment today what is now right now 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.670
 I told you we'll have more things 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.790
 professionals 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.390
 will do us side to show 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.670
 for you 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.970
 the maximum maximum but here we go 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.299
 try to keep the processor more or 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.480
 unless almost because the difference 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.829
 other and the video card yes we go 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.829
 want to see a good difference 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600
 ae 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.610
 i 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.760
 ae 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.779
 Thank you very much guys for 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.539
 accompanied us to have the patience of 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:10.300
 to have seen this madness is we have 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:13.300
 there techlab the youtube channel techlab 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.419
 There is also a discussion group that 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.370
 calls extreme pcs and overclock a group 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.740
 from facebook just click on 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.509
 you can enter there where the 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.150
 people commit all these things that the 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:27.129
 Thank you very much to the staff of the 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.259
 Why did the team come to us? 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:32.050
 always given a force to us and even in 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:35.919
 byte that received these crazy people here 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:39.069
 Joe and Jackson to fly these machines 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:41.879
 there soon we voted against videos 

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:41.879
 really worth it 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.260
 there said this is it there
