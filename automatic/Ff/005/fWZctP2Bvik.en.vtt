00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
fortunately one of them is powered right

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.149 
fortunately one of them is powered right
now<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.290> motors<00:01:22.590> burnt<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
now it's the motors burnt out in the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.450 
now it's the motors burnt out in the
second<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> needs<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.210> replaced<00:01:25.460> one

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
second one it needs to be replaced one

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
second one it needs to be replaced one
of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> side<00:01:27.030> effects<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.479> running<00:01:27.810> these

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
of the side effects of running these

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.120 
of the side effects of running these
things<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> time<00:01:28.619> when<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.009> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
things all the time when we have this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.929 
things all the time when we have this
open<00:01:30.000> Alice's<00:01:30.950> then<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> sort<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
open Alice's then we have the sort of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.090 
open Alice's then we have the sort of

think somebody liked it enough to take
it<00:01:59.880> home<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.360> over<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it home with it and then over here to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.060 
it home with it and then over here to
the<00:02:04.079> right<00:02:04.200> you've<00:02:04.320> got<00:02:04.469> kind<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.710> almost<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the right you've got kind of almost a

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
the right you've got kind of almost a
city<00:02:05.340> type<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.329> kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.630> model<00:02:06.899> after

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
city type so this is kind of model after

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
city type so this is kind of model after
typical<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.890> Saigon<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.239> French

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
typical like Saigon you know the French

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
typical like Saigon you know the French
the<00:02:09.840> French<00:02:09.959> Vietnamese<00:02:10.289> architecture<00:02:11.039> all

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
way under the thing or just kind of

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.390 
way under the thing or just kind of
running<00:03:06.910> down<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.360> side<00:03:07.540> yep<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.400> there

and the the cooking the cooking pot

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.319 
and the the cooking the cooking pot
lifts<00:03:15.280> up<00:03:15.430> underneath<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.970> as<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.120> tunnel

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
lifts up underneath it as a tunnel

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.509 
lifts up underneath it as a tunnel
ladder<00:03:16.840> goes<00:03:17.109> down<00:03:17.350> into<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.620> basement<00:03:17.709> or

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
ladder goes down into the basement or

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.309 
ladder goes down into the basement or
into<00:03:18.790> an<00:03:18.910> underground<00:03:19.269> cellar<00:03:19.720> sort<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.109> area

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
into an underground cellar sort of area

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.259 
into an underground cellar sort of area
and<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:21.250> could<00:03:21.400> actually<00:03:21.549> see<00:03:21.940> where<00:03:22.120> there

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
and you could actually see where there

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.660 
and you could actually see where there
is<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.350> green<00:03:23.590> there<00:03:23.859> represents<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.459> water

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
is the green there represents the water

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.690 
is the green there represents the water
so<00:03:24.970> they<00:03:25.420> actually<00:03:25.630> made<00:03:26.049> tunnels<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:27.430> you

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
so they actually made tunnels that you

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.610 
so they actually made tunnels that you
would<00:03:27.790> have<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.150> swim<00:03:28.420> on<00:03:28.600> in<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.109> water<00:03:29.319> and

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
would have to swim on in the water and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.770
