00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 the diet summarizing the eliminate the 4 p 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.450
 the bread the pasta the pasta and the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.700
 desserts chew very slowly 20 minutes 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 because then the center of the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.910
 hunger there is a very nice phrase of gandhi 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.140
 who says chew your drink and drink your 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 food is chewed so much that it remains 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.980
 a liquid in the food and drink 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.340
 chew the so that aunt lynn to that 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.610
 It is in the mouth can increase 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.800
 digestive ability bless the food 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.739
 it's another very good habit I remember you 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.870
 that when I was little our grandmothers my 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.820
 Grandmother grabbed and blessed the food and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.950
 we liked the food better, it's not true 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.890
 because we work without that stress without 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.969
 those nerves if we eat several meals 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.250
 on day 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.430
 much better six small meals and not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.100
 three because the digestive effort is 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.989
 greater and then more calories are spent 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 to digest it you have to have 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.660
 undoubtedly a new mental scheme 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 create that there are other things that exceed 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.649
 simply 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 what are we going to eat that we are going to take and if 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.159
 not that we can say that we are going to read 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.370
 let's hear what we're going to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.850
 talk 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.850
 23 glasses of water fasting are very 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.830
 good record of the size of people 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.530
 two roses at least because they make a 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.850
 Body cleansing gives me very good 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.820
 result in the people who are going to 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.090
 eliminate salt remember that a 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.590
 spoonful of salt are 9 grams 9 grams 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.719
 that has a liter of liquid 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.189
 a liter of liquids a kilo a meal 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.710
 tasty 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.539
 at noon another tasty night and 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.060
 we can be putting our body 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:49.520
 two kilos true and consume the stevia not 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.229
 it's true that it's ours and stevia is 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.479
 extraordinary 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.700
 you will know it is very sweet it is not 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.399
 true in stevia is the best thing that 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.209
 we can be and eliminate the sugar 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.159
 these are schemes that we may have to 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.170
 would help to be able to take a diet 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.729
 slim down 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.679
 we also have the subject of listings 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.319
 the listings are very good listings 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.079
 they are living, unborn cells that are 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.500
 they dry and they give us very good results 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.390
 if to a list we accompany it with points 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.780
 What we can do, for example, is 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.540
 thyroid 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.760
 this one of the hormonal part and the part 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.700
 of the stomach this is the part of 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.800
 cause diuresis of the kidney points 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.660
 headphones there are others in the body that 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.330
 we already explained it is not true with 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.470
 liver and kidney thyroid listings 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.300
 we achieve much better result true 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.720
 undoubtedly that with all this 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.270
 we can walk very well while resting 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.880
 absolute we consume 1200 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.400
 calories that you told me 10 today 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.340
 that will ask me if the 1200 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.170
 migrations calories clear because it's what 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.900
 that we spend rest means that if 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.900
 we consume 1200 calories with 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.959
 that reaches for the consumption that has 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.269
 our body the basic consumption if we 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.480
 we move more then we start there 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.730
 spend the excess that has been left 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.580
 I have a little boring read it not true 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.610
