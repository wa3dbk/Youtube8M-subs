by going to college I just pretty much

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.539 
by going to college I just pretty much
just<00:01:15.030> did<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> drawing<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.860> learned<00:01:17.460> a

just did a lot of drawing and learned a
lot<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.820> stuff<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.119> my<00:01:18.180> own<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.780> got<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
lot of stuff on my own and got to a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
lot of stuff on my own and got to a
point<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.430> people<00:01:20.670> were<00:01:20.970> respected

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
point to where people were respected

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.210

what<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> did<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.290> we're<00:01:22.650> willing<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> pay<00:01:23.100> me

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
money for it so I think that's something

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
money for it so I think that's something
that<00:01:25.770> anybody<00:01:26.130> could<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.700> being<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> successful

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
