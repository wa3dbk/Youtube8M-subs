00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
they're made of from resin you can kind

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
they're made of from resin you can kind
of<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.300> from<00:00:45.329> my<00:00:45.600> primer<00:00:45.870> primer<00:00:46.200> paint<00:00:46.739> chip

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
of see from my primer primer paint chip

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.680 
of see from my primer primer paint chip
there<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.550> resin<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.420> under

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
there that it's resin and the under

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
there that it's resin and the under
spray<00:00:49.370> on<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.730> back<00:00:50.940> um<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> only<00:00:53.190> difference

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
spray on the back um the only difference

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
spray on the back um the only difference
is<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.910> slightly<00:00:54.420> lighter<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> mean<00:00:55.260> it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
is it's slightly lighter but I mean it's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200 
is it's slightly lighter but I mean it's
great<00:00:55.649> quality<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.280> fits<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> heads<00:00:56.910> just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
great quality it fits on the heads just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.330 
great quality it fits on the heads just
fine<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.510> have<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> Celtic<00:01:01.050> bio

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
fine and then you have the Celtic bio

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.709 
fine and then you have the Celtic bio
and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> difference<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and the difference on this is it has the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.170 
and the difference on this is it has the
scars<00:01:04.049> from<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> alien<00:01:05.460> attacked<00:01:05.939> him

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.570 
scars from when the alien attacked him
and<00:01:06.600> cut<00:01:07.320> into<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> mask<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.220> they're<00:01:08.430> right

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and cut into the mask and they're right

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.570 
and cut into the mask and they're right
up<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:09.439> but<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> mean<00:01:10.650> great<00:01:10.890> detail<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.460> can

still<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.750> detail<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
still see all the detail that was in the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.330 
still see all the detail that was in the
original<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> show<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.860> for

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
original and just to show you for

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249 
original and just to show you for
comparison's<00:01:18.210> sake<00:01:18.360> here's<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> original

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
comparison's sake here's the original

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.990 
comparison's sake here's the original
mask<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> only<00:01:20.729> difference

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
mask and really the only difference

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.850 
mask and really the only difference
aside<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.080> having<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> scars

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
aside from not having the scars

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
aside from not having the scars
obviously<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:24.930> these<00:01:25.680> eyes<00:01:26.420> we're<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
obviously is these eyes we're like a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
obviously is these eyes we're like a
translucent<00:01:28.020> plastic<00:01:28.700> now<00:01:29.700> which<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.939> can

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
translucent plastic now which you can

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
translucent plastic now which you can
barely<00:01:30.540> even<00:01:30.750> tell<00:01:31.110> right<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> light

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
barely even tell right now in the light

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.249 
barely even tell right now in the light
but<00:01:33.200> obviously<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.500> reproduction<00:01:35.130> mask<00:01:35.369> is

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
but obviously the reproduction mask is

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.780 
but obviously the reproduction mask is
just<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> solid<00:01:37.710> piece<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.189> I'll<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> paint

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
just a solid piece so I'll have to paint

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.789 
just a solid piece so I'll have to paint
some<00:01:39.030> effect<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> movie

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
some effect in or I think in the movie

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.580 
some effect in or I think in the movie
it<00:01:40.920> was<00:01:41.070> actually<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.670> silver<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.590> I'm

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it was actually just a silver so I'm

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.940 
it was actually just a silver so I'm
gonna<00:01:43.770> paint<00:01:43.979> off<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.369> screen<00:01:44.610> cap<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.950> we'll

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
gonna paint off of a screen cap so we'll

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.300 
gonna paint off of a screen cap so we'll
