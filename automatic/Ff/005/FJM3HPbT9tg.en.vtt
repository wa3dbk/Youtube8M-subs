00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.200
This is what I've used

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.520
10 seconds of silence for my cut nails! :(

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.200
One of my nails was hopelessly broken, so...

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
... I cut off all my nails!!! :(

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.520
I save you the following...

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.200
I file all my nails to level their tips.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.800
I use a metal nail file

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.460
to remove the excesses of filing

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.120
and to round off the nails' corners.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000
With a buffer

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.720
I clean and level

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.600
the nail surface.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.400
Then I wash my hands.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.960
I cut a lemon

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.840
and I "rub" my nails inside it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.240
to white them

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.400
I dip my nails in the lemon juice for a little while!

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.700
I wash my hands again.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.400
I use an oil

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.120
to soft the cuticles.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.280
After I've applied it

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.960
I gently massage my nails.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.700
I wash again my hands!  ^_^

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.400
I use a cuticles pencil

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.800
to soft and remove the cuticles' excesses.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.700
...and I wash my hands!!!

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.520
I apply a strengthening base coat

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.760
And since my nails are short now...

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.720
...I use a growth-stimulating nail polish

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.920
so my nails grow faster!!!

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.560
These are my nails now!!! ^_^
