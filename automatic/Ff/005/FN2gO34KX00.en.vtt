00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.050
 the buses of the integrated system of 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.689
 public transport operator 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.700

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.199
 Cristobal 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.480
 and the only thing we care about is getting to 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.680
 meet to get paid a salary 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.680
 28,000 daily positions 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.210
 very prettily salaries we have a 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.160
 basic of 740 thousand pesos of which 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.070
 we receive a bonus of 300 thousand pesos 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.440
 If you can not come one day for X 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.040
 reason had some problem we discounted 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.630
 280 thousand pesos plus the working day in 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.739
 the case of salaries for example 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.170
 monthly would be 700 42 thousand 300 in 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.670
 this case however in the fortnight not 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.840
 it's not even half way 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:14.640
 they only paid 227 thousand 660 pesos 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.399
 fortnights of 300 of 450 and 480 plus or 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.590
 less are rounded 800 thousand pesos how much 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.259
 it would have to be me I think that as no 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 traditional was 500 million to this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.100
 they added defaults in the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.319

 from 21 in the morning raised 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.400
 exposing everywhere in a mailbox to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.440
 on a bus that is for 30 people 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.440
 We are loading 60 to 70 people 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.110
 They also assured that buses do not 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.780
 the maintenance is done 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.970
 adequate to provide the service and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.810
 this situation is putting at risk 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.810
 the life of the users 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.579
 a fleet was reported by brakes are made 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.400
 those in the media crash and the 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:29.090
 It's the operator's fault if we do not have 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.459
 guarantees vitality that has 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.359
 presenting due to work things 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.359
 by the lords 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.410
 in life we ​​always find 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.160
 transmilenio that is harassing us 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.530
 We have an accident in the workplace 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.470
 life is always the culprit 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.820
 operators for a day do not come are 283 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.660
 a thousand times they are discounting a 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.600
 operator that 's unfair salaries 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.910
 of 740 thousand pesos at 4 o'clock in the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.860
 morning was made present in the place the 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.720
 head of the yard who assured that the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.890
 payments if there was a discount are made 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.890
 as the law indicates 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.420
 they are talking about the part of the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.250
 payroll if only payroll reviews 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.989
 they found that they are doing 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.090
 credits through the fund that are 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.500
 generating discounts and there the company does not 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.120
 they count because they are credits that they 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.040
 they are doing are good savings that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.750
 they are doing but if we get to 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.730
 to pass like this something happens to the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.090
 fleet we crash the blame is the 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.250
 operator 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.470
 before these complaints the drivers 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.300
 they assured that they will not move the vehicles 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.190
 until not reached an agreement with 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.769
 the express consortium operator and 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.989
 Transmilenio in the payment of salaries 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.280
 the maintenance of the buses and the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.280
 compliance schedules
