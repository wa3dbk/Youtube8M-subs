00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
fashion slightly because it lacks the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
ground can go away and forget about so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.200 
ground can go away and forget about so
there<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.509> two<00:01:52.409> ways<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.460> order<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> give<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
there are two ways in order to give it a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.260 
there are two ways in order to give it a
bit<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.570> leg<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.590> leg<00:01:55.890> up<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.490> simply

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
bit of a leg up and leg up one is simply

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.010 
bit of a leg up and leg up one is simply
by<00:01:57.450> by<00:01:57.780> soaking<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.350> seed<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.820> know

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
by by soaking the seed for you know

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.800 
by by soaking the seed for you know
24-48<00:02:01.020> hours<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.560> some

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
24-48 hours in some

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.260 
24-48 hours in some
and<00:02:03.140> then<00:02:03.830> drying<00:02:04.490> drying<00:02:04.790> them<00:02:04.970> off<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> bit

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
and then drying drying them off a bit

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.820 
and then drying drying them off a bit
and<00:02:05.690> then<00:02:05.810> flying<00:02:06.020> about<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.350> does<00:02:06.530> tend<00:02:06.770> to

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
and then flying about it does tend to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.080 
and then flying about it does tend to
make<00:02:06.890> them<00:02:07.070> stick<00:02:07.340> together<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.760> little<00:02:07.880> bit

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
make them stick together a little bit

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.330 
make them stick together a little bit
and<00:02:08.810> I'm<00:02:09.289> making<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.619> bit<00:02:09.740> difficult<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.160> handle

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
and I'm making a bit difficult to handle

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.970 
and I'm making a bit difficult to handle
but<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:11.000> tends<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.630> work<00:02:11.750> quite<00:02:12.140> well

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
but that tends to work quite well

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.550 
but that tends to work quite well
the<00:02:13.340> second<00:02:13.670> way<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.790> do<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.200> which<00:02:15.200> i<00:02:15.319> think<00:02:15.380> is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the second way to do it which i think is

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.170 
the second way to do it which i think is
a<00:02:15.590> bit<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.860> bit<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.190> lazy<00:02:16.459> trick<00:02:16.850> which<00:02:17.150> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
a bit of a bit of a lazy trick which is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.340 
a bit of a bit of a lazy trick which is
good<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.100> take<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.630> module<00:02:20.630> train<00:02:20.900> which

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
good it's to take a module train which

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.770 
good it's to take a module train which
is<00:02:21.459> something<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.880> fill<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.660> with

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
is something like this I fill it with

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.979 
is something like this I fill it with
some<00:02:23.930> good<00:02:24.140> quality<00:02:24.739> seed<00:02:25.580> compost<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.690> then

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
some good quality seed compost and then

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.479 
some good quality seed compost and then
so<00:02:27.739> four<00:02:28.640> or<00:02:28.760> five<00:02:28.970> seeds<00:02:29.380> into<00:02:30.380> each<00:02:30.920> module

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
so four or five seeds into each module

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.760 
so four or five seeds into each module
very<00:02:32.060> gently<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.390> scattering<00:02:32.930> them<00:02:33.050> along<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
very gently of scattering them along the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.550 
very gently of scattering them along the
top<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.880> then<00:02:35.120> what<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.380> take

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
top and then what you do is you take

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.030 
top and then what you do is you take
kettle<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:40.730> water<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:42.440> module<00:02:42.860> tray

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
kettle and you water that module tray

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.070 
kettle and you water that module tray
with<00:02:43.730> some<00:02:43.760> very<00:02:44.150> hot<00:02:44.390> water<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.840> what<00:02:44.930> that

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
with some very hot water and what that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.420 
with some very hot water and what that
does<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.440> gives<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> bit<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.890> steam<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
does is it gives it a bit of steam and a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.180 
does is it gives it a bit of steam and a
bit<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.640> zip<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.989> gets<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.440> seed<00:02:48.800> starchy

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
bit of zip and gets the seed starchy

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.530 
bit of zip and gets the seed starchy
then<00:02:49.370> then<00:02:49.489> cover<00:02:49.700> them<00:02:49.819> plastic<00:02:50.150> bag<00:02:50.300> put

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
then then cover them plastic bag put

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.449 
then then cover them plastic bag put
them<00:02:50.569> on<00:02:50.750> up<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.110> windowsill<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:52.100> then<00:02:52.250> as

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
them on up on a windowsill and then as

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.979 
them on up on a windowsill and then as
the<00:02:52.700> weather<00:02:52.819> warms<00:02:52.940> up<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.450> will<00:02:53.600> bring<00:02:53.750> two

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
the weather warms up you will bring two

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.680 
the weather warms up you will bring two
to<00:02:54.319> bring<00:02:54.620> them<00:02:54.800> out<00:02:54.950> into<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.000> open<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.480> show

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
to bring them out into the open and show

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.740 
to bring them out into the open and show
them<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.230> world<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:58.550> then<00:02:58.940> when<00:02:59.540> they're<00:02:59.660> big

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
them the world and then when they're big

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.330 
them the world and then when they're big
enough<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.500> transplant<00:03:00.980> them<00:03:01.130> very

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
enough you can transplant them very

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.320 
enough you can transplant them very
carefully<00:03:01.700> because<00:03:01.760> they<00:03:01.910> don't<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.239> their

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
carefully because they don't and their

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.300 
carefully because they don't and their
roots<00:03:02.450> mean<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.780> serve<00:03:02.959> too<00:03:03.110> much<00:03:03.260> either<00:03:03.800> into

roots mean to serve too much either into
