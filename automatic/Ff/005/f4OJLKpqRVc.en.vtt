00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
shows that try the CGI thing reboot and

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.759 
shows that try the CGI thing reboot and

beast wars of all things

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.770 
beast wars of all things
reboot<00:02:47.400> had<00:02:47.579> an<00:02:47.670> excuse<00:02:48.060> they<00:02:48.299> perfected<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
reboot had an excuse they perfected the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.259 
reboot had an excuse they perfected the
look<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.049> 1991<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.920> put<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> screen<00:02:50.609> in<00:02:50.760> 94

so<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.109> kind<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:52.560> give<00:02:52.859> it<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.010> pass<00:02:53.250> since<00:02:53.579> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
so I can kind of give it a pass since it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.240
