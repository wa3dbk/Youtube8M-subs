00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.990
 present this latest installation 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.900
 on alfa 159 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.840
 as you can see I have my ipad in my hands 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.660
 mini here we have modified so 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.289
 appropriate to the bridge of the 159 in 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.289
 so you can insert our ipad 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:31.260
 and of course the display is customized 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.850
 of the ipad with the alpha logo we access 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.250
 therefore to any of the activities 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.290
 available on our ipad bringing 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.770
 obviously the audio section on our 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.440
 plant 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:49.170
 for example we launch radio deejay in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.680
 streaming we can listen hello beautiful 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.490
 in live streaming 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.030
 the audio section of the mate of additional ones 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.610
 managed by the parrot asteroid mini for the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.260
 which we have created this support 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.530
 in the area of the glasses holder 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.850
 original alpha so you can 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.470
 properly position the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.400
 picture display under the curtain 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.950
 brings objects of the we placed the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.550
 remote control of the parish priest who allows us 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.320
 to manage the volume and eventually the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.860
 applications attached to the device 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.470
 parrot then what is the phone 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.750
 the usb devices the apple attack 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.780
 etcetera etc. we leave the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.210
 application in the web radio of course 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.820
 through you we will be able to access 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.229
 hundreds more web radio stations 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.950
 that we can obviously choose from 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.950
 menu we can also access ours 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.210
 itunes music library directly 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.830
 from the itunes interface or dall 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.530
 interface that we downloaded 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.600
 that to the macintosh that I like 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.670
 much like graphic layout that there 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.479
 will allow access with an aspect 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.970
 aesthetically pleasing to the content 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.000
 of our music library then 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.240
 we choose the song we want 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.240
 to listen 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:33.900
 and we'll have the death of Jesus one 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.340
 beautiful macintosh platform 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.069
 aesthetically of this moment 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.489
 I know they are characteristic notes seen 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.489
 on TV 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.640
 we can obviously access the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.640
 social platforms as well as the pops 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.450
 manage our e-mail 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.440
 gmail 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.120
 however our mail account 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.460
 electronic we can access to 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.470
 google content 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.330
 looking for what interests us for 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.580
 example the woman's restaurant was 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.920
 the one where he was not familiar with the area 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.080
 we can also enter to manage one 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.530
 navigation platform we have 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.600
 downloaded copilot works offline and there 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.610
 allows to manage 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.680
 obviously the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.270
 car navigation if not there 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.750
 like this application we can 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.660
 of course we can download more 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.170
 also manage google browsing 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.510
 which I should have in here 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.550
 I believe here obviously this provides one 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.270
 network connection to work 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.470
 correctly the difference of that 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.900
 which he had downloaded we can use 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.220
 always connected in the network, even ethical 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.040
 another navigation platform 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.500
 very interesting and interactive 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.209
 there is also from these we have all the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.530
 video content too now I do not but gods 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.450
 video content but we can launch 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.030
 from your free itunes video 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.420
 even movies or 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.930
 access sky go for example look at us 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.510
 maybe parked in front of a customer 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.889
 or waiting for 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.129
 of the girlfriend 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.409
 the game on sky go or simply the 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:30.219
 TV news here of course 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:32.349
 fir connection is required you can 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:36.639
 manage or with the hot spot function of the 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:39.990
 monster phone or with a router 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.509
 portable or possibly choosing the 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.270
 the ipad instead of the wifi version in the 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.969
 phone version which therefore also 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.580
 traffic management 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.069
 here as you have seen created a support 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.159
 for entering my phone 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.930
 in such a way that it is convenient to reach 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:03.509
 of course this guarantees me of course 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.509
 the maintenance of the charge 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.490
 the possibility of managing therefore the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.860
 phone activity without having to 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.349
 that is, to work without having to take it 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.759
 then in charge in position 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.870
 appropriate to manage its contents 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.539
 while we look at our own 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.940
 sky or rather rita newscast 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:28.860
 animated stores by per fatic depending on the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.259
 personal tastes of work in short is 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.259
 needless to say that a platform of 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.720
 this kind allows you to manage 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:39.539
 comfortably any activity 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.210
 subordinate to entertainment or to 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.960
 guide with an aesthetic introduction of 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.780
