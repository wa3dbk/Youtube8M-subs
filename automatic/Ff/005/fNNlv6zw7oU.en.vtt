00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
as a result the usual technology

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.610 
as a result the usual technology
advancements<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.209> were<00:02:51.299> used<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.659> seeing<00:02:51.959> in

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
modern day technology like weaponry etc

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.899 
modern day technology like weaponry etc
has<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.200> come<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> complete<00:02:55.950> stop<00:02:56.400> so

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
has just come to a complete stop so

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.300 
has just come to a complete stop so
although<00:02:57.060> say<00:02:57.690> twenty<00:02:58.319> thirty<00:02:58.560> forty<00:02:58.889> years

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
although say twenty thirty forty years

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.099 
although say twenty thirty forty years
as<00:02:59.549> an<00:02:59.639> advanced<00:03:00.120> we're<00:03:00.480> still<00:03:00.690> only<00:03:00.840> using

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
as an advanced we're still only using

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.660 
as an advanced we're still only using
the<00:03:01.349> weaponry<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.889> was<00:03:02.220> currently

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the weaponry that was currently

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.660 
the weaponry that was currently
available<00:03:02.940> at<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:04.109> sort<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.590> time<00:03:04.889> period<00:03:05.400> so

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
available at this sort of time period so

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.309 
available at this sort of time period so
that's<00:03:05.819> why<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.030> theory<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.569> using<00:03:06.900> current

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
that's why the theory of using current

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.080 
that's why the theory of using current
day<00:03:07.470> weaponry<00:03:08.040> within<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> future<00:03:08.849> could

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
day weaponry within the future could

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.539 
day weaponry within the future could
work<00:03:09.359> very<00:03:09.780> very<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.079> with<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.799> whole<00:03:10.859> post

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
because of how similar their names are

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.770 
because of how similar their names are

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
have been pointing out that apparently

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.750 
have been pointing out that apparently
he<00:03:37.260> didn't<00:03:37.590> die<00:03:37.739> within<00:03:38.099> modern<00:03:38.370> warfare<00:03:38.549> 2

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
he didn't die within modern warfare 2

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.659 
he didn't die within modern warfare 2
apparently<00:03:39.690> he<00:03:39.780> was<00:03:39.989> shot<00:03:40.199> in<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.379> shoulder

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
apparently he was shot in the shoulder

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.920 
apparently he was shot in the shoulder
apparently<00:03:41.669> he<00:03:41.879> wasn't<00:03:42.150> covered<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.569> gasoline

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
apparently he wasn't covered in gasoline

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.839 
apparently he wasn't covered in gasoline
when<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.410> character<00:03:43.829> was<00:03:43.859> burnt<00:03:44.250> he<00:03:44.730> was

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
when the character was burnt he was

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.520 
when the character was burnt he was
wearing<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.150> fireproof<00:03:45.540> jacket<00:03:46.169> so<00:03:46.319> there's<00:03:46.470> a

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
wearing a fireproof jacket so there's a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.439 
wearing a fireproof jacket so there's a
possibility<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.459> he's<00:03:47.609> still<00:03:47.879> alive<00:03:48.000> and

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
possibility that he's still alive and

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.300 
possibility that he's still alive and
the<00:03:48.900> interesting<00:03:49.349> thing<00:03:49.379> is<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.949> that<00:03:50.160> there

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
the interesting thing is is that there

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.400 
the interesting thing is is that there
was<00:03:50.400> actually<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.790> comic<00:03:51.209> book<00:03:51.239> called<00:03:51.930> modern

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
again has to be set in the future which

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.250

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
again links back into the scenario and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.659 
again links back into the scenario and
situations<00:04:19.859> I've<00:04:20.130> been<00:04:20.310> talking<00:04:20.609> about

that<00:04:23.130> he's<00:04:23.669> not<00:04:23.700> alive<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.330> think<00:04:24.539> he's<00:04:24.990> just

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
that he's not alive I think he's just

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.900 
that he's not alive I think he's just
going<00:04:25.349> to<00:04:25.409> be<00:04:25.500> some<00:04:25.740> sort<00:04:25.889> of<00:04:25.919> hero<00:04:26.250> or<00:04:26.550> inspir
