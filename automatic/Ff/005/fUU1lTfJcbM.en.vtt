I mentioned before it's optic and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.190 
I mentioned before it's optic and
basically<00:02:17.390> where<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.660> get<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:17.989> press<00:02:18.170> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
basically where you get when you press a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.710 
basically where you get when you press a
button<00:02:19.209> don't<00:02:20.209> know<00:02:20.269> whether<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.510> pick

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
button don't know whether you can pick

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.690 
button don't know whether you can pick
that<00:02:20.750> noise<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.500> very<00:02:21.590> quiet<00:02:21.980> but<00:02:22.129> you're

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
that noise up it's very quiet but you're

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.060

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
actually amazed by because doesn't like

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.059 
actually amazed by because doesn't like
small<00:03:03.700> devices<00:03:04.030> but<00:03:04.390> i<00:03:04.870> think<00:03:05.350> one<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
small devices but i think one of the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.380 
small devices but i think one of the
best<00:03:06.310> things<00:03:06.520> about<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:06.850> device<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.360> that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
best things about this device is that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.610 
best things about this device is that
it's<00:03:07.690> caused<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> 5<00:03:08.740> inch<00:03:09.390> vertical

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
it's caused a 5 inch vertical

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.080 
it's caused a 5 inch vertical
corner-to-corner<00:03:11.620> diagonal<00:03:12.490> screen<00:03:12.700> and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
corner-to-corner diagonal screen and

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.870 
corner-to-corner diagonal screen and
it's<00:03:13.690> very<00:03:13.959> very<00:03:14.170> easy<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.560> see<00:03:14.740> reuse<00:03:15.100> so<00:03:15.850> i

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
it's very very easy to see reuse so i

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.190 
it's very very easy to see reuse so i
think<00:03:16.120> that's<00:03:16.270> one<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.630> benefits<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:17.080> this

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
think that's one of the benefits of this

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.729 
think that's one of the benefits of this
device<00:03:18.180> another<00:03:19.180> thing<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.630> feature<00:03:19.840> it

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
device another thing that a feature it

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.610 
device another thing that a feature it
has<00:03:20.800> opera<00:03:21.550> mobile<00:03:21.760> 9.5<00:03:22.660> little<00:03:23.170> internist

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
has opera mobile 9.5 little internist

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.380 
has opera mobile 9.5 little internist
and<00:03:24.930> after<00:03:25.930> say<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:27.190> really<00:03:27.760> really<00:03:28.150> works

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
and after say it really really works

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.360 
and after say it really really works
well<00:03:28.570> on<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.870> device<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.500> think<00:03:30.220> that's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
well on this device I think that's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.690 
well on this device I think that's
because<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.850> size<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.300> screen<00:03:31.390> it

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
because of the size of the screen it

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.740 
because of the size of the screen it
because<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.790> use<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.150> with<00:03:34.300> mobile<00:03:34.600> on<00:03:34.660> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
because I use up with mobile on the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.440 
because I use up with mobile on the
diamond<00:03:35.140> draft<00:03:35.610> wasn't<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.670> bad<00:03:37.030> experience

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
diamond draft wasn't a bad experience

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.540 
diamond draft wasn't a bad experience
but<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.050> was<00:03:38.170> nowhere<00:03:38.500> near<00:03:38.560> as<00:03:38.890> enjoyable<00:03:39.519> as

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
but it was nowhere near as enjoyable as

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.690 
but it was nowhere near as enjoyable as
this<00:03:39.880> experience<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:41.680> just<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.190> easy<00:03:42.220> to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
this experience it's just so easy to

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.320
