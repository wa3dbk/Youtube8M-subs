up<00:00:47.040> there<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.309> been<00:00:48.210> thinking<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.890> all<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
up there I been thinking about all the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.830 
up there I been thinking about all the
different<00:00:50.430> RV<00:00:50.879> parks<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.360> I've<00:00:51.449> stayed<00:00:51.809> at

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
different RV parks that I've stayed at

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
different RV parks that I've stayed at
especially<00:00:52.589> this<00:00:52.710> season<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.370> even<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.910> other

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
especially this season and even in other

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.130 
especially this season and even in other
times<00:00:54.330> with<00:00:54.540> other<00:00:54.660> people

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
times with other people

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380 
times with other people
and<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.860> determined<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.460> there<00:00:56.670> are<00:00:56.730> two

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and I have determined that there are two

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.889 
and I have determined that there are two
and<00:00:57.690> only<00:00:57.989> two<00:00:58.230> kinds<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> RV<00:00:59.610> parks<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.210> two

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and only two kinds of RV parks and two

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.290 
and only two kinds of RV parks and two
and<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.320> guess<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:01.980> only<00:01:02.250> kinds<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> our<00:01:02.940> beers

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and I guess two only kinds of our beers

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.120 
and I guess two only kinds of our beers
and<00:01:04.259> uh<00:01:04.729> what<00:01:05.729> boils<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.830> ever<00:01:07.979> go

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and uh what boils down to is you ever go

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
and uh what boils down to is you ever go
to<00:01:08.160> an<00:01:08.310> RV<00:01:08.460> park<00:01:08.580> where<00:01:09.000> nobody<00:01:09.750> talks<00:01:10.619> to
