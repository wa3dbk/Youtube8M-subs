 raised the trophy 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:25.369

 supporters alessandro moggi may 1996 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.300

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.660
 rome olympic I was in the final of 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.660
 the league of champions 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 I remember I was 16 years old 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 at the time before I was in high school 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.839
 I went to see the match with my father 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.040
 was born in mios not address my friends what 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.969
 she had found the league of 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.989
 champions after a long absence 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.079
 she had all the players to do 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.260
 a great team there was great 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.890
 champions but despite that we had a little 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.030
 afraid of the ajax who were the favorites 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.300
 with players like the twins of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.679
 boer finidi george and canon cmos 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.009
 the atmosphere was electric we play a 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.600
 very important match against a big 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.310
 European team the most match 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.700
 important to leave in volume for the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700
 30th 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.760
 score very fast by ravanelli in a 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.400
 impossible angle 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:46.240
 after a misunderstanding between frank de boer 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:49.660
 and make the fans explode on 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.650
 started singing and jumping everywhere 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:02:00.810
 like fools of allah I remember 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.810
 very good of the litmanen equalization 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.229
 peru 10 pledges to points instead of 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.729
 capture the balloon 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:13.209
 it happens directly on hitman she 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.590
 which marks easily but despite that we 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:22.330
 did not lose hope 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:24.370
 the news continued to attack then 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.270
 it ended on penalties and that 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.220
 it's obviously the lottery we do not 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.200
 could not breathe but I could see 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.870
 although the team but absolutely win 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.440
 the first failure of science is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.440
 for edgar davids 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:48.150
 then we did not miss anything we marked 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:50.280
 especially shoot us it was easy I get 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.580
 remember the hug between ferrara and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.790
 vialli vialli do not want to watch the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:07.530
 decisive penalty new bobitch devich a 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:10.019
 marked fell to the ground it was a 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.849
 magic evening for the eyes a flea and 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.930
 for players 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:22.819
 he was crying like babies some 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.819
 were sli like di livio manelli 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.710
 it was incredible images these are 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:37.880
 irrational emotions that make the 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:41.020
 football a sport as beautiful champion 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.020
 of Europe 1996
