thing<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> Box<00:02:04.680> mentions<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
thing that the Box mentions is that it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.059 
thing that the Box mentions is that it
has<00:02:06.030> Liquipel<00:02:06.659> protection<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.860> actual

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
has Liquipel protection so the actual

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
has Liquipel protection so the actual
electronic<00:02:08.910> parts<00:02:09.270> inside<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.899> ear<00:02:10.020> buds<00:02:10.229> are

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
electronic parts inside the ear buds are

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.809 
electronic parts inside the ear buds are
protected<00:02:11.430> by<00:02:11.459> Liquipel<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.360> you're

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
protected by Liquipel so if you're

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.459 
protected by Liquipel so if you're
out<00:02:12.879> being<00:02:13.180> active<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.749> you're<00:02:13.959> sweating

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
out being active and you're sweating

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.280 
out being active and you're sweating
it's<00:02:15.370> not<00:02:15.609> going<00:02:15.999> to<00:02:16.150> seep<00:02:16.510> into<00:02:16.719> the<00:02:16.870> earbuds

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
it's not going to seep into the earbuds

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.640 
it's not going to seep into the earbuds
and<00:02:17.499> cause<00:02:18.249> any<00:02:18.790> kind<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.209> damage<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
and cause any kind of damage to the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.369 
and cause any kind of damage to the
device<00:02:20.859> itself<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.519> sweat<00:02:21.999> in<00:02:22.299> moisture<00:02:22.989> is

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
device itself so sweat in moisture is

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.860 
device itself so sweat in moisture is
actually<00:02:24.040> one<00:02:24.219> thing<00:02:24.249> to<00:02:24.670> consider<00:02:24.870> whenever

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
actually one thing to consider whenever

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.509 
actually one thing to consider whenever
you're<00:02:25.989> looking<00:02:26.170> at<00:02:26.469> active<00:02:26.950> earbuds<00:02:27.310> like

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
you're looking at active earbuds like

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.059 
you're looking at active earbuds like
this<00:02:27.790> these<00:02:28.269> are<00:02:28.420> Liquipel<00:02:28.959> protected<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.010> you

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
this these are Liquipel protected so you

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.020 
this these are Liquipel protected so you
really<00:02:30.250> don't<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.579> worry<00:02:30.819> about<00:02:30.909> that

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
really don't have to worry about that

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.270 
really don't have to worry about that
moisture<00:02:31.689> when<00:02:31.900> you're<00:02:32.049> being<00:02:32.409> active<00:02:32.950> okay

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
moisture when you're being active okay

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.559 
moisture when you're being active okay
so<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.969> idea<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.329> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
so I really like the idea of the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.690 
so I really like the idea of the
carrying<00:02:34.900> case<00:02:35.079> it's<00:02:35.409> just<00:02:36.040> an<00:02:36.159> added<00:02:36.400> bonus

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
carrying case it's just an added bonus

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.050 
carrying case it's just an added bonus
feature<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.620> anyhow<00:02:38.919> it<00:02:39.129> houses<00:02:39.489> your

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
feature here but anyhow it houses your

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.080 
feature here but anyhow it houses your
earbuds<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:42.040> safekeeping<00:02:42.730> when<00:02:42.879> you're<00:02:42.999> not
