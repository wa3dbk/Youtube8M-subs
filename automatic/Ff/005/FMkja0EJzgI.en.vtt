there's<00:02:23.349> no<00:02:23.470> lumps<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:24.069> mix<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.209> well

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.229

I have mine I don't exactly know the
wattage<00:02:47.859> sim<00:02:48.129> so<00:02:48.280> I'm<00:02:48.340> sorry<00:02:48.640> it's<00:02:49.209> on<00:02:49.450> high

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
wattage sim so I'm sorry it's on high

power level ten and I just microwave

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.640 
power level ten and I just microwave
mine<00:02:54.099> for<00:02:54.549> three<00:02:55.150> minutes<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:56.379> is<00:02:56.500> what

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
mine for three minutes and this is what

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.800 
mine for three minutes and this is what
it<00:02:56.739> looks<00:02:56.950> like<00:02:57.129> after<00:02:57.639> three<00:02:57.879> minutes<00:02:58.180> this

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
it looks like after three minutes this

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.270 
it looks like after three minutes this
is<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.109> point<00:02:59.349> where<00:02:59.530> I'm<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.769> take<00:03:00.010> my

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
is the point where I'm going to take my

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.280 
is the point where I'm going to take my
food<00:03:00.519> coloring<00:03:00.969> and<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.689> food<00:03:01.870> coloring<00:03:02.079> I'm

food coloring and the food coloring I'm

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.129 
food coloring and the food coloring I'm
using<00:03:02.469> is<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.769> gel<00:03:03.189> so<00:03:03.939> you<00:03:03.969> only<00:03:04.389> need<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
using is a gel so you only need the

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.000 
using is a gel so you only need the
smallest<00:03:05.650> smallest<00:03:06.129> amount<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.090> stuff

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
smallest smallest amount of this stuff

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.170

the<00:03:09.010> batch<00:03:09.129> I<00:03:09.310> did<00:03:09.459> before<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:09.879> I<00:03:10.060> actually

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
the batch I did before this I actually

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.179 
the batch I did before this I actually
scored<00:03:10.659> it<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.840> lot<00:03:11.169> more<00:03:11.439> and<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.799> just<00:03:12.010> turned

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
scored it a lot more and it just turned

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.449 
scored it a lot more and it just turned
into<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.540> bright<00:03:13.540> bright<00:03:14.079> obnoxious<00:03:14.889> neon<00:03:15.220> pink

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
into a bright bright obnoxious neon pink

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.210 
into a bright bright obnoxious neon pink
which<00:03:15.760> almost<00:03:16.659> was<00:03:16.840> not<00:03:17.439> edible<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:18.099> by

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
which almost was not edible just by

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.789 
which almost was not edible just by
looking<00:03:18.519> at<00:03:18.639> it<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.629> I'm<00:03:19.870> just<00:03:20.049> taking<00:03:20.169> one

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
looking at it so I'm just taking one

looking at it so I'm just taking one
small<00:03:21.400> little<00:03:21.669> drop<00:03:21.969> as<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.780> can<00:03:22.930> see<00:03:23.079> I'm

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
small little drop as you can see I'm

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.530 
small little drop as you can see I'm
placing<00:03:23.439> it<00:03:23.620> on<00:03:23.799> my<00:03:23.950> fork<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.459> then<00:03:25.359> I'm<00:03:25.510> just

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
placing it on my fork and then I'm just

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.089 
placing it on my fork and then I'm just
going<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.959> place<00:03:26.139> this<00:03:26.319> right<00:03:26.439> in<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.769> center

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
going to place this right in the center

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.349 
going to place this right in the center
which<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.370> usually<00:03:27.849> where<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.180> liquid

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
which is usually where the liquid

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.530 
which is usually where the liquid
accumulates<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.790> I'm<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:30.939> going<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> stir

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
accumulates and I'm just going to stir

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.379 
accumulates and I'm just going to stir
this<00:03:31.750> all<00:03:31.959> up<00:03:32.200> until<00:03:32.439> it<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.969> even

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
this all up until it is one even

consistency

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.440 

and<00:03:43.439> it<00:03:44.129> starts<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.609> look<00:03:44.640> like<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.969> really<00:03:45.239> pale

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
and it starts to look like a really pale

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.449 
and it starts to look like a really pale
pink<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.200> you're<00:03:46.980> gonna<00:03:47.069> stick<00:03:47.370> this

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
pink like this you're gonna stick this

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.489 
pink like this you're gonna stick this
back<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.849> your<00:03:47.879> microwave<00:03:48.239> again<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:49.349> the

same amount of time anywhere between two

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.360 
same amount of time anywhere between two
to<00:03:51.150> three<00:03:51.269> minutes<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:52.139> I<00:03:52.170> place<00:03:52.469> mine<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
to three minutes so I place mine in the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.330 
to three minutes so I place mine in the
microwave<00:03:53.459> for<00:03:53.760> three<00:03:54.150> minutes<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:55.340> while

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
microwave for three minutes and while

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.399 
microwave for three minutes and while
that<00:03:56.519> was<00:03:56.639> in<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.819> microwave<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.389> just<00:03:57.599> poured

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
that was in the microwave I just poured

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.890 
that was in the microwave I just poured
out<00:03:58.530> some<00:03:58.859> of<00:03:58.950> my<00:03:58.980> cornstarch<00:03:59.519> onto<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> surface

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
out some of my cornstarch onto a surface

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.929 
out some of my cornstarch onto a surface
and<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.799> actually<00:04:02.099> lined<00:04:02.280> my<00:04:02.430> surface<00:04:02.790> with

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
and I actually lined my surface with

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.149 
and I actually lined my surface with
parchment<00:04:03.180> paper<00:04:03.359> it's<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.530> know<00:04:04.620> easier<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
parchment paper it's you know easier to

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.550 
parchment paper it's you know easier to
clean<00:04:05.340> up<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:06.359> I'm<00:04:06.689> just<00:04:06.719> spreading<00:04:07.079> out<00:04:07.319> all

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
clean up so I'm just spreading out all

clean up so I'm just spreading out all
of<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.859> cornstarch<00:04:08.329> so<00:04:09.329> that<00:04:09.510> way<00:04:09.719> when<00:04:10.109> I

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
of the cornstarch so that way when I

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.190 
of the cornstarch so that way when I
grab<00:04:10.919> my<00:04:10.950> bowl<00:04:11.400> from<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.760> microwave<00:04:12.120> I'll<00:04:12.629> be

all prepared and this is what your mochi

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.089 
all prepared and this is what your mochi
should<00:04:15.930> look<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:16.139> after<00:04:16.709> two<00:04:16.919> passes

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
should look like after two passes

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.009 
should look like after two passes
through<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.759> microwave<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.509> should<00:04:18.870> be<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
through the microwave it should be a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.560 
through the microwave it should be a
little<00:04:19.229> bit<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:20.820> should<00:04:20.849> be<00:04:21.120> able<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.269> see

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
little bit you should be able to see

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.020 
little bit you should be able to see
through<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.199> a<00:04:22.289> little<00:04:22.440> bit<00:04:22.650> not<00:04:23.220> too<00:04:23.430> much<00:04:23.460> but

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
through it a little bit not too much but

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.150 
through it a little bit not too much but
it<00:04:24.960> just<00:04:25.020> has<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.320> really<00:04:25.500> sticky<00:04:25.949> consistency

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
it just has a really sticky consistency

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.540 
it just has a really sticky consistency
and<00:04:26.880> now<00:04:26.910> be<00:04:27.360> careful<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:28.199> is<00:04:28.440> extremely<00:04:29.310> hot

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550

way you store this is just store it in

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.769 
way you store this is just store it in
an<00:06:19.509> airtight<00:06:19.689> container<00:06:19.929> and<00:06:21.089> place<00:06:22.089> it<00:06:22.359> in<00:06:22.509> a

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
cupboard would be fine and it should

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.019 
cupboard would be fine and it should
