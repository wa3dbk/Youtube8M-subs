00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.769
 good as promised is debt today 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.469
 we will continue to see environments at home 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.360
 with there are two good ecological proposals 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.469
 interesting and good many other things 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.469
 more come with me 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.199
 to 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.530
 It is so shocking 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.939
 everything classic and contemporary 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.970
 when this responsibility frame if 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.420
 well this year we opted for good in this 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.860
 large space the initial concept was 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.530
 create a very natural space where 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.860
 we can house through this 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.540
 giant sculpture 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.540
 the two shamrock projects 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.540
 a garden square already with certain 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.820
 products 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.790
 and technified just for the subject 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.790
 of the cultivation of legumes vegetables 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.880
 materials in this space are friendly 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.020
 with the environment are technologies 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.420
 green developed for 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.800
 construction tell me why this 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.350
 product is a new product is not 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.340
 true is a wood this is called 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.980
 wood plastic is an agglomerate of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.190
 recycled plastic and wood receive 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.740
 a way let's say wood that has been 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.980
 cut let's say mounts that are going to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.320
 reforest then serve as inputs 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.780
 all this, let's say junk garbage 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.240
 those materials that we use them and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.760
 now here in Peru to make this 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.150
 material that has an appearance of 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.150
 wood 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.550
 it is a difficult space not 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.490
 good the ecological laundry good 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.130
 try to make a very cool environment not 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.280
 trying to respect the house I've 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.910
 used all this structure in mdf 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.310
 which is prefabricated 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.700
 and the interesting thing good 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.560
 prefabrication is that let's say saving 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.660
 of energy not apart from the fact of using 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.670
 agglomerates is also helps you a lot 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.260
 when the wood itself completely 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.020
 but you use all the chips that 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 There are no more than larger pieces of 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.100
 wood to arm I do not speak I give to others 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.990
 somehow that also helps without 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.910
 doubt in the ecology on this floor is the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.340
 floor that I had draw against if this 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.260
 is the existing floor of the house because 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.030
 it was already a patio was raised as a fax 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.740
 and it was already raised as a patio is a 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.910
 open space 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.550
 I'm not taking advantage of all the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.640
 ventilation natural lighting I'm 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.330
 using lighting LEDs which is a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.860
 lighting that saves energy not 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.490
 pollutes when disposing of 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.360
 spotlights 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.480
 then the furniture that without plating with 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.480
 recycled woods 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.200
 and that has given importance to the point 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.030
 central to the laundry equipment that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.959
 I imagine that also at the same time 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.959
 they have the whole subject of saving 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.820
 and well the painting is also a 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.880
 ecological painting that yes that is a 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.500
 paint that is called ecogreen that repels 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.480
 in addition the contamination or this is 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.700
 paint we have used it in tunnels of 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.270
 Europe to reduce the issue of 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.270
 pollution 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.239
 and me
