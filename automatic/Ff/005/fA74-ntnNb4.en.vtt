 but it must have been a 6th cm2 but good 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.940
 it's really a laptop really 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.910
 basic 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.380
 in fact it's an English laptop when 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.480
 you have to actually always reload 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.380
 when we are going to try credit in fact 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.760
 it was not a it's not it's not everything 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.160
 the world had to pay finally 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.170
 and it costs me about 10 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.239
 cents per sms is an english mobile 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.380
 I had to rode buses that taxes they 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.780
 know he has broken himself and men 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.720
 young and alcatel is celebrating with the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.640
 keyboard that comes out and you are you to croak your 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.080
 portable 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.870
 frankly no at first I was 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.640
 really addicted what kind I sent 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.420
 daily sms every day 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.850
 every day 24 hours a day 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.560
 sorry but in brilliant but 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.019
 now we make a subject sends when 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.959
 he put himself on the days but hey I 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.600
 see when I lead her with me when I 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.019
 go out and suddenly blow that's it I have not everything 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.760
 we prefer to kill sms or talk 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.560
 directly at his own expense 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.120
 when I will be best friend I like 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.440
 speak directly because we have 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.850
 many things to say in principle 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.000
 so tests but that's it takes too much 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.709
 a long time and then again that's when they 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.900
 dispense say something quick bar and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.100
 his threat 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.799
 since when did you have your current mobile 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.709
 so this one I him at Christmas so Christmas 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:38.650
 2011 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:40.959
 so that's mathieu so I'm 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.930
 boring have you ever been shocked and to 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:49.810
 current laptops yes but not in progress 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.269
 actually because I actually turn it off 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.350
 downright in progress but it was at the 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.400
 recess you i had it game 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.780
 I went to see something on the internet 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.820
 or in what not and I was stuck with 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.780
 but hey, we do not want anything so 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:08.520
 it was not serious acquired already broken 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.540
 by sms will not only change nothing what 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.630
 is your mobile 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.330
 finally, what is the portal of your dreams 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:20.370
 bar years is good of his cows 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:22.890
 yes ok iphone but I already have the ipad and 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.380
 my iPad down I thought it home 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.270
 welcomed me girl and I find that 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.580
 really makes the iPad I use 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.020
 more than my comfortable ipad but 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.870
 I love blackberries because I love 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.250
 the keyboard and blackberry it's more 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.470
 solid than iphone because iphone 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.060
 I would be too scared to bring him into the 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.180
 pocket because it's antwerp is or is not 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.010
 but I would be too scared of myself and 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.870
 frankly I find that as I have my 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:51.530
 ipad at home is largely sufficient 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.530
 and then here are the blackberry I love 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.540
 so here I think it's all a 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.490
 that was really a blow to a pack 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.500
 very very short so if you have 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.720
 other talented range proposed 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.220
 do not hesitate because it's funny 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.560
 to do that one 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.010
 So here we are and see you soon 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.010
 bye
