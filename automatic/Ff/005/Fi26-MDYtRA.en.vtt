00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.670
 it is already here we have already been able to prove 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
 a nintendo 3ds in depth in the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.600
 Writing know that ye are many 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.520
 that you have doubts about this machine 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 yes it is a new console that will replace 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.500
 the others or if it is simply about 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.300
 a review today is impossible 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.220
 know it meanwhile it is convenient to know 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.050
 the characteristics of a machine that 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.700
 we have been enthusiastic about its design and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.700
 news we are going for them 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 some of the great changes come 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.590
 given by the design in particular because 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.629
 It is changed the arrangement of certain 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.489
 buttons the home button stays on 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.010
 lonely in the front while 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.840
 that the start and select buttons stay 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.730
 to one of the sides of the console the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.230
 volume slider also changes its 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 place to be placed in the part of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 up something that you want to avoid going down and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
 turn up the volume by accident then 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.210
 we have the entry for the cartridge and the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 touch pen but the biggest change without 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.229
 doubt is in the power button and it is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.850
 important because we will not have to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.940
 open the console to turn it on and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.940
 turn it off 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.630
 all these small changes help 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.610
 that nintendo 3ds wins in a matter of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.799
 details however the best comes by 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.659
 part of the new buttons the new 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.240
 right stick is actually a small 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.530
 rigid button that although it does not seem 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.509
 responds quite accurately to the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.880
 thumb placement by testing it with 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.079
 games like monster hunter 4 the truth 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 is that there is a huge difference 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.969
 between playing with or without him then there are the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.530
 new top triggers that are not 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.270
 analogical but that mainly 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 come to fulfill the role of the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 sliding button triggers pro a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.569
 as the effect has passed the time 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.520
 stereoscopic has ceased to be the vessel 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.409
 badge of this machine but we counted 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.959
 with good news for this review 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.360
 the 3d effect is improved and now it's very 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.369
 difficult to lose it as it has been done now 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.560
 the console detects our face and follows 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.540
 our movements so that the 3d 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.459
 It adapts to our position in time 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.920
 real we really have a wide margin 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.870
 to move or rotate the console such is 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.299
 the margin that a partner or friend can 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.069
 lean out to see the 3d something else 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.840
 interesting is that the screens have 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 changed by others that present a 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.950
 better contrast and representation of 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.900
 colors the brightness is very 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.370
 similar only that we now have a 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.019
 automatic brightness option that to 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.000
 we particularly have not 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.780
 seemed imperative but not bad 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.780
 that they have put it 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.870
 There is some concern about the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.760
 fact that new nintendo 3ds has a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.290
 greater process capacity has been 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.930
 announced that it will have an exclusive game 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.880
 xenoblade chronicles but for the moment 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.130
 is the only thing we know for you 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.170
 make an idea neither majora's mask nor 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.420
 monster hunter 4 have advantages 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.070
 graphs in this console what yes it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.110
 note is that the loading screens are 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.090
 shorter and that in general the console 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.070
 moves with greater ease through the menus 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.710
 here we have done a test to see what 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.710
 it takes a long time to load the isaf there is a world 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.940
 this has to do with power but 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.470
 also with that the console carries some 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.810
 type of improvement that allows 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.610
 downloads go faster the browser 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.560
 It is more fluid and now we will not be late 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.930
 both in lowering certain games 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.850
 titles like monster hunter 4 improve their 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.250
 online because of this improvement in 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.050
 definitive this greater power beyond 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.850
 of what is used in the future for games 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.860
 exclusive that we do not know 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.860
 generates a better overall experience 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.290
 ah 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.750
 we reached one of the most 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.269
 interesting question suits me the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
 normal version or the xl one of the things 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.010
 that draw attention to this review 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.090
 It is the new most stylized design 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.459
 adapted to the new times 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.220
 nintendo maintains the line to draw a 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.900
 normal version and another xl here comes in 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.610
 within the taste of each one to choose what 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.190
 what's best for you just have to have 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.079
 some things in mind if you want the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.730
 normal version tell you that it is the only 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.920
 that comes with the buttons style 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.780
 super nintendo another question are the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.849
 exclusive covers also for this 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.650
 Size allowing to customize our 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.900
 console with several designs that are 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.780
 interchangeable may be the option 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.190
 ideal if you play outside the house there is also 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.110
 have to say that their screens are 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.750
 slightly larger than those of the 3ds 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.400
 normal if you decide that the big version 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.250
 It is yours to tell you that we have 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.350
 compared to the 3ds xl normal and this 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.720
 new machine is even more bulky 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.550
 it also weighs less and has some 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.590
 screens that are surely the best 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.360
 option for those who are used to 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.810
 take many hours in a row in front of the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.810
 console 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.750
 there are many improvements hidden in this 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.640
 new platform the battery lasts longer and 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.760
 there are other additions like the reader 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.830
 nfc to use our friends too 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.840
 We have the new camera that has the biggest 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.030
 quality but something had to 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.470
 fail and we in particular do not 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.120
 he liked that you have to take a 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.880
 screwdriver to access the new 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.700
 micro SD card which has 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.740
 a capacity of 4 gigas could also 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.780
 be criticized the fact that it does not come 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.610
 with the included charger then we have 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:24.460
 the file transfer system 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:26.020
 which is still very confusing surely 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.670
 Now what you are asking is 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.800
 if it's worth it or not this new 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.510
 platform we believe is a 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.970
 console that even goes a little further 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.700
 of the mere concept of revision not only 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.890
 has the 3d improved the right stick or 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.720
 new buttons but that also counts 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.730
 with a new processor and improvement 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.340
 online capabilities that make it 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.260
 a globally more powerful machine to 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.270
 we have convinced and 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.960
 we consider that it also has enough 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.960
 future ahead
