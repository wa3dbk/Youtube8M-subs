00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to all it's little by little 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.150
 magic and go for a new 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.840
 round with only four cards 4 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:17.970
 red cards and four black cards 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:21.439
 so here are the black blue cards 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:28.830
 we turn them over the pink cards 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:29.970
 so we will limit a cartridge of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:42.480
 red card for them to find 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:45.030
 four 14.4 black card a loan so I 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:52.949
 am going to challenge the red cards and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:57.239
 agreement gap after a 14.94 a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.250
 black card a catasrophe I'm going all 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.250
 gently poteo think I'm cheating 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.970
 so there I do not know if you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.430
 know the phenomenon of oil and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.320
 water but when we mix the oil and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.990
 the water eh ben a few moments later 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.480
 he knows he is separating and well the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.910
 red cards and 4 black it's a sect 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.130
 in the same way you will see in the hollow 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.300
 look at a red card a black card 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:35.240
 the crankcase or a black cape which is 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.240
 funny look tac 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.050
 here 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:58.630
 with four cards black 4 red cards 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.630
 it's fascinating it's a good look 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.619
 see how that tells you now 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.370
 so a 4th road a black card a 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.049
 Red card 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:26.069
 the red card because you are black a card 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:27.540
 red so look at a 4th road a 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.329
 black card a red card a card 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.329
 black years 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.459
 already victorious it's crazy and the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.609
 black neighborhoods arrive slowly 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.459
 and look here are four red cards 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.680
 four cards have nothing to what is 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.340
 funny even more what's even more 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.159
 funny is that she looks is that we 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.609
 puts the red cards on the covers 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:07.060
 so that means we do not 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:13.209
 mix not look for the dishes at the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:21.370
 end of the package here nothing and we roms it 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:23.980
 let this cost is nothing and she is recovering 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.239
 lange in easter time and their mixture 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:32.200
 Packaged it's crazy and it well 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:36.340
 this is the end of this magic trick 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.879
