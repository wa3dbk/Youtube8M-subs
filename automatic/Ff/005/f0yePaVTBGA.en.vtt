00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
it was a little baby now what I think
this<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.470> saying<00:01:55.680> cuz<00:01:55.829> cuz<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
this is what this was saying cuz cuz it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.550 
this is what this was saying cuz cuz it
I'm<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> look<00:01:56.700> at<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.439> think<00:01:58.439> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
I'm going to look at this I think this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.539 
I'm going to look at this I think this
is<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> defected<00:01:59.549> part<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.320> Miriam<00:02:01.430> since<00:02:02.430> we

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
is a defected part of Miriam since we

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.530 
is a defected part of Miriam since we
know<00:02:02.579> Miriam<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> cold<00:02:04.310> heartless<00:02:05.310> killer<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
know Miriam is a cold heartless killer I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.830 
know Miriam is a cold heartless killer I
think<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> human<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:09.360> sign

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
think this is the human like kind sign

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.500 
think this is the human like kind sign
of<00:02:10.250> Miriam<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.599> honestly<00:02:12.599> don't<00:02:13.110> know<00:02:13.290> about

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
of Miriam I honestly don't know about

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.240 
of Miriam I honestly don't know about
that's<00:02:15.510> my<00:02:15.810> theory<00:02:16.170> that's<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that's my theory that's like the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.280 
that's my theory that's like the
kindness<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.120> Miriam<00:02:18.630> or<00:02:18.750> something<00:02:19.080> that's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
kindness of Miriam or something that's

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.340 
kindness of Miriam or something that's
the<00:02:19.560> other<00:02:19.740> side<00:02:20.150> maybe<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.750> he<00:02:21.900> waited

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
the other side maybe like if he waited

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.920 
the other side maybe like if he waited
he<00:02:22.770> would<00:02:22.800> have<00:02:23.250> been<00:02:23.370> able<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.850> know<00:02:24.150> been<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
he would have been able to know been a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
he would have been able to know been a
different<00:02:25.650> kind<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.040> Kingdom<00:02:26.430> who<00:02:26.790> knows

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
different kind of Kingdom who knows

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.730 
different kind of Kingdom who knows
maybe<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> kind<00:02:27.960> one<00:02:28.170> or<00:02:28.320> something<00:02:28.620> like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
maybe in a kind one or something like

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.600 
maybe in a kind one or something like
that<00:02:29.960> but<00:02:30.960> after<00:02:31.650> seeing<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.950> lead<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> AL

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
