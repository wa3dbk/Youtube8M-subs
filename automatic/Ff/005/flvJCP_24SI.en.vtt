00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.210 
offer at the very beginning the
continuity<00:04:22.020> through<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.530> engineering<00:04:23.190> that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
continuity through the engineering that

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.420 
continuity through the engineering that
we<00:04:23.730> know<00:04:24.090> how<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.390> provide<00:04:24.900> ending<00:04:25.860> up<00:04:26.070> with

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
we know how to provide ending up with

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.690 
we know how to provide ending up with
the<00:04:26.580> last<00:04:27.210> touch<00:04:28.170> point<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.950> is<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.610> the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
the last touch point that is that of the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.340 
the last touch point that is that of the
consumer<00:04:30.090> experience<00:04:30.240> in<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> point-of-sale

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
consumer experience in the point-of-sale

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.060 
consumer experience in the point-of-sale
so<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.890> think<00:04:31.980> that<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.520> disease

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
so I think that the disease

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.820 
so I think that the disease
the<00:04:34.310> perfect<00:04:34.700> summary<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.840> perfect<00:04:36.230> match<00:04:36.440> I

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
the perfect summary of a perfect match I

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.230 
the perfect summary of a perfect match I
would<00:04:36.950> say<00:04:37.310> between<00:04:38.210> these<00:04:38.510> two<00:04:38.690> companies
