00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 and also friend of how to configure 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.160
 Welcome back to our channel 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.629
 Today we are going to teach you actively how 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.530
 see the memory to our phone the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 optimal boy cl 4 2 basically there are three 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.889
 types are two ways of seeing memory 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.470
 we could be talking about seeing the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.410
 ram memory that is one thing also see 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.119
 how much device memory does it have? 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.859
 say how much memory comes and with 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 how much do we have available for 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.949
 applications we can also be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.890
 talking about how to see the archives 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.019
 interns that are good to talk about the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 phone memory of these three things 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.710
 we will show them below 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.420

 link on screen tricks for the room 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.829
 10 dotcom also below in description 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.680
 is the link then to see 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.840
 let's start by seeing the ram memory that is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 very easy the first way to suddenly see 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.480
 what applications are running in the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.570
 century 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.220
 and how to close them is having here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.150
 our lg optimus l 42 leaving sunken 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.640
 the center button 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.560
 and here if we give it all we can erase 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.900
 delete all applications that are 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.880
 working in the background with that 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.490
 we managed to free ram memory and right now 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.190
 we enter here for applications and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.530
 we enter here for adjustments we enter 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.159
 where it says storage 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.130
 and then here in storage we can 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.080
 really see this team with how much 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.690
 space comes from this team comes with 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.210
 two gigabytes of which one part 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.860
 dedicated to the operating system and other 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.350
 part for the user to download 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.030
 applications to know how much space 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.920
 really have the phone to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.310
 applications we click here in 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.440
 applications and here in the option of 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.310
 all ours that we can see between 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.920
 in moving running downloaded in 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.280
 execution and we all look here in the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.170
 option of all we go down here or 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.239
 being in the option of all finished 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.519
 it tells us how much internal storage 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.030
 we have really here tells us that 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.030
 we have 1.7 gb free for us 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.019
 download applications to the phone that 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.630
 really of those two girls we have 1.7 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.360
 gigabytes free normally if I'm not 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.470
 wrong this phone is a phone that we 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.900
 says the characteristics or 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.470
 specifications that is 4 gigs and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.550
 we really have 2 gigs left of use 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.440
 I used 320 and I have 1.7 left which 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.480
 would be the 2 gigas if I want to see 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.640
 how much ram memory does this phone have 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.430
 very good to the option I made in 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.120
 execution and below I can see the memory 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.390
 ram tells me that I have used 302 megabytes and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.920
 I have free 173 megabytes and free is 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.330
 say that this phone is a phone 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.860
 that comes with 512 mb of ram basically 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.360
 that's it for this video 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.670

 files we can see the files 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.640
 here by the file manager and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.760
 here we have two options where we can 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.610
 see what's in the local part and what 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.230
 that is here in what is connected 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.300
 storage list there is no 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.100
 connected storage this has to 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.290
 go not all that is if we connect 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.740
 USB or something around here part 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.990
 local

 if we move 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.700
 for this sd card 0 is the internal memory 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.200
 to the device that was all for study
