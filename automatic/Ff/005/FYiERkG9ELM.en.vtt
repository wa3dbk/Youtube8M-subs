next part is D and F sharp then you go

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.610 
next part is D and F sharp then you go
to<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:55.040> these<00:01:55.370> are<00:01:55.520> all<00:01:55.610> quarter<00:01:56.060> notes

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.450 

during<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.850> on<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:14.690> hand<00:02:15.130> it's<00:02:16.130> F

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
during the on the right hand it's F

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.700 
during the on the right hand it's F
sharp<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.570> D<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.290> he<00:02:18.350> goes<00:02:19.960> then<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.530> move

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
sharp a and D so he goes then you move

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.530 
sharp a and D so he goes then you move
over<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.790> mean<00:02:23.150> F<00:02:23.390> sharp<00:02:23.720> na<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:26.270> I'll<00:02:26.360> play

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
over to a I mean F sharp na so I'll play

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.170 
over to a I mean F sharp na so I'll play
like<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:27.190> slowly<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.520> if<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.760> up<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
like that slowly so if I up on the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:47.589 
like that slowly so if I up on the
beginning<00:02:35.450> monster

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:54.069 

right<00:02:48.499> so<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.549> next<00:02:49.609> part<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.329> a<00:02:51.079> B<00:02:51.530> chord<00:02:53.079> no

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
right so this next part is a B chord no

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.390 
right so this next part is a B chord no
one<00:02:54.260> named<00:02:54.469> so<00:02:54.859> it<00:02:54.950> goes<00:02:55.099> from<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.629> then<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:57.709> D

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
one named so it goes from this then to D

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:11.380 
one named so it goes from this then to D
G<00:02:59.269> B<00:02:59.599> and<00:03:00.139> D<00:03:03.159> so<00:03:04.159> from<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.430> core

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.970 

then<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.170> right<00:03:12.410> hand<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:13.240> have<00:03:14.240> D<00:03:16.360> then<00:03:17.740> no<00:03:18.740> B

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
then the right hand you have D then no B

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.880 
then the right hand you have D then no B
then<00:03:19.940> B<00:03:20.390> then<00:03:20.870> C<00:03:21.290> sharp<00:03:21.800> then<00:03:22.490> a<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.510> goes

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
then B then C sharp then a so it goes

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:33.190 
then B then C sharp then a so it goes
slowly<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.610> B<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:31.280> a

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
slowly to the B then a

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:46.220 
slowly to the B then a
so<00:03:33.830> I'll<00:03:34.010> fight<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.280> from<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.730> guy

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.750 

you

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.789 

right<00:03:51.000> now<00:03:51.840> next<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.379> it<00:03:53.360> walk<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.659> and<00:03:55.049> then

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
right now next is it walk in and then

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.020 
right now next is it walk in and then
for<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.280> right<00:03:56.459> hand

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
for the right hand

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.819 
for the right hand
it's<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.909> D<00:03:59.909> and<00:04:00.269> abstract<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.409> goes<00:04:03.230> G<00:04:04.230> then

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
it's a D and abstract so it goes G then

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.620 
it's a D and abstract so it goes G then
F<00:04:04.950> sharp<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.549> yes<00:04:05.700> but<00:04:06.239> that's<00:04:06.329> quickly<00:04:06.689> so<00:04:06.870> yes

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.210 

and<00:04:10.140> disease<00:04:10.500> off<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.130> blower<00:04:11.840> they<00:04:12.840> know

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
and disease off the blower they know

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.580 
and disease off the blower they know
then<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.610> right<00:04:14.970> hand<00:04:15.240> chord<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.870> AC<00:04:16.110> sharp

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
then the right hand chord is AC sharp

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.030 
then the right hand chord is AC sharp
and<00:04:17.100> E

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:31.129
