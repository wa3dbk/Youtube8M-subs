hi<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:00.989> Carmen<00:00:01.500> Lynne<00:00:01.709> with<00:00:01.920> expert<00:00:02.129> village

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi I'm Carmen Lynne with expert village

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.940 
hi I'm Carmen Lynne with expert village
so<00:00:03.480> now<00:00:03.720> we're<00:00:03.929> going<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.230> be<00:00:04.350> talking<00:00:04.620> about

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
so now we're going to be talking about

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.150 
so now we're going to be talking about
two<00:00:05.460> very<00:00:05.700> important<00:00:06.180> letters<00:00:06.569> T<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.680> and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
two very important letters T and I and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.180 
two very important letters T and I and
this<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:09.000> when<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> T<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.050> are<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.559> small

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
this is when the T and I are the small

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.490 
this is when the T and I are the small
versions<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> lowercase<00:00:12.570> version<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.230> T

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
versions of the lowercase version of T

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.730 
versions of the lowercase version of T
and<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.889> we're<00:00:14.549> looking<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.420> T<00:00:16.080> bars<00:00:16.379> and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
and I we're looking at the T bars and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.689 
and I we're looking at the T bars and
the<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> dot

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the I dot

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.510 
the I dot
so<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:18.300> we're<00:00:18.539> looking<00:00:18.810> at<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> T<00:00:19.520> we're

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
so when we're looking at the T we're

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.870 
so when we're looking at the T we're
looking<00:00:20.880> at<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.630> stem<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.830> t-nuts

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
looking at the stem of the t-nuts

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.630 
looking at the stem of the t-nuts
this<00:00:24.390> part<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.740> we're<00:00:26.310> looking

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
this part right here and we're looking

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.540 
this part right here and we're looking
at<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.510> length<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.199> we're<00:00:28.769> also<00:00:28.920> looking<00:00:29.070> at

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
at the length and we're also looking at

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.170 
at the length and we're also looking at
where<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.810> bar<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.349> occurs<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:33.000> would

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
where on the bar it occurs so that would

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.530 
where on the bar it occurs so that would
be<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> very<00:00:34.230> regular<00:00:34.860> T<00:00:35.040> right<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:36.000> now

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
be like a very regular T right there now

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.910 
be like a very regular T right there now
you<00:00:36.600> might<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.140> someone<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> very<00:00:38.309> high

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
you might have someone with a very high

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.590 
you might have someone with a very high
highly<00:00:40.920> placed<00:00:41.190> stem<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.570> low<00:00:43.910> stem<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
highly placed stem or low stem or you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.790 
highly placed stem or low stem or you
might<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.930> someone<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.739> short

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
might have someone with a very short

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
might have someone with a very short
stem<00:00:49.800> or<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.250> long<00:00:50.700> stem<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.140> these

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
stem or a very long stem so all of these

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.850 
stem or a very long stem so all of these
things<00:00:52.559> are<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.489> factored<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.860> what

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
things are what factored in and what

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
things are what factored in and what
that<00:00:56.070> represents<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> person's

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that represents is a person's

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.979 
that represents is a person's
self-esteem<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.829> self-confidence<00:00:59.809> as<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
self-esteem and self-confidence as you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
self-esteem and self-confidence as you
can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.260> from<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.649> page<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.219> there

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
can see from this page right here there

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.780 
can see from this page right here there
are<00:01:02.730> many<00:01:03.030> different<00:01:03.690> ways<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.199> doing<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.489> T

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
are many different ways of doing the T

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.230 
are many different ways of doing the T
bar<00:01:06.110> crossings<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> T<00:01:07.830> stems<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.580> only

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
bar crossings and the T stems not only

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
bar crossings and the T stems not only
the<00:01:09.390> length<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> height<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.950> T<00:01:11.159> bar

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the length and the height of the T bar

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.429 
the length and the height of the T bar
but<00:01:11.850> also<00:01:12.030> sometimes<00:01:12.659> you've<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:13.049> something

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
but also sometimes you've got something

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
but also sometimes you've got something
like<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> where<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.430> doing<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.820> funny

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
like this where it's doing a funny

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
like this where it's doing a funny
little<00:01:15.420> crossover<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.830> extra

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
little crossover like that and extra

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.179 
little crossover like that and extra
loops<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> loops<00:01:19.110> by<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.830> we'll<00:01:20.040> get

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
loops and loops by the way we'll get

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.590 
loops and loops by the way we'll get
onto<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> later<00:01:20.909> they<00:01:21.150> indicate

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
onto that later they indicate

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
onto that later they indicate
sensitivity<00:01:22.470> generally<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:23.909> are

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
sensitivity generally and here there are

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
sensitivity generally and here there are
even<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.540> T<00:01:24.930> bar<00:01:25.170> crossings<00:01:25.710> all<00:01:25.979> different

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
even more T bar crossings all different

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.999 
even more T bar crossings all different
types<00:01:26.729> sometimes<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.780> might<00:01:27.930> slant<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:28.530> or

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
types sometimes they might slant down or

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.399 
types sometimes they might slant down or
up<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.820> might<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.180> loops<00:01:30.509> within<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.229> they

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
up we might have loops within them they

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.469 
up we might have loops within them they
might<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.740> wavy<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.850> we're<00:01:33.000> also<00:01:33.210> looking

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
might be wavy and so we're also looking

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.310 
might be wavy and so we're also looking
at<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> dot<00:01:35.450> all<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.600> earrings<00:01:36.900> either

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
at the I dot all right earrings either

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.880 
at the I dot all right earrings either
very<00:01:37.530> different<00:01:37.979> types<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.490> eye<00:01:38.670> dots<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
very different types of eye dots so the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.580 
very different types of eye dots so the
eye<00:01:40.920> dot<00:01:41.420> represents<00:01:42.420> attention<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> detail

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
eye dot represents attention to detail

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.999 
eye dot represents attention to detail
or<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.479> dot<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.320> over

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
or we see if you have the dot right over

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.499 
or we see if you have the dot right over
the<00:01:47.130> eye<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.970> means<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.329> very

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the eye that means you are very

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.969 
the eye that means you are very
meticulous<00:01:49.040> if<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.810> dot<00:01:51.979> flying

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
meticulous if you have the I dot flying

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.310 
meticulous if you have the I dot flying
out<00:01:53.189> ahead<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.119> eye<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:54.869> seem<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
out ahead of the eye that would seem to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.709 
out ahead of the eye that would seem to
indicate<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:56.070> impatient<00:01:57.060> hasty<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
indicate that you're impatient hasty you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.280 
indicate that you're impatient hasty you
want<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.110> things<00:01:58.380> done<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.960> opposite

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
want to get things done and the opposite

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.389 
want to get things done and the opposite
of<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> would<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.829> someone<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> eye

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
of that would be someone with the eye

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.330 
of that would be someone with the eye
dot<00:02:02.899> before<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.130> that's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
