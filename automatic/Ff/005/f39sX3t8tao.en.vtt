00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:51.300 

what<00:01:37.870> is<00:01:38.050> that<00:01:39.270> kill<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.420> cyborgs<00:01:50.310> profile

what is that kill the cyborgs profile

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.080 
what is that kill the cyborgs profile
every<00:01:51.940> cyborg<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.700> get<00:01:54.910> into

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
every cyborg right so if you get into

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.870 
every cyborg right so if you get into
this<00:01:55.180> blue<00:01:55.420> area<00:01:58.440> profile<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.740> cyborg<00:02:00.520> to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
this blue area profile a cyborg to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.230 
this blue area profile a cyborg to
reveal<00:02:01.240> its<00:02:01.420> weak<00:02:01.600> point

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
reveal its weak point

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.950 
reveal its weak point
so<00:02:04.240> where<00:02:04.690> is<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.080> cyborg<00:02:06.300> it's<00:02:07.300> free<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.840> this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960

we go so we can slow down the cyborgs

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.870 
we go so we can slow down the cyborgs
and<00:04:13.510> we<00:04:14.510> actually<00:04:15.110> we<00:04:16.040> only<00:04:16.070> have<00:04:16.430> one<00:04:16.609> skill

so<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.270> next<00:05:18.449> skill<00:05:18.690> we're<00:05:18.780> going<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:18.960> be

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
so the next skill we're going to be

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.730 
so the next skill we're going to be
using<00:05:19.259> we<00:05:19.979> will<00:05:20.780> upgrade<00:05:21.780> our<00:05:22.199> battery<00:05:24.740> right

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
using we will upgrade our battery right

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:51.029 
using we will upgrade our battery right
if<00:05:25.889> we<00:05:26.009> carry<00:05:26.250> on<00:05:27.469> next<00:05:28.469> area
