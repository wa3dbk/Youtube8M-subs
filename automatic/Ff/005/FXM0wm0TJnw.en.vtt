00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
Saluki games as a mid laner or an ad now

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.070 
Saluki games as a mid laner or an ad now
these<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> things<00:00:09.990> that

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
these are going to be the things that

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.419 
these are going to be the things that
are<00:00:10.230> key<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.440> laning<00:00:10.950> gaining<00:00:11.340> early

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
are key to laning gaining early

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
are key to laning gaining early
advantages<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.330> then<00:00:12.420> how<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.630> turn<00:00:12.900> that

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
advantages and then how to turn that

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.870 
advantages and then how to turn that
early<00:00:13.259> lead<00:00:13.410> into<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> win<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.490> first<00:00:14.700> off<00:00:14.820> let's

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
early lead into a win so first off let's

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.129 
early lead into a win so first off let's
look<00:00:15.179> at<00:00:15.299> something<00:00:15.480> that's<00:00:15.630> probably<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
look at something that's probably the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.900 
look at something that's probably the
most<00:00:16.260> important<00:00:16.800> part<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.039> any<00:00:17.279> lane<00:00:17.580> now<00:00:17.760> it's

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
most important part of any lane now it's

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.580 
most important part of any lane now it's
gonna<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.090> lane<00:00:18.359> control<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.050> every<00:00:19.230> champion

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
gonna be lane control so every champion

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.050 
gonna be lane control so every champion
has<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> zone<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.070> control<00:00:20.580> whether<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:20.970> from

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
has a zone of control whether it's from

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.670 
has a zone of control whether it's from
your<00:00:21.150> tower<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.810> abilities<00:00:22.289> or<00:00:22.320> your

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
your tower your abilities or your

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.990 
your tower your abilities or your
auto-attacks<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.430> that's<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
auto-attacks and that's really how you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
auto-attacks and that's really how you
start<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> deny<00:00:24.630> people<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.289> ahead<00:00:25.439> in

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
start to deny people and get ahead in

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.080 
start to deny people and get ahead in
lane<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.400> two<00:00:26.519> main<00:00:26.699> ways<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
lane now there are two main ways of

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.700 
lane now there are two main ways of
gaining<00:00:27.240> control<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.930> Lane<00:00:28.170> now<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> first

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
gaining control in Lane now the first

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.109 
gaining control in Lane now the first
actually<00:00:29.039> requires<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.670> nothing<00:00:30.029> at

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
actually requires you to do nothing at

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.279 
actually requires you to do nothing at
all<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> natural<00:00:31.199> advantage

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
all but just have a natural advantage

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
all but just have a natural advantage
over<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> enemy<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.669> example<00:00:33.149> Graves<00:00:33.510> has

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
over the enemy so for example Graves has

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.569 
over the enemy so for example Graves has
Lane<00:00:33.930> control<00:00:34.320> over<00:00:34.620> vane<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.130> his<00:00:35.250> combo

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
Lane control over vane because his combo

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.100 
Lane control over vane because his combo
can<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.880> hundreds<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> 0<00:00:36.510> her<00:00:36.660> before<00:00:36.960> she

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
can just hundreds of 0 her before she

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.450 
can just hundreds of 0 her before she
can<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.350> anything<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> other<00:00:38.190> way<00:00:38.340> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
can do anything but the other way of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.860 
can do anything but the other way of
gaining<00:00:38.640> control<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.570> they're<00:00:39.690> too

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
gaining control is just if they're too

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.540 
gaining control is just if they're too
low<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> fight<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> let's<00:00:41.100> hit<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> same

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
low to fight you and let's hit the same

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
low to fight you and let's hit the same
example<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.210> before<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.809> say<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
example as before and just say the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
example as before and just say the
grazers<00:00:43.440> had<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> bad<00:00:43.920> trade<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.370> loses<00:00:44.610> half

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
grazers had a bad trade and loses half

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.369 
grazers had a bad trade and loses half
is<00:00:45.000> health<00:00:45.329> suddenly<00:00:45.750> Vayne<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.260> gonna

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
is health suddenly Vayne is now gonna

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.750 
is health suddenly Vayne is now gonna
have<00:00:46.500> Lane<00:00:46.829> control<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.610> were

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
have Lane control because if they were

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.670 
have Lane control because if they were
to<00:00:47.940> fill<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.239> fire<00:00:48.510> Fame<00:00:48.750> would<00:00:48.930> win<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
to fill out fire Fame would win so to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
to fill out fire Fame would win so to
show<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> mean<00:00:50.370> by<00:00:50.579> zones<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.969> control

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
show you what I mean by zones of control

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.610 
show you what I mean by zones of control
let's<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.079> matchup<00:00:52.320> between

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
let's just look at this matchup between

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
let's just look at this matchup between
zed<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.010> annie<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.969> dead<00:00:54.149> zone<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
zed and annie now this is dead zone of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
zed and annie now this is dead zone of
control<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.350> W<00:00:55.649> forward<00:00:56.070> harass

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
control because it can W forward harass

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
control because it can W forward harass
and<00:00:56.699> even<00:00:56.879> hop<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> his<00:00:57.270> clone<00:00:57.539> reducing<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and even hop to his clone reducing the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.660 
and even hop to his clone reducing the
distance<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.500> his<00:00:58.620> target<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
distance to his target now this is a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.189 
distance to his target now this is a
nice<00:00:59.850> own<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.329> her<00:01:00.449> ability<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> pretty

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
nice own as her ability is a pretty

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.170 
nice own as her ability is a pretty
short<00:01:01.440> range<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.100> said<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> step<00:01:02.850> into<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
short range if said was to step into the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.340 
short range if said was to step into the
red<00:01:03.329> zone<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.570> Annie<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:03.989> most<00:01:04.140> likely

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
red zone and Annie will most likely

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
red zone and Annie will most likely
suffer<00:01:04.890> mabh<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.339> her<00:01:05.460> combo<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.210> he's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
suffer mabh out with her combo if he's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
suffer mabh out with her combo if he's
outside<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.229> she<00:01:07.380> can't<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.799> anything

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
outside of it then she can't do anything

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.320 
outside of it then she can't do anything
that's<00:01:08.520> important<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> note<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.119> these

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that's important to note that these

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.420 
that's important to note that these
zones<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.930> change<00:01:10.290> though<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:11.010> example

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
zones can change though so for example

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.250 
zones can change though so for example
if<00:01:11.549> sets<00:01:11.790> W<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.330> cooldown<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.869> suddenly<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
if sets W is on cooldown then suddenly a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
if sets W is on cooldown then suddenly a
zone<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> control<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.100> reduced<00:01:14.460> hugely

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
zone of control is reduced hugely

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
zone of control is reduced hugely
because<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> no<00:01:15.450> longer<00:01:15.630> poke<00:01:15.930> from

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because you can no longer poke from

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
because you can no longer poke from
range<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.590> gap<00:01:16.799> close<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.430> opposite<00:01:17.880> can

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
range or gap close the opposite can

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820 
range or gap close the opposite can
really<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.299> said<00:01:18.479> 482<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.560> were<00:01:19.680> low

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
really be said 482 so if you were low

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.770 
really be said 482 so if you were low
enough<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> die<00:01:20.369> from<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.790> combo<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.450> she<00:01:21.630> has

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
enough to die from one combo and she has

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
enough to die from one combo and she has
flash<00:01:22.020> available<00:01:22.590> they<00:01:22.710> know<00:01:22.830> zone<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
control is sunny gets a lot bigger once

control is sunny gets a lot bigger once
you<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.409> stronger<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.799> lane<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you are stronger in lane then you can

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.890 
you are stronger in lane then you can
start<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:26.909> your<00:01:27.060> zone<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> control<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
start to use your zone of control to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
start to use your zone of control to
deny<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> enemy<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.740> kill<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.250> they

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
deny the enemy and kill them if they

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
deny the enemy and kill them if they
come<00:01:29.520> close<00:01:29.579> enough<00:01:30.090> now<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.780> leads

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
come close enough now this kind of leads

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
come close enough now this kind of leads
on<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> second<00:01:31.710> thing<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> trading

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
on to the second thing which is trading

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.340 
on to the second thing which is trading
now<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.180> types<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.780> trading<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
now there are two types of trading and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.749 
now there are two types of trading and
that's<00:01:34.530> trading<00:01:34.770> based<00:01:35.070> round<00:01:35.310> minions<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that's trading based round minions and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.640 
that's trading based round minions and
trading<00:01:36.119> based<00:01:36.299> around<00:01:36.479> cooldowns<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.380> minion

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
trading based around cooldowns so minion

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
trading based around cooldowns so minion
based<00:01:37.829> trading<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.310> most<00:01:38.549> useful<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.939> skill

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
based trading is most useful for skill

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.999 
based trading is most useful for skill
shots<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> mid<00:01:39.960> laner<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.350> auto<00:01:40.500> taxes

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
shots as the mid laner and auto taxes

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
shots as the mid laner and auto taxes
and<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.220> D<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:41.939> revolves<00:01:42.390> around<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and they D so it all revolves around the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.030 
and they D so it all revolves around the
fact<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> enemy<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:43.680> themselves

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
fact that the enemy will put themselves

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
fact that the enemy will put themselves
in<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:44.460> predictable<00:01:44.700> place<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.329> kill

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
in a really predictable place to kill

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
in a really predictable place to kill
that<00:01:45.659> creep<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> they'll<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.439> focusing<00:01:46.829> on

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that creep and they'll be focusing on

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.649 
that creep and they'll be focusing on
that<00:01:47.040> creed<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.520> attacking<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.450> means

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that creed not attacking you this means

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.210 
that creed not attacking you this means
that<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.899> easier<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> hit<00:01:49.439> skill<00:01:49.770> shots<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that it's easier to hit skill shots as a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.160 
that it's easier to hit skill shots as a
less<00:01:50.520> likely<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> dodge<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> same<00:01:51.960> way

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
less likely to dodge and in the same way

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.690 
less likely to dodge and in the same way
they<00:01:52.320> aren't<00:01:52.500> likely<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.860> attack<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.250> back<00:01:53.520> as

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
they aren't likely to attack you back as

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
they aren't likely to attack you back as
I<00:01:53.759> would<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.090> killing<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.420> minion<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
I would just be killing that minion so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.359 
I would just be killing that minion so
cooldown<00:01:55.409> based<00:01:55.590> training<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.280> an

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
cooldown based training is more of an

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
cooldown based training is more of an
engaged<00:01:56.700> than<00:01:56.969> poke<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.810> reward

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
engaged than poke but it is gonna reward

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.899 
engaged than poke but it is gonna reward
you<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.530> well<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.100> most<00:01:59.310> champions<00:01:59.700> rely

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
you more as well so most champions rely

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.609 
you more as well so most champions rely
on<00:01:59.939> abilities<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.659> damage<00:02:00.960> early<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.409> into

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
on abilities to do damage early on into

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
on abilities to do damage early on into
the<00:02:01.710> game<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.100> means<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.490> any<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the game which means that any time the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.609 
the game which means that any time the
ability<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.540> cooldown<00:02:03.780> they<00:02:04.079> can't<00:02:04.320> use<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
ability is on cooldown they can't use it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.990 
ability is on cooldown they can't use it
in<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.799> fire<00:02:04.979> though<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.430> sounds<00:02:05.670> really

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
in a fire though this sounds really

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
in a fire though this sounds really
obvious<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> really<00:02:07.229> easy<00:02:07.259> way<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
obvious but it's a really easy way of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
obvious but it's a really easy way of
gaining<00:02:08.039> an<00:02:08.129> advantage<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.700> lane<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.300> let's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
gaining an advantage in lane so let's

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.510 
gaining an advantage in lane so let's
just<00:02:09.599> use<00:02:09.750> graves<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.289> an<00:02:10.410> example<00:02:10.739> again<00:02:10.979> now

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
just use graves as an example again now

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.339 
just use graves as an example again now
grace<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.940> renowned<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.390> his<00:02:12.480> huge<00:02:12.840> burst<00:02:13.110> but

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
grace is renowned for his huge burst but

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.520 
grace is renowned for his huge burst but
if<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
if you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
if you
just<00:02:13.770> uses<00:02:14.040> queue<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> find<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> way<00:02:14.819> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
just uses queue to find the way that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.670 
just uses queue to find the way that
gives<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.420> roughly<00:02:15.569> ten<00:02:15.990> seconds<00:02:16.500> where

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
gives you roughly ten seconds where

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.380 
gives you roughly ten seconds where
we'll<00:02:16.770> do<00:02:16.860> almost<00:02:17.160> 300<00:02:17.610> less<00:02:17.730> damage<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
we'll do almost 300 less damage to in a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.910 
we'll do almost 300 less damage to in a
fight<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.080> reason<00:02:19.350> trading<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.770> so

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
fight so the reason trading is so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.350

important<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.340> lower<00:02:20.490> lows<00:02:20.730> because<00:02:21.090> once<00:02:21.270> you

important in lower lows because once you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.760 
important in lower lows because once you
win<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> few<00:02:21.750> trades<00:02:22.110> you'll<00:02:22.319> gain<00:02:22.500> Lane

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
win a few trades you'll gain Lane

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.930 
win a few trades you'll gain Lane
control<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.370> will<00:02:23.490> lead<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.819> either

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
control that will lead you to either

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.430 
control that will lead you to either
denying<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:24.600> killing<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.020> enemy

so<00:02:25.830> far<00:02:26.040> I've<00:02:26.100> covered<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> laning<00:02:26.700> style

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
so far I've covered the laning style

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.699 
so far I've covered the laning style
we're<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.209> gonna<00:02:27.330> lay<00:02:27.569> together<00:02:27.780> early<00:02:28.290> but

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
we're just gonna lay together early but

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.570 
we're just gonna lay together early but
now<00:02:28.860> I'll<00:02:28.980> call<00:02:29.130> what<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.400> should<00:02:29.490> actually

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
now I'll call what you should actually

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.340 
now I'll call what you should actually
do<00:02:29.850> with<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.270> win<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.510> game<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.230> is

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
do with it to win the game now this is

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.720 
do with it to win the game now this is
more<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:31.709> mid<00:02:31.860> laners<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:32.340> roaming<00:02:32.640> is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
more for mid laners but roaming is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.979 
more for mid laners but roaming is
probably<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> easiest<00:02:33.180> way<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.540> win<00:02:33.750> games

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
probably the easiest way to win games

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.750 
probably the easiest way to win games
once<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.440> an<00:02:34.500> advantage<00:02:34.800> depending<00:02:35.670> on

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
once you have an advantage depending on

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.949 
once you have an advantage depending on
the<00:02:35.850> game<00:02:36.030> you're<00:02:36.209> either<00:02:36.360> gonna<00:02:36.600> want<00:02:36.840> to

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the game you're either gonna want to

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.479 
the game you're either gonna want to
roam<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.350> counter<00:02:37.739> gank<00:02:37.890> their<00:02:38.130> mid<00:02:38.340> or

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
roam to counter gank their mid or

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.920 
roam to counter gank their mid or
jungler<00:02:38.910> or<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.239> be<00:02:39.390> pushing<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.780> wave

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
jungler or you just be pushing the wave

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.690 
jungler or you just be pushing the wave
and<00:02:40.080> roaming<00:02:40.380> yourself<00:02:40.709> counter<00:02:41.310> ganking<00:02:41.610> is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and roaming yourself counter ganking is

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.949 
and roaming yourself counter ganking is
pretty<00:02:41.970> simple<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.660> really

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
pretty simple that can be really

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.180 
pretty simple that can be really
rewarding<00:02:43.140> especially<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:43.980> some

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
rewarding especially if you have some

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.979 
rewarding especially if you have some
sort<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.430> speed<00:02:44.700> buff<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.060> Orianna<00:02:45.570> or<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> gap

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
sort of speed buff like Orianna or a gap

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.180 
sort of speed buff like Orianna or a gap
closer<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.440> Greiger's<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.890> get<00:02:47.040> there

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
closer like Greiger's to get there

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.680 
closer like Greiger's to get there
faster<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.970> as<00:02:48.090> soon<00:02:48.180> as<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.540> their

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
faster so as soon as you see their

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.240 
faster so as soon as you see their
jungler<00:02:48.930> ganking<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.470> immediately<00:02:49.830> run<00:02:50.100> to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
jungler ganking you immediately run to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.920 
jungler ganking you immediately run to
the<00:02:50.340> lane<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.640> mop<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.910> fight<00:02:51.180> chances<00:02:51.810> are

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the lane to mop up the fight chances are

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.270 
the lane to mop up the fight chances are
that<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.230> enemy<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.530> fighting<00:02:52.950> your<00:02:53.100> team

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
that if the enemy is fighting your team

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.350 
that if the enemy is fighting your team
and<00:02:53.430> they<00:02:53.489> aren't<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.970> decide<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and they aren't just going to decide to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.120 
and they aren't just going to decide to
stop<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.870> run<00:02:54.959> away<00:02:55.200> when<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.500> move<00:02:55.680> but<00:02:55.890> even

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
stop and run away when you move but even

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.380 
stop and run away when you move but even
if<00:02:56.220> they<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.400> you'll<00:02:56.700> probably<00:02:56.850> have<00:02:57.060> lost<00:02:57.209> two

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
if they do you'll probably have lost two

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.729 
if they do you'll probably have lost two
minions<00:02:57.750> at<00:02:57.900> most<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.380> chance<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
minions at most for the chance of

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.570 
minions at most for the chance of
getting<00:02:58.890> some<00:02:59.130> kills

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
getting some kills

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.190 
getting some kills
now<00:02:59.910> roaming<00:03:00.239> yourself<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.720> most<00:03:00.750> common

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
now roaming yourself is the most common

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.660 
now roaming yourself is the most common
situation<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:01.980> you'll<00:03:02.069> just<00:03:02.190> want<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.489> push

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
situation and you'll just want to push

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.860 
situation and you'll just want to push
the<00:03:02.790> wave<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.060> then<00:03:03.180> walk<00:03:03.269> backwards<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:03.810> they

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the wave and then walk backwards so they

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.300 
the wave and then walk backwards so they
lose<00:03:03.989> vision<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.590> now<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.100> really

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
lose vision of you now this is really

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.620 
lose vision of you now this is really
important<00:03:05.819> because<00:03:05.910> even<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.480> actually

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
important because even if you actually

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.330 
important because even if you actually
don't<00:03:06.930> end<00:03:07.110> up<00:03:07.200> roaming<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.769> threat<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.100> doing

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
don't end up roaming the threat of doing

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.410 
don't end up roaming the threat of doing
so<00:03:08.519> now<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.700> you're<00:03:08.880> missing<00:03:09.120> will<00:03:09.239> still

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
to gain from it just try and get behind

the enemy lanes and make sure you ping a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.120 
the enemy lanes and make sure you ping a
lot<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:16.140> pinging<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.470> lot<00:03:16.620> sounds<00:03:16.860> really

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
lot now pinging a lot sounds really

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.770 
lot now pinging a lot sounds really

judgement<00:03:26.880> though<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.239> roaming<00:03:27.570> too<00:03:27.690> much

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
judgement though so roaming too much

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.539 
judgement though so roaming too much
will<00:03:28.049> put<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.320> behind<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:29.220> win<00:03:29.400> games

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
will put you behind but it can win games

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.520 
will put you behind but it can win games
easily<00:03:30.120> by<00:03:30.269> itself<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.110> best<00:03:31.290> three

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
easily by itself so the best three

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.110 
easily by itself so the best three
things<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.980> look<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.370> are<00:03:32.549> how<00:03:32.730> push<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
things to look for are how push the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.090 
things to look for are how push the
enemy<00:03:33.239> Lane<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.660> are<00:03:33.840> how<00:03:34.049> much<00:03:34.200> CC<00:03:34.650> your<00:03:34.860> laner

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
enemy Lane is are how much CC your laner

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.710 
enemy Lane is are how much CC your laner
has<00:03:35.430> or<00:03:35.730> whether<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.239> die<00:03:36.420> with<00:03:36.600> their

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
has or whether you can die with their

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.569 
has or whether you can die with their
low<00:03:36.900> health<00:03:37.140> under<00:03:37.440> turret<00:03:37.620> now<00:03:38.070> objectives

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
low health under turret now objectives

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.830 
low health under turret now objectives
are<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:38.970> important<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.630> give<00:03:39.750> your

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
are really important and can give your

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.509 
are really important and can give your
entire<00:03:39.930> team<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.380> huge<00:03:40.709> advantage<00:03:41.070> through<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
entire team a huge advantage through the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.979 
entire team a huge advantage through the
global<00:03:41.790> gold<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.239> experience<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.870> they

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
global gold and experience that they

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.390 
global gold and experience that they
give<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.709> good<00:03:43.829> habit<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.160> ask

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
give so it's a good habit to ask

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.039 
give so it's a good habit to ask
yourself<00:03:44.790> what<00:03:44.970> can<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.239> now<00:03:45.600> after<00:03:45.840> you

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
yourself what can I do now after you

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.690 
yourself what can I do now after you
kill<00:03:46.260> someone<00:03:46.530> rather<00:03:46.769> than<00:03:46.980> just<00:03:47.190> farm<00:03:47.430> and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
kill someone rather than just farm and

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.099 
kill someone rather than just farm and
in<00:03:47.760> most<00:03:47.970> cases<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.329> lead<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> dragon

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
in most cases that lead to be a dragon

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.110 
in most cases that lead to be a dragon
or<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.290> tower<00:03:49.560> there's<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.280> really<00:03:50.519> easy<00:03:50.670> way<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
or a tower there's a really easy way of

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.910 
or a tower there's a really easy way of
securing<00:03:51.450> dragons<00:03:51.959> if<00:03:52.079> you're<00:03:52.320> ahead<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.829> is

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
securing dragons if you're ahead that is

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.349 
securing dragons if you're ahead that is
pretty<00:03:53.130> obvious<00:03:53.519> but<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.760> lot<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.030> people<00:03:54.239> just

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
pretty obvious but a lot of people just

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.789 
pretty obvious but a lot of people just
don't<00:03:54.510> think<00:03:54.630> about<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.170> when<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.500> force<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
don't think about it when you force the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.170 
don't think about it when you force the
enemy<00:03:55.920> out<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.190> lane<00:03:56.370> by<00:03:56.579> either<00:03:56.700> killing<00:03:56.940> them

you'll<00:04:03.239> need<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.630> wait<00:04:03.810> until<00:04:04.049> a

lower<00:04:14.070> élow<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.459> can<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.910> turn<00:04:15.120> pick<00:04:15.420> up<00:04:15.540> a

lower élow you can just turn pick up a

lower élow you can just turn pick up a
kill<00:04:15.840> or<00:04:15.959> two<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.289> need<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.470> go<00:04:16.590> back<00:04:16.709> to

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
kill or two and need to go back to

kill or two and need to go back to
dragon<00:04:17.160> or<00:04:17.250> base<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:17.880> repeat<00:04:18.090> the

dragon or base and it to repeat the
process<00:04:18.419> again<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.289> taking<00:04:19.590> towers<00:04:19.890> is<00:04:20.010> slight

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
process again so taking towers is slight

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.349 
process again so taking towers is slight
different<00:04:20.549> depending<00:04:20.850> on<00:04:20.940> if<00:04:21.030> you're<00:04:21.120> an<00:04:21.209> ad

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
different depending on if you're an ad

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.240 
different depending on if you're an ad
or<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.659> mid<00:04:21.840> laner<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.650> bot<00:04:22.830> Lane<00:04:22.979> if<00:04:23.130> you're

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
or a mid laner so in bot Lane if you're

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.200 
or a mid laner so in bot Lane if you're
in<00:04:23.340> control<00:04:23.640> then<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.909> will<00:04:24.060> naturally

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
in control then you will naturally

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.700 
in control then you will naturally
pushed<00:04:24.570> away<00:04:24.720> from<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> zoning<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:25.620> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
pushed away from the zoning so the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.670 
pushed away from the zoning so the
turret<00:04:25.979> damage<00:04:26.220> from<00:04:26.370> me

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
turret damage from me

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.050 
turret damage from me
so<00:04:26.770> that<00:04:26.919> auto-attack<00:04:27.550> will<00:04:27.699> eventually<00:04:28.030> just

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
so that auto-attack will eventually just

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.879 
so that auto-attack will eventually just
destroy<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.570> on<00:04:28.660> its<00:04:28.810> own<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.320> can<00:04:29.380> also<00:04:29.590> put<00:04:29.860> a

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
destroy it on its own you can also put a

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.200 
destroy it on its own you can also put a
lot<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.190> pressure<00:04:30.340> onto<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:30.820> tower<00:04:31.000> if<00:04:31.120> you

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
lot of pressure onto the tower if you

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.909 
lot of pressure onto the tower if you
kill<00:04:31.449> or<00:04:31.630> force<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.960> enemy<00:04:32.139> to<00:04:32.259> recall<00:04:32.800> but

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
kill or force the enemy to recall but

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.350 
kill or force the enemy to recall but
this<00:04:33.009> is<00:04:33.130> only<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.580> good<00:04:33.729> idea<00:04:34.000> if<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.180> don't

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
this is only a good idea if you don't

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.999 
this is only a good idea if you don't
need<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.540> base<00:04:34.780> yourself<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.590> if<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.740> do<00:04:35.889> need

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
need to base yourself so if you do need

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.379 
need to base yourself so if you do need
to<00:04:36.100> base<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.460> do<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.699> too<00:04:36.880> late<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.270> they're

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
to base you do it too late and they're

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.640 
to base you do it too late and they're
just<00:04:37.509> gonna<00:04:37.660> get<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.900> wave<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.229> your<00:04:38.320> turret

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
just gonna get the wave to your turret

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.590 
just gonna get the wave to your turret
and<00:04:38.770> you'll<00:04:38.889> end<00:04:39.039> up<00:04:39.160> losing<00:04:39.370> CS<00:04:39.759> yourself<00:04:40.180> and

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
and you'll end up losing CS yourself and

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.969 
and you'll end up losing CS yourself and
taking<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.930> bot<00:04:41.080> is<00:04:41.110> pretty<00:04:41.440> much<00:04:41.530> always<00:04:41.830> a

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
taking a bot is pretty much always a

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.379 
taking a bot is pretty much always a
good<00:04:42.190> idea<00:04:42.520> unless<00:04:42.699> you<00:04:42.820> have<00:04:43.000> nothing<00:04:43.270> else

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
good idea unless you have nothing else

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:43.920 
good idea unless you have nothing else
to<00:04:43.509> do

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
to do

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.629 
to do
so<00:04:44.169> don't<00:04:44.380> take<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.650> if<00:04:44.949> dragon<00:04:45.280> is<00:04:45.400> already

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
so don't take it if dragon is already

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.400 
so don't take it if dragon is already
down<00:04:45.850> for<00:04:46.060> example<00:04:46.180> if<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.720> enemy<00:04:46.990> laner<00:04:47.169> has

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
down for example if the enemy laner has

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.200 
down for example if the enemy laner has
a<00:04:47.440> lot<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.710> waveclear<00:04:48.220> mid<00:04:48.520> lane<00:04:48.669> once<00:04:49.090> the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
a lot of waveclear mid lane once the

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.790 
a lot of waveclear mid lane once the
tower<00:04:49.389> is<00:04:49.509> gone<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.870> two<00:04:50.050> best<00:04:50.259> options<00:04:50.380> will

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
tower is gone the two best options will

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.529 
tower is gone the two best options will
be<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:51.039> secure<00:04:51.310> dragon<00:04:51.759> or<00:04:51.880> rotate<00:04:52.240> mid<00:04:52.389> and

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
be to secure dragon or rotate mid and

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.090 
be to secure dragon or rotate mid and
push<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.840> tower<00:04:53.080> down<00:04:53.289> too<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:53.949> if<00:04:54.009> you're

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
push that tower down too so if you're

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.350 
push that tower down too so if you're
gonna<00:04:54.190> go<00:04:54.340> meet<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:54.669> push<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.970> tower<00:04:55.150> then

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
gonna go meet and push the tower then

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.580 
gonna go meet and push the tower then
the<00:04:55.449> best<00:04:55.630> way<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:55.810> doing<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.199> to<00:04:56.350> make<00:04:56.440> sure

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
the best way of doing this to make sure

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.200 
the best way of doing this to make sure
number<00:04:56.800> axe<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:57.280> just<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.550> recon<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.120> go

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
number axe is just a recon and go

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.460 
number axe is just a recon and go
straight<00:04:58.419> there<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.110> going<00:04:59.229> to<00:04:59.289> avoid

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
straight there this is going to avoid

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.379 
straight there this is going to avoid
any<00:04:59.770> Wars<00:05:00.039> that<00:05:00.190> may<00:05:00.340> see<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.729> run<00:05:00.940> from<00:05:01.120> bots

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
any Wars that may see you run from bots

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.610 
any Wars that may see you run from bots
and<00:05:01.510> mid<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:01.990> means<00:05:02.139> no<00:05:02.320> one<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.470> gonna

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
and mid and it means no one is gonna

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.350 
and mid and it means no one is gonna
react<00:05:02.949> in<00:05:03.100> time<00:05:03.130> now<00:05:03.789> in<00:05:03.910> mid<00:05:04.030> it's<00:05:04.150> gonna<00:05:04.240> be

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
react in time now in mid it's gonna be

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.340 
react in time now in mid it's gonna be
slightly<00:05:04.510> harder<00:05:04.720> for<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:04.990> to<00:05:05.020> take<00:05:05.260> the

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
slightly harder for you to take the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.629 
slightly harder for you to take the
turret<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.710> your<00:05:05.860> own<00:05:05.979> but<00:05:06.190> if<00:05:06.250> your<00:05:06.370> jungler

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
turret on your own but if your jungler

turret on your own but if your jungler
does<00:05:06.850> gank<00:05:07.120> then<00:05:07.330> ask<00:05:07.449> him<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.750> stay<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.020> put

does gank then ask him to stay and put
some<00:05:08.320> damage<00:05:08.620> onto<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.919> turret<00:05:09.130> this<00:05:09.460> will

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
some damage onto the turret this will

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.650 
some damage onto the turret this will
mean<00:05:09.760> that<00:05:09.910> if<00:05:10.000> they're<00:05:10.120> mich<00:05:10.240> laner<00:05:10.510> does

mean that if they're mich laner does

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.360 
mean that if they're mich laner does
eventually<00:05:10.930> bro<00:05:11.350> mollies<00:05:11.710> own<00:05:11.949> you'll<00:05:12.190> have<00:05:12.340> a

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
eventually bro mollies own you'll have a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.800 
eventually bro mollies own you'll have a
much<00:05:12.580> higher<00:05:12.729> chance<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:13.240> taking<00:05:13.389> his<00:05:13.600> tower

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
much higher chance of taking his tower

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.180 
much higher chance of taking his tower
really<00:05:14.139> punishing<00:05:14.560> him<00:05:14.650> for<00:05:14.680> doing<00:05:14.889> so

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
really punishing him for doing so

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.469 
really punishing him for doing so
finally<00:05:15.789> I<00:05:15.820> do<00:05:15.880> just<00:05:16.090> want<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.270> talk<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.449> little

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
finally I do just want to talk a little

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.490 
finally I do just want to talk a little
bit<00:05:16.780> about<00:05:16.810> wards

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
bit about wards

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.420 
bit about wards
now<00:05:17.620> I'm<00:05:17.710> not<00:05:17.800> gonna<00:05:17.949> give<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.280> whole

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
now I'm not gonna give you the whole

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.740 
now I'm not gonna give you the whole
wards<00:05:18.729> wing<00:05:18.880> game<00:05:19.090> ball<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.539> a<00:05:19.599> lot<00:05:19.720> of

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
wards wing game ball that a lot of

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.420 
wards wing game ball that a lot of
people<00:05:20.020> do<00:05:20.260> but<00:05:20.470> rather<00:05:20.650> just<00:05:20.889> where<00:05:21.099> to<00:05:21.250> place

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
people do but rather just where to place

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.379 
people do but rather just where to place
them<00:05:21.610> when<00:05:21.729> you're<00:05:21.820> snowballing

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
them when you're snowballing

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.850 
them when you're snowballing
so<00:05:22.660> every<00:05:22.840> time<00:05:22.960> you<00:05:23.110> base<00:05:23.289> meet<00:05:23.560> game<00:05:23.740> you

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
so every time you base meet game you

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.140 
so every time you base meet game you
should<00:05:24.010> try<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.220> pick<00:05:24.340> up<00:05:24.430> two<00:05:24.639> Wars<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.030> pay

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
should try to pick up two Wars and pay

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.909 
should try to pick up two Wars and pay
some<00:05:25.330> deep<00:05:25.509> into<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.870> enemy<00:05:26.080> jungle<00:05:26.380> this<00:05:26.710> way

some deep into the enemy jungle this way

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.170 
some deep into the enemy jungle this way
you<00:05:26.979> can<00:05:27.070> catch<00:05:27.280> people<00:05:27.310> who<00:05:27.639> are<00:05:27.849> farming

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
you can catch people who are farming

enemy team is 4v5 while already being
behind<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.440> really<00:05:32.770> easy<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:33.099> push<00:05:33.280> towers

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460
