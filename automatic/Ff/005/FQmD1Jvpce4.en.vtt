skipping now this gives your works on
not<00:02:45.010> just<00:02:45.070> reform<00:02:45.820> but<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.269> works<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.660> power

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
not just reform but it works for power

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.470 
not just reform but it works for power
so<00:02:47.920> get<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.250> know<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:48.970> helps<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.269> allow

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
when you coming off the blocks they just

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.790 
when you coming off the blocks they just
go<00:02:51.610> power<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.209> out<00:02:52.330> drag<00:02:52.690> those<00:02:52.870> need<00:02:53.140> 54<00:02:53.709> to

elbows back alright so you keep that
consistent<00:02:58.209> rhythm<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.810> you're<00:02:58.959> going<00:02:59.110> up<00:02:59.680> and

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
consistent rhythm as you're going up and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.870 
consistent rhythm as you're going up and
down<00:03:00.340> try<00:03:00.700> try<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.300> try

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
down try try to try

down try try to try
again<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:03.240> are<00:03:03.450> some<00:03:03.480> other<00:03:03.660> drills

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
again these are some other drills

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.690 
again these are some other drills
although<00:03:04.530> some<00:03:04.740> of<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.860> truth<00:03:05.040> may<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.220> T<00:03:05.550> is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
although some of the truth may be T is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.810 
although some of the truth may be T is
very<00:03:06.510> critical<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.680> your<00:03:07.830> running<00:03:08.220> motion<00:03:08.430> and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
very critical to your running motion and

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.270 
very critical to your running motion and
your<00:03:09.150> form<00:03:09.420> okay<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:10.560> next<00:03:10.770> drill<00:03:11.070> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
your form okay so this next drill is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.650 
your form okay so this next drill is
basically<00:03:11.730> black<00:03:12.540> case<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.260> one<00:03:13.500> can<00:03:14.280> freeze

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
basically black case this one can freeze

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920 
basically black case this one can freeze
the<00:03:15.660> sweep<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:17.270> recovery<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.510> feet<00:03:18.720> going

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the sweep and recovery of the feet going

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.500 
the sweep and recovery of the feet going
up<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.260> down<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.220> can<00:03:20.370> see<00:03:20.580> you're

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
up and down so as you can see you're

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.570 
up and down so as you can see you're
bringing<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.080> heel<00:03:22.320> up<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.800> butt<00:03:23.100> and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
bringing in the heel up to the butt and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.880 
bringing in the heel up to the butt and
back<00:03:23.790> down<00:03:24.060> work<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:24.540> svms<00:03:25.110> helping<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.590> build

back down work on svms helping to build

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.860 
back down work on svms helping to build
and<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.060> those<00:03:27.210> measuring<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.750> get

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and so on I'm those measuring to get

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.230 
and so on I'm those measuring to get
infused<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.560> quick<00:03:28.860> motion<00:03:29.370> I'll<00:03:29.880> bring

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
infused to that quick motion I'll bring

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.150 
infused to that quick motion I'll bring
that<00:03:30.300> heel<00:03:30.630> up<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.200> put<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.530> back<00:03:31.650> down<00:03:31.710> right

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
that heel up and put it back down right

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.770 
that heel up and put it back down right
so<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:32.910> want<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.150> be<00:03:33.210> efficient<00:03:33.690> and

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
so you want to be efficient and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.720 
so you want to be efficient and
consistent<00:03:34.110> with<00:03:34.380> finger<00:03:34.650> runs<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.580> your

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
consistent with finger runs and in your

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.300 
consistent with finger runs and in your
drills<00:03:35.970> going<00:03:36.270> up<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.840> coming<00:03:37.020> back<00:03:37.320> okay<00:03:38.070> in

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
drills going up and coming back okay in

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.710 
drills going up and coming back okay in
this<00:03:38.430> last<00:03:38.640> rule<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.000> basically<00:03:39.390> what<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.570> call

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
this last rule is basically what I call

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.600 
this last rule is basically what I call
the<00:03:39.840> fast<00:03:40.080> twist<00:03:40.380> through<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.310> has<00:03:41.400> many

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
the fast twist through and it has many

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.090 
the fast twist through and it has many
names<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.450> one<00:03:42.630> faster<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.680> basically<00:03:43.950> it

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
names I like one faster so basically it

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.880 
names I like one faster so basically it
is<00:03:44.190> your<00:03:44.370> skipping<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.820> playful<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.020> try

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
is your skipping it playful it is so try

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.190 
is your skipping it playful it is so try
the<00:03:46.950> knee<00:03:47.310> all<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.640> way<00:03:47.760> up<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.600> back<00:03:48.660> down<00:03:49.050> to

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
the knee all the way up and back down to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.870 
the knee all the way up and back down to
the<00:03:49.290> ground<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.680> running<00:03:49.950> mostly<00:03:50.430> moving

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the ground like a running mostly moving

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.180 
the ground like a running mostly moving
this<00:03:51.420> helps<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.870> work<00:03:52.020> on<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.410> quickness<00:03:52.860> and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
this helps to work on the quickness and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.589 
this helps to work on the quickness and
the<00:03:53.280> efficiency<00:03:53.850> of

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
the efficiency of

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.000 
the efficiency of
you<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.930> your<00:03:55.140> strikes<00:03:55.469> on<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.829> ground

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
you know your strikes on to the ground

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.220 
you know your strikes on to the ground
and<00:03:56.370> remember<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.299> cloying<00:03:57.569> motion

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
and remember the cloying motion

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.229 
and remember the cloying motion
so<00:03:58.499> you've<00:03:58.620> skip<00:03:58.920> skip<00:03:59.159> skip<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.760> then<00:04:00.060> that

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
so you've skip skip skip and then that

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.089 
so you've skip skip skip and then that
puts<00:04:00.450> cycles<00:04:01.079> all<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.349> way<00:04:01.409> through<00:04:01.709> as<00:04:01.920> if

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
puts cycles all the way through as if

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.789 
puts cycles all the way through as if
you're<00:04:02.249> running<00:04:02.549> very<00:04:02.849> quickly<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.530> it

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
you're running very quickly and it

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.020 
you're running very quickly and it
doesn't<00:04:05.040> take<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.159> lot<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.340> coordination<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.879> do

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
doesn't take a lot of coordination to do

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.940 
doesn't take a lot of coordination to do
this<00:04:06.150> drill<00:04:06.359> but<00:04:06.840> take<00:04:07.200> your<00:04:07.290> time<00:04:07.499> is<00:04:07.709> kind<00:04:07.889> of

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
this drill but take your time is kind of

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.739 
this drill but take your time is kind of
break<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.249> down<00:04:08.340> you'll<00:04:08.670> be<00:04:08.819> able<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:09.030> do<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.239> so

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:09.749 
break it down you'll be able to do it so

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.179 
break it down you'll be able to do it so
you've<00:04:09.900> got<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.139> remember<00:04:10.200> skip<00:04:10.739> skip<00:04:11.010> skip

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
you've got to remember skip skip skip

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.550 
you've got to remember skip skip skip
and<00:04:11.609> then<00:04:11.819> a<00:04:11.849> flip<00:04:12.510> cycle<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.139> right<00:04:13.319> side

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
and then a flip cycle the right side

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.520 
and then a flip cycle the right side
quick<00:04:14.370> cycle<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.819> left<00:04:15.000> side<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.870> works<00:04:16.229> on

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
quick cycle the left side this works on
