00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
think reading and literacy is the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.469 
think reading and literacy is the
foundation<00:01:33.900> where<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.710> everything

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
foundation where you know everything

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.210 
foundation where you know everything
academically<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.869> education<00:01:37.680> wise<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
academically and education wise it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
academically and education wise it
starts<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.700> reading<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.150> restarts<00:01:39.630> with

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
starts with reading and restarts with

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.179 
starts with reading and restarts with
literacy<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.229> started<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:41.040> tough

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
literacy it started that's that's tough

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.109 
literacy it started that's that's tough
I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:43.020> bottom<00:01:43.229> floor<00:01:43.649> of
