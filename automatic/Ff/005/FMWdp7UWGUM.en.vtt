00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.700
Neuroscience have, in fact,
had a spectacular progress

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.200
which is due in great part
to the existence of new techniques

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.600
for the study of
the human nervous system,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.500
for the study of
the human nervous system,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
and of the human
nervous living system.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.200
Until a relatively short time ago,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.400
it wasn't possible to directly

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.000
study the brain
on a living human being.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.500
And that which is taking place at
this moment which is in fact new,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.600
isn't just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.500
to see the possibility of
understanding how the brain works,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.600
in order to be able to better
notice and diagnose

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.500
and treat neurological
and psychiatric diseases

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
which, generally, are directly
connected to the working of the brain,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.400
but also to be able
to understand better

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.200
what's happening to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.000
that which have been
the products of human nature,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.200
which have been the products
of the human brain, in terms of,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.300
for example,
to the building of structures,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.450
for example, of ethics, to the creation
of social structures, in general,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.700
politics, economics, and, then,
the creation, evidently,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.400
of technique and science,
and arts.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.500
Since the classics, such as music,
or painting and sculpture,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.200
until the complex arts,
such as, for example, theatre

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.400
and movies,
all those

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.400
great human capacities
and productivities,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.750
it has been possible to connect
them to the brain's functioning,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.200
through this huge technical
success that has been,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.500
which has been designing in
the last two or three decades.
