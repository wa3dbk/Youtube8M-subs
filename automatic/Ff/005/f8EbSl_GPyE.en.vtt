00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 at the football-wm in brazil is yes 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.430
 today a play free day for many 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.960
 Fans gave it a long time yesterday 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.680
 quarterfinal at the end with the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.300
 Lower countries 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.160
 Nevertheless, one or the other is like that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.139
 without soccer, boring 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 because the benefit game fit between the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 fc carl zeiss jena and first-time bayer 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.119
 leverkusen well in the plan 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.380
 the whole thing goes back to the flood 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.420
 last year and the resulting 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.150
 Damage caused at the jena stadion 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.230
 the factory had spontaneous at that time 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.570
 support and today it was 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.369
 as far as and of course, of course 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.300
 the big wm for the benefit 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.610
 bit core mountains city ​​corcovado serious 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 abbe sports field city maracana the summer 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.140
 2014 is holding heavy exams ready for 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.969
 stefan kießling for the wm not 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.680
 considers preparation instead 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.300
 on the new season with the werkself 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 leverkusen's top striker of the last 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 season has arranged with it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.910
 at least superficially five weeks 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.010
 vacation had also very nice holiday 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.100
 that's why there's nothing to it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 gripe 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.539
 as satisfactorily the prelude to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.670
 testplay from bayer sicht el arabi about 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 on the right there I have the stage in January 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.290
 played in front of the feet of julian brand 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.760
 are just 20 seconds 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.380
 in the beginning but of course 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.310
 right now but properly penned 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.810
 otherwise you can get in much more 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.910
 believe such a phase of preparation 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.200
 I do not expect that either, of course 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.060
 of FC Carl Zeiss feels heavy 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 against the three classes better opponent 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.990
 But it always happens again and again 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.150
 at all counter- guest-gate as at 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.430
 this storm over half the field of 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.800
 returner jovanovic and with it 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.660
 direct new access alexander hettich der 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.660
 compensation after 16 minutes 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.720
 Stefan Kießling can help you with the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.000
 play his stamp on times 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.660
 is the jenaer defense to the place times 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.460
 he quarrels with his own colleagues 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.930
 somehow more target water today 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.750
 when he got 26 minutes karim 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.820
 bellarabi from 25 meters 12 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.670
 Jena now expected more and more often 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.070
 vulnerable to plant eleven nine attacks 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.550
 minutes before the break has roberto 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.349
 Hilbert makes no effort to 1 3 halftime 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.450
 to blame all that obviously 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.069
 Listed by falko götz trainer from 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.140
 Erzgebirge aue the second division of the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.420
 opponent of Jena in the first round of the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.340
 dfb cup jump in the second half 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.890
 in which the Bundesliga continues 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.599
 how he stopped the substitute 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.040
 blanco currently one to four 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.989
 The result of this is slow 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.870
 befitting forms from the perspective of 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.160
 Guests then change happily 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.599
 after about an hour, go right away 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.280
 half the team from the field too for 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.010
 Stefan Kießling is working day with it 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.049
 finished scoreless mind you and also the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.209
 jena is another hit failed 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.250
 although in the 74 minute the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.170
 huge chance have miserably forgiven 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.780
 however, from tino schmidt we have ourselves 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.310
 good combined and yes you can 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.380
 happen but of course happen there 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.569
 those are such the action was already 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.220
 from Drews there and only and only 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.540
 want to pull up the arms and then 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.000
 suddenly the thing is back in the game 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.859
 would be yes and is from the Bundesliga to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.870
 all in abundance one more time in the 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.010
 jenaer tor sunk market practically to 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.870
 1 5 endstand 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.700
 the knowledge gained after this game 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.519
 but manageable on both sides 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.250
 After all, Stefan Kießling was in Jena 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.250
 he would have missed it wm driver smoothly
