memory card or memory chip let's get it

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.489 
memory card or memory chip let's get it
out<00:00:13.490> of<00:00:13.519> the<00:00:13.700> envelope<00:00:13.849> here<00:00:14.780> it<00:00:14.869> is<00:00:15.049> as<00:00:15.320> you

out of the envelope here it is as you
can<00:00:15.530> see<00:00:15.769> it's<00:00:15.919> really<00:00:16.460> small<00:00:16.730> looks<00:00:17.540> very

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
can see it's really small looks very

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.370 
can see it's really small looks very
nice<00:00:19.390> apparently<00:00:20.390> these<00:00:20.540> are<00:00:20.720> available<00:00:21.200> in

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
nice apparently these are available in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.730 
nice apparently these are available in
up<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:21.650> 32<00:00:22.310> gigabytes<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:23.320> will<00:00:24.320> start<00:00:24.560> by

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
up to 32 gigabytes I will start by

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.500 
up to 32 gigabytes I will start by
getting<00:00:25.310> it<00:00:25.400> out<00:00:25.490> of<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.670> packaging<00:00:26.120> and<00:00:26.360> this

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
getting it out of the packaging and this

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
getting it out of the packaging and this
not<00:00:26.690> use<00:00:26.870> on<00:00:27.080> scissors

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.530 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.490 

so<00:00:33.530> I<00:00:33.560> was<00:00:33.680> pretty<00:00:33.830> difficult

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
so I was pretty difficult

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.140 
so I was pretty difficult
get<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.740> out<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> packaging<00:00:35.580> very<00:00:35.640> nice

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
get it out of the packaging very nice

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.420 
get it out of the packaging very nice
packed<00:00:36.510> when<00:00:36.810> you're<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.080> gonna<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.440> taking

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
packed when you're not gonna be taking

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.890 
packed when you're not gonna be taking
this<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.030> box<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> few

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
this out of the box in just a few

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.740 
this out of the box in just a few
seconds<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.470> I've<00:00:40.620> thought<00:00:41.480> here<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
seconds like I've thought here is the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
seconds like I've thought here is the
drive<00:00:42.990> itself<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.650> see<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.070> really

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
drive itself as you can see it's really

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.330 
drive itself as you can see it's really
small<00:00:44.700> comparing<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.390> my<00:00:45.420> finger<00:00:46.340> really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
small comparing to my finger really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310 
small comparing to my finger really
small<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.240> absolutely<00:00:48.810> something<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
small this is absolutely something you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.750 
small this is absolutely something you
want<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> your<00:00:49.920> keychain<00:00:50.130> for<00:00:50.580> your

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
want to have on your keychain for your

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240 
want to have on your keychain for your
most<00:00:50.940> important<00:00:51.420> data<00:00:51.830> some<00:00:52.830> cool<00:00:53.010> features

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
most important data some cool features

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.420 
most important data some cool features
it's<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> waterproof<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:55.350> available<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.190> up

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it's a waterproof it's available in up

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's a waterproof it's available in up
to<00:00:56.930> 32<00:00:57.930> gigabytes<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.310> size<00:00:59.930> now<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.710> way

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to 32 gigabytes in this size now the way

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.220 
to 32 gigabytes in this size now the way
it's<00:01:02.100> designed<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:03.060> if<00:01:03.540> I<00:01:03.660> take<00:01:03.840> care<00:01:04.050> it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
it's designed is if I take care it

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.910 
it's designed is if I take care it
regular<00:01:04.589> USB<00:01:04.920> port<00:01:05.780> like<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
regular USB port like this this is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
regular USB port like this this is
pretty<00:01:08.280> much<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.550> same<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:09.300> except<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
pretty much the same thing except that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.350 
pretty much the same thing except that
it<00:01:10.050> doesn't<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.770> frame<00:01:11.310> around<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it doesn't have this frame around it the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.010 
it doesn't have this frame around it the
metal<00:01:12.660> frame<00:01:12.690> here<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:14.270> instead<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> having

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
metal frame here so instead of having

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.969 
metal frame here so instead of having
the<00:01:16.170> frame<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.390> clock<00:01:18.390> itself

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
the frame it's just the clock itself

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
the frame it's just the clock itself
which<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> why<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> will<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.080> connectors

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
which is why you will see the connectors

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
which is why you will see the connectors
there<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> bottom<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.970> would<00:01:24.090> be

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
there on the bottom so if I would be

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.240 
there on the bottom so if I would be
connecting<00:01:24.660> this<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> USB<00:01:25.290> port<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.190> will

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
connecting this to a USB port it will

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.050 
connecting this to a USB port it will
just<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:27.660> into<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> drive

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
just go into it like this the drive

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.310 
just go into it like this the drive
itself<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.840> compatible<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:32.180> USB<00:01:33.180> 2<00:01:33.930> ports

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
itself is compatible with USB 2 ports

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.370 
itself is compatible with USB 2 ports
and<00:01:34.710> USB<00:01:35.009> 1<00:01:35.490> ports<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.200> also

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and USB 1 ports I think it's also

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.440 
and USB 1 ports I think it's also
compatible<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.130> USB<00:01:38.280> 3<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.240> really

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
compatible with USB 3 but I'm not really

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140 
compatible with USB 3 but I'm not really
sure<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.530> compatible<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.400> Windows

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
sure and it's compatible with Windows

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.190
