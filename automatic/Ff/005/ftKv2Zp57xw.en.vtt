well it's important for parents to
understand<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:04.860> brain<00:01:05.100> works

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
understand about how the brain works

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.609 
understand about how the brain works
because<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:05.940> brain<00:01:06.300> is<00:01:06.720> incredibly

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
because the brain is incredibly

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.639 
because the brain is incredibly
responsive<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.399> experiences<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.110> kinds

is thinking it has always been assumed
that<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.269> brain<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:09.019> teenager<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.799> the<00:02:10.039> same

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
that the brain of a teenager is the same

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.880 
that the brain of a teenager is the same
as<00:02:10.640> an<00:02:10.910> adult<00:02:11.140> just<00:02:12.140> filled<00:02:12.440> with<00:02:12.530> less

knowledge<00:02:13.430> fewer<00:02:14.000> experiences<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.650> turns<00:02:15.980> out

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
knowledge fewer experiences it turns out

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.809
