be that Center driveshaft now they've

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.919 
be that Center driveshaft now they've
done<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> pretty<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:27.750> design<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.590> over<00:00:29.929> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
done a pretty good design but over the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.459 
done a pretty good design but over the
years<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.410> whatnot<00:00:31.830> especially<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
years and whatnot especially with the

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.350 
years and whatnot especially with the
hcg<00:00:34.469> version<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.860> hollow

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
hcg version of this one this is a hollow

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.959 
hcg version of this one this is a hollow
splined<00:00:39.360> aluminum<00:00:40.290> driveshaft<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.250> quite

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
splined aluminum driveshaft so quite

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.600 
splined aluminum driveshaft so quite
lengthy<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.540> probably<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.140> 10<00:00:44.010> 11<00:00:44.340> inches

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
lengthy it's probably about 10 11 inches

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.410 
lengthy it's probably about 10 11 inches
in<00:00:44.789> length<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:46.230> all-in-all<00:00:46.730> is<00:00:47.730> proved<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> be

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
in length but all-in-all is proved to be

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.020 
in length but all-in-all is proved to be
one<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> weak<00:00:49.110> points<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.160> truck<00:00:50.460> not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
one of the weak points in the truck not

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
one of the weak points in the truck not
only<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> slide<00:00:52.289> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> back

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
only is it going to slide kind of back

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
only is it going to slide kind of back
and<00:00:52.949> forth<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.360> steel<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.199> drives<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and forth on the steel out drives but it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.549 
and forth on the steel out drives but it
could<00:00:57.180> twist<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.780> Bend<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.109> all<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.410> other

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
could twist and Bend and all that other

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.729 
could twist and Bend and all that other
sort<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> stuff<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.930> went<00:01:01.469> ahead<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
sort of stuff so I went ahead and I

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.460 
sort of stuff so I went ahead and I
picked<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.340> techno<00:01:02.969> driveshaft<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:04.409> do

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
going to be an issue

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.780 
going to be an issue
possibly<00:03:05.550> with<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.200> chassis<00:03:07.250> fitting<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
possibly with this chassis fitting the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.570 
possibly with this chassis fitting the
out<00:03:09.120> drive<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.500> kind<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.800> go<00:03:10.950> along<00:03:11.160> I

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
out drive so as we kind of go along I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.949 
out drive so as we kind of go along I
haven't<00:03:11.850> test<00:03:12.120> fitted<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.510> yet<00:03:12.690> because<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
haven't test fitted it yet because I

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.990 
haven't test fitted it yet because I
just<00:03:13.140> opened<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:14.160> will<00:03:14.340> see<00:03:14.550> how<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.970> goes

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
just opened it we will see how it goes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.930 
just opened it we will see how it goes
and<00:03:15.570> then<00:03:16.500> looks<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.100> also<00:03:17.250> get<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.610> kit

and then looks like you also get a kit

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.199 
and then looks like you also get a kit
here<00:03:18.269> with<00:03:18.620> four<00:03:19.620> rubber<00:03:20.100> washers<00:03:20.730> very

there and then a set pin and also a set

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.460 
there and then a set pin and also a set
screw<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.370> we'll<00:03:30.060> see<00:03:30.209> how<00:03:30.360> those<00:03:30.570> work<00:03:30.630> now

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
screw so we'll see how those work now

going and we'll take a look at how it

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.250 
going and we'll take a look at how it
goes<00:03:55.440> throughout<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.040> process<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:57.300> we're

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
goes throughout the process and we're

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.660 
goes throughout the process and we're
back<00:03:58.380> now<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.890> went<00:03:59.160> ahead<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.519> I've

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
back now and I went ahead and I've

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.940 
back now and I went ahead and I've
separated<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.450> chassis<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.500> front

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
separated the chassis on the front

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.400 
separated the chassis on the front
portion<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.300> pretty<00:04:03.630> much<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.810> four

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
portion of it so pretty much just four

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.650 
portion of it so pretty much just four
screws<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.190> then<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.880> one<00:04:06.060> screw<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
screws and then the one screw on the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.170 
screws and then the one screw on the
steering<00:04:07.110> linkage<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.790> remove<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.000> whole

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
steering linkage to remove the whole

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
on the new techno ones now here are the

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.990 
on the new techno ones now here are the
couple<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.859> differences<00:04:20.370> that<00:04:20.519> I've<00:04:20.640> noticed

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
couple of differences that I've noticed

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.969 
couple of differences that I've noticed
so<00:04:21.209> far<00:04:21.510> these<00:04:22.289> are<00:04:22.440> going<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.650> be<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.800> front

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
so far these are going to be the front

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.880 
so far these are going to be the front
drive<00:04:23.250> shafts<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:24.750> stock<00:04:24.990> one<00:04:25.200> up<00:04:25.320> here<00:04:25.650> and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
drive shafts the stock one up here and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.320 
drive shafts the stock one up here and
then<00:04:26.070> here

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
then here

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.450 
then here
is<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.539> new<00:04:26.659> techno<00:04:27.169> one<00:04:27.349> this<00:04:27.800> one<00:04:28.009> does<00:04:28.220> use

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
is the new techno one this one does use

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.570 
is the new techno one this one does use
a<00:04:28.490> through<00:04:29.210> pen<00:04:29.750> design<00:04:30.409> as<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.889> see<00:04:31.069> here

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
a through pen design as you see here

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.219 
a through pen design as you see here
however<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.330> technical<00:04:32.750> one<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:32.990> little

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
however the technical one is a little

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.390 
however the technical one is a little
bit<00:04:33.439> thicker<00:04:33.830> on<00:04:34.159> the<00:04:35.120> rear<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:36.259> have<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.949> very

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
bit thicker on the rear you have a very

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.600 
bit thicker on the rear you have a very
similar<00:04:37.669> design<00:04:37.939> as<00:04:38.330> well<00:04:39.039> has<00:04:40.039> kind<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.400> a

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
similar design as well has kind of a

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.059 
similar design as well has kind of a
tapered<00:04:41.479> end<00:04:41.750> right<00:04:42.020> there<00:04:42.229> there's<00:04:42.560> flat<00:04:42.889> on

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
tapered end right there there's flat on

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.939 
tapered end right there there's flat on
either<00:04:43.250> side<00:04:43.580> same<00:04:43.939> as<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.449> stock<00:04:44.810> one<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
either side same as the stock one and

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.820 
either side same as the stock one and
they<00:04:46.340> just<00:04:46.610> use<00:04:46.879> a<00:04:47.120> set<00:04:47.449> pin<00:04:47.689> now<00:04:48.169> I<00:04:48.199> do<00:04:48.409> plan<00:04:48.770> to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
they just use a set pin now I do plan to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.249 
they just use a set pin now I do plan to
go<00:04:49.069> ahead<00:04:49.189> and<00:04:49.460> use<00:04:49.669> red<00:04:50.150> loctite<00:04:50.599> on<00:04:51.020> these

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
go ahead and use red loctite on these

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.020 
go ahead and use red loctite on these
not<00:04:51.740> too<00:04:51.919> much<00:04:52.129> just<00:04:52.159> enough<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:52.879> keep

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
not too much just enough to keep

not too much just enough to keep
everything<00:04:53.419> snug<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.229> down<00:04:54.439> now<00:04:55.129> you<00:04:55.189> will

just the set pen that thing went on with
no<00:05:57.289> issue<00:05:57.469> and<00:05:57.830> once<00:05:58.339> again<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.699> can<00:05:58.849> see<00:05:58.879> the

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
no issue and once again you can see the

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.040 
no issue and once again you can see the
o-ring<00:05:59.629> is<00:05:59.779> kind<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.050> sticking<00:06:00.289> out<00:06:00.529> there<00:06:02.050> all

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
o-ring is kind of sticking out there all

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.629 
o-ring is kind of sticking out there all
right<00:06:03.080> so<00:06:03.199> I<00:06:03.319> test<00:06:03.650> fit<00:06:03.860> everything<00:06:04.069> and<00:06:04.370> I<00:06:04.430> did

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
right so I test fit everything and I did

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.379 
right so I test fit everything and I did
notice<00:06:04.849> just<00:06:05.479> a<00:06:05.690> slight<00:06:06.409> bit<00:06:06.919> of<00:06:07.099> rubbing<00:06:07.520> it's

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
notice just a slight bit of rubbing it's

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.920 
notice just a slight bit of rubbing it's
just<00:06:08.779> probably<00:06:09.020> a<00:06:09.289> very<00:06:09.589> close<00:06:10.099> fit<00:06:10.520> and

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
just probably a very close fit and

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.170 
just probably a very close fit and
here's<00:06:11.930> kind<00:06:12.229> of<00:06:12.289> where<00:06:12.469> it<00:06:12.589> is<00:06:12.860> basically<00:06:13.849> the

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
here's kind of where it is basically the

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.290 
here's kind of where it is basically the
top<00:06:14.509> of<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.050> out<00:06:15.289> Drive<00:06:15.680> it's<00:06:16.580> just<00:06:16.849> barely

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
top of this out Drive it's just barely

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.010 
top of this out Drive it's just barely
rubbing<00:06:17.990> on<00:06:18.139> the<00:06:18.409> underside<00:06:19.159> of<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:20.330> chassis

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
rubbing on the underside of the chassis

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.180 
rubbing on the underside of the chassis
right<00:06:21.139> here<00:06:21.409> so<00:06:21.589> I'm<00:06:21.680> just<00:06:21.800> going<00:06:21.949> to<00:06:21.979> take<00:06:22.159> a

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
right here so I'm just going to take a

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.360 
right here so I'm just going to take a
little<00:06:22.610> bit<00:06:22.909> of<00:06:23.089> the<00:06:23.960> plastic<00:06:24.500> off<00:06:24.680> with<00:06:25.009> my

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
little bit of the plastic off with my

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.640 
little bit of the plastic off with my
handy<00:06:25.940> Dremel<00:06:26.930> right<00:06:27.050> there<00:06:27.229> with<00:06:27.409> just<00:06:27.560> a

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
handy Dremel right there with just a

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.950 
handy Dremel right there with just a
little<00:06:27.740> sanding<00:06:28.370> drum<00:06:28.610> and<00:06:28.849> that<00:06:29.779> way

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
little sanding drum and that way

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.629 
little sanding drum and that way
everything<00:06:30.560> should<00:06:30.889> fit<00:06:30.919> in<00:06:31.250> there<00:06:31.400> just

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
everything should fit in there just

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.290 
everything should fit in there just
perfectly<00:06:32.330> now<00:06:32.990> I<00:06:33.319> think<00:06:33.940> eventually<00:06:34.940> if<00:06:35.270> you

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
perfectly now I think eventually if you

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.149 
perfectly now I think eventually if you
were<00:06:35.599> to<00:06:35.810> run<00:06:36.080> this<00:06:36.289> there's<00:06:36.770> probably<00:06:37.069> not

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
were to run this there's probably not

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.370 
were to run this there's probably not
going<00:06:37.279> to<00:06:37.339> be<00:06:37.459> any<00:06:37.639> issue<00:06:37.940> but<00:06:38.330> obviously<00:06:39.289> a

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
going to be any issue but obviously a

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.190 
going to be any issue but obviously a
free<00:06:39.800> Drive

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
free Drive

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.470 
free Drive
