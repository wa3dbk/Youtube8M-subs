00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.509
 put it and the girl lean a certain point 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.610
 with 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 I would like to talk to you today. 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 biggest mistakes everyone knows 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.740
 everybody commits to starting a diet 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.050
 the first mistake of all would be to stay 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.300
 stressed thinking about diet all the time 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 is sad because when a person is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 stressed the body ends up releasing 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.899
 hormone called cortisol this hormone 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.360
 slows down fat burning 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.070
 to avoid future problems so do not 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.809
 it's worth stressing that staying 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.730
 stressed will only delay the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.270
 process of losing weight to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.850
 reach the stage of it 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.430
 error number two is wanting to lose weight 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.440
 too fast, no point in losing 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.989
 weight too fast because depending on 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.500
 You can only win all over again fast. 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.030
 just as fast and so do I 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.190
 Calm down and have patience. 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.110
 continue to diet less 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.520
 healthy all right and no use 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.620
 want to lose weight from day to night 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.360
 because studying this will even stress 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.970
 Your body will not be on a diet 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.369
 sustainable and it's going to hurt you 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.920
 suddenly some nutritional deficiency 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.690
 and that the best thing you do and 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 calmly and patiently you will arrive 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.540
 over there 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.700
 reduce many calories that can 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.700
 really affect your body 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.710
 because human consumption is generally 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 2 thousand calories a day but if suddenly 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.420
 you drop to less than a thousand calories 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.410
 800 calories a day will definitely go there 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.440
 to affect 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.340
 so it's no use reducing calories 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.680
 totally the same way as 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.550
 the more powerful the better. 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.550
 it will be project 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 is to buy those processed foods 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.070
 who say they are light because those 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.860
 food generally discounted too much 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.410
 preservative and also some kind of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.360
 sweetener we export something then 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.520
 The best thing you have is that you 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 kind of food because even if he 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.360
 light is no longer a food 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.940
 processed is from time to time fled 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.520
 diet to eat fast food 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.040
 it's no good the best thing is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.620
 you follow the diet all right 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.150
 for at least 21 days because it says 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.000
 after the person follows a diet of 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.520
 20 days in the balanced diet the body stays 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.660
 easier to follow that habit ends up 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.250
 making habit 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.470
 then it is the reverse to follow five days of 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 I'm going to diet and at the end of the week I'm going to break 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.239
 diet and eating fast food does not follow the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.690
 whole diet including end of 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.300
 week Saturday sunday holiday follows 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.450
 diet for at least 21 days 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.200
 What are you going to see the result? 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.569
 is to cut down on fat generally our 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.709
 body it needs good fats o 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.090
 that we have to cut the fats 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.530
 bad 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.989
 those that when it enters the organism 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.970
 ends up becoming fat but the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.680
 good fats we have to keep that 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
 are fats that we find one 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.530
 avocado also found in olive oil 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.400
 olive 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.040
 This is where the body ends up needing 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.290
 do not take medicine to lose weight this is 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.730
 an error that ends with any diet 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.519
 because when we take medicine to 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.870
 to lose weight light but with 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.299
 sure as to the remedy for 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.250
 fat double triple all over again 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.200
 so what the body is not accustomed to 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.390
 with that limitation then the best 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.189
 What you do is re-education 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.260
 maintain a food supply 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:36.239
 balanced and forget the drugs nor 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.849
 take this option into consideration because 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.099
 plus the day takes sustainable has 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.440
 risks we do not know in the future 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.840
 side effects because there is no study 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.459
 enough they have all the short term but 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.739
 not to know the effects in 50 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.079
 60 years and there are also things 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.180
 You pre- drink the medicine to 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.060
 to lose weight and try to lose weight 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.220
 as natural and healthy as possible 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.079
 are those diets totally 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.939
 repetitive talking to network cut 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.250
 fully carbohydrate and started to 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.560
 Protein Protein Not Our Body 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.299
 also needs carbohydrate as a source 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.060
 power only has to be an amount 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.489
 certainty because most of the color lasts 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.010
 comes is that it turns into fat 20 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.519
 carbohydrates but because people in 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.400
 to consult consume in a way 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.780
 very exaggerated then the best 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.960
 thing we have is 100 palance aa diet 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.600
 the famous start on Monday 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.160

 who start dieting on monday 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.300

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.389
 second weekend and so on 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.160
