00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.099

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.170
 very good things android merz that you 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.840
 it is and today I bring you an attack guys 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.060
 chan chan chan very expected for the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.060
 channel and we're going to make an attack with 12 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.430
 witches and 12 witches guys that the truth 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.900
 is that he has cost his in elixir as 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.760
 I really want to do the 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.560
 attack and see how it worked 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.449
 I'm pretty newbie with witches and 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.129
 play it with so many, I see it very 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.710
 crappy then I'm going for one thing 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.510
 pretty random it's worth going with the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.239
 cauldron of spells and having prepared 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.220
 four there are three ray forgiveness and one of 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.570
 healing three rays to tighten a 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.400
 mortar because it's going to touch me a lot 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.720
 both because what I've seen a 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.190
 mortar can be loaded with damage 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.049
 splash all the witches hit 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.760
 then yes it can burst some then 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.470
 I'll be pretty pretty good and guys 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.150
 but everything is to ask please 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.710
 this video reventase szalai know 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.930
 how many can we get as we arrive 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.780
 well beyond that we know about these and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.269
 moderate me to the boys but through the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.159
 amount of whatever we're going to attack 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.900
 these guys what is said as put 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.850
 the comments what do you want the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.860
 next video if you want me to make a 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.820
 attack only to what was an attack 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.870
 only ride pigs only pecan 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.670
 even that also because it is very 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.360
 entertained and we will do until 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.400
 here that I'm going to do the area is good 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.650
 here they throw the rays to me to this mortar 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.410
 from here to see if we play a lot 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.720
 eggs we tighten one metamos two vale 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.430
 we have this out and I think we can 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.830
 throw the giants and they go 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.119
 doing his job and I from while I go 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.160
 to throw here the witches that go 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.650
 doing your job is worth it and I'm going to throw 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.780
 the good pk has the pk to go 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.920
 doing a little damage and here I am going to 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.650
 throw this up I'm going to go pretty 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.520
 quickie to see if we can get 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.869
 make a good attack since always 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.729
 I make the attack because I'm left 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.070
 short of time then it is a faithful as 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.570
 the house but good to see what is 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.310
 give now because the truth that this can 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 look good or you can have very bad 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.880
 pint pulls me here because if I do not 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.320
 let's take light years and see if not 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.390
 the attack is very complicated and 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.789
 we can do something very very 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.229
 epic guys at the moment the troops do not get 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.390
 they are diverting me a lot which is what 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 I was scared but could go a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.930
 little more to the center that I'm not going to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 say no but good the important thing is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.989
 that go go make doing 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.590
 guys like before they are doing then 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.870
 better 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.830
 after all spit and one of these 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.690
 of 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.920
 of stores I'm going to throw the skill 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.130
 King I shit all over me always 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.570
 Sneak the whip tie guys I'm a filazo 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.670
 of the host I'm always doing 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.800
 fails and let's see if the giant is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.290
 eat all the damage and here you are watching 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.600
 Well, what are you doing? 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.240
 that we are bursting a lot because I 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.130
 already realized if the queen archer 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.690
 you can get to the center quickly and 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.310
 petar the crossbow is because it is what 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.950
 he is touching me the eggs worth perfect 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.840
 the giant is making this tank 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.610
 and it seems that the magicians are bursting 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.680
 this lake city warehouse looks like it's going 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.240
 to be a good booty guys a honk 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.700
 of the host or this what is 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.400
 showing up and I hope we do not do 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.780
 much the mess at the moment the witches 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.250
 they are still doing some damage that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.170
 you're seeing the splash damage 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.000
 is what scared me how is it being 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.920
 it has not burst enough and we are going to 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.290
 burst the rest of elixir let's 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.280
 burst a bit this and I'm going to throw the 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.140
 spell of 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.350
 radio over here to see if you catch a 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.850
 little 240,000 and we have thus caught a 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.740
 little bit more than it was not bad at all 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.840
 the boys, we have achieved the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.400
 victory we have stayed to nothing of 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.470
 get two stars the truth that 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.030
 it would be a little faithful this part but good 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.170
 it's been a good attack guys the truth 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.000
 is that we have got a good booty 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.140
