00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.560
 very good friends to burn the then to 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.260
 to locate and this is going to be a video 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.930
 very short just to show you 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.740
 as you can see, we're here for franklin here in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.470
 the sea are the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.840
 11 at night in the game 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.640
 we are pretty far away from the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.890
 As you can see, the moon has already risen and 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.910
 such and what I have come is to seek 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.579
 sharks 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.989
 I want to see sharks 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.810
 because I think there are sharks in the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.670
 fire but be towards the deepest 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.670
 so my goal now is to find 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.880
 the safest thing is that they eat us but 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.390
 well at least we want 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.390
 we have a heart 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.210
 a lot of light outside 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.210
 enough to see a little 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.250
 I think we have moved far enough 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.500
 around here there must be some 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 Milk jo let's see the seabed 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 come on let's go there 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.190
 good as you see scares quite 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.270
 your 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.270
 this is the motorcycle 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.110
 franklin does not like too well 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.370
 because the current is carrying it 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.370
 he wants to be sure of what 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.010
 but we want to lie here without a motorcycle 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.650
 because we could be sure 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.200
 the thing 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.200
 a little around good there are fish 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.719
 Look, look, look, this is a tuna that 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.719
 I want sharks is a little fish of nothing 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.479
 It's worth the motorcycle fuck 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.479
 oysters something has happened to the side 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.040
 just passed love by the side 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.160
 so it is that the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.160
 Uncle current 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.990
 that is, it is lasting, you have seen no 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.940
 salt salt of salt salt here I knew 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.350
 I knew there was something next 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 correct to the motorcycle 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.630
 to the unfortunate bike right back 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.599
 good 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.120
 good good, but what I wanted was 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.120
 a meeting out of the water 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.190
 well as I said it was a very video 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.070
 very brief but I just wanted to 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.230
 show you this nonsense I hope that you 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.030
 have liked nothing has no interest 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.630
 simply because you see how are the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.240
 sharks we have found sharks 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.040
 and a little more I hope you liked it 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.720
