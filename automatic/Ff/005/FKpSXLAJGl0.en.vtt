00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
set that to cut in my software I also

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.249 
set that to cut in my software I also
made<00:01:32.310> sure<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.880> words<00:01:33.210> were<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:34.110> an

made sure that these words were about an
inch<00:01:34.439> tall<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.430> plant<00:01:36.000> stakes<00:01:36.329> are

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
inch tall because the plant stakes are

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.410 
inch tall because the plant stakes are
about<00:01:36.840> an<00:01:36.990> inch<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> quarter<00:01:37.770> thick<00:01:38.420> you're

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
about an inch and a quarter thick you're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.670 
about an inch and a quarter thick you're
gonna<00:01:39.540> need<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> measure<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.140> own<00:01:40.380> plant

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
gonna need to measure your own plant

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.889 
gonna need to measure your own plant
stakes<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.310> how<00:01:41.430> thick<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.630> use

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
stakes to see how thick they are so use

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.539 
stakes to see how thick they are so use
some<00:01:43.079> scissors<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> cut<00:01:43.649> apart<00:01:43.979> all<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
some scissors to cut apart all of the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.389 
some scissors to cut apart all of the
words<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> vinyl<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.590> used<00:01:47.189> some

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
words on the vinyl and then I used some

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.319 
words on the vinyl and then I used some
tweezers<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:49.020> weed<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.280> letters<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tweezers to weed out the letters so

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.389 
tweezers to weed out the letters so
weeding<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> where<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.439> pull<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.159> parts

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
weeding is where you pull out the parts

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.700 
weeding is where you pull out the parts
