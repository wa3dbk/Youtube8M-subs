00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
fights in that fight he lost the babbly

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.140 
fights in that fight he lost the babbly
was<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> very<00:02:26.140> tight<00:02:26.440> fight<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.700> yes<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.030> could

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
was a very tight fight and yes you could

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.900 
was a very tight fight and yes you could
say<00:02:28.209> Taylor<00:02:28.569> won<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.020> by<00:02:29.140> around<00:02:29.530> or<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.160> draw<00:02:30.550> if

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
say Taylor won it by around or a draw if

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.880 
say Taylor won it by around or a draw if
you<00:02:31.180> think<00:02:31.600> Taylor<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.319> can<00:02:32.500> see<00:02:32.709> that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
you think Taylor one and I can see that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.130 
you think Taylor one and I can see that
I<00:02:32.920> thought<00:02:33.280> Pavlik<00:02:33.760> hurt<00:02:34.390> him<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.750> 10th<00:02:34.989> or

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
I thought Pavlik hurt him in the 10th or

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.570 
I thought Pavlik hurt him in the 10th or
11th<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.709> that's<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.190> was<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> difference

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
11th so that's that was the difference

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.860 
11th so that's that was the difference
of<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.910> fight<00:02:37.239> but<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.610> as<00:02:39.760> far<00:02:39.940> as<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.480> far<00:02:40.540> as

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
of the fight but but as far as as far as

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.960 
of the fight but but as far as as far as
the<00:02:41.019> Taylor<00:02:41.350> goes<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.980> gotta<00:02:42.220> respect<00:02:42.700> him

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the Taylor goes you gotta respect him

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.870 
the Taylor goes you gotta respect him
and<00:02:43.350> know<00:02:44.350> he<00:02:44.470> gets<00:02:44.769> off<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.069> fast<00:02:45.310> starts<00:02:45.730> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and know he gets off the fast starts and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.580 
and know he gets off the fast starts and
a<00:02:45.910> lot<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.030> people<00:02:46.150> say<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.290> his<00:02:47.380> last

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
a lot of people say like in his last

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.740 
a lot of people say like in his last
fight<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.130> he<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.489> won't<00:02:48.730> use<00:02:48.910> fatigue<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
fight that he just won't use fatigue the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.809 
fight that he just won't use fatigue the
end<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.080> fight<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.680> think<00:02:51.069> getting<00:02:51.220> 11<00:02:51.670> and

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
end of the fight I think getting 11 and

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.340 
end of the fight I think getting 11 and
12<00:02:52.060> from<00:02:52.330> when<00:02:52.540> he<00:02:52.569> was<00:02:52.690> really<00:02:53.080> running

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
12 from when he was really running

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.410 
12 from when he was really running
around<00:02:53.830> then<00:02:54.069> he<00:02:54.160> got<00:02:54.280> more<00:02:54.489> fatigued<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.360> i

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
around then he got more fatigued but i

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.809 
around then he got more fatigued but i
think<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:55.810> mental<00:02:56.290> fatigue<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.310> when<00:02:57.760> he

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
think it's mental fatigue and when he

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.479 
think it's mental fatigue and when he
starts<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.330> get<00:02:58.450> hit<00:02:58.840> then<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.650> all<00:02:59.860> comes<00:03:00.310> back

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
starts to get hit then it all comes back

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.699 
starts to get hit then it all comes back
to<00:03:00.700> him<00:03:01.000> both<00:03:01.180> those<00:03:01.510> knockouts<00:03:01.959> obviously

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
to him both those knockouts obviously

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.259 
to him both those knockouts obviously
his<00:03:02.799> last<00:03:03.040> knockout<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.760> knockout<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
his last knockout in the knockout the

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.990 
his last knockout in the knockout the
pavlik<00:03:04.750> i<00:03:05.070> just<00:03:06.070> think<00:03:06.310> that's<00:03:06.549> actually

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
pavlik i just think that's actually

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.030 
pavlik i just think that's actually
what's<00:03:07.570> messing<00:03:08.049> with<00:03:08.260> him<00:03:08.410> i<00:03:08.560> don't<00:03:08.650> i<00:03:08.980> don't

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
what's messing with him i don't i don't

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.770

because he look you look pretty good
shape<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.530> rematch<00:03:11.860> against<00:03:12.220> Kelly<00:03:12.489> any

so<00:03:15.519> like<00:03:15.820> I<00:03:15.910> said<00:03:15.970> he<00:03:16.209> did<00:03:16.420> look<00:03:16.570> tired<00:03:16.840> in

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
so like I said he did look tired in

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.440 
so like I said he did look tired in
those<00:03:17.170> last<00:03:17.380> two<00:03:17.709> rounds<00:03:17.880> but<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:18.940> was<00:03:19.299> more

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
those last two rounds but I was more

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.280 
those last two rounds but I was more
Froch<00:03:19.900> being<00:03:20.680> more<00:03:20.859> effective<00:03:21.310> than<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.820> was

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
Froch being more effective than it was

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.020 
Froch being more effective than it was
Taylor<00:03:23.290> being<00:03:23.560> tired<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.280> think<00:03:24.640> he's<00:03:24.760> mentally

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
Taylor being tired I think he's mentally

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
Taylor being tired I think he's mentally
a<00:03:25.359> little<00:03:25.660> messed<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:26.049> from<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.709> when

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
a little messed up from it and when

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.979 
a little messed up from it and when
things<00:03:27.489> don't<00:03:27.730> both<00:03:27.940> wait<00:03:28.299> he<00:03:28.690> kind<00:03:28.930> of

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
things don't both wait he kind of

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.810 
things don't both wait he kind of
reverts<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.440> his<00:03:29.560> old<00:03:29.829> style<00:03:30.160> we<00:03:30.400> know<00:03:30.549> his<00:03:30.670> old

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.980 
but he leap type of fighter and I know
Jermain<00:05:16.040> Taylor<00:05:16.280> is<00:05:16.700> elite<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.540> then<00:05:17.750> like<00:05:17.960> I

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
Jermain Taylor is elite and then like I

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.690 
Jermain Taylor is elite and then like I
said<00:05:18.140> be<00:05:18.500> lovin<00:05:18.890> right<00:05:19.010> there<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:19.580> he's

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
said be lovin right there but he's

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.310 
said be lovin right there but he's
definitely<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.180> best<00:05:20.419> fighter<00:05:20.660> ii<00:05:20.780> spot<00:05:21.080> I

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
definitely the best fighter ii spot I

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.200 
definitely the best fighter ii spot I
think<00:05:21.620> we<00:05:21.770> can<00:05:21.919> all<00:05:22.040> agree<00:05:22.100> on<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.490> and

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
think we can all agree on that and

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.300 
think we can all agree on that and
here's<00:05:24.110> what<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.380> like<00:05:24.620> about<00:05:24.650> Arthur<00:05:25.190> Abraham

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
here's what I like about Arthur Abraham

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.920 
here's what I like about Arthur Abraham
and<00:05:25.669> I'm<00:05:25.730> actually<00:05:25.940> leaning<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.720> him

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
and I'm actually leaning to him

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.690 
and I'm actually leaning to him
obviously<00:05:27.860> I'm<00:05:27.950> not<00:05:28.010> going<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.310> predict<00:05:28.640> the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
obviously I'm not going to predict the

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.920 
obviously I'm not going to predict the
winner<00:05:28.910> of<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.180> whole<00:05:29.300> tournament<00:05:29.690> because

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
winner of the whole tournament because

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.510 
winner of the whole tournament because
this<00:05:30.169> is<00:05:30.290> just<00:05:30.350> a<00:05:30.590> one<00:05:30.800> fighter<00:05:31.040> addition<00:05:31.430> when

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
this is just a one fighter addition when

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.900 
this is just a one fighter addition when
we<00:05:31.610> seem<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:32.030> have<00:05:32.060> time<00:05:32.919> but<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:33.980> like<00:05:34.370> after<00:05:34.880> a

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
we seem to have time but I like after a

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.000 
we seem to have time but I like after a
wreck<00:05:35.270> because<00:05:35.390> he's<00:05:35.660> very<00:05:36.169> patient<00:05:36.440> he<00:05:36.740> keeps

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
wreck because he's very patient he keeps

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.600 
wreck because he's very patient he keeps
the<00:05:37.160> hands<00:05:37.520> really<00:05:37.820> high<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.440> he's<00:05:39.440> got<00:05:39.680> good

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
the hands really high and he's got good

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.720 
the hands really high and he's got good
hand<00:05:40.880> speed<00:05:41.030> in<00:05:41.510> a<00:05:41.990> lot<00:05:42.260> of<00:05:42.290> power<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:43.010> that's

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
hand speed in a lot of power and that's

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.730 
hand speed in a lot of power and that's
where<00:05:43.970> I<00:05:44.000> think<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.600> difference<00:05:44.870> is<00:05:45.200> Taylor

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
where I think the difference is Taylor

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.130 
where I think the difference is Taylor
actually<00:05:46.160> in<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.430> press<00:05:46.700> conference<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.419> think

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
actually in the press conference I think

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.320 
actually in the press conference I think
he<00:05:48.290> kind<00:05:48.800> of<00:05:48.919> said<00:05:49.340> some<00:05:49.610> stuff<00:05:49.850> that<00:05:49.910> I<00:05:50.120> was

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
he kind of said some stuff that I was

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.790 
he kind of said some stuff that I was
like<00:05:50.540> really<00:05:50.810> like<00:05:51.110> you're<00:05:51.290> already<00:05:51.470> mentally

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
like really like you're already mentally

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.400 
like really like you're already mentally
saying<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:52.700> he<00:05:52.910> was<00:05:53.030> saying<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.480> Abraham

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
saying that he was saying that Abraham

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.260 
saying that he was saying that Abraham
just<00:05:54.620> a<00:05:54.710> brawler<00:05:55.010> he<00:05:55.280> comes<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.790> you<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.000> fight

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
just a brawler he comes to you to fight

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.570 
just a brawler he comes to you to fight
you<00:05:56.990> know<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:57.290> actually<00:05:57.410> Andre<00:05:57.890> Darrell<00:05:58.280> said

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
you know and actually Andre Darrell said

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.460 
you know and actually Andre Darrell said
it's<00:05:58.760> smarter<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.270> know<00:05:59.390> he's<00:05:59.960> got<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.290> best

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
it's smarter you know he's got the best

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.120 
it's smarter you know he's got the best
defense<00:06:00.950> besides<00:06:01.340> you<00:06:01.460> andre<00:06:01.790> ward<00:06:02.090> in<00:06:02.720> in<00:06:03.590> the

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
defense besides you andre ward in in the

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.090 
defense besides you andre ward in in the
whole<00:06:04.280> term<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:05.750> andre<00:06:06.110> ward<00:06:06.350> we<00:06:06.650> don't<00:06:06.890> know

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
whole term and andre ward we don't know

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.460 
whole term and andre ward we don't know
all<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.520> way<00:06:08.030> his<00:06:08.240> defense<00:06:08.690> yet<00:06:08.990> because<00:06:09.350> he

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
all the way his defense yet because he

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.030 
all the way his defense yet because he
hasn't<00:06:09.650> faced<00:06:10.160> top<00:06:10.640> top<00:06:11.500> fighters<00:06:12.500> yet<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:12.919> we

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
hasn't faced top top fighters yet so we

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.529 
hasn't faced top top fighters yet so we
don't<00:06:13.070> know<00:06:13.310> if<00:06:13.580> that<00:06:13.760> defense<00:06:14.180> is<00:06:14.330> good

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
don't know if that defense is good

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.020 
don't know if that defense is good
against<00:06:14.900> subpar<00:06:15.800> good<00:06:16.520> average<00:06:16.820> fighters<00:06:17.360> 22

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
against subpar good average fighters 22

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.000 
against subpar good average fighters 22
above<00:06:18.150> average<00:06:18.330> fighters<00:06:18.870> you<00:06:19.560> never<00:06:19.770> don't

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
above average fighters you never don't

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.800 
above average fighters you never don't
so<00:06:20.190> it<00:06:20.310> gets<00:06:20.430> in<00:06:20.610> there<00:06:20.760> was<00:06:20.910> somebody<00:06:21.120> really

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
so it gets in there was somebody really

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.680 
so it gets in there was somebody really
good<00:06:22.110> so<00:06:23.010> I<00:06:23.040> was<00:06:23.250> our<00:06:23.340> Abraham<00:06:23.700> I<00:06:23.880> think<00:06:24.240> the

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
good so I was our Abraham I think the

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.060 
good so I was our Abraham I think the
difference<00:06:25.080> in<00:06:25.230> this<00:06:25.350> fight<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.710> it<00:06:25.830> could<00:06:25.980> go

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
difference in this fight and it could go

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.620 
difference in this fight and it could go
either<00:06:26.100> way<00:06:26.340> night<00:06:26.730> like<00:06:26.970> I<00:06:27.090> said<00:06:27.150> in<00:06:27.450> another

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
either way night like I said in another

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.750 
either way night like I said in another
video<00:06:27.930> I<00:06:28.080> think<00:06:28.320> my<00:06:28.380> last<00:06:28.620> video<00:06:28.950> sure<00:06:29.580> if

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
video I think my last video sure if

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.490 
video I think my last video sure if
Jermain<00:06:30.120> Taylor<00:06:30.330> does<00:06:30.690> win<00:06:30.900> this<00:06:31.020> fight<00:06:31.290> I

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
Jermain Taylor does win this fight I

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.550 
Jermain Taylor does win this fight I
believe<00:06:32.010> he<00:06:32.190> will<00:06:32.370> win<00:06:32.670> the<00:06:32.970> whole<00:06:33.060> tournament

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
believe he will win the whole tournament

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.900 
believe he will win the whole tournament
even<00:06:34.560> though<00:06:34.770> I<00:06:34.800> I<00:06:35.190> know<00:06:35.340> he's<00:06:35.550> been<00:06:35.700> knocked

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
even though I I know he's been knocked

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.360 
even though I I know he's been knocked
out<00:06:36.060> twice<00:06:36.420> and<00:06:36.690> all<00:06:36.840> that<00:06:37.050> but<00:06:37.650> if<00:06:37.830> he<00:06:38.070> beats

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
out twice and all that but if he beats

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.490 
out twice and all that but if he beats
Abraham<00:06:38.910> the<00:06:39.120> guy<00:06:39.270> who<00:06:39.330> has<00:06:39.630> really<00:06:40.380> good

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
Abraham the guy who has really good

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.710 
Abraham the guy who has really good
defense<00:06:40.920> in<00:06:41.070> power<00:06:41.460> that<00:06:42.180> would<00:06:42.330> give<00:06:42.480> him<00:06:42.690> the

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
defense in power that would give him the

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.020 
defense in power that would give him the
confidence<00:06:43.080> boost<00:06:43.500> I<00:06:43.770> think<00:06:44.010> he<00:06:44.190> needs<00:06:44.340> but<00:06:45.000> I

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
confidence boost I think he needs but I

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.540 
confidence boost I think he needs but I
do<00:06:45.150> see<00:06:45.720> Abraham<00:06:46.260> winning<00:06:46.770> this<00:06:46.950> fight<00:06:47.280> in

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550

of<00:06:56.940> my<00:06:57.000> take<00:06:57.240> on<00:06:57.420> it<00:06:57.480> so<00:06:57.690> I<00:06:57.720> think<00:06:57.990> dr.<00:06:58.200> Abraham

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
of my take on it so I think dr. Abraham

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
with like I said the power to back up

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.980 
with like I said the power to back up
Taylor<00:07:02.160> and<00:07:02.340> the<00:07:02.370> defense<00:07:03.000> it's<00:07:03.600> not<00:07:03.720> easy

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
Taylor and the defense it's not easy

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.380 
Taylor and the defense it's not easy
just<00:07:04.320> to<00:07:04.470> get<00:07:04.650> on<00:07:04.680> it<00:07:05.010> and<00:07:05.370> he's<00:07:05.940> very<00:07:06.180> patient

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
just to get on it and he's very patient

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.300 
just to get on it and he's very patient
fighter<00:07:06.840> all<00:07:07.140> of<00:07:07.260> a<00:07:07.290> sudden<00:07:07.320> the<00:07:07.650> punches<00:07:08.070> you

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
know he may fight kind of n so so style

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.400 
know he may fight kind of n so so style
like<00:07:12.630> I<00:07:12.780> say<00:07:12.930> boring<00:07:13.290> but<00:07:13.980> like<00:07:14.130> a<00:07:14.160> so-so<00:07:14.490> style

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
like I say boring but like a so-so style

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.440 
like I say boring but like a so-so style
for<00:07:16.410> like<00:07:16.560> four<00:07:16.800> rounds<00:07:17.370> and<00:07:17.520> you<00:07:18.210> can<00:07:18.300> come

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
for like four rounds and you can come

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.880 
for like four rounds and you can come
down<00:07:18.480> into<00:07:18.780> him<00:07:18.990> um<00:07:19.490> men<00:07:20.490> and<00:07:21.620> and<00:07:22.620> then<00:07:22.740> also

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890

Lake<00:07:50.850> ale<00:07:51.120> but<00:07:51.390> I<00:07:51.450> think<00:07:51.720> it<00:07:51.840> I<00:07:52.260> don't<00:07:53.250> know

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.340
