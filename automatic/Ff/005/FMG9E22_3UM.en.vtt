00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
like a tack speed like hyper stones as

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.340 
like a tack speed like hyper stones as
you<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.730> see<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.060> basic<00:03:07.810> attack<00:03:07.959> speed<00:03:08.200> with

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
you can see the basic attack speed with

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.640 
you can see the basic attack speed with
this<00:03:08.470> mod<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:09.070> very<00:03:09.400> slow<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.900> if<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.380> have

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
this mod on is very slow but if you have

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.030 
this mod on is very slow but if you have
a<00:03:11.920> hyper<00:03:12.250> stone<00:03:12.640> or<00:03:12.880> three<00:03:13.420> hyper<00:03:13.600> stones<00:03:14.040> you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
a hyper stone or three hyper stones you

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800 
a hyper stone or three hyper stones you
can<00:03:15.190> see<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.700> goes<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.910> little<00:03:16.030> bit<00:03:16.180> faster<00:03:16.390> and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
can see it goes a little bit faster and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.990 
can see it goes a little bit faster and
I<00:03:17.440> believe<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:17.920> adjusted<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.430> fit<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.850> dota

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
I believe it is adjusted to fit the dota

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.150 
I believe it is adjusted to fit the dota
2<00:03:19.120> attack<00:03:19.510> speed<00:03:19.780> like<00:03:20.140> there<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.709> base

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
2 attack speed like there is a base
