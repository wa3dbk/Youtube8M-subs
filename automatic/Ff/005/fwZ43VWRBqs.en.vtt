00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.949
 Ah 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.050
 U 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:28.880
 People say that society only knows what they know. 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:32.619
 It is said that it is heard only after what a wicked Seo Hee does . 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:39.190
 Right now I mean 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:43.420
 A lot of living stories that can not be ignored because of the fact that they just do not know 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.670
 Wisdom of life or business ideas 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:53.840
 I was afraid I might miss it . 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.840
 That was the reason I chose to air when I was getting older 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.339
 By the way, when I came into this school, 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.339
 It was helpful to me 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.570
 Academic political equation 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.210
 Rather, it gets a little darkness. 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.950
 In a difficult environment 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:20.960
 I am convinced of future success without releasing a cord to future hope 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:25.030
 Looking at the posture of living such 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.030
 The hand has been a merit arm 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.620
 53 people we love 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:38.130
 Alumni do not do it once. 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.130
 In it, I felt my pride. 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:56.070
 Perhaps at any time 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.070
 I am proud to ask anyone 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:16.630
 I'm a writer . 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:19.150
 The motive will be that even though I do not have a forest , 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.680
 In that 40-year history of Daekyo 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.220
 If you can do it, think big and think 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.489
 Implementation of advanced first-rate country and Korea Nuri 2 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:37.079
 So that our broadcasting stations can 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:40.049
 As the best part of everywhere, animals and nations for low-income schools 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.620
 Let's work hard for development. 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.620
 thank you
