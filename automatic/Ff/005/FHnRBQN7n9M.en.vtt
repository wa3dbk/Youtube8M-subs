a<00:03:09.360> lot<00:03:09.570> thinner<00:03:09.900> than<00:03:10.200> most<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.769> other

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.050 
a lot thinner than most of the other
figures<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.700> guess<00:03:11.940> that's

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
figures but I guess that's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.940 
figures but I guess that's
understandable<00:03:12.239> considering<00:03:13.170> his<00:03:13.680> legs

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
understandable considering his legs

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.590 
understandable considering his legs
aren't<00:03:14.250> armored<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:14.970> most<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.450> other

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600

riders our basic pose ability all around
his<00:03:22.890> arms<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.489> get<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> little<00:03:23.970> bit<00:03:24.090> better

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
his arms can get a little bit better

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.820 
his arms can get a little bit better
pose<00:03:24.570> ability<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.050> some<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.410> them<00:03:25.530> because

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
pose ability and some of them because

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.330 
pose ability and some of them because
the<00:03:25.950> shoulder<00:03:26.310> pads<00:03:26.580> are<00:03:26.850> connected<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
the shoulder pads are connected to the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.960 
the shoulder pads are connected to the
arm<00:03:29.340> joint<00:03:30.180> right<00:03:30.450> here<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.650> he<00:03:32.100> can<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.340> okay

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
arm joint right here so he can go okay

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.729 
arm joint right here so he can go okay
pretty<00:03:33.239> much<00:03:33.390> all<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.630> way<00:03:33.690> around<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.290> do

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
pretty much all the way around and do

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.020 
pretty much all the way around and do
really<00:03:34.980> weird<00:03:35.130> things<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> shoulders

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
really weird things to the shoulders

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.400 
really weird things to the shoulders
that<00:03:36.239> most<00:03:36.450> human<00:03:36.780> beings<00:03:36.810> wouldn't<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.320> able

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
that most human beings wouldn't be able

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.820 
that most human beings wouldn't be able
to<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.630> that's<00:03:39.780> cool<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.080> guess<00:03:40.320> belt

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
to do so that's cool I guess belt

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.560 
to do so that's cool I guess belt
detailing<00:03:41.430> was<00:03:41.549> pretty<00:03:41.940> much<00:03:42.090> spot-on

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
detailing was pretty much spot-on

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.190 
detailing was pretty much spot-on
-<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:44.000> all-around<00:03:45.000> excellent<00:03:45.600> marks<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.110> this

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
- so all-around excellent marks for this

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.870 
- so all-around excellent marks for this
figure<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.620> wish<00:03:46.950> he<00:03:47.070> came<00:03:47.220> with<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> weapon<00:03:47.730> but

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
figure I wish he came with a weapon but

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.670 
figure I wish he came with a weapon but
he<00:03:47.970> doesn't<00:03:48.239> have<00:03:48.420> one<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.840> come<00:03:49.049> with<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.650> I

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
he doesn't have one to come with so I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.199 
he doesn't have one to come with so I
guess<00:03:50.040> it's<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.610> really<00:03:50.850> anything<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.120> can

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
guess it's not really anything you can

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.840 
guess it's not really anything you can
mark<00:03:51.510> them<00:03:51.690> down<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:52.489> let's<00:03:53.489> find<00:03:53.730> that

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
mark them down for let's find that

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.520 
mark them down for let's find that
thumbs<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.269> hand<00:03:54.540> there<00:03:57.080> alright<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.140> here's

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
the thumbs up and he still he does he

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.070 
the thumbs up and he still he does he
have<00:04:01.650> another<00:04:01.890> one<00:04:02.130> darn<00:04:02.700> he<00:04:02.970> doesn't<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.480> would

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
have another one darn he doesn't I would

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.600 
have another one darn he doesn't I would
totally<00:04:04.200> make<00:04:04.380> him<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.739> like<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.040> Fonzie<00:04:05.430> pose

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610

totally make him do like the Fonzie pose
or<00:04:05.820> something<00:04:06.260> but<00:04:07.260> um<00:04:08.180> basically<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.630> think

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
or something but um basically I think

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.710 
or something but um basically I think
those<00:04:10.350> are<00:04:10.560> his<00:04:10.709> tension<00:04:11.130> pose<00:04:11.569> hands<00:04:12.569> at

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
those are his tension pose hands at

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.130 
those are his tension pose hands at
least<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.050> one<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:14.390> this<00:04:15.390> one<00:04:15.569> probably<00:04:15.810> is

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.059 
I haven't seen googa like his own show
just<00:04:20.209> what<00:04:21.209> he<00:04:21.539> wasn't<00:04:21.900> decayed<00:04:22.530> which<00:04:22.770> was

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:23.069 
just what he wasn't decayed which was

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:28.159 
just what he wasn't decayed which was
pretty<00:04:23.280> much<00:04:23.370> crap<00:04:26.389> so<00:04:27.389> bear<00:04:27.780> with<00:04:27.810> me<00:04:27.990> here

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
but I will definitely be watching Kouga

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.589 
but I will definitely be watching Kouga
pretty<00:04:30.840> soon<00:04:31.490> I'm<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.580> lot<00:04:32.819> of<00:04:32.849> people<00:04:33.419> are

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
pretty soon I'm a lot of people are

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:34.760 
pretty soon I'm a lot of people are
selling<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.199> right<00:04:34.380> now

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770

so hopefully one of them actually gets

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.900 
so hopefully one of them actually gets
off<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.650> ground<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:38.039> finishes<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.520> entire

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
apparently Kouga doesn't like molesting

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.110 
apparently Kouga doesn't like molesting
people<00:04:50.900> what<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:51.930> shame
