00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
to your film and tear meniscus SS hello

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.929 
to your film and tear meniscus SS hello
we're<00:00:30.829> going<00:00:30.859> to<00:00:31.009> look<00:00:31.189> at<00:00:31.279> your<00:00:31.399> tear<00:00:31.640> film

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
we're going to look at your tear film

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.580 
we're going to look at your tear film
today<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:32.269> if<00:00:32.540> you'd<00:00:32.689> like<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:32.989> put<00:00:33.140> your<00:00:33.170> chin

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
today so if you'd like to put your chin

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.530 
today so if you'd like to put your chin
forward<00:00:33.829> on<00:00:34.190> there<00:00:34.399> for<00:00:34.699> me<00:00:34.850> that's<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:35.420> and

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
forward on there for me that's it and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.780 
forward on there for me that's it and
lean<00:00:35.750> in<00:00:35.930> again<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.409> bar<00:00:36.620> okay<00:00:37.280> don't

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
lean in again to the bar okay don't

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.189 
lean in again to the bar okay don't
worry<00:00:37.940> if<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:38.210> blink<00:00:38.510> but<00:00:38.780> just<00:00:39.019> look

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
worry if you blink but just look

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.000 
worry if you blink but just look
straight<00:00:39.500> ahead<00:00:41.230> now<00:00:42.230> we<00:00:42.290> have<00:00:42.470> a<00:00:42.500> general

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
straight ahead now we have a general

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.119 
straight ahead now we have a general
look<00:00:43.190> at<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:43.550> eye<00:00:43.579> first<00:00:44.089> and<00:00:44.649> you<00:00:45.649> can<00:00:45.860> see

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
look at the eye first and you can see

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.819 
look at the eye first and you can see
there<00:00:46.370> at<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.610> rim<00:00:46.909> of<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.239> lower<00:00:47.449> lid<00:00:47.839> you

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
there at the rim of the lower lid you

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.939 
there at the rim of the lower lid you
can<00:00:48.860> see<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.460> tear<00:00:49.699> film<00:00:49.729> meniscus<00:00:50.800> you<00:00:51.800> can

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
can see the tear film meniscus you can

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.160 
can see the tear film meniscus you can
see<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.189> very<00:00:52.430> small<00:00:52.850> reflection<00:00:53.180> just

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
see that very small reflection just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.229 
see that very small reflection just
represents<00:00:54.799> that<00:00:54.979> small<00:00:55.309> river<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.850> fluid

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
represents that small river of fluid

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.469 
represents that small river of fluid
that<00:00:56.960> sits<00:00:57.260> along<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.589> lower<00:00:57.830> lid<00:00:58.070> margin<00:00:58.479> now

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
that sits along the lower lid margin now

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.600 
that sits along the lower lid margin now
if<00:00:59.629> we<00:00:59.780> increase<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.439> magnification<00:01:00.799> there

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
if we increase the magnification there

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.940 
if we increase the magnification there
slightly<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:05.540> can<00:01:05.570> see<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.259> more<00:01:06.439> detail

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
slightly you can see it in more detail

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.179 
slightly you can see it in more detail
just<00:01:07.549> put<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.759> little<00:01:08.030> bit<00:01:08.150> more<00:01:08.420> light<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:10.100> we

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
just put a little bit more light and we

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.480 
just put a little bit more light and we
can<00:01:10.369> see<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.240> represents<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:13.220> tear

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
can see that that represents the tear

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.520 
can see that that represents the tear
film<00:01:13.549> sitting<00:01:14.270> along<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.630> lower<00:01:14.990> eyelid

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
film sitting along the lower eyelid

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.870 
film sitting along the lower eyelid
margin<00:01:16.869> now<00:01:17.869> this<00:01:18.650> represents<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.430> diffuse

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
margin now this represents a diffuse

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.819 
margin now this represents a diffuse
image<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.630> area<00:01:20.960> but<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.650> actually

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
image of that area but to actually

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.270 
image of that area but to actually
measure<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:22.899> I'd<00:01:23.899> have<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.350> go<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.890> narrow

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
measure it I'd have to go to a narrow

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.219 
measure it I'd have to go to a narrow
beam<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.119> using<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.109> slipped<00:01:27.469> beam<00:01:27.799> here<00:01:29.229> now

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
beam and using a slipped beam here now

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.050 
beam and using a slipped beam here now
this<00:01:30.380> almost<00:01:30.679> gives<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.130> cross-sectional<00:01:31.999> view

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
this almost gives a cross-sectional view

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.039 
this almost gives a cross-sectional view
of<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.049> two<00:01:33.259> meniscus<00:01:33.859> in<00:01:34.460> shot<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.749> look<00:01:35.929> at

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
of the two meniscus in shot and look at

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.440 
of the two meniscus in shot and look at
the<00:01:36.170> meniscus<00:01:36.679> in<00:01:37.179> profile<00:01:38.179> there<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:39.020> I

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
the meniscus in profile there I can I

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.739 
the meniscus in profile there I can I
can<00:01:41.450> change<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:42.049> height<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.710> beam<00:01:42.920> to

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
can change the height of the beam to

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.899 
can change the height of the beam to
give<00:01:44.749> me<00:01:44.899> some<00:01:45.200> way<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.619> estimating<00:01:45.889> that<00:01:46.579> tear

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
give me some way of estimating that tear

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.899 
give me some way of estimating that tear
meniscus<00:01:47.420> height

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.389 

put<00:01:50.749> down<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.109> slit-lamp<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.799> can<00:01:52.069> actually

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
put down the slit-lamp I can actually

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.580 
put down the slit-lamp I can actually
compare<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.909> height<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.509> my<00:01:53.689> beam<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
compare the height of my beam to the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.870 
compare the height of my beam to the
meniscus<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.369> see<00:01:55.819> I<00:01:57.009> can<00:01:58.009> also<00:01:58.250> if<00:01:58.729> I

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
meniscus that I see I can also if I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.310 
meniscus that I see I can also if I
choose<00:01:59.560> turn<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.770> beam<00:02:01.780> horizontal

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.240 

and<00:02:06.640> use<00:02:07.640> beamwidth<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.290> similar<00:02:09.710> way<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:09.920> I

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and use beamwidth in a similar way so I

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.650 
and use beamwidth in a similar way so I
can<00:02:10.310> widen<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.210> I<00:02:11.330> can<00:02:11.600> narrow<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.590> beam<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
can widen and I can narrow the beam to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.600 
can widen and I can narrow the beam to
estimate<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.440> two<00:02:15.680> meniscus<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.280> helps

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
estimate that two meniscus and it helps

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.370 
estimate that two meniscus and it helps
actually<00:02:20.030> at<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.210> point<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.810> make<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.050> nice

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
actually at this point if I make it nice

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:33.200 
actually at this point if I make it nice
and<00:02:21.410> short<00:02:21.860> as<00:02:22.250> well<00:02:22.490> with<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> horizontal<00:02:23.960> beam

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:43.660 

you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.520 

we've<00:02:44.210> been<00:02:44.360> still<00:02:44.630> fluorescein<00:02:45.200> into<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
we've been still fluorescein into the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.700 
eye and we're now using blue light but
we're<00:02:47.540> having<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.840> diffuse<00:02:48.200> view<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.680> can

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
we're having a diffuse view and you can

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.360 
we're having a diffuse view and you can
see<00:02:48.890> Vande<00:02:49.550> without<00:02:50.450> an<00:02:50.660> akan<00:02:51.650> test<00:02:51.860> filter<00:02:52.220> in

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
see Vande without an akan test filter in

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.310 
see Vande without an akan test filter in
place<00:02:52.640> we<00:02:52.910> can<00:02:53.030> see<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.510> meniscus<00:02:54.050> is

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
place we can see the meniscus is

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.110 
place we can see the meniscus is
enhanced<00:02:54.890> by<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.070> view<00:02:55.280> if<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:55.820> put<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
enhanced by the view if we put the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.140 
enhanced by the view if we put the
filter<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:57.220> we<00:02:58.220> can<00:02:58.400> see<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.700> even<00:02:58.850> more

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
filter in we can see it even more

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.870 
filter in we can see it even more
clearly<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.470> in<00:03:00.710> fact<00:03:00.890> if<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.190> increase<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
clearly and in fact if I increase the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.280 
clearly and in fact if I increase the
magnification<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:05.120> get<00:03:05.330> an<00:03:05.480> even<00:03:05.720> better<00:03:05.900> view

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
magnification we get an even better view

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.940 
magnification we get an even better view
of<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.860> area<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:08.510> see<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.810> as<00:03:08.960> it's<00:03:09.170> best<00:03:09.530> we

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
of that area to see it as it's best we

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.910 
of that area to see it as it's best we
really<00:03:10.280> need<00:03:10.490> a<00:03:10.520> beam<00:03:12.700> where<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.060> actually

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
really need a beam where we can actually

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.660 
really need a beam where we can actually
view<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.130> meniscus<00:03:16.610> more<00:03:16.850> clearly<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.610> you

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
view that meniscus more clearly so you

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.930 
view that meniscus more clearly so you
can<00:03:19.910> see<00:03:20.150> as<00:03:20.270> I<00:03:20.420> go<00:03:20.630> along<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.340> rim<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
can see as I go along the the rim of the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.780 
can see as I go along the the rim of the
lower<00:03:23.150> eyelid<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.470> can<00:03:24.680> see<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.160> meniscus

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
lower eyelid you can see that meniscus

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.990 
lower eyelid you can see that meniscus
there

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.150 

okay<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.320> bring<00:03:34.500> your<00:03:34.710> head<00:03:34.860> forward

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
okay so if you bring your head forward

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.470 
okay so if you bring your head forward
as<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:36.830> that's<00:03:37.970> okay

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.240 

so<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.900> can<00:03:43.080> see<00:03:43.260> there<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.740> center<00:03:44.220> of

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
so you can see there in the center of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.880 
so you can see there in the center of
the<00:03:44.460> shot<00:03:44.730> we're<00:03:45.090> using<00:03:45.320> specular<00:03:46.320> reflection

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the shot we're using specular reflection

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.830 
the shot we're using specular reflection
as<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> slit<00:03:47.340> lamp<00:03:47.460> technique<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.300> image<00:03:48.600> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
as a slit lamp technique to image the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.980 
as a slit lamp technique to image the
debris<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:50.000> we<00:03:51.000> can<00:03:51.210> visualize<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
debris that we can visualize in the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.900 
debris that we can visualize in the
normal<00:03:52.440> tear<00:03:52.650> film<00:03:52.950> floating<00:03:53.460> up<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.700> down

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
normal tear film floating up and down

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.330 
normal tear film floating up and down
with<00:03:54.120> every<00:03:54.360> blink

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
with every blink

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.030 
with every blink
this<00:03:56.340> really<00:03:56.580> has<00:03:56.790> qualitative<00:03:57.600> uses<00:03:58.110> not<00:03:58.830> so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
this really has qualitative uses not so

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800 
this really has qualitative uses not so
much<00:03:59.190> quantitative<00:03:59.910> for<00:04:00.090> research<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:00.780> we

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
much quantitative for research but we

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.170 
much quantitative for research but we
would<00:04:01.080> recognize<00:04:01.490> differences<00:04:02.490> clinically

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
would recognize differences clinically

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.000 
would recognize differences clinically
in<00:04:03.330> dry<00:04:03.600> eye<00:04:03.630> where<00:04:04.080> we<00:04:04.200> would<00:04:04.320> see<00:04:04.530> much<00:04:04.680> more

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
in dry eye where we would see much more

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:24.010 
in dry eye where we would see much more
of<00:04:05.190> this<00:04:05.310> debris

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.270 

you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.340 

you
