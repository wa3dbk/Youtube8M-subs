00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
car seat and it angles it just slightly

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
car seat and it angles it just slightly
so<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.770> doesn't<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.820> into<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
so that it doesn't really go into the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the space when it was rear-facing that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.010 
the space when it was rear-facing that
it<00:01:44.640> took<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.090> lot<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.240> space<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.899> have

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it took up a lot of space so if you have

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.520 
it took up a lot of space so if you have
a<00:01:46.049> smaller<00:01:46.409> car<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.020> might<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
a smaller car you know that might be a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.960 
a smaller car you know that might be a
little<00:01:49.710> bit<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.159> issue<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.670> wasn't<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
little bit of an issue it wasn't a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.700 
little bit of an issue it wasn't a
problem<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.390> me<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> angle<00:01:52.290> adjuster

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
problem for me but the angle adjuster

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
problem for me but the angle adjuster
