00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.809
 I am maura galeano I come from the city 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.580
 of crankcase department of canindeyÃº is 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 the first casting of my whole life is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.310
 sensational to know that privileged in the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.140
 selection and this of cold formation 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 war is making me an experience 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 particular amazing really fills you up 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.500
 first of satisfaction for being able to be 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.199
 part of this and second of much joy 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.260
 to do a service for god and for 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.649
 God 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.019
 of something that does not have no name 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.449
 for me and I'm living it from a 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.310
 way 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.270
 extraordinary 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.070
 is to know that we belong to a church 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.480
 the church that we love so much 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.880
 above all things because it is the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.250
 Church of our God is our Lord 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.510
 Jesus Christ and the truth 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.800
 I am very happy for all 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.800
 for participating 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.490
 and I introduced myself 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.829
 that 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.829
 Y 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.810
 the first days but not the first day 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.440
 I was a little hesitant but I have a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.780
 More than 26 years of co2 experience 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.780
 and in several forums then 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.189
 I'm going out there can be that if the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.009
 mind 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.150
 but the truth is that I did not think I was going to 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.500
 stay 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.170
 the presence of dad francisco 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.850
 he considered and I hope he leaves something 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.830
 some positive result 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.189
 in our town to give us 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.100
 realize that God really is 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.830
 present in our daily life that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.590
 now in something the Paraguayan begins to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.430
 think about the poorest in the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.040
 unprotected in the abandoned in the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.100
 forgotten 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.590
 It would be good if good to look at the dad 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.860
 the charisma of this gentleman if we have not 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.860
 changed 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.730
 because of the closeness it has with the town 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.920
 for all the simplicity that frames the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.640
 I think we have to learn from him 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.640
 make big 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.319
 in the best way 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.500
 then that makes this chorus with a 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.860
 too much energy and desire to do the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.750
 things well something different something new and 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.750
 something that really transmits to God
