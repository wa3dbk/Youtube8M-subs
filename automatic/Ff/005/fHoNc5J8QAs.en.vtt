00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.380
 to become one of the words divide them 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.450
 hello to all and all these sentences 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.240
 today we find ourselves for a sport 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.770
 on dofus and band uncle an opus that 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.990
 should appear by 2.269 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.070
 points hug - first of all I 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.279
 I want to apologize 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.480
 in my little voice as you know I 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.760
 angina so it's quite difficult 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.580
 for me to speak 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.990
 so suddenly a little spoil on it 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.629
 ask you to remember maybe 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.199
 so I'll put you some screen of this 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.629
 door that there was to brac marc and of 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.210
 episode 34.2 which rubim so it takes 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.910
 know so we will come back on these two 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.480
 little things there you have to know that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.350
 I did a lot of research 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.510
 several researches how do you say 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.219
 I did a lot of research on 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.410
 Hispanic forums on the forums 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 French and I found a lot of 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.230
 subjects so I propose my theory 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 we will return to baghran and we will 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.729
 also go back to episode 34.2 which 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.200
 rubim and so it's already a background 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.520
 you have to know that ball cave 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.940
 was a dragon that actually had in him 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.340
 three dofus so that the elders of the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.850
 world of the twelve had hidden so must 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.729
 know that the dragon agua briane in 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.580
 reality and the dragon of the dofus on what 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 if I'm not mistaken but is also the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.310
 dragon of one of the dofus who is not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 still existing so one of the dofus 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.659
 paramount which might be the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 dofus and ben simply because 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.240
 john so a demon so a demon 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.799
 Maleficent 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.000
 what would explain a little the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.650
 dofus and ben had done a trick with 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.140
 a nun so she is a beautiful woman 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.119
 see the beautiful woman who had flirted 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.009
 dragon and they managed to make a 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.880
 dofus a dofus as do not know the name 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.399
 and who in fact and well how 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.710
 you explain that to barjols the fly he 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.600
 broke with that since it's him 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.840
 who will capture the request the udc hoc 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.229
 allag through head shackles to 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.269
 click 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.880
 so here we have to go back in the episode 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.200
 34.2 who rubim for those who saw me 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.970
 personally I saw them or play 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.530
 actually gets locked up in this 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.269
 hindering so it's kind of a prison 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.030
 we can not move so we have them 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.040
 hands 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.560
 and the tied feet we have that the head that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.740
 can and that goes off with the name of 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.660
 the one we are silent so we must know 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.310
 that in the background dofus from me 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.069
 what I understood the name of the one that 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.640
 we are silent it's hugues our kayaks the word 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.530
 secret remains remains a mystery 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 on that one is a little past it 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.130
 so he was released by I know more 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.560
 what god so I invite you to go 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.970
 listen to the drivers will have to go secret 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.410
 I would put you saying the inscription 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.980
 so he was released and he stole the 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.370
 dofus 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.110
 so you have to know that there are 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.120
 more and more appearances with here is and 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.080
 to mike lowell and the gift and the demon 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.000
 kallag urns the last one was the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.890
 multis leads so you have to know that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.459
 each multiman elects a dofus 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.190
 primordial there are six primordial dofus 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:22.380
 excuse me so squale it's the dofus 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.360
 turquoise relief birth and purple dofus 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.799
 body hours I do not know what she knows 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.870
 maybe the ocher dofus good voila you 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.070
 see and so there is dofus hiwar she 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.810
 dofus and ben who did not have were 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.390
 appeared so the ivory dofus illuminates 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.680
 to the dofus islands and ben is so we brda 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.600
 almost according to my theory so 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.850
 normally seen as ivory dofus and dofus 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.989
 and ben are primordial dofus that do not 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.650
 have not appeared should appear 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.420
 soon you have to know that to brac 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.400
 marc there is a door that has not appeared 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.200
 and in relation to this map which is a 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.989
 spot so find on twitter on the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.340
 account of the area i left a spoil of the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.769
 version 2 points 19 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.280
 we see very clearly a dofus at 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.410
 level of brakmar so that means 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.060
 what does that mean? 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.280
 to say that means there will be everything 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.959
 simply a dofus to acquire so for 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.060
 me it's simply a continuation of 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.019
 quests since Ankama has decided not to 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.900
 acquire the dofus 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.370
 lino fuse by random drop and well 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.310
 by kate and well just it will be 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.110
 a quest with heresy a guy who well 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.710
 it will be necessary to go fight all 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.379
 simply the demon noc therefore to kallag 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.509
 brec'h marc with a series of quests that 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.860
 can go with the king to leicester because 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.190
 that the king alister this follow-up which has 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.430
 captured from nok kallag in his trap 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.729
 clap clip here is so anyway 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.550
 for me it will be a quest that will be very 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.680
 linked between the two cities brÃ¢kmar es good 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.460
 so you have to know that apart from the pvp 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.470
 1 v1 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.180
 there is a great story between these two 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.740
 cited that I invite you to watch 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.569
 always in the introductory episode 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.430
 secret tea books from elsewhere in the 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:05.060
 month of secrecy we will start reading 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.710
 the books and that's so that's it 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.050
 promises to be a very good quest 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:14.060
 bitching at the bottom level at the level of 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.580
 like the emerald dofus what is it 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.819
 on the other hand the g there by cons I do not 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.509
 will not advance me at all on the quality 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.949
 of g2 dofus must know that even 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.099
 the last two dofus we could the 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.469
 to see appear these opus a little multi 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.430
 leman with 20 damage the dofus of 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:34.069
 ice creams of damage in all 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.889
 elements and the almanac this 50 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:40.580
 characteristics so each element 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:43.340
 so the dofus and ben would be in my opinion 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.509
 therefore 5% resistance or strength will 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.830
 fixed in each element 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.610
 in any case it would be the logic of 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.259
 things after also know that shadow 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.810
 seen that shadow is directly related to 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.520
 dofus you have to know that his shadow is 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.930
 a dealer damage actually one that is going 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.759
 do a lot of damage among all the 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.440
 multis leads so after we can 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.180
 also expect maybe a big 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.430
 big dofus with a lot of 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.560
 features or even art can be 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.279
 even more power than dofus 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.650
 purple you never know so since he 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:15.150
 is an update that will appear 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.880
 this is April so with the 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.890
 search for secrets 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.030
 in fact we have a news that has appeared on 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.040
 dofus today so there are some 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.380
 people who disappear any good case 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.170
 we can really tie a lot of things to 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.530
 those people who disappear with 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.440
 our callac of dofus dofus and ben who 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.160
 appears and the treasures to find 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.320
 worldwide 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.590
 and quite simply we can think 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:46.800
 that ankama looks very clearly on 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.150
 on those on his side harper it takes 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.300
 also know that well just 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.220
 seeing that the dofus bonta and new dolphin 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.380
 and the mountain dungeon including jean marc 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.570
 parent anyway hoping that this 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.360
 two new dungeons that will be 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.840
 related perhaps directly to the quest 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.310
 of the dofus of the dofus and band so we will see 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.990
 well anyway that's my assumption 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.370
 we will see well then in any case me 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.740
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.740
 and I tell you in the next crisis
