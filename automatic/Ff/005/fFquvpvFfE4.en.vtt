00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
your speaker and we went

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.639 
your speaker and we went
we<00:01:16.850> went<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.479> outweigh<00:01:17.930> its<00:01:17.960> 10<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:24.590> you

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
we went to the outweigh its 10 so you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.340 
we went to the outweigh its 10 so you
would<00:01:25.039> wait<00:01:25.579> using<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.090> super<00:01:26.420> glue<00:01:26.630> glue<00:01:27.079> the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
would wait using the super glue glue the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.760 
would wait using the super glue glue the
back<00:01:27.799> side<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:29.689> one<00:01:29.720> that<00:01:30.200> doesn't<00:01:30.530> have<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
back side the one that doesn't have the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.590 
back side the one that doesn't have the
swirly<00:01:31.220> thing<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:38.090> would<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
swirly thing so you would have the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.929 
swirly thing so you would have the
swirly<00:01:39.020> one<00:01:39.200> up<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:40.039> drill<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.429> hole<00:01:40.549> at

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
swirly one up and you drill a hole at

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.380 
swirly one up and you drill a hole at
the<00:01:40.970> side<00:01:41.420> your<00:01:42.259> altoids<00:01:42.740> tin<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.210> white

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
the side your altoids tin so the white

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.550 
the side your altoids tin so the white
wires<00:01:44.630> can<00:01:44.990> go<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:46.240> just<00:01:47.240> glue<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.110> part

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
wires can go to and just glue that part

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.040 
wires can go to and just glue that part
down

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:06.929 

you

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.969 

okay<00:02:07.939> so<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.869> what<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.379> looks<00:02:09.560> like<00:02:09.739> right

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
okay so that's what it looks like right

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.130 
okay so that's what it looks like right
now<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.519> still<00:02:10.640> dry<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.480> now<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.810> would

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
now it's still dry so now you would

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.070 
now it's still dry so now you would
split<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.500> wires<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.239> have<00:02:17.569> headphones

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
split the wires so I have headphones

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.570 
split the wires so I have headphones
like<00:02:18.290> those<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:19.040> I'm<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.050> would<00:02:21.340> find<00:02:22.340> it

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
like those that I'm so you would find it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580 
like those that I'm so you would find it
until<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.269> find<00:02:23.599> where<00:02:23.840> there's<00:02:24.019> only<00:02:24.230> one

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
until you find where there's only one

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.960 
until you find where there's only one
wire<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.560> that's<00:02:27.950> where<00:02:28.190> there's<00:02:28.430> two<00:02:28.730> wires

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
wire so that's where there's two wires

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.550 
wire so that's where there's two wires
and<00:02:29.360> that's<00:02:29.540> where<00:02:29.750> there's<00:02:29.989> one<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.410> would

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
and that's where there's one you would

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.990 
and that's where there's one you would
cut<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.010> there<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.549> utility<00:02:32.180> knife<00:02:32.420> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.750 

we<00:02:41.000> get<00:02:41.239> something<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.170> with<00:02:42.860> three

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
we get something like that with three

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.509 
we get something like that with three
wires<00:02:44.060> or<00:02:44.450> two<00:02:44.660> buyers<00:02:44.900> wine<00:02:45.470> produced<00:02:46.160> three

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
wires or two buyers wine produced three

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.690 
wires or two buyers wine produced three
wires<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.349> remember<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.500> cut<00:02:48.799> off<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.190> end<00:02:49.400> of

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
wires and remember to cut off the end of

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:01.070 
wires and remember to cut off the end of
the<00:02:49.849> colored<00:02:50.180> apart<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.310> would<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:53.950> that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.020 

now<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:04.120> dad<00:03:04.540> cutting<00:03:05.880> splitting<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
now this is my dad cutting splitting the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
now this is my dad cutting splitting the
wires<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:12.180> that's<00:03:13.180> how<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.390> do<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.720> with<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
wires and that's how you do it with the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.970 
wires and that's how you do it with the
knife<00:03:14.470> do<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.040> at<00:03:15.160> an<00:03:15.340> angle<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.980> plastic

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
knife do it at an angle so the plastic

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:27.890 
knife do it at an angle so the plastic
comes<00:03:18.220> off<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.810> exposes<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:21.130> bare<00:03:21.400> wire

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.479 

so<00:03:28.900> look<00:03:29.110> at<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.350> colored<00:03:29.650> parts<00:03:29.980> at<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.340> end

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
so look at the colored parts at the end

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.210 
so look at the colored parts at the end
o<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.300> light

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.250 

and<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.090> might<00:03:36.270> have<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.630> rip<00:03:36.810> some<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
and you might have to rip some of the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.640 
and you might have to rip some of the
plastic<00:03:37.650> off

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
plastic off

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.190 
plastic off
and<00:03:39.739> just<00:03:40.519> be<00:03:40.730> sure<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.060> have<00:03:41.390> an<00:03:41.569> adult<00:03:41.870> to

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
and just be sure to have an adult to

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:51.250 
and just be sure to have an adult to
help<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.530> with<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:42.920> cuz<00:03:43.459> I'm<00:03:44.560> not

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.080 

okay<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.709> would<00:03:52.890> need<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.400> cut<00:03:53.610> off<00:03:53.730> a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
okay and you would need to cut off a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.369 
okay and you would need to cut off a
small<00:03:54.900> part<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.030> middle<00:03:57.030> or<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.930> colored

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
small part of the middle or the colored

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.780 
small part of the middle or the colored
wires<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.700> can<00:03:59.970> twist<00:04:00.269> some<00:04:00.750> together<00:04:01.790> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
wires so I can twist some together and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:22.550 
wires so I can twist some together and
such<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.989> expose<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.410> cob

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.080 

this<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.770> usually<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.520> hardest<00:04:24.820> clubs

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:39.670 

you

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.040 

now<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.740> would<00:04:41.130> connect<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.910> wires<00:04:42.270> you

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
now you would connect the wires you

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.470 
now you would connect the wires you
would<00:04:43.230> take<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.680> exposed<00:04:44.070> part<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.790> you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
would take the exposed part and you

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.020 
would take the exposed part and you
would<00:04:45.630> need<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.990> experiment<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.650> this<00:04:47.030> one

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
would need to experiment on this one

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.070 
would need to experiment on this one
because<00:04:49.070> when<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.220> have<00:04:50.360> three<00:04:51.360> wires<00:04:51.630> then

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
because when you have three wires then

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.710 
because when you have three wires then
you<00:04:52.230> need<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.590> twist<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.190> certain<00:04:53.670> 2<00:04:53.910> for<00:04:53.940> me<00:04:54.390> red

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
you need to twist a certain 2 for me red

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.200 
you need to twist a certain 2 for me red
and<00:04:54.870> black<00:04:55.080> together<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.670> get<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.060> most

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
and black together so you get the most

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:05.060 
and black together so you get the most
volume<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.460> most<00:05:02.060> think<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.500> connect<00:05:04.890> the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
volume and the most think so connect the

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.470 
volume and the most think so connect the
white<00:05:05.430> wires<00:05:05.730> to<00:05:06.240> your<00:05:06.420> headphone<00:05:06.810> wires<00:05:07.110> and

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
white wires to your headphone wires and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.200 
white wires to your headphone wires and
you<00:05:09.480> would<00:05:09.660> whisk<00:05:09.960> them<00:05:10.170> together<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:11.210> the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
you would whisk them together and the

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.570 
you would whisk them together and the
opp<00:05:12.450> use<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.590> optional<00:05:14.990> electrical<00:05:15.990> tape<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
opp use the optional electrical tape the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:29.629 
opp use the optional electrical tape the
seal<00:05:17.940> no<00:05:19.970> seal<00:05:20.970> it

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.820 

and<00:05:30.979> we're<00:05:31.979> all<00:05:32.129> use<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:33.240> extra<00:05:33.749> Jack<00:05:34.199> that

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
and we're all use the extra Jack that

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.589 
and we're all use the extra Jack that
you<00:05:35.009> see<00:05:35.249> you<00:05:35.669> would<00:05:35.789> connect<00:05:36.090> that<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.300> your

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
you see you would connect that to your

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:49.149 
you see you would connect that to your
iPod<00:05:37.159> so<00:05:38.159> obviously<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:47.669> would<00:05:47.999> be<00:05:48.180> connected

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
iPod so obviously it would be connected

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:55.969 
iPod so obviously it would be connected
he's<00:05:50.159> masking<00:05:50.789> tape<00:05:51.029> I<00:05:52.009> am<00:05:53.060> cuz<00:05:54.060> make<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.110> be

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
he's masking tape I am cuz make it be

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.779 
he's masking tape I am cuz make it be
louder<00:05:56.419> now<00:05:57.419> right<00:05:57.810> now<00:05:58.020> I'm<00:05:58.050> drilling<00:05:58.919> the

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
louder now right now I'm drilling the

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.029 
louder now right now I'm drilling the
holes<00:06:00.060> on<00:06:00.479> the<00:06:00.779> altoid<00:06:01.169> skins<00:06:01.439> and<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.770> sound

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
holes on the altoid skins and the sound

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.600 
holes on the altoid skins and the sound
comes<00:06:02.340> out<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:03.419> by<00:06:03.629> now<00:06:03.930> your<00:06:04.319> speaker<00:06:05.039> should

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
comes out so by now your speaker should

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.640 
comes out so by now your speaker should
work<00:06:06.289> you<00:06:07.289> haven't<00:06:07.800> look<00:06:08.039> over<00:06:08.219> this<00:06:08.520> video

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
work you haven't look over this video

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:34.330 
work you haven't look over this video
cuz

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.090 

was<00:06:34.520> a<00:06:34.550> time
