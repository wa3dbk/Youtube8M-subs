00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.759 
seeing the highlights I don't know
there's<00:02:48.540> there's<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.350> bunch<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.560> fun<00:02:49.739> things

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
there's there's a bunch of fun things

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.860 
there's there's a bunch of fun things
involved<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:50.940> will<00:02:51.360> be<00:02:51.510> played<00:02:51.690> some

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.930 
involved with that will be played some
GTA<00:02:52.019> but<00:02:52.440> mostly<00:02:53.190> assuming<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> don't

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
GTA but mostly assuming that I don't

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.250 
GTA but mostly assuming that I don't
think<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.150> will<00:02:54.239> be<00:02:54.330> incorporating<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.140> too

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260
