00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
better I am really really really glad
that<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.649> than<00:01:53.070> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that this is going to be more than just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
that this is going to be more than just
Batman<00:01:54.000> fighting<00:01:54.689> Superman<00:01:57.350> honestly<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
Batman fighting Superman honestly it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.999 
Batman fighting Superman honestly it
just<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.909> brought<00:02:00.210> light<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.590> time

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
just it really brought light to the time

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
just it really brought light to the time
the<00:02:02.280> title<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:02.969> shouldn't<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.600> be

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the title really shouldn't just be

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
the title really shouldn't just be
called<00:02:04.079> Batman<00:02:04.500> versus<00:02:04.829> men<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
called Batman versus men I think the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
called Batman versus men I think the
only<00:02:06.210> reason<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.750> titled<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.439> simply

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
only reason it's titled that is simply

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.279 
only reason it's titled that is simply
so<00:02:08.550> people<00:02:08.849> are<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.119> oh<00:02:09.300> my<00:02:09.929> god<00:02:10.110> they're

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
so people are like oh my god they're

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.780 
so people are like oh my god they're
