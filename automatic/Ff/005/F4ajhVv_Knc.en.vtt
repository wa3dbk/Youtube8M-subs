00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
wood to reinforce it inside so you want

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.719 
wood to reinforce it inside so you want
you<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.720> snap<00:02:06.930> off<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.980> glue<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> inside<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you to snap off and glue it inside the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.790 
you to snap off and glue it inside the
plane

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
to hook the reverb onto it and there you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.240 
to hook the reverb onto it and there you
go<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.910> gears<00:02:14.210> are<00:02:14.390> open<00:02:14.720> okay<00:02:15.530> my<00:02:15.650> prints<00:02:15.980> are

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
go the gears are open okay my prints are

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.820 
go the gears are open okay my prints are
so<00:02:16.640> far<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.090> good

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
so far so good

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.180 
to figure out settler bound by their see
about<00:02:36.770> their<00:02:36.980> dad<00:02:37.460> hook<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:39.440> robot<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:40.100> going

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
about their dad hook the robot is going

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:50.220 
about their dad hook the robot is going
down<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.300> there

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.290 

mm-hmm<00:02:51.320> just<00:02:52.220> strong<00:02:52.460> enough<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.940> pull<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
mm-hmm just strong enough to pull the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.540 
mm-hmm just strong enough to pull the
door<00:02:53.480> open<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:54.230> not<00:02:54.440> too<00:02:54.620> strong<00:02:54.890> they're

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
door open but not too strong they're

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.110 
door open but not too strong they're
going<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.060> stress<00:02:56.420> my<00:02:56.630> server<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.820> anyway

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
going to a stress my server so anyway

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.510 
going to a stress my server so anyway
now<00:02:59.780> let's<00:03:00.020> figure<00:03:00.170> out<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.500> way<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:01.490> make

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
now let's figure out a way to to make

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.240 
now let's figure out a way to to make
this<00:03:01.880> gear<00:03:02.210> come<00:03:02.990> down<00:03:03.170> here<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.710> touch

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
this gear come down here and touch

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.800 
this gear come down here and touch
something<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:05.000> know<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.360> going<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.660> make

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
something you know that is going to make

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.940 
something you know that is going to make
these<00:03:06.080> door<00:03:06.950> closed<00:03:07.430> over<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.470> let's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
these door closed over it so that let's

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.080 
these door closed over it so that let's
see<00:03:10.160> what<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.550> can<00:03:10.730> come<00:03:10.850> up<00:03:10.910> with<00:03:13.030> all<00:03:14.030> right

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
see what we can come up with all right

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.660 
see what we can come up with all right
but<00:03:14.510> first<00:03:14.780> we're<00:03:15.140> going<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.560> fix<00:03:15.860> I'm<00:03:16.310> finish

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
but first we're going to fix I'm finish

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.990 
but first we're going to fix I'm finish
basically<00:03:17.209> they're<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:18.760> panels<00:03:19.760> on<00:03:19.850> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
basically they're the panels on the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.870 
basically they're the panels on the
landing<00:03:20.360> gears<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.110> there<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:21.950> go<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.790> know

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
landing gears and there you go you know

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.580 
landing gears and there you go you know
cut<00:03:23.150> out<00:03:23.300> into<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.720> wind<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.140> make<00:03:24.170> sure<00:03:24.440> you

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
cut out into the wind to make sure you

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.210 
cut out into the wind to make sure you
know<00:03:24.680> if<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:25.010> flush<00:03:25.370> with<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.060> wing<00:03:27.220> looking

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
know if it flush with the wing looking

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.390 
know if it flush with the wing looking
good<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:28.580> far<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.750> metal<00:03:30.230> tubing<00:03:31.220> right

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
good so far this is a metal tubing right

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.260 
good so far this is a metal tubing right
here<00:03:31.640> this<00:03:31.820> is<00:03:31.880> actually<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:34.120> landing<00:03:35.120> gear

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
here this is actually the landing gear

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.060 
here this is actually the landing gear
door<00:03:35.480> panel<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:35.959> going<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.200> be<00:03:36.290> holed<00:03:36.590> into<00:03:36.800> it

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
door panel is going to be holed into it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.479 
door panel is going to be holed into it
as<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:38.090> right<00:03:38.239> here<00:03:38.770> glue<00:03:39.770> to<00:03:39.950> reinforce

door you see right there and I can you
have<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.420> build<00:04:26.630> another<00:04:26.840> hook<00:04:27.230> that<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.680> going

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
have to build another hook that is going

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.320 
have to build another hook that is going
to<00:04:27.920> be<00:04:28.010> inside<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.520> plane<00:04:28.670> holding<00:04:29.210> the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
to be inside the plane holding the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.940 
to be inside the plane holding the
rubber<00:04:29.480> band<00:04:29.810> on<00:04:29.870> place<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:30.740> sit<00:04:30.860> over

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
rubber band on place I just sit over

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.680 
rubber band on place I just sit over
here<00:04:30.980> one<00:04:31.310> beside<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.790> servo<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.540> other

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
here one beside the servo and the other

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.870 
here one beside the servo and the other
one<00:04:32.840> on<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:32.990> other<00:04:33.080> side<00:04:33.520> do<00:04:34.520> herb<00:04:34.700> and

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
one on the other side do herb and

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.720 
one on the other side do herb and
someplace<00:04:35.390> now<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.890> gear<00:04:37.100> doors<00:04:37.400> are

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
someplace now and the gear doors are

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.410 
someplace now and the gear doors are
open

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
open

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.600 
open
yeah<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.080> do<00:04:39.260> during<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.980> wheel<00:04:40.190> I'm<00:04:40.400> using

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
yeah that do during the wheel I'm using

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.940 
yeah that do during the wheel I'm using
right<00:04:40.880> there<00:04:41.030> it's<00:04:41.660> a<00:04:41.750> bit<00:04:41.900> too<00:04:42.050> big<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.740> need

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
right there it's a bit too big so I need

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.600 
right there it's a bit too big so I need
to<00:04:43.070> cut<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> notch<00:04:43.700> on<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.030> door<00:04:45.460> okay<00:04:46.460> my

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
to cut a notch on the door okay my

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.010 
to cut a notch on the door okay my
friends<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.030> here<00:04:47.210> we<00:04:47.300> have<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.660> landing

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
friends so here we have the landing

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.340 
friends so here we have the landing
gears<00:04:48.260> now<00:04:49.240> actually<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.270> end<00:04:50.630> up<00:04:50.810> putting<00:04:51.080> a

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
gears now actually I end up putting a

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.010 
gears now actually I end up putting a
servo<00:04:51.950> on<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.940> landing<00:04:53.270> gear<00:04:53.480> doors<00:04:53.720> because

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
servo on the landing gear doors because

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.560 
servo on the landing gear doors because
I<00:04:54.140> couldn't<00:04:54.380> figure<00:04:54.530> out<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.800> way<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:56.420> get<00:04:56.510> a

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
I couldn't figure out a way to to get a

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.210 
I couldn't figure out a way to to get a
rubberband<00:04:57.110> on<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.350> wire<00:04:57.560> or<00:04:57.770> something<00:04:57.800> to

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
rubberband on a wire or something to

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.160 
rubberband on a wire or something to
work<00:04:58.400> you<00:04:58.550> know<00:04:58.640> to<00:04:58.700> keep<00:04:58.970> in<00:04:59.120> close<00:04:59.270> the

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
work you know to keep in close the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.220 
work you know to keep in close the
rubber<00:05:00.440> band<00:05:01.030> style<00:05:02.030> did<00:05:02.360> work<00:05:02.570> very<00:05:02.600> good<00:05:02.870> on

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
rubber band style did work very good on

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.260 
rubber band style did work very good on
the<00:05:03.320> front<00:05:03.500> landing<00:05:03.860> gear<00:05:04.040> doors<00:05:04.400> but<00:05:05.180> it

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
the front landing gear doors but it

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.790 
the front landing gear doors but it
didn't<00:05:05.540> on<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.780> back<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.140> know<00:05:06.170> just<00:05:06.590> because

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
didn't on the back you know just because

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.170 
didn't on the back you know just because
of<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.070> way<00:05:07.250> their<00:05:07.460> gears<00:05:07.700> go<00:05:07.880> in<00:05:08.030> you<00:05:08.150> know

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
of the way their gears go in you know

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.450 
of the way their gears go in you know
they<00:05:08.420> don't<00:05:08.600> go<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.870> going<00:05:09.680> perfectly<00:05:10.310> you

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
they don't go it going perfectly you

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.420 
they don't go it going perfectly you
know<00:05:10.930> vertical<00:05:11.930> or<00:05:12.050> horizontal<00:05:12.340> you<00:05:13.340> know

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
know vertical or horizontal you know

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.860 
know vertical or horizontal you know
with<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.760> fuselage<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.330> know<00:05:14.420> they<00:05:14.540> go<00:05:14.750> in

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
with the fuselage you know they go in

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.750 
with the fuselage you know they go in
like<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.020> sideways<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.400> just<00:05:16.550> hard<00:05:16.730> to

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
like a sideways and it just hard to

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.460 
like a sideways and it just hard to
figure<00:05:17.000> out<00:05:17.180> something<00:05:17.570> that<00:05:17.600> way<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:18.260> have

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
figure out something that way so I have

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.500 
figure out something that way so I have
to<00:05:18.590> put<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:18.770> servo<00:05:19.130> on<00:05:19.250> him<00:05:19.400> well<00:05:20.210> it's<00:05:20.360> not

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
to put a servo on him well it's not

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.050 
to put a servo on him well it's not
pretty<00:05:20.780> good<00:05:20.890> very<00:05:21.890> nice<00:05:22.130> I'm<00:05:22.610> pretty<00:05:22.880> happy

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
pretty good very nice I'm pretty happy

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.330 
pretty good very nice I'm pretty happy
with<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.780> have<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.140> cut<00:05:24.770> a<00:05:24.800> hole<00:05:24.860> here

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
with it I have to cut a hole here

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.550 
with it I have to cut a hole here
because<00:05:25.640> this<00:05:25.820> wheel<00:05:26.060> there<00:05:26.930> I'm<00:05:27.080> using<00:05:27.230> right

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
because this wheel there I'm using right

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.200 
because this wheel there I'm using right
now<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:27.890> nose<00:05:28.070> gear<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.520> not<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.790> skill

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
now and the nose gear is not a skill

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.900 
now and the nose gear is not a skill
really<00:05:29.450> it's<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:30.200> little<00:05:30.440> bit<00:05:30.530> bigger<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:31.070> I'm

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
really it's a little bit bigger so I'm

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.400 
really it's a little bit bigger so I'm
gonna<00:05:32.060> have<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.330> get<00:05:32.450> me<00:05:32.540> a<00:05:32.600> smaller<00:05:32.840> wheel<00:05:33.050> to

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
gonna have to get me a smaller wheel to

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.530 
gonna have to get me a smaller wheel to
put<00:05:33.590> in<00:05:33.650> here<00:05:33.860> but<00:05:34.400> I'm<00:05:34.490> going<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.730> just<00:05:35.390> have

so<00:07:03.680> I'm<00:07:03.830> actually<00:07:03.980> think<00:07:04.430> I'm<00:07:04.610> going<00:07:04.850> to<00:07:05.440> I'm

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 
so I'm actually think I'm going to I'm

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.440 
so I'm actually think I'm going to I'm
thinking<00:07:06.830> on<00:07:06.950> changing<00:07:07.340> they<00:07:07.940> are<00:07:07.970> on<00:07:08.300> some

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450 
thinking on changing they are on some

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.390 
thinking on changing they are on some
building<00:07:08.810> mascara<00:07:09.200> like<00:07:09.320> this<00:07:09.530> you<00:07:10.220> know<00:07:10.280> do

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
building mascara like this you know do

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.820 
building mascara like this you know do
you<00:07:10.970> need<00:07:11.090> different<00:07:11.360> type<00:07:11.900> of<00:07:11.930> handy<00:07:12.560> store

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
you need different type of handy store

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.720 
you need different type of handy store
but<00:07:13.010> I<00:07:13.220> think<00:07:14.090> we<00:07:14.330> nicer<00:07:15.140> is<00:07:15.410> more<00:07:15.710> scale<00:07:16.040> so<00:07:16.700> I

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.730 
but I think we nicer is more scale so I

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.950 
but I think we nicer is more scale so I
think<00:07:16.910> I'm<00:07:16.970> going<00:07:17.120> to<00:07:17.210> leave<00:07:17.360> this<00:07:17.540> with<00:07:17.780> my

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
think I'm going to leave this with my

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.409 
think I'm going to leave this with my
aliens<00:07:18.200> -<00:07:18.500> so<00:07:19.310> okay<00:07:19.520> my<00:07:19.640> prints<00:07:19.910> are<00:07:20.060> thank<00:07:20.360> you
