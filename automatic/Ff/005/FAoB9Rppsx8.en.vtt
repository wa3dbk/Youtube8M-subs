you're<00:00:51.940> going<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.269> hang<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.629> loop<00:00:53.039> behind<00:00:54.039> the

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
you're going to hang a loop behind the

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.020 
you're going to hang a loop behind the
two<00:00:54.910> ends<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.809> your<00:00:56.109> cast<00:00:56.410> on<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:57.670> puts<00:00:58.379> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
two ends of your cast on this puts the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.819 
two ends of your cast on this puts the
cast<00:01:01.030> on<00:01:01.239> tool<00:01:01.510> behind<00:01:01.780> your<00:01:02.230> knitting<00:01:02.589> and<00:01:02.679> it

cast on tool behind your knitting and it
makes<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.160> simpler<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.030> doesn't

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
makes it simpler and it doesn't

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.490 
makes it simpler and it doesn't
interrupt<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:05.770> nice<00:01:06.040> edge<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.610> your<00:01:06.700> cast<00:01:07.000> on

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
further apart than I would use for this

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.419 
further apart than I would use for this

hanging it behind both strands 21 okay

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:35.390 
hanging it behind both strands 21 okay
now<00:02:21.940> you're<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.360> add<00:02:22.750> your<00:02:22.810> next<00:02:23.709> needle

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.259

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
your loops or as I'm doing pick it up

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.240 
your loops or as I'm doing pick it up
behind<00:02:45.230> I'm<00:02:46.230> going<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.500> pick<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.739> up<00:02:46.830> halfway

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
behind I'm going to pick it up halfway

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.970 
behind I'm going to pick it up halfway
through<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:48.110> don't<00:02:49.110> have<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.410> problem<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
through I don't have a problem with the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.369 
through I don't have a problem with the
color<00:02:50.220> because<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.849> going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.120> match<00:02:51.379> so

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
color because it's not going to match so

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.839 
color because it's not going to match so
I<00:02:52.410> won't<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.040> confused

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
I won't get that confused

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.220 
I won't get that confused
again<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.260> both<00:02:55.500> strands<00:02:55.980> are<00:02:56.129> in<00:02:56.610> front<00:02:57.230> okay

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
again the both strands are in front okay

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.789 
again the both strands are in front okay
so<00:02:58.739> now<00:02:59.549> we<00:02:59.610> have<00:03:00.000> all<00:03:00.330> four<00:03:00.900> needles<00:03:01.140> cast<00:03:01.500> on

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
so now we have all four needles cast on

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.759 
so now we have all four needles cast on
and<00:03:02.129> as<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.150> see<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:04.110> really<00:03:04.319> can't

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
and as you can see you really can't

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.430 
and as you can see you really can't
twist<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.340> needles<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:07.110> going

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
twist the needles if you do it's going

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.140 
twist the needles if you do it's going
to<00:03:07.530> look<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.640> be<00:03:08.760> very

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
to look like this it's going to be very

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.130 
to look like this it's going to be very
obvious<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.739> my<00:03:11.489> pattern<00:03:11.970> calls<00:03:12.239> for<00:03:12.450> knit<00:03:12.959> one

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
obvious so my pattern calls for knit one

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.750 
obvious so my pattern calls for knit one
purl<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.530> ribbing<00:03:14.299> so<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:16.370> could<00:03:17.370> find<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
purl one ribbing so I could find the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.640 
purl one ribbing so I could find the
right<00:03:17.970> end<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.500> there<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.620> go<00:03:20.480> alright<00:03:21.650> so

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
right end of the there we go alright so

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.460 
right end of the there we go alright so
then<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:22.950> pull<00:03:23.160> your<00:03:23.280> needles<00:03:23.549> around<00:03:24.470> pull

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
then you pull your needles around pull

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.080 
then you pull your needles around pull
you<00:03:25.620> mid<00:03:25.799> each<00:03:25.950> other<00:03:27.079> yarn<00:03:28.079> up<00:03:28.260> your<00:03:28.440> hand<00:03:28.709> and

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.520 

go<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:33.480> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.500 

so<00:03:41.070> when<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.400> come<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.760> loop<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.270> slip

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
so when you come to the loop just slip

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.160 
so when you come to the loop just slip
it<00:03:42.690> purlwise<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.710> back<00:03:44.670> up<00:03:44.940> your<00:03:45.090> yarn<00:03:48.170> and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
it purlwise and back up your yarn and

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:59.520 
it purlwise and back up your yarn and
just<00:03:49.200> continue<00:03:50.070> on

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.590
