00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
Troy

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.830 
Troy
that's<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.340> lowest<00:04:37.910> rated<00:04:38.210> movie<00:04:38.480> he<00:04:38.750> was

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
that's the lowest rated movie he was

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.300 
that's the lowest rated movie he was
also<00:04:38.990> in<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.169> film<00:04:39.350> called<00:04:39.410> full<00:04:39.740> frontal<00:04:40.190> it

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
also in a film called full frontal it

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.770 
also in a film called full frontal it
was<00:04:40.430> directed<00:04:40.669> by<00:04:40.760> Steven<00:04:41.060> Soderbergh<00:04:41.210> that's

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
was directed by Steven Soderbergh that's

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.440 
was directed by Steven Soderbergh that's
only<00:04:42.050> 38%<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:43.100> he<00:04:43.430> co-starred<00:04:43.850> in<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:44.419> I

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
only 38% and he co-starred in it so I

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.730 
only 38% and he co-starred in it so I
guess<00:04:44.600> he<00:04:44.690> can<00:04:44.780> count<00:04:44.960> full<00:04:45.139> frontal<00:04:45.500> as<00:04:45.590> well

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
guess he can count full frontal as well

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.920 
guess he can count full frontal as well
so<00:04:46.010> Wow<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.400> mean<00:04:46.850> look<00:04:47.090> Troy's<00:04:47.300> not<00:04:47.450> great<00:04:47.750> but
