00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
food so let's go whoo all right this is

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.780 
food so let's go whoo all right this is
a<00:00:50.500> little<00:00:50.710> bit<00:00:50.800> brighter<00:00:50.950> than<00:00:51.100> normal<00:00:51.490> that's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
a little bit brighter than normal that's

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.390 
a little bit brighter than normal that's
probably<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.450> water<00:00:52.660> breathing<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:54.250> it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
probably the water breathing and it

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.720 
probably the water breathing and it
seems<00:00:54.730> that<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:56.440> water<00:00:57.160> breathing<00:00:57.550> so

this<00:02:39.129> is<00:02:39.189> what<00:02:39.459> makes<00:02:39.609> it<00:02:39.760> work<00:02:39.909> so<00:02:40.650> this

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
this is what makes it work so this

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.440 
this is what makes it work so this
complicated<00:02:42.639> commands

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
complicated commands

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.020 
complicated commands
not<00:02:44.319> really<00:02:44.439> that<00:02:44.530> complicated<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:45.639> this<00:02:45.879> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
not really that complicated is this the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.470 
not really that complicated is this the
score<00:02:46.359> helmets<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.650> did<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.159> I<00:02:48.549> just<00:02:48.849> added<00:02:49.090> a
