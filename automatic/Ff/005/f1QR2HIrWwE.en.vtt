00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
cigarette to more detail with these

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
cigarette to more detail with these
things<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> use<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.600> Liars<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.770> thing

things and use your Liars and the thing

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.850 
things and use your Liars and the thing
as<00:01:44.040> much<00:01:44.220> neater<00:01:44.460> than<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.110> concept

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
as much neater than this but the concept

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.740 
as much neater than this but the concept
sketching<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.360> cool<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
sketching it's really really cool you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.620 
sketching it's really really cool you
can<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.259> get<00:01:49.560> quick<00:01:49.799> idea<00:01:50.189> down<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
can just get get quick idea down on the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.520 
can just get get quick idea down on the
go<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:56.329> I've<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.390> picked<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> kind

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
go or you know I've just picked a kind

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
go or you know I've just picked a kind
of<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.770> middle<00:01:59.310> green<00:01:59.640> now<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.240> probably<00:02:00.360> going

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
of a middle green now I'm probably going

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.030 
of a middle green now I'm probably going
to<00:02:00.689> go<00:02:00.750> over<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.320> later<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
to go over this a bit later but this is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.789 
to go over this a bit later but this is
to<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> put<00:02:02.790> some<00:02:03.079> some<00:02:04.079> highlights<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
to kind of put some some highlights and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.710 
to kind of put some some highlights and
start<00:02:05.009> showing<00:02:05.189> some<00:02:05.430> form<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
start showing some form and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.990 
start showing some form and
and<00:02:07.500> getting<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.830> better<00:02:07.950> shape<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> kind

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and getting a better shape to this kind
