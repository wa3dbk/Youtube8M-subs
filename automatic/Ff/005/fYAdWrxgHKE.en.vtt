00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
gross so I didn't like that anymore and
I<00:00:49.710> tried<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> switch<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> braid

and<00:00:52.890> put<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> behind<00:00:53.460> um<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> bobby<00:00:54.840> pin<00:00:54.930> but

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and put it behind um in a bobby pin but

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
and put it behind um in a bobby pin but
that<00:00:55.800> idea<00:00:56.190> didn't<00:00:56.610> work<00:00:56.640> either<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that idea didn't work either because it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680 
that idea didn't work either because it
gave<00:00:57.660> me<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> crap<00:00:59.329> hairdo<00:01:00.329> that
