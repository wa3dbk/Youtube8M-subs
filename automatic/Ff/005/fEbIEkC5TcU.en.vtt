00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.720
 on the islands but they are full 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.759
 of tourists it is an archipelago 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.349
 in the North Atlantic between Scotland 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.719
 Norway and Iceland 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.490
 the reason they simply want to observe the 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.830
 total eclipse of the sun that registered 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.510
 tomorrow in this region the occupation 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.780
 hotel in this place is at 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.300
 100% are around 10,000 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.220
 people who are already in this 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.680
 place there you can appreciate the moon 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.740
 completely covering the sun for 2 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.740
 minutes with approximately 45 seconds 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.420
 to tell us about this total eclipse 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.190
 I have a telephone line on the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.380
 doctor jose franco director general of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.530
 disclosure of the science of the unam 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.579
 Tell us about this extraordinary 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.879
 astronomical phenomenon that suÃ¡rez brings 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.160
 tomorrow already in the north Atlantic 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.150
 well, we have a solar eclipse that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.830
 is almost coincident with the entrance of the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.790
 spring in the northern hemisphere 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.690
 so 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.690
 in 15 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.070
 very coincident with this with this event 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:12.690
 and this has generated a great many 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:17.700
 is expectantly and effectively 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.120
 only in Africa and in Europe and on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.090
 all northern europe then in mexico 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.790
 we will not be able to see the eclipse because 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.870
 It's going to happen in the morning of Europe 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.890
 say at 9-thirty in the morning 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.340
 the British Isles or 10 and a half of the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.190
 Morning central Europe 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.110
 so that this would correspond to the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.240
 three thirty in the morning the maximum 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.970
 manager here in the city of mexico 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
 all of us will not have a chance 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.840
 to see what exactly they are going to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.820
 see the people who will have this 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.170
 extraordinary privilege to observe 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.210
 this clear phenomenon looks 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.430
 unless it is on a regular basis all 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.650
 the years of fact every year there 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.009
 between 3 and 5 eclipses 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.960
 in the world somewhere in the world the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.110
 half of them are moon and the other 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.740
 half are sunny in this case this is a 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.300
 eclipse of the sun where the moon 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.300
 interpose between the earth and the sun and 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.190
 so that the shadow of the moon is going to 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:35.110
 hide a part of the part that is of 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.350
 mine on our planet because it's going to start 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.220
 out there of the Canary Islands there goes to 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.500
 start at 7 o'clock in the morning and in 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.080
 the Canary Islands dead after 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.280
 7 o'clock in the morning in the Canary Islands 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:56.170
 and is going to move towards the rest of africa 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.920
 and from Europe and it's going to be very, very 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:05.520
 visible in the Nordic part, that is to say 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.780
 example spain all europe 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.270
 in the Nordic countries on the islands 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.450
 British all of them are going to be able 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.750
 observe the eclipse in a very 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.730
 very clear in the morning of tomorrow 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:27.000
 the same will be visible in greenland 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:31.310
 and several of the islands located then in 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.310
 near the North Pole
