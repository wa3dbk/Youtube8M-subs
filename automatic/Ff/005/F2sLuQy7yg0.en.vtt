that's<00:03:51.269> where<00:03:51.479> issues<00:03:51.900> started<00:03:52.259> falling

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
that's where issues started falling

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.860 
that's where issues started falling
behind<00:03:52.859> because<00:03:53.759> now<00:03:53.939> the<00:03:54.000> PlayStation<00:03:54.659> Vita

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
behind because now the PlayStation Vita

behind because now the PlayStation Vita
sure<00:03:55.109> if<00:03:55.259> they<00:03:55.379> have<00:03:55.500> homebrew<00:03:55.979> running<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.400> it

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
sure if they have homebrew running on it

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.360 
sure if they have homebrew running on it
that's<00:03:56.939> fine<00:03:57.299> once<00:03:57.629> again<00:03:58.019> but<00:03:59.009> hey<00:03:59.159> if<00:03:59.250> they

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
that's fine once again but hey if they

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.119 
that's fine once again but hey if they
start<00:03:59.579> pirating<00:04:00.060> games<00:04:00.620> we<00:04:01.620> might<00:04:01.829> fall<00:04:02.040> in

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
start pirating games we might fall in

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.439 
start pirating games we might fall in
the<00:04:02.189> same<00:04:02.310> platform<00:04:02.729> as<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.909> original<00:04:03.150> PSP

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
the same platform as the original PSP

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.610 
the same platform as the original PSP
and<00:04:03.599> then<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.840> developers<00:04:04.259> aren't<00:04:04.379> going<00:04:04.530> to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and then the developers aren't going to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.050 
and then the developers aren't going to
want<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.769> develop<00:04:05.069> for<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.459> PlayStation<00:04:05.879> Vita

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060

the<00:04:10.169> platform<00:04:10.680> that's<00:04:11.280> actually<00:04:11.579> my<00:04:11.669> question

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the platform that's actually my question

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.020 
the platform that's actually my question
of<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.269> week<00:04:12.449> do<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:13.919> home<00:04:14.430> brew<00:04:14.759> and<00:04:15.000> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
of the week do you see home brew and the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.449 
of the week do you see home brew and the
hacking<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.139> PlayStation<00:04:16.590> Vita<00:04:16.769> as<00:04:16.949> an

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
hacking of PlayStation Vita as an

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.849 
hacking of PlayStation Vita as an
advantage<00:04:18.000> or<00:04:18.150> disadvantage<00:04:18.409> my<00:04:19.409> opinion

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
advantage or disadvantage my opinion

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.800 
advantage or disadvantage my opinion
they<00:04:20.159> just<00:04:20.430> have<00:04:20.579> homebrew<00:04:21.150> running<00:04:21.509> on<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.750> I

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
they just have homebrew running on it I

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.420 
they just have homebrew running on it I
think<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.049> an<00:04:22.139> advantage<00:04:22.349> PSP<00:04:23.190> sales

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
think it's an advantage PSP sales

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.249 
think it's an advantage PSP sales
skyrocketed<00:04:24.360> when<00:04:24.539> they<00:04:24.599> were<00:04:24.690> able<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
skyrocketed when they were able to

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.850 
skyrocketed when they were able to
access<00:04:25.710> homebrew<00:04:26.099> on<00:04:26.250> their<00:04:26.400> PSP<00:04:26.719> however

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
access homebrew on their PSP however

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.379 
access homebrew on their PSP however
they<00:04:28.860> give<00:04:29.130> users<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.580> ability<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:30.090> pirate

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
they give users the ability to pirate

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.029 
they give users the ability to pirate
games<00:04:30.599> it's<00:04:31.349> gonna<00:04:31.440> have<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.650> negative<00:04:31.800> impact

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
games it's gonna have a negative impact

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.790 
games it's gonna have a negative impact
and<00:04:32.669> as<00:04:33.150> much<00:04:33.570> as<00:04:33.599> I<00:04:33.810> am<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.229> fan<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.560> the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
and as much as I am a fan of the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.620 
and as much as I am a fan of the
PlayStation<00:04:35.190> Vita<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.639> could<00:04:36.449> potentially

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
PlayStation Vita it could potentially

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.070 
PlayStation Vita it could potentially
hurt<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.500> platform<00:04:38.509> really<00:04:39.509> bad<00:04:39.719> so<00:04:39.960> I'm

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
hurt the platform really bad so I'm

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.420 
hurt the platform really bad so I'm
hoping<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.469> does<00:04:40.650> not<00:04:40.770> happen<00:04:40.949> but<00:04:41.250> let<00:04:41.340> me
