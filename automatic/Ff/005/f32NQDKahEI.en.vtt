bar I mean timer now this is my building
right<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.629> a<00:03:18.870> massive<00:03:19.440> massive<00:03:19.979> world

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
right here on a massive massive world

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.339 
right here on a massive massive world
this<00:03:20.699> you<00:03:21.090> could<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:21.449> scroll<00:03:21.930> around

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
the the level system doesn't really mean

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.739 
the the level system doesn't really mean

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:04.419 
much like the fact that I'm a level 23
doesn't<00:07:03.379> really<00:07:03.529> mean<00:07:03.770> much<00:07:03.919> it's<00:07:04.129> sort<00:07:04.369> of

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:04.429 
doesn't really mean much it's sort of

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:05.889 
doesn't really mean much it's sort of
just<00:07:04.580> for<00:07:04.669> bragging<00:07:05.029> rights

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:05.899

might<00:07:06.349> you<00:07:06.649> get<00:07:07.009> from<00:07:07.779> building<00:07:08.779> stuff<00:07:09.050> and

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
might you get from building stuff and

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.730 
might you get from building stuff and
creating<00:07:10.610> units<00:07:11.179> as<00:07:11.330> well<00:07:11.449> so<00:07:11.809> if<00:07:11.990> I<00:07:12.199> guess
