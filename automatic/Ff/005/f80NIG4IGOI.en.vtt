 such cars are similar to a minibus 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.020
 only they are specially equipped for

 from the store immediately called the police and 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.750
 went to search for criminals 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.270

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.700
 fast but the police car 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.810
