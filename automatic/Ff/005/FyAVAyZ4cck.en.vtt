 guys what I wanted to tell you were two 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.230
 things mainly first of all 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.940
 I want to ask for a favor I said it I think 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 It was in a video yesterday if it was not before 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.629
 yesterday surely many of you 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 you follow me on facebook and on twitter 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.170
 but there is a social network out there that I 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.480
 I do not use and surely many of 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.820
 you also do not use what is google 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.740
 agree the google + thing is that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.630
 for us who do videos in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.150
 Youtube is very important that you follow us 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 or that you follow me in this social network that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.470

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.680
 to grow are themes of google and youtube 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 that I simply ask that of you as a 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.450
 please follow me on google + and nothing 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.980

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.440
 we will make the 11 pm hour 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.850
 Spanish agreement is 11 at night 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.860
 Spanish time also down one 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.440
 description I will leave a section for 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
 put different countries on the hour so 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.649
 can you tell me in the comments if 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.180
 your country is not suggesting 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.319
 jce I look for it I look for the hour that will be 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.090
 our country and the public 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.890
 and you can also say in the case that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.930
 the time is bad, you tell me and I 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.609
 I check it or I look for it again or as the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.569
 hour that you tell me to be in 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.390
 your country of agreement 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.189
 as I say the online gta 5 is going to be 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.200
 11 o'clock at night and I'm going to play with 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.030
 crew people according to the cross 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.859
 of robbery and 23 that you have also down 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.480
 in the description you can not join is 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.209
 an open tribe does not need an invitation 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.239
 so if you want to play with me tomorrow 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.400
 with us live tomorrow by the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.599
 night in the live you have to think about 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.409
 members of the crew because what are we going 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.849
 to do first of all I'm going to create 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.500
 Agree activities let's play no 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.939
 I know if any capture or some mission 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.219
 something in these that I think that 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.900
 limit are 16 people I will use the 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.919
 option to invite crew members 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.959
 to all members who are 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.010
 connected at that moment of the crew them 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.900
 the invitation for the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.730
 activity and 12 the first 16 of each 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.470
 activity that you do, they will be the ones 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.060
 enter the activity according 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.620
 I believe that we will do several activities 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.500
 of these later we will pass if it gives 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.940
 time to the map and we do whatever a 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.320
 little the crazy we will do a little the goose myself 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.880
 I know if we'll try some trick 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.800
 little thing but it's always going to be 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.970
 members of the breeding agreement I believe 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.990
 which is the fairest because I can not 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.390
 add everyone according 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.010
 guys in the playstation 4 century add 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.620
 to many people who are not 2000 or 3000 the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.930
 limit but in playstation3 the limit of 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.640
 people are 100 and as I go 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.990
 lengthening people although it has more than 100 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.190
 people added I can not see them in 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.540
 the list therefore I can not 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.640
 invite the part of the games of 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.340
 agreement so I think that the fairest 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.720
 is to do activities and inviting 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.400
 members of the crew that right now 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.690
 we are I think almost 400 really 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.430
 thank you very much alone a lot 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.320
 limit is in thousand so there we go to 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.270
 be there hurrying those thousand to see if 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.550
 we arrived soon and I think what was said 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.040
 everything is going to happen to the theme of minecraft 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.720
 okay after the direct gta 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.980
 let's prepare a live from minecraft 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.890
 surely hunger games ' with 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.690
 subscribers that will start that from 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.760
 one in the morning in the early morning 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.010
 or less than Spanish time according another 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.720
 once I refer you to the description I will not put 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.489
 the hours of 200 countries to grow 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.959
 Etc. Anything Any Questions 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.140
 you always have the comments of 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.300
 agreement 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.670
 we will play in principle I will try 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.739
 play in not premium but you know that 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.049
 the issue of non-premium is the problem 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.720
 that the servers that work 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.280
 there is much cetera etcetera and if not 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.110
 works well obviously I will have 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.540
 that happen to premium servers so 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.820
 guys if you are not premium because really 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.560

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.120
 direct but good I'll try in 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.440
 principle play in non- premium if it goes well 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.960
 we continue in the awards and if we do not 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.669

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.080

 play when you have to go to the first 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.040

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.260
