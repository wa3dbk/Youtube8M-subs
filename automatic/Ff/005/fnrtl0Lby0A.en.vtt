and<00:02:28.360> then<00:02:28.900> I'll<00:02:29.019> probably<00:02:29.290> take<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.799> same

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
and then I'll probably take this same

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.610 
and then I'll probably take this same
tool<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.569> just<00:02:31.750> lay<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.349> here<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.890> this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
tool and just lay it on here like this

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.870 
tool and just lay it on here like this
right<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:35.890> I've<00:02:36.069> essentially<00:02:36.670> got<00:02:36.970> my<00:02:37.150> lid

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
right there I've essentially got my lid

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.599 
right there I've essentially got my lid
you<00:02:39.880> know<00:02:39.940> I'd<00:02:40.030> measure<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:40.600> my<00:02:40.720> calipers

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
you know I'd measure it with my calipers

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.259 
you know I'd measure it with my calipers
make<00:02:42.609> sure<00:02:42.910> it's<00:02:43.060> pretty<00:02:43.239> close<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.910> isn't

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
make sure it's pretty close if it isn't

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.910 
make sure it's pretty close if it isn't
right<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:48.630> might<00:02:49.630> come<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:50.230> cut<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.680> off

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
right you might come in and cut this off

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.690 
right you might come in and cut this off
a<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.720> then<00:02:55.930> what<00:02:56.079> I'll<00:02:56.200> do<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.700> take

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
a little and then what I'll do is take

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.059 
a little and then what I'll do is take
my

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
my

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.420 
my
that<00:02:59.549> same<00:02:59.939> tool<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.749> just<00:03:00.900> slice<00:03:01.829> underneath

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that same tool and just slice underneath

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.759 
that same tool and just slice underneath
here<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.980> gives<00:03:05.280> me<00:03:05.489> my<00:03:05.700> blank<00:03:06.560> then<00:03:07.560> I'm

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
here and that gives me my blank then I'm

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.379 
here and that gives me my blank then I'm
going<00:03:08.159> to<00:03:08.430> cut<00:03:08.969> this<00:03:09.209> off<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:11.159> set<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.180> aside

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
going to cut this off and set this aside

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.899 
going to cut this off and set this aside
on<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.840> little<00:03:13.170> pad<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.069> I'll<00:03:14.639> show<00:03:14.879> you

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
on that little pad and I'll show you

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.300 
on that little pad and I'll show you
what<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.180> do<00:03:15.299> with<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.659> later<00:03:16.189> the<00:03:17.189> other

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
what I do with that later the other

what I do with that later the other
things<00:03:17.639> we<00:03:17.790> have<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:17.939> make<00:03:18.269> where<00:03:19.170> we're<00:03:19.349> done

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
things we have to make where we're done

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
things we have to make where we're done
here<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:21.299> spout<00:03:22.939> is<00:03:23.939> which<00:03:24.239> we're<00:03:24.569> just

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
here is a spout is which we're just

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.259 
here is a spout is which we're just
gonna<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:27.030> just<00:03:27.329> make<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> little<00:03:27.780> spout

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
gonna you just make a little spout

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.699 
gonna you just make a little spout
usually<00:03:30.269> what<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.480> try<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.840> do<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.169> push<00:03:31.469> this

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
usually what I try to do is push this

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.520 
usually what I try to do is push this
out<00:03:31.980> some<00:03:32.400> here<00:03:32.879> at<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> bottom<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.349> then

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
out some here at the bottom and then

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.339 
out some here at the bottom and then
make<00:03:34.739> sure<00:03:34.769> this<00:03:35.189> comes<00:03:35.549> in<00:03:35.819> nice<00:03:36.139> whoops

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
make sure this comes in nice whoops

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:46.080 
make sure this comes in nice whoops
like<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.459> messed<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.180> up

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.009 

and<00:03:47.090> then<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.299> just<00:03:47.450> have<00:03:47.659> to<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.959> know

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
and then you just have to you know

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.420 
and then you just have to you know
figure<00:03:48.530> out<00:03:48.790> how<00:03:49.790> how<00:03:50.209> wide<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.840> want<00:03:50.870> this<00:03:51.430> is

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
figure out how how wide you want this is

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.390 
figure out how how wide you want this is
about<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:53.030> be<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> lot<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:54.950> times<00:03:55.189> I'll

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
about to be then a lot of times I'll

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.360 
about to be then a lot of times I'll
come<00:03:55.609> in<00:03:55.760> at<00:03:55.909> the<00:03:56.000> end<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.390> just<00:03:57.189> clean<00:03:58.189> the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
come in at the end and just clean the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.670 
come in at the end and just clean the
edge<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.849> this<00:03:59.060> spout<00:03:59.420> up<00:03:59.689> to<00:03:59.840> sharpen<00:04:00.469> it<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
edge of this spout up to sharpen it a

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.990 
edge of this spout up to sharpen it a
little<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.739> that<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.040> water<00:04:04.220> when<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.760> water

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
mark then I cut deeper to get a little

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.550 
mark then I cut deeper to get a little
pad<00:04:12.560> again<00:04:13.129> like<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.930> set<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:14.959> aside<00:04:16.209> okay

it's<00:04:56.570> kind<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:56.930> Center<00:04:57.229> but<00:04:57.349> just<00:04:57.560> make<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:57.919> so

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
it's kind of Center but just make it so

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.899 
it's kind of Center but just make it so
it<00:04:58.639> doesn't<00:04:58.880> wobble<00:05:00.250> but<00:05:01.250> then<00:05:01.430> I'll<00:05:01.550> trim

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
it doesn't wobble but then I'll trim

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.909 
it doesn't wobble but then I'll trim
that<00:05:02.090> up<00:05:02.300> as<00:05:02.479> I<00:05:02.630> need<00:05:02.840> even<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.229> can<00:05:03.409> even<00:05:03.560> trim

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
that up as I need even I can even trim

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.640 
that up as I need even I can even trim
the<00:05:04.039> sides<00:05:04.310> of<00:05:04.729> it<00:05:04.909> because<00:05:05.720> what<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.050> want<00:05:06.440> with

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
the sides of it because what I want with

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.180 
the sides of it because what I want with
this<00:05:06.860> is<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:07.870> want<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.169> fit<00:05:09.440> in<00:05:09.770> here

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
this is that it I want it to fit in here

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.899 
this is that it I want it to fit in here
and<00:05:10.510> be<00:05:11.510> like<00:05:12.440> in<00:05:12.710> this<00:05:12.860> one<00:05:13.099> I<00:05:13.159> want<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.729> be

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
and be like in this one I want it to be

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.210 
and be like in this one I want it to be
pretty<00:05:14.449> loose<00:05:14.810> in<00:05:15.110> there<00:05:15.349> so<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:15.919> can<00:05:16.039> have

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
pretty loose in there so it can have

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.640 
pretty loose in there so it can have
these<00:05:16.340> two<00:05:16.400> little<00:05:16.990> cleats<00:05:17.990> on<00:05:18.289> there<00:05:18.500> to

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
these two little cleats on there to

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.430 
these two little cleats on there to
catch<00:05:18.889> it<00:05:19.389> also<00:05:20.389> another<00:05:20.810> interesting<00:05:21.020> thing

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
catch it also another interesting thing

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.279 
catch it also another interesting thing
they<00:05:21.800> did<00:05:22.039> they<00:05:22.070> glazed<00:05:22.669> everything<00:05:23.599> so<00:05:24.080> that

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
they did they glazed everything so that

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.770 
they did they glazed everything so that
minute<00:05:24.800> stayed<00:05:25.130> stays<00:05:25.940> pretty<00:05:26.330> loose<00:05:26.570> because

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
minute stayed stays pretty loose because

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.439 
minute stayed stays pretty loose because
you<00:05:26.900> have<00:05:26.990> to<00:05:27.139> allow<00:05:27.380> for<00:05:27.409> the<00:05:27.680> glaze<00:05:28.389> okay<00:05:29.389> so

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
you have to allow for the glaze okay so

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.210 
you have to allow for the glaze okay so
then<00:05:29.750> what<00:05:29.900> I'm<00:05:30.020> going<00:05:30.169> to<00:05:30.199> do<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.470> pulled<00:05:30.949> three

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
then what I'm going to do I pulled three

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.420 
then what I'm going to do I pulled three
handles<00:05:31.760> here<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:33.139> got<00:05:33.349> some<00:05:33.380> knobs<00:05:33.830> and

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
handles here and I got some knobs and

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.080 
handles here and I got some knobs and
then<00:05:34.610> what<00:05:34.729> I'll<00:05:34.849> do<00:05:35.060> is<00:05:35.180> I'll<00:05:35.330> take<00:05:35.720> mine<00:05:37.090> I'll

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
then what I'll do is I'll take mine I'll

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.110 
then what I'll do is I'll take mine I'll
take<00:05:38.389> my<00:05:38.599> teapot<00:05:39.080> here<00:05:39.440> I'll<00:05:41.409> take<00:05:42.409> a<00:05:42.940> say<00:05:43.940> this

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
take my teapot here I'll take a say this

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.990 
take my teapot here I'll take a say this
is<00:05:44.300> my<00:05:44.509> spout<00:05:45.250> usually<00:05:46.250> what<00:05:46.340> I'll<00:05:46.460> do<00:05:46.669> is<00:05:46.820> I'll

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
is my spout usually what I'll do is I'll

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.760 
is my spout usually what I'll do is I'll
just<00:05:47.030> cut<00:05:47.659> I<00:05:47.870> know<00:05:47.960> I'm<00:05:48.169> going<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.380> probably

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
just cut I know I'm going to probably

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.930 
just cut I know I'm going to probably
have<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.070> cut<00:05:49.340> this<00:05:49.520> off<00:05:49.789> right<00:05:50.030> like<00:05:50.240> this<00:05:51.940> and

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
have to cut this off right like this and

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.480 
have to cut this off right like this and
then<00:05:53.539> I'll<00:05:53.690> sort<00:05:54.260> of<00:05:54.409> start<00:05:54.680> fitting<00:05:55.130> that<00:05:55.279> on

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
then I'll sort of start fitting that on

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.100 
then I'll sort of start fitting that on
and<00:05:55.760> see<00:05:56.029> how<00:05:56.300> that<00:05:56.360> look

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
and see how that look

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.439 
and see how that look
you<00:05:57.620> know<00:05:57.710> if<00:05:57.800> I<00:05:57.889> want<00:05:58.159> it<00:05:58.340> up<00:05:58.490> here<00:05:58.970> if<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.240> want

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
you know if I want it up here if I want

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
handle my handle is gonna want to sort

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.860 
handle my handle is gonna want to sort
of<00:06:34.969> sit<00:06:35.240> here<00:06:36.069> so<00:06:37.069> I<00:06:37.099> will<00:06:37.610> probably<00:06:37.849> then<00:06:38.210> cut

of sit here so I will probably then cut

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.219 
of sit here so I will probably then cut
some<00:06:38.900> of<00:06:39.259> this<00:06:39.379> off<00:06:41.319> and<00:06:42.879> then<00:06:43.879> serve<00:06:44.270> see
