this<00:02:41.940> one<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.180> few<00:02:42.420> days<00:02:42.660> ago<00:02:42.960> like<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.410> wasn't

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
this one a few days ago like it wasn't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.720 
this one a few days ago like it wasn't
really<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.580> hard<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.120> do<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.470> go

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
really that hard to do here we go

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.760 
really that hard to do here we go
zigzagging<00:02:47.730> doing<00:02:48.210> my<00:02:48.330> thing<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.140> i<00:02:49.500> keep

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
zigzagging doing my thing and i keep

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.190 
zigzagging doing my thing and i keep
getting<00:02:49.950> tackled<00:02:50.420> okay<00:02:51.420> maybe<00:02:51.690> they<00:02:51.990> made

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
getting tackled okay maybe they made

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.020 
getting tackled okay maybe they made
this<00:02:52.410> drill<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.800> little<00:02:53.250> harder<00:02:53.580> i<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:53.940> they

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
this drill a little harder i think they

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.400 
this drill a little harder i think they
might<00:02:54.210> have<00:02:54.240> made<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.750> little<00:02:54.930> harder

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
might have made it a little harder

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.470 
might have made it a little harder
because<00:02:55.650> when<00:02:56.610> i<00:02:56.700> was<00:02:56.820> first<00:02:57.000> doing<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.390> I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
because when i was first doing it I
