as far as heavy duty laminating I mean

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740 
as far as heavy duty laminating I mean
it's<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.699> pretty<00:00:56.699> heavy<00:00:56.910> duty<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it's it's a pretty heavy duty and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.740 
it's it's a pretty heavy duty and
everything<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> held<00:00:59.190> together<00:00:59.600> you<00:01:00.600> know

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
everything is held together you know

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.179 
everything is held together you know
these<00:01:01.260> things<00:01:02.899> once<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> close<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.650> it's

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
these things once you close that it's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
these things once you close that it's
not<00:01:05.460> coming<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.240> okay<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.229> thought<00:01:07.470> we'd

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
not coming out then okay I thought we'd

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
not coming out then okay I thought we'd
do<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:07.860> size<00:01:08.250> comparison<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.270> can

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
do a little size comparison here you can

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
do a little size comparison here you can
see<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> size<00:01:10.200> compared<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> regular

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
see the size compared to a regular

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.270 
see the size compared to a regular
