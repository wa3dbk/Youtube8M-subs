00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
round basically you have to guess the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
round basically you have to guess the
code<00:00:54.600> there'll<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.020> clues<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
code there'll be clues here but at the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.270 
code there'll be clues here but at the
minute<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:58.079> not<00:00:58.140> true<00:00:58.770> that's<00:00:59.129> where

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
minute of that's not true that's where

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.330 
minute of that's not true that's where
the<00:00:59.370> code<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.579> 1<00:00:59.850> 2<00:01:00.000> 3<00:01:00.120> 4<00:01:00.770> which<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:02.100> pin

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the code is 1 2 3 4 which is my pin

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.719 
the code is 1 2 3 4 which is my pin
number<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.300> debit<00:01:03.989> card<00:01:04.549> no<00:01:05.549> money

kidding
so<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> first<00:01:08.400> bonus<00:01:08.850> round

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so this is the first bonus round

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.050 
so this is the first bonus round
basically<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.290> hover<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.060> they'll

bring my gun in this is one I made
earlier<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.810> code<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:48.860> which<00:01:49.860> is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
earlier the code on it is this which is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
earlier the code on it is this which is
saying<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.540> mouse<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> be

saying that the mouse is going to be

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.069 
saying that the mouse is going to be
hidden<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.729> you're<00:01:53.909> gonna<00:01:54.000> use<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.630> gun<00:01:54.810> as

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
hidden so you're gonna use the gun as

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.420 
hidden so you're gonna use the gun as
your<00:01:55.229> mouse<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.250> x<00:01:56.430> position<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:58.619> my

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
little frame there and that is nothing

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.170 
little frame there and that is nothing
which<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:08.190> we<00:04:08.310> want<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.030> going<00:04:09.120> to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
which is what we want so it's going to

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.420 
which is what we want so it's going to
say<00:04:09.360> when<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:10.050> click<00:04:10.319> that<00:04:10.349> button<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.980> goes

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
say when you click that button it goes

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.920 
say when you click that button it goes
there<00:04:12.620> okay<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:15.330> need<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.540> put<00:04:15.690> stop

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
there okay but you need to put stop

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.659 
there okay but you need to put stop
functions<00:04:16.320> on<00:04:16.470> each<00:04:16.889> of<00:04:17.040> these<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.489> just

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
functions on each of these so just

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.820 
functions on each of these so just
create<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.000> new<00:04:18.090> layer<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.720> put<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.530> stop<00:04:20.480> and

create a new layer and put a stop and

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:30.560 
create a new layer and put a stop and
then<00:04:22.830> same<00:04:23.730> in<00:04:23.880> there<00:04:28.880> now<00:04:29.880> we<00:04:29.940> go<00:04:30.090> back<00:04:30.300> one

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
then same in there now we go back one

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.890 
then same in there now we go back one
into<00:04:31.530> symbol<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.430> your<00:04:32.550> movement<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.450> is

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
into symbol to your movement so this is

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.190 
into symbol to your movement so this is
where<00:04:34.139> we're<00:04:34.260> going<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.440> be<00:04:34.710> able<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.919> move<00:04:35.100> it

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:50.260 

from<00:04:43.200> there<00:04:45.560> go<00:04:46.560> 60<00:04:47.460> frames<00:04:47.729> create<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.210> new<00:04:48.419> one

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
from there go 60 frames create a new one

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.360 
from there go 60 frames create a new one
move<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.389> over<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.810> there<00:04:52.760> dink-dink<00:04:53.990> put<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.139> a

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
move it over to there dink-dink put in a

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.270 
move it over to there dink-dink put in a
tween<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.930> moved<00:04:58.289> from<00:04:58.470> there<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.830> there<00:04:59.460> and

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
tween so I moved from there to there and

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.279 
tween so I moved from there to there and
then<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.539> one<00:05:03.660> hundred<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:04.020> twentieth

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
then on the one hundred and twentieth

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.730 
then on the one hundred and twentieth
frame<00:05:05.000> just<00:05:06.000> drag<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.300> one<00:05:06.600> hold<00:05:07.320> alt<00:05:07.590> and

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
frame just drag that one hold alt and

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.090 
frame just drag that one hold alt and
drag<00:05:07.830> over<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.760> 120<00:05:10.700> so<00:05:11.700> then<00:05:12.570> goes<00:05:12.810> back<00:05:13.500> to

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
drag over to 120 so then goes back to

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.440 
drag over to 120 so then goes back to
there<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.700> they'll<00:05:14.820> just<00:05:14.910> keep<00:05:15.120> repeating

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
there and they'll just keep repeating

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.060 
there and they'll just keep repeating
that<00:05:15.630> unless<00:05:16.169> you<00:05:16.320> put<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.500> stop<00:05:16.710> function

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
that unless you put a stop function

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.969 
that unless you put a stop function
there<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.310> so<00:05:17.400> that's<00:05:17.490> what<00:05:17.640> you<00:05:17.729> want<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:17.910> do

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
there and so that's what you want to do

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:29.120 
there and so that's what you want to do
so<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:23.570> think<00:05:25.039> yeah<00:05:27.650> that's<00:05:28.650> just<00:05:28.889> gonna<00:05:29.039> move

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
so I think yeah that's just gonna move

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.040 
so I think yeah that's just gonna move
left<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.490> right<00:05:29.700> at<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.570> minute<00:05:30.750> my<00:05:30.840> curse<00:05:31.020> is

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
left and right at the minute my curse is

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.129 
left and right at the minute my curse is
behind<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.919> block<00:05:32.729> because<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.900> way<00:05:34.020> I've

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
behind the block because of the way I've

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.890 
behind the block because of the way I've
got<00:05:34.289> my<00:05:34.380> layer<00:05:34.560> set<00:05:34.860> up<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:36.240> if<00:05:36.330> we<00:05:36.479> just<00:05:36.660> drag

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
got my layer set up so if we just drag

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.170 
got my layer set up so if we just drag
that<00:05:37.410> under<00:05:37.889> that<00:05:38.990> that's<00:05:39.990> cool

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
that under that that's cool

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.650 
that under that that's cool
awesome<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:45.680> that's<00:05:46.340> pretty<00:05:46.550> cool<00:05:46.699> and<00:05:46.940> then

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
awesome so that's pretty cool and then

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.999 
awesome so that's pretty cool and then
if<00:05:48.139> we<00:05:48.740> have<00:05:49.070> a<00:05:49.960> little<00:05:50.960> school<00:05:51.289> bar<00:05:51.470> at<00:05:51.919> the

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
if we have a little school bar at the

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.550 
if we have a little school bar at the
top<00:05:52.190> here<00:05:52.430> just<00:05:52.780> create<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:54.190> dynamic<00:05:55.190> text<00:05:55.639> box

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
top here just create a dynamic text box

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.629 
top here just create a dynamic text box
doesn't<00:05:57.560> have<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.800> have<00:05:57.889> anything<00:05:58.100> in<00:05:58.280> it<00:05:58.400> and

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
doesn't have to have anything in it and

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.610 
doesn't have to have anything in it and
just<00:05:59.180> call<00:05:59.449> it<00:05:59.479> score<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:01.690> then<00:06:02.690> in<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.470> very

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
just call it score and then in the very

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.969 
just call it score and then in the very
a<00:06:03.740> bit<00:06:04.030> put<00:06:05.030> root<00:06:05.570> underscore<00:06:06.560> root

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
a bit put root underscore root

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.590

and then just create an actions layer

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.589 
and then just create an actions layer
and<00:06:20.180> in<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.449> actions<00:06:20.750> layer<00:06:20.840> put<00:06:22.599> under

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
button function where we wrote our code

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.560 
button function where we wrote our code
there<00:06:40.669> and<00:06:41.500> under<00:06:42.500> here<00:06:42.680> put<00:06:43.389> under<00:06:44.389> school

when we shoot this it's going to go to
the<00:06:54.440> next<00:06:54.590> frame<00:06:54.710> which<00:06:55.039> is<00:06:55.159> nothing<00:06:55.970> there

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
the next frame which is nothing there

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.110 
the next frame which is nothing there
and<00:06:56.419> it's<00:06:56.990> also<00:06:57.139> going<00:06:57.349> to<00:06:57.409> add<00:06:57.470> a<00:06:57.889> point<00:06:58.880> to

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
and it's also going to add a point to

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.640 
and it's also going to add a point to
our<00:06:59.360> school<00:06:59.800> okay<00:07:00.830> go<00:07:01.430> back<00:07:01.580> to<00:07:01.669> seam<00:07:01.849> one<00:07:02.650> test

our school okay go back to seam one test
it<00:07:03.880> say<00:07:04.880> no<00:07:05.150> bang<00:07:06.020> one<00:07:06.860> point<00:07:07.240> so<00:07:08.240> if<00:07:08.300> we<00:07:08.389> just

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
it say no bang one point so if we just

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.339 
it say no bang one point so if we just
copy<00:07:09.139> a<00:07:09.260> load<00:07:09.440> of<00:07:09.560> these<00:07:09.880> hold<00:07:10.880> alt<00:07:11.060> and<00:07:11.240> drag

copy a load of these hold alt and drag

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:20.860 
copy a load of these hold alt and drag
down<00:07:12.970> and<00:07:13.970> maybe<00:07:14.389> make<00:07:14.570> that<00:07:14.599> one<00:07:14.870> smaller
