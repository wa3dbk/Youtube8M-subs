 About 40 kg 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.079

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.079

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.040
 For example yet 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:02.710
 There is no smell when the fish rots 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:08.010
 On the contrary fresh yeah 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.010
 Even the smell of fish is drifting 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.890
 It is the positional 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 It's almost like this

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:22.170
 In such a condition, a flow has entered Asai shallow water 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.810

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.600
 From the upstream 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.900
 Sometimes when it's falling downstream 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.319
