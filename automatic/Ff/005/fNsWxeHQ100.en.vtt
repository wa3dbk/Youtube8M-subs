up to head out for whitefish in a few
weeks<00:00:22.930> I've<00:00:23.140> got<00:00:23.259> a<00:00:23.290> trip<00:00:23.619> plan<00:00:23.919> with<00:00:24.279> the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
weeks I've got a trip plan with the

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.880 
weeks I've got a trip plan with the
ladies<00:00:24.790> from<00:00:24.970> Wisconsin<00:00:25.660> women<00:00:25.960> fish<00:00:26.200> and<00:00:26.739> a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
ladies from Wisconsin women fish and a

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.190 
ladies from Wisconsin women fish and a
lot<00:00:27.099> of<00:00:27.130> them<00:00:27.489> have<00:00:27.669> been<00:00:27.820> asking<00:00:28.270> me<00:00:28.480> how<00:00:29.140> to

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
lot of them have been asking me how to

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.550 
lot of them have been asking me how to
set<00:00:29.590> up<00:00:29.619> their<00:00:29.890> rods<00:00:30.099> with<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.090> slider<00:00:31.689> so<00:00:32.230> I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
set up their rods with a slider so I

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.620 
set up their rods with a slider so I
think<00:00:32.739> that<00:00:33.190> it's<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.399> good<00:00:33.579> time<00:00:33.880> right<00:00:34.149> now

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
think that it's a good time right now

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.270 
think that it's a good time right now
we've<00:00:34.870> got<00:00:34.989> three<00:00:35.290> or<00:00:35.320> four<00:00:35.440> weeks<00:00:35.800> before<00:00:36.160> the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
we've got three or four weeks before the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.190 
we've got three or four weeks before the
big<00:00:36.370> trip<00:00:36.700> let's<00:00:37.270> talk<00:00:37.570> about<00:00:37.750> that<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.110> I'll

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
big trip let's talk about that and I'll

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.689 
big trip let's talk about that and I'll
show<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:38.470> exactly<00:00:38.920> how<00:00:39.219> you're<00:00:39.370> gonna<00:00:39.430> do

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
show you exactly how you're gonna do

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.529 
show you exactly how you're gonna do
that<00:00:40.199> first<00:00:41.199> of<00:00:41.350> all<00:00:41.550> you're<00:00:42.550> going<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:42.910> want

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
that first of all you're going to want

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.410 
that first of all you're going to want
to<00:00:43.600> use<00:00:43.780> monofilament<00:00:44.500> line<00:00:44.920> I've<00:00:45.309> got<00:00:45.760> six<00:00:46.210> to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
to use monofilament line I've got six to

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.450 
to use monofilament line I've got six to
eight<00:00:46.539> pound<00:00:46.899> test<00:00:47.050> whichever<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:47.890> prefer<00:00:48.039> on

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
eight pound test whichever you prefer on

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.939 
eight pound test whichever you prefer on
here<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.510> reason<00:00:49.989> I<00:00:50.079> have<00:00:50.289> such<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.620> heavy

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
here the reason I have such a heavy

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.029 
here the reason I have such a heavy
grade<00:00:51.309> line<00:00:51.609> is<00:00:51.940> because<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:53.260> small<00:00:53.589> treble

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
grade line is because this small treble

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.619 
grade line is because this small treble
hook<00:00:54.219> which<00:00:54.429> you<00:00:54.550> can<00:00:54.699> use<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:54.850> number<00:00:55.059> 12<00:00:55.449> or

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
hook which you can use a number 12 or

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.709 
hook which you can use a number 12 or
number<00:00:55.960> 14<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.800> going<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.670> literally<00:00:57.940> slide<00:00:58.420> up

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
number 14 is going to literally slide up

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.180 
number 14 is going to literally slide up
and<00:00:58.870> down<00:00:59.019> on<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.260> line<00:00:59.559> so<00:00:59.829> it's<00:00:59.949> going<00:01:00.100> to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
and down on the line so it's going to

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.560 
and down on the line so it's going to
cause<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.399> little<00:01:00.670> bit<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:00.969> friction<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.510> a

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
cause a little bit of friction and a

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.380 
cause a little bit of friction and a
little<00:01:01.809> bit<00:01:01.899> of<00:01:01.989> wear<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.320> tear<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:04.120> first

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
little bit of wear and tear so the first

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.060 
little bit of wear and tear so the first
thing<00:01:04.659> that<00:01:04.690> you're<00:01:04.930> going<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.080> need<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.560> do<00:01:05.800> is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
thing that you're going to need to do is

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.320 
thing that you're going to need to do is
this<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:07.450> eye<00:01:07.480> of<00:01:08.110> your<00:01:08.590> treble<00:01:08.980> hook<00:01:09.330> you're

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
this the eye of your treble hook you're

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.000 
this the eye of your treble hook you're
going<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.690> take<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.140> eye<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.620> treble<00:01:11.860> hook

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
going to take the eye of the treble hook

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.850 
going to take the eye of the treble hook
you're<00:01:13.000> going<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.360> feed<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.870> line<00:01:14.080> directly

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
you're going to feed the line directly

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.050 
you're going to feed the line directly
through<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.370> eye<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:16.540> time<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.880> going<00:01:18.970> to

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
through the eye one time you're going to

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.960 
through the eye one time you're going to
come<00:01:19.300> back<00:01:19.330> around<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.590> go<00:01:21.250> right<00:01:21.280> through

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
come back around and go right through

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.710 
come back around and go right through
the<00:01:22.180> eye<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:22.690> hook<00:01:22.960> one<00:01:23.410> more<00:01:23.710> time<00:01:24.720> no

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
the eye of that hook one more time no

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.570 
the eye of that hook one more time no
this<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.320> technique<00:01:26.830> that<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:27.100> have<00:01:27.370> been

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
this is a technique that I have been

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.860 
this is a technique that I have been
using<00:01:27.610> for<00:01:28.110> probably<00:01:29.110> I<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.820> say<00:01:31.060> close<00:01:31.750> to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
using for probably I would say close to

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.530 
using for probably I would say close to
12<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.590> 14<00:01:33.040> years<00:01:36.180> looks<00:01:37.180> like<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:37.390> got<00:01:37.510> it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
12 to 14 years looks like I got it

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.320 
12 to 14 years looks like I got it
caught<00:01:37.810> on<00:01:38.020> there<00:01:38.230> now<00:01:39.160> you'll<00:01:39.700> see<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.180> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
caught on there now you'll see that the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.750 
caught on there now you'll see that the
hook<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.810> on<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.680> line<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.190> all<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.580> do

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
hook is on the line and all you do

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.670 
hook is on the line and all you do
literally<00:01:43.150> is<00:01:43.360> slide<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.900> right<00:01:43.930> up<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.500> line

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
literally is slide it right up the line

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.850 
literally is slide it right up the line
now<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.730> does<00:01:45.910> not<00:01:46.120> matter<00:01:46.570> whether<00:01:47.260> this<00:01:47.590> hook

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
now it does not matter whether this hook

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.330 
now it does not matter whether this hook
is<00:01:48.600> sideways<00:01:49.600> straight<00:01:50.290> up<00:01:50.410> and<00:01:50.590> down<00:01:50.650> as<00:01:51.130> long

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
is sideways straight up and down as long

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.520 
is sideways straight up and down as long
as<00:01:51.580> it's<00:01:51.760> on<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.600> line<00:01:52.780> that's<00:01:53.050> all<00:01:53.230> you<00:01:53.380> need

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
as it's on the line that's all you need

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.140 
as it's on the line that's all you need
to<00:01:53.590> worry<00:01:53.650> about<00:01:53.860> white<00:01:54.400> fish<00:01:54.670> have<00:01:54.880> very

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
to worry about white fish have very

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.380 
to worry about white fish have very
small<00:01:55.660> mouths<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.030> reason

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
small mouths and that's the reason
