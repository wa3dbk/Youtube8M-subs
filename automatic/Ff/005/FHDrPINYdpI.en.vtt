00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.230
 hello friends in this video I will try 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.720
 explain how we can change the pins 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.640
 of some cables made of a radio-cd 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.410
 our vehicle sometimes happens that 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.510
 when we buy a radio-cd for 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.970
 change what we have in series happens that 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.710
 we connect the cables correctly with 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.140
 the adapter that the radio usually uses 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.510
 offer but it happens that when we remove 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.710
 the contact of the key turns out that only 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.730
 for the uar that configuration that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.980
 we had gotten on the radio 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.110
 configuration I mean him more than 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 we want the equalizer presented nor is it 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.380
 that we have saved from the radio 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.620
 etcetera then when we remove the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.360
 key and short battery when returning to 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.680
 Plug in is before we have everything 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.260
 configured as if we had put 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.540
 another standard mind from the beginning said 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.390
 until the time of the network this would be 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.550
 configured then what we're going to see 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.920
 when that happens what we have to 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.200
 to do is modify the position of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.229
 cables and on the radio well 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.870
 these are the cables of the radio cedé of 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.150
 a citroën xsara 1.6 and sx 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.100
 this is the adapter that comes with 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.020
 the cd radio to be able to connect the radio 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 well the gap is to say these connectors 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.340
 females would go to this male connector and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.080
 then this already depending on the radio 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.000
 will have a connector or another here we have 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.350
 the new radio that we want to put in 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.300
 this would be the connector that comes with the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 the cause of the problem of that 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.170
 deconfiguration of the radio that is not 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.090
 saves in memory is that the position 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.580
 of the cable that offers us to save the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 memory with the position of the cable that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.140
 gives us the energy the radio are 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.940
 exchanged that is does not match as 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.250
 is of the electrical installation of the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.290
 vehicle with the adapter that it offers us 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.480
 the radio then what we have to 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.940
 do is change the position of those 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.760
 wires to match the cable 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.410
 adapter with the next female cable 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.690
 and get out of the hole that the radio makes 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.370
 this can be done both from this 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.400
 part like the adapter you give us 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.630
 the radio I would really recommend doing 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.570
 from the adapter because if not 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.860
 we know totally how is the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.810
 electrical installation of our 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.970
 vehicle it is possible that we modify the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.860
 position of the cable pins to 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.630
 a question that is not correct then 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.950
 when 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.900
 we bought a radio that does not 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.070
 comes the instructions usually we 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.130
 says each cable so that is in this case 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.900
 on my radio I gave in here comes the each 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.570
 cable what for what it is used for 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.850
 example here the yellow serves to 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.600
 save the memories what it is that we 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.550
 interesting and red color this red color 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.620
 is the one that gives us the power of the radio 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.690
 therefore what we should do is 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.310
 modify the position where the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.520
 yellow cable 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.640
 by the position of the red wire ie 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.160
 here it would be in if we see here there 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.090
 has two numbers the card does not look good 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.349
 but this is 4 and red is in 7 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.580
 in red are the 7 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.099
 and red is in 7 what we have 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.120
 what to do is change the position of the 7 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:10.459
 to 4 and from 4 to 7 in that way 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.620
 we would fix the problem every time 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.900
 we would remove the contact from the key and the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.519
 short battery when the radio turns off 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.140
 When turning on again we will return to 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.900
 have everything configured as we had 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.600
 done at first then how 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.060
 we modify the position of the cables 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.720
 some adapters this is not the case 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.400
 well in the middle of the cable comes a 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.080
 kind of tab to say it some 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.940
 way in which it allows you to exchange 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.110
 where is the yellow wire in panama 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.360
 where is the red of the red the yellow 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.170
 so you do not have to remove anything 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.569
 from here and change position but 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.180
 is not the case and there are many cables that do not 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.670
 come with that functionality then 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.310
 To remove these cables, it is not enough 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.380
 pull back in fact this is well 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.590
 because it is blocked with a little eyelash 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.560
 that have these metal bits that 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.170
 they prevent you from removing the cables and that 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.060
 release so easily then what 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.190
 we need could be done with a 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.140
 small screwdriver but the ideal and 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.300
 although it seems the comedian works very 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.580
 well use a crochet of which 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.230
 They use mothers in grandmothers 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.329
 to do the crochet as we release 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.400
 as we remove the cable from here we go to 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.109
 locate that we want to remove the cable 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.690
 yellow yellow wire is the position 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.760
 4 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.800
 we see that it is precisely here where 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.780
 we want to remove it if we look at the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.270
 tab to the dedicated blog of the connector there 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.360
 a hole well precisely in the 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.560
 connector that we want to remove 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.400
 we will insert the crochet in the boom in 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.020
 the hole and we will push towards the 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.570
 side where is the connector that is 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.880
 inward because because every 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.080
 connector has a locking eyelash 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.210
 the cable so that you can not 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.900
 remove so easily then we do 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.650
 pressure and at the same time we remove the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.650
 cable back 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.320
 we have inward pressure and we're going 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:10.190
 pulling out the cable there is 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.060
 so the cable would be removed if we see here 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.770
 she has that little eyelash that what she does is 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.630
 block it inside the tab then 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.780
 what we have done with the crochet has 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.330
 been tightening this little eyelash this 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.530
 lever so that pulling towards 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.050
 back we can release the connector 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.050
 we must do the same with the red wire 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.360
 in the same way squeezing towards 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:41.240
 in and pulling back the cable 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.860
 we see that it is released as well 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.710
 only thing that we now have to do is 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.590
 make sure that little eyelash is 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.599
 lifted up on both a cable and another 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.240
 so now when you put them in the 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.240
 position that interests us of the record 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.430
 be anchored then now that we have 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.889
 the cables removed we can already do the 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.340
 change if before the yellow was in the 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.680
 position 4 of the connector 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.400
 the red was in the 7 then we will do 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:14.760
 just that the yellow goes to pin 7 and the 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.520
 red to 4 then we take the yellow 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.930
 and we put it in the pin in the 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.930
 connector number 7 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.659
 today we see that he makes a small clack and 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:29.449
 we see that he has effectively stayed 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:33.260
 anchored the card and the red that we have 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:36.350
 said then goes now to position 4 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:39.490
 here is the 4 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.490
 and we introduce it 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.410
 clicked and it has effectively 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.910
 well anchored well then of this 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.670
 we have changed 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.700
 the position of the cables inside the 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.230
 connector without having to cut and solder or 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.390
 make another kind of story of this is 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.370
 a much cleaner way to change 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.130
 the positions of how they are located 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.960
 the wires inside the connector using the 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.000
 radio adapter then this 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.820
 so initially most 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.030
 cases the problem is solved and only 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.820
 we have to connect 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.820
 the female part with the male part 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.930
 this over here 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.940
 this 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.940
 and now we only have to connect the radio 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.330
 now we would need to check that 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.100
 effectively by entering the key of the 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.100
 vehicle 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.140
 and connect the radio and do the 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.780
 settings you want us 

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.320
 everything is saved once 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.940
 let's remove the key again 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.620
 and with this we have solved the problem 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.200
 of radio configuration I hope that 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.760
 has been helpful and if not then I can not 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.760
 follow more Galician greetings
