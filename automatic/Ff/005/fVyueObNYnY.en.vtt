00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
this one on our spelling materials some

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.540 
this one on our spelling materials some
I'll<00:05:28.270> try<00:05:28.479> it<00:05:28.659> out<00:05:28.810> for<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.380> next<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:30.400> then

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
I'll try it out for the next and then

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.800 
I'll try it out for the next and then
I'm<00:05:30.669> probably<00:05:30.849> three<00:05:31.300> minutes<00:05:31.570> too<00:05:32.169> much<00:05:32.349> baby

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
I'm probably three minutes too much baby

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.990 
I'm probably three minutes too much baby
so<00:05:34.810> that's<00:05:34.960> how<00:05:35.110> organized<00:05:35.590> my<00:05:35.770> space<00:05:36.099> and<00:05:36.490> it

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
so that's how organized my space and it

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.050 
so that's how organized my space and it
works<00:05:37.180> really<00:05:37.449> well<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:39.460> just<00:05:39.669> think<00:05:39.880> that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
works really well and I just think that

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.680 
works really well and I just think that
being<00:05:40.960> organized<00:05:41.409> is<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.800> very<00:05:42.190> important<00:05:42.759> way

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
being organized is a very important way

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.140 
being organized is a very important way

took a $1 quilting fabric from jo-ann
fabrics<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.409> I<00:05:59.620> literally<00:06:00.039> just<00:06:00.460> pushed<00:06:01.029> it

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180

fabrics and I literally just pushed it
down<00:06:01.389> and<00:06:01.690> I<00:06:02.080> think<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.409> glue<00:06:02.620> gunned<00:06:02.860> the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
down and I think a glue gunned the

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.600 
down and I think a glue gunned the
bottom

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
bottom

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.249
