me show you how they look when they're
hanging<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.020> setup<00:00:16.260> looks<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.800> pretty

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
hanging so the setup looks like pretty

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460 
hanging so the setup looks like pretty
simple<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.789> pull-up<00:00:18.060> bar<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.300> top<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
simple the pull-up bar on top and the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.160 
simple the pull-up bar on top and the
ranks<00:00:19.859> are<00:00:20.160> hanging<00:00:20.609> right<00:00:20.760> there<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:22.109> can

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
ranks are hanging right there and I can

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.630 
ranks are hanging right there and I can
detach<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.490> Rings<00:00:24.060> anytime<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> want<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
detach the Rings anytime I want but the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.179 
detach the Rings anytime I want but the
only<00:00:26.670> concern<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.900> safety<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
only concern with this is safety is the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.840 
only concern with this is safety is the
fact<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.599> this<00:00:30.619> whole<00:00:31.619> bar<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.430> bolted

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
fact that this whole bar is not bolted

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.450 
fact that this whole bar is not bolted
to<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> doorframe<00:00:34.469> or<00:00:34.829> anything<00:00:35.040> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to the to the doorframe or anything so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.420 
to the to the doorframe or anything so
it<00:00:36.000> falls<00:00:36.300> off<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.930> push<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.469> way<00:00:37.530> get

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
it falls off you push it this way get

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430 
it falls off you push it this way get
stronger<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.910> push<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.809> so

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
stronger if you push it this way so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.020 
stronger if you push it this way so
that's<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> only<00:00:40.980> concern<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.850> might

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that's the only concern that you might

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.220 
that's the only concern that you might
have<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.600> can't<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.079> too

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
have is that you can't really get too

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.660 
have is that you can't really get too
crazy<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> Rings<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.160> else<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.489> might

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
crazy with the Rings or else you might

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.450 
crazy with the Rings or else you might
fall<00:00:45.090> apart<00:00:45.840> might<00:00:46.140> fall<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:47.100> does<00:00:47.340> not

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
fall apart might fall and it does not

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
fall apart might fall and it does not
going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> big<00:00:48.059> fall<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:49.469> wanted<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
going to be a big fall I just wanted to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.709 
going to be a big fall I just wanted to
point<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> setup

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
point that out but this is the setup

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.250 
point that out but this is the setup
that<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.930> use<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> fact<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.640> can

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
that I use in I like the fact that I can

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
that I use in I like the fact that I can
superset<00:00:55.430> dips<00:00:56.430> inverted<00:00:57.059> rows<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> post

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
with a straight bar I can also just pull

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
with a straight bar I can also just pull
the<00:01:00.690> Rings<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.620> pull-ups<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.609> chin-ups

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
like the the flexibility the main thing

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
somewhere else take it to the playground

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450 
somewhere else take it to the playground
and<00:01:15.330> use<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:17.070> always<00:01:17.280> having

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and use them there and not always having

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.700 
and use them there and not always having
to<00:01:17.610> rely<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.990> having<00:01:19.409> them<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
to rely on and having them on the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.490 
to rely on and having them on the
ceiling<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.130> something<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
ceiling or something like that and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.170 
ceiling or something like that and
that's<00:01:22.500> pretty<00:01:22.860> much<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> wanted<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
