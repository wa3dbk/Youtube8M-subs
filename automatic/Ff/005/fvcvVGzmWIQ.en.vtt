00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.360
 this being how to know if our 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.530
 phone is being spied on 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.520
 this is being monitored by 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.260
 other people good this before 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.630
 start this one can with any 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.750
 phone I have an android but it 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.460

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.730
 phone and with that the ico in 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.489
 any kind of company either 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.760
 movistar telcel here in Mexico truth in 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.940
 an unfortunate iphone in all brands 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.500
 that exist here in Mexico can and is 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.200
 with any phone to the most 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.630
 oldies can be because these even 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.420
 they may be watching them in their 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.880
 calls or in your messages good 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.500
 First, it's very simple 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.130
 we go to as if 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.060
 we were going to make a call 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.799
 whether on the phone they have this and 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.070
 already once here on the keyboard you 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:21.070
 they're going to do this code they 're going to tighten 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:24.490
 asterisk a cat 06 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.240
 cat when the cat number is squeezed 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.860
 they will leave a number a little window 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.810
 it should not be precisely what I 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.590
 came out to me there are there different windows 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.310
 but what is this is going to you 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.960
 to leave something called here email this and m 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.020
 and like a good number this what we 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.340
 let's fix is ​​on the number and good 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.710
 with this number we give ourselves 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.850
 account if our phone is being 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.080
 spied on by someone or by other people 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.360
 good 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.300
 this number that means good this is 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.820
 number is called email is the number 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.410
 is not the phone number or anything like this 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.950
 is the number that all phones 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.250
 they bring when they manufacture it from the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.320
 company is that number I brought it printed 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.820
 on the phone physically nothing of 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.760
 internal nothing that's a number that all 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.790
 they carry in a clear this each telephone 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.830
 It has a different number but this is the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.300
 which physically leads 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.280
 and here I have a note that goes like this 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.360
 leave in my case is this is the same 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.630
 number 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.420
 well here it's worth the interesting thing is if you 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.150
 you have the number can be the same 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.370
 numbers letters all that's fine but 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.740
 if it is if in some of you they have 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.480
 something similar like this that after 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.860
 last number whether they have a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.970
 a diagonal or have an asterisk or 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.909
 have a space or have a point not 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.790
 I know some sign that divides from others 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.549
 numbers true in the majority that I've 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.170
 seen they have a diagonal and here they continue 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.800
 other numbers good 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.080
 this good your phone must leave 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.660
 as I only got a number 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.370
 and it's over if you get a point a 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.040
 space east 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.380
 I already told you something that divides from others 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.560
 numbers and if they have then 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.790
 or other numbers each number means 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.320
 one thing but if you are already doing this 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.870
 monitored by some people and this 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.780
 not all the phone but but if any 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.500
 part of your phone is already doing 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:53.490
 this monitored this 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.570
 I think this is that if they seem to you later 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:01.110
 a diagonal and three zeros or an asterisk 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.810
 and 30 or something means that completely 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.320
 your phone is being spied on 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.680
 calls are spying messages 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.530
 and if you have a smartphone it's just 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.200
 they are taking out good accounts a disaster 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.380
 but here is one is not a combination 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.400
 I had a phone that 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.100
 I had 01 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.250
 and good without what it means to be one 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.009
 good that he was doing or if of some 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.979
 way spied on this but it's only 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:37.210
 that messages or calls 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:40.270
 be like this I have certainly seen 0 0 2 no 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.910
 I know that you will already be already changing truth 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.960
 but this one in that way we realize 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.539
 this if our phone because already already 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.570
 this journal is being watched 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.449
 I would recommend if you have this 30 hours and 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.760
 that you try to sell him to do something to him 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.910
 because if the truth is already there is already very 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.440
 very committed that phone then good 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.790
 friends and that's all been 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.060
 I hope you have served them 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:13.350

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.120

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.170
