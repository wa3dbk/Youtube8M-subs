00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everything is everything except that I you 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:09.480
 present and update to the top-10 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.730
 much to 0.4 this update is 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.769
 released on February 4, 2015 but I did not 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 not yet had the time to do it and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.020
 then after that I have a little forgotten 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.270
 now I'm catching up with this bet 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.769
 up to date is about gopro 04 black and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 civr edition and she will bring 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.529
 some improvements for the blake and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.660
 the silver edition so you go 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 to be able to have automatic rotation of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.480
 the image for that it will be necessary to make you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.130
 in the settings 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.350
 instead of adjusting the rotation on up 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.059
 you choose the auto mode and here you are 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.210
 so will have the automatic rotation of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.210
 the image 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.719
 then the burst mode includes 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.940
 now the opportunity to take 30 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.739
 photos in six seconds what will you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.480
 allow to create image sequences 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.890
 so you can learn how to do it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.289
 recently little tutorial I did 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 on photoshop we continue with the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.190
 beacons highlight indeed it is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.899
 possible to put these tags when 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.250
 reading your video you just need 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.049
 so just put a tag 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.640
 as usual though if you have 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.920
 the black edition you have to buy 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 the LCD screen finally I kept the best 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 for the end gopro add a word of time 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.590
 lapse in 4k the big advantage is that this 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.750
 time lapse except to be done directly 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.009
 and automatically in the camera you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.470
 will not need to go through 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.509
 big studios you can do it in 16 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.500
 9th or 4/3 so for leucate yesterday I 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.360
 have no example but in fact 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.549
 simply a mode that is less wide 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.840
 and bigger ones to activate will be able 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.640
 just go to the settings of the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.110
 video mode is selected time lapse 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.579
 video 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.259
 we end this video with two 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.030
 settings available for the hero gopro 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.439
 4 black edition so you will have 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.439
 now the possibility of filming in 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.579
 720p with 240 frames per second which 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.950
 is huge 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.030
 the only problem is that you have to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.680
 filmed in narrosse mode by the way the word 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.900
 should not care but without the fish eye 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.690
 finally you can now film in 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.490
 2007 that had only 60 frames per second 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.369
 it will now be possible to do 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.259
 sub and motion in 2.7 because that's it 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.670
 then through his different wagers 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.350
 day I think that gopro laughs a little 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.000
 of us since I realize that 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.860
 our gopro has a big potential but 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.090
 that she is voluntarily blocked a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.410
 simple update thus allows to 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.060
 develops but hey it is true that if go 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.319
 prod and completely block our camera 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 we would not need to buy their 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.670
 future cameras the gopro hero 5 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.050
 Anyway, I hope this video shows you 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.920
 you will enjoy this news 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.160
 potential 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.160
 kisses
