00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.470
 In general, all the guys hello yet allows 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.780
 I have a little time here for a copy 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.160
 but already getting ready to go home and decided 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.750
 remove settings deuce 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.780
 how to configure it to search on the beach 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.820
 so for a start we go into the ground 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.490
 be sure to put the swing that is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 turn on start well who walks surrenders to me 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 knows how to do a ground detuning so 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.670
 Well, the following go to the menu in the menu 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.149
 discrimination can not be changed 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.859
 it does not affect anything well of course than 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.160
 less discrimination so he is a little bit 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:46.679
 deeper sensitivity as possible 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.190
 higher lift because on the lakes like 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.440
 the rule 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.690
 there is no electricity 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.370
 silence that is go away at 98 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.309
 sensitive articles can not be put 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.699
 because real noise will go current 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 leave the coil 2 and purity if put 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.920
 put the most desirable immediately 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.720
 choose golden max power program 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.480
 is the third in the coffin of the program on 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.380
 account but no 2 apologizing program 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.680
 I have selected my gmp program 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.470
 so the next is loud iron hem 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.570
 iron can be turned off altogether on lakes 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.580
 iron is usually very small but all 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.100
 equal it comes across but so i put 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.640
 this one and I go on one 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 that there are such signals as if 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.290
 clog that is there carnations can 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.670
 sometimes comes across either from 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.560
 next to the pier when you dig 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.720
 surely there are pieces 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.450
 what some welds but by a welding 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.830
 welding machine 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.200
 speed speed can be set at all 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.230
 maximum 4 because usually 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 a lot of coins on the beach and to share 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.980
 each goal is desirable to use 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.590
 This is the speed of the weak 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.009
 signals can be left 4 because 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.560
 it doesnâ€™t have much effect because 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.630
 it affects that is 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.410
 quiet beeps will sound loud see 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.459
 interference I increased the noise strongly 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.709
 as a rule on the lakes all the little things 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.780
 is on the surface there are earrings 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.900
 all sorts of coin chains they lie all on 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.110
 surfaces that is there are 34 centimeters from 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.630
 sat on the lies or even on the surface 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.370
 label do not touch label this is a cut of the ground 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.650
 Ie still want to add 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.870
 if anyone walks with any 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.540
 digging everything on the lakes 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.580
 all that rings all dig even who's 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.480
 wants to dig in the iron because the coins 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.040
 iron but I certainly don't dig well 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.560
 I advise you to drip everything because 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.830
 Some say there I cut the cork 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.120
 so as not to dig them well wanted to say under 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.519
 cork vodka cork fall out 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.739
 silver rings big rings they 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.049
 fall under this segment and that is if 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.160
 you cut then you usually cut 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.110
 and these rings and some foil too 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.239
 ticking foil says why I don't find 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.600
 gold yes because gold falls under 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:22.400
 foil segment and when disconnecting foil 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:26.120
 you turn off and gold so well everything is in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.530
 In general , I ran through the settings in 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.959
 general who liked the video put 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.810
 Like who did not like dizlike 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.810
 In general, all for now thanks for watching
