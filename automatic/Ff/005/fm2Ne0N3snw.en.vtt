about<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> supposedly<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.109> going

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
about this is that supposedly is going

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
about this is that supposedly is going
to<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> campaign<00:01:02.430> type<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.180> thing<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to be a campaign type of thing and I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.320 
to be a campaign type of thing and I
really<00:01:04.409> want<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.489> zombies<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
really want to see that in zombies I

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.160 
really want to see that in zombies I
think<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.430> basically

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
think that's what is you know basically

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.050 
think that's what is you know basically
it's<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.530> appearing<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.340> Call<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> Duty<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
it's not appearing in Call of Duty I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's not appearing in Call of Duty I
think<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.409> need<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.189> sort<00:01:14.340> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
think what we need is like some sort of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
think what we need is like some sort of
campaign<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.810> looking<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.619> forward

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
campaign so I'm looking really forward

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
campaign so I'm looking really forward
for<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.549> game<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.900> sure<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.470> it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
for this game now I'm not sure if it's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
for this game now I'm not sure if it's
going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.070> good<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.820> didn't<00:01:21.090> saw<00:01:21.240> no
