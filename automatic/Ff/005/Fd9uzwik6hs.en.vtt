00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.650
 good afternoon my name is alexei krasikov 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.350
 welcome to the portal neurosis 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.139
 megalopolis of law keep answering 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.799
 your last questions today i have chosen 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.450
 answer the next question Alekseevich 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.940
 Hello, please tell me how 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.500
 learn to understand people as you can 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.250
 check them before serious 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.230
 Relations example for many 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.769
 tell me a short technique or 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.579
 exercises as well as possible in general 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.540
 you can understand people veronica 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.329
 veronica is really an ability 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 understanding people is a good skill and 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:51.050
 concept to understand people 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:55.020
 very extensive of course to master 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.360
 By all kinds of this they are by most 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.570
 words art starting with non-verbal 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.030
 body movements and facial expressions 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 ending their deep strategies their 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.520
 behavior takes years of work 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.920
 practice I will not be afraid of this word 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.869
 talent and no inner 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.400
 feeling because reading a book 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.820
 about some kind of method that's not 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.110
 understand people 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.829
 ability to understand people is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 a kind of inner feeling as in which 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.890
 and you revive us academic knowledge and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.619
 experience but without this inner feeling 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.579
 all three academic knowledge experience is nothing 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.820
 they will not give it that is why many practitioners 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.100
 from high schools with even 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.729
 degrees can sometimes be absolutely 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.180
 ineffective in the concept to understand 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.240
 people 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.530
 because they don't have this 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.920
 inner feeling thin 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.530
 intuition such 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.800
 who help them apply their 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.370
 knowledge about exercise or methods 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.830
 who are you asking is this 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.930
 interesting story which i would like 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.130
 share with you and with all viewers 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:28.140
 channel and guys if you want to check 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:32.140
 man about what it contains 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.340
 propensity internal degree of filling 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.269
 shit addiction to some act 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.160
 or something else before you join 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.590
 there is some deep long relationship 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:52.209
 or something else is very simple 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:56.790
 piss off this person here if you 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:00.269
 get him angry this first and 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.750
 the second is how he will behave in this 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:07.049
 these two points will be very clear 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.540
 characterize this person not mask 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.709
 social narva flowers and give a bouquet 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.470
 yes it is not so here if you succeed it 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.130
 piss off how fast he loses his temper 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.829
 this is the first that he could go to anger 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.200
 same look and second and most important 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:32.440
 how does he behave what does he say he is 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.790
 doing while being angry this is very 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.500
 characterizes what a person is filled with 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.769
 so here in Russia they say that here in 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.450
 Hearts flared and spoke here that 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.480
 you burned in the hearts 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.380
 and they say it and that's what you are 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.220
 are filled 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.579
 and if you are a more accurate person 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.700
 quickly get mad and get out of it 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:01.630
 shit poured oh yeah you this you such yes 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.880
 this is all that unfortunately we can 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.569
 state the fact that something than that 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.670
 said the man is this in it and contains 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.230
 is it that he is in the ordinary everyday life of everything 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.890
 only just cute fluffy of course this 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.650
 mask 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.880
 so before doing any 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.850
 serious conclusions 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.520
 this this this exercise this technique 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.630
 can take over for themselves 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.950
 company director you can 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.240
 provoke on probation 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.730
 Iâ€™m not afraid of my colleagues if 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.060
 you need to test 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:45.919
 beginner put it in the condition where he is 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.140
 will be pissed off look like he is to this 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.600
 will relate well for example set 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.510
 war some complicated schedule or 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.750
 asked to go out or something at work 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.760
 somehow its in an uncomfortable position 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.630
 set look like this man 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.600
 will behave if he starts yelling 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.090
 scream and scream express claim this 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.020
 one story if it is just stupid 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.590
 be silent and humbly do everything the other 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.680
 history professional 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.919
 express rationally their attitude to 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.620
 This will say I agree it is not and 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.220
 offer a solution if a person 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.570
 silent 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.640
 stupidly such a test then it says 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.810
 his lack of professionalism so that only you 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.419
 to please he is silent 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.360
 if he screams and hysteria, then of course it 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.600
 hysterical which is also not good for you 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.930
 will bring the same test 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.150
 such conditional personal relationships or there 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.930
 in what you all know perfectly well 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.900
 what's worth pissing a friend or is there still 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.930
 someone and you immediately know the truth here 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.470
