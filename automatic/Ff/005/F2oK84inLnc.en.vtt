00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
so um and they're pretty bad so probably

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.950 
so um and they're pretty bad so probably
like<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.199> take<00:00:56.039> 20<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.030> 20<00:00:57.390> over<00:00:57.570> 20<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
