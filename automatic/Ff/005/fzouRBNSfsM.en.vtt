it's<00:00:18.349> been<00:00:18.529> determined<00:00:18.650> that<00:00:19.130> we<00:00:19.310> have<00:00:19.429> vole

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
it's been determined that we have vole

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.669 
it's been determined that we have vole
activity<00:00:20.359> in<00:00:20.539> our<00:00:20.720> backyard<00:00:21.230> farm<00:00:21.500> or<00:00:21.650> garden

activity in our backyard farm or garden
and<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:22.730> we're<00:00:22.880> going<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.090> sigh<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.359> control

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
and so we're going to sigh to control

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.720 
and so we're going to sigh to control
these<00:00:24.199> voles<00:00:24.470> before<00:00:24.980> they<00:00:25.099> start<00:00:25.340> eating<00:00:25.430> too

voles<00:01:00.019> will<00:01:00.229> just<00:01:00.379> go<00:01:00.500> right<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.979> but<00:01:01.519> we

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
voles will just go right in but we

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.039 
voles will just go right in but we

well first we're going to do we're going
to<00:01:20.780> locate<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.439> runs<00:01:21.770> or<00:01:22.130> where<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.550> voles

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
to locate the runs or where the voles

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.360 
to locate the runs or where the voles
are<00:01:23.000> active<00:01:23.480> in<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:24.140> garden<00:01:24.590> if<00:01:24.770> we<00:01:25.159> look

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
are active in this garden if we look

are active in this garden if we look
here<00:01:25.670> we<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.030> see<00:01:26.210> there's<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.480> run<00:01:26.750> going<00:01:26.990> in

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
here we can see there's a run going in

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.680 
here we can see there's a run going in
the<00:01:27.320> grass<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:28.490> have<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.850> part<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.270> turf<00:01:29.480> to

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
the grass we have to part the turf to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.170 
the grass we have to part the turf to
find<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.980> run<00:01:31.159> has<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.430> hole<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.730> it<00:01:32.030> as

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
find it and that run has a hole in it as

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.270 
find it and that run has a hole in it as
it<00:01:32.360> enters<00:01:32.720> our<00:01:32.900> garden<00:01:33.380> then<00:01:33.830> we<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.070> follow

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
it enters our garden then we can follow

it enters our garden then we can follow
that<00:01:34.520> run<00:01:34.760> up<00:01:35.060> into<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:35.990> garden<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.620> into<00:01:37.190> our

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
that run up into the garden and into our

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.640 
that run up into the garden and into our
plant<00:01:37.760> material<00:01:38.330> now<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.080> area<00:01:39.350> there's

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
plant material now in this area there's

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.380 
plant material now in this area there's
a<00:01:39.710> lot<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.979> seed<00:01:40.190> heads<00:01:40.460> for<00:01:40.760> them<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.090> eat<00:01:41.180> in

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
a lot of seed heads for them to eat in

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.500 
a lot of seed heads for them to eat in
voles<00:01:42.110> love<00:01:42.620> grain<00:01:43.280> they're<00:01:43.790> granted<00:01:44.300> war

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
voles love grain they're granted war

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.330 
voles love grain they're granted war
when<00:01:45.050> there's<00:01:45.170> not<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.350> lot<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.620> grain<00:01:45.860> they<00:01:46.190> go

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
when there's not a lot of grain they go

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.280 
when there's not a lot of grain they go
for<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.580> tubers<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:47.240> there's<00:01:47.870> probably<00:01:48.110> some

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
for the tubers so there's probably some

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.230 
for the tubers so there's probably some
plants<00:01:48.680> over<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:49.070> way<00:01:49.280> or<00:01:49.760> right<00:01:49.909> up<00:01:50.030> there

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
plants over that way or right up there

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.660 
plants over that way or right up there
we<00:01:50.360> have<00:01:50.510> some<00:01:50.690> iris<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.740> have<00:01:51.979> tubers<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
we have some iris that have tubers and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.420 
we have some iris that have tubers and
so<00:01:53.150> all<00:01:53.330> those<00:01:53.600> are<00:01:53.630> food<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.590> our<00:01:54.770> vole<00:01:55.100> that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
so all those are food for our vole that

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.920 
so all those are food for our vole that
we<00:01:55.520> want<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.760> get<00:01:55.880> rid<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.030> what<00:01:56.690> we're<00:01:56.810> going

bit<00:01:58.850> inconspicuous<00:01:59.299> and<00:02:00.290> we're<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:00.619> to

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
bit inconspicuous and we're going to

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.020 
bit inconspicuous and we're going to
Nestle<00:02:01.130> our<00:02:01.840> trap<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.250> area<00:02:04.250> close<00:02:05.000> to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.630 
Nestle our trap in that area close to
the<00:02:05.360> run<00:02:05.570> but<00:02:06.110> before<00:02:06.440> we<00:02:06.530> Nestle<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.010> we<00:02:07.430> have

the run but before we Nestle it we have

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.789 
the run but before we Nestle it we have
to<00:02:07.820> wind<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.899> wind<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.289> four<00:02:09.649> to

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
to wind it we have to wind it four to

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.360 
to wind it we have to wind it four to
six<00:02:10.069> times<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:11.420> activate<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.170> not<00:02:12.769> too<00:02:13.099> tight

traps get hot and something could happen

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.390 
traps get hot and something could happen
to<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.180> vole<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:42.260> always<00:02:42.440> set<00:02:42.830> late<00:02:43.130> and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
to the vole so we always set late and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.870 
to the vole so we always set late and
then<00:02:43.880> we're<00:02:44.060> going<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.860> check<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.070> very<00:02:46.460> early

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
then we're going to check it very early

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.050 
then we're going to check it very early
in<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.480> a.m.<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.410> make<00:02:48.590> sure<00:02:48.860> when<00:02:49.640> we<00:02:49.670> check

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
in the a.m. to make sure when we check

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.260 
in the a.m. to make sure when we check
it<00:02:50.240> we<00:02:50.450> bring<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.840> up<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:52.790> can<00:02:52.940> look<00:02:53.090> right

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
it we bring it up we can look right

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.700 
it we bring it up we can look right
through<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.600> holes<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.050> see<00:02:54.230> if<00:02:54.320> something's

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
through the holes to see if something's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.490 
through the holes to see if something's
in<00:02:54.830> there<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.210> can<00:02:56.240> open<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.720> like<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:56.960> to

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
in there and we can open it like that to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.800 
in there and we can open it like that to
find<00:02:57.680> out<00:02:57.890> if<00:02:58.100> we<00:02:58.220> caught<00:02:58.460> any<00:02:58.700> voles<00:02:59.060> many

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
find out if we caught any voles many

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.480 
find out if we caught any voles many
times<00:03:00.170> there'd<00:03:00.530> be<00:03:00.590> more<00:03:00.800> than<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.160> in<00:03:01.190> there

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
times there'd be more than one in there

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.440 
times there'd be more than one in there
so<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.940> catch<00:03:02.120> it
