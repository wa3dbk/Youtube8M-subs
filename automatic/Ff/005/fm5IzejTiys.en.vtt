fireplace they also have a convex one
which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.050> very<00:00:34.380> similar<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.800> size<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> this

which is very similar in size to this
but<00:00:35.579> more<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> curved<00:00:36.300> front<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.989> then<00:00:37.890> they

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
but more of a curved front and then they

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.650 
but more of a curved front and then they
also<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> corner<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> kind<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
also do a corner you kind of like a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
also do a corner you kind of like a
triangle<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> corner<00:00:40.820> so

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
triangle and go right in the corner so

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.400 
triangle and go right in the corner so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
those because they're all going to have

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
those because they're all going to have
the<00:00:44.460> same<00:00:44.670> burn<00:00:44.910> characteristics<00:00:45.690> same<00:00:46.260> color

finishes and everything like that one

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.979

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
thing that we really like about the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
thing that we really like about the
ethanol<00:00:52.320> burning<00:00:52.710> fireplace<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> whole

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
ethanol burning fireplace is as a whole

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
ethanol burning fireplace is as a whole
and<00:00:54.539> especially<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.350> Napoleon<00:00:55.829> ones<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and especially the Napoleon ones is is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
and especially the Napoleon ones is is
how<00:00:57.000> could<00:00:57.210> he<00:00:57.420> mean<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.710> don't

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
how could he mean they are they don't

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.160 
how could he mean they are they don't
need<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.190> vented<00:00:59.550> their<00:00:59.699> burn<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.170> 99%

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
need to be vented their burn over 99%

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
need to be vented their burn over 99%
clean<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.390> be

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
clean and then they can really be

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.030 
clean and then they can really be
mounted<00:01:03.870> anywhere<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> wall<00:01:04.799> mount

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
mounted anywhere there's a wall mount

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.789 
mounted anywhere there's a wall mount
application<00:01:05.960> they're<00:01:06.960> very<00:01:07.170> similar<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
application they're very similar to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.010 
application they're very similar to
electric<00:01:08.280> fireplaces<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> big

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
electric fireplaces and one of the big

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.440 
electric fireplaces and one of the big
advantages<00:01:10.170> over<00:01:10.799> doing<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.250> ethanol<00:01:11.580> over<00:01:11.909> an

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
advantages over doing an ethanol over an

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.969 
advantages over doing an ethanol over an
electric<00:01:12.869> fireplace<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.500> number<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
electric fireplace is number one you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.230 
electric fireplace is number one you
don't<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> plug<00:01:14.400> anything<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
don't have to plug anything in and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
don't have to plug anything in and
number<00:01:15.930> two<00:01:16.110> you're<00:01:16.320> dealing<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> real

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
number two you're dealing with a real

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.520 
number two you're dealing with a real
fire<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.720> dramatic<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
fire so you can see dramatic for the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.100 
fire so you can see dramatic for the
aesthetic<00:01:20.159> look<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.060> really<00:01:21.360> no<00:01:21.900> comparison

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
aesthetic look it's really no comparison

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
aesthetic look it's really no comparison
between<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.189> electric<00:01:23.580> fireplace

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
between this and electric fireplace

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
between this and electric fireplace
there<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.049> some<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.470> nice<00:01:25.680> electric

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
there are some very nice electric

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.460 
there are some very nice electric
fireplaces<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:28.200> they're<00:01:28.350> all

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
fireplaces out there but they're all

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.870 
fireplaces out there but they're all
backlit<00:01:30.110> flames<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.280> hard<00:01:32.579> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
backlit flames so it's really hard to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.420 
backlit flames so it's really hard to
emulate<00:01:33.360> real<00:01:33.659> fire<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> why

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
emulate real fire and so this is why

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.969 
emulate real fire and so this is why
this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.390> such<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> cool<00:01:37.079> new<00:01:37.350> product<00:01:37.829> just

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this is such a cool new product just

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
this is such a cool new product just
because<00:01:38.130> you're<00:01:38.250> getting<00:01:38.369> real<00:01:38.729> fire<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
because you're getting real fire but the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.469 
because you're getting real fire but the
easy<00:01:40.079> convenience<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:41.060> an<00:01:42.060> electric

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
easy convenience of an electric

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300
