00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.650
 but it will be four years that I stopped 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.520
 straightening and three and a half years that am 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.520
 totally natural 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.030
 before the parade but they break 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.050
 I read them I did them finally 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.060
 a lot of things that made them 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.380
 were very fragile and breaking 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.940
 and little by little and your engine has 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.300
 really had tuesday to have hair 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.590
 brittle 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.860
 so I 'm told but what is 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.510
 it would start his hair if he 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.090
 was natural knowing that my mother 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.230
 had always told me and shirt were 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.309
 really hard to comb when you 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.660
 was small they are very thick not 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.220
 really motivated I 'm still going 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.110
 watched on the internet 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.720
 I came across everything on chains 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.010
 youtube from america and and that shows is 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.210
 in fact the same lace between treasure 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.270
 that game maintained their hair 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.420
 natural curly hair curly or 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.760
 see some kinky and it was always 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.869
 very very very young and it was not so 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.520
 complicated to maintain them 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.080
 and there I take a step I must 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.040
 throw me I have to do it 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.040
 way I have nothing to lose 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.770
 as I had very brittle hair 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.050
 and use the straightener that 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.640
 damage the hair with heat I 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.120
 actually decided no the transition anymore 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.470
 at all used heat and it has me 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.610
 a lot helped and I think to limit the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.500
 break my hair during the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.320
 transition were hair curlers 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.360
 little tips ten years later actually m 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.160
 to wash hair 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.240
 I used pure shea butter 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.630
 it was not necessarily what was 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.460
 better 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.530
 but at the time I did not know all 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 the products the idea of ​​small curlers 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.160
 it was very good so I was disguised 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.640
 in fact the next day already laid some pretty 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.260
 town I think now if I 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.330
 actually went back where we were 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.010
 the transition I think I will use 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.150
 I will make a field for argentré a 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.490
 mask once a week and then 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.450
 I will use the capillaries or a cream 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.760
 surely capillary an oil or amber 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.709
 Thune oil quite fine and then 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.480
 so I will do I think distress and 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.920
 since you the next day I will do them 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.450
 mistresses and some i will get 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.610
 members help in trying to make 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.840
 twists the suitcases when I already have my 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.530
 horses the ten-year - old friezes and in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.950
 transition 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.330
 it did not hold at all and rsa want it 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.920
 just put a little maggot end 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.920
 and that's fine 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.770
 I did a little bit 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.540
 up on a whim I was with my 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.910
 buddy of the time who helped me at all 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.379
 cut on the spot I had really 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.690
 want to talk about knowing that I had 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.920
 already cut the small places and for 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.739
 see a little my texan of may river 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.400
 I was in a hurry cut but once 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.230
 cut it was really very short then 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.290
 already that these courses a little month it makes 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.910
 centimeters away except that actually 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.190
 when we cut him there is a lot of 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.349
 shri ncatch of a shortening did 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.450
 in the end three centimeters on the head 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.580
 and I admit I had never but I 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.730
 can also blow and dedicate himself honestly 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.650
 yeah that was hard and so at night I 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.360
 know after the cut to the clothes finally 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.130
 I cried you do not feel good at all 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.280
 do and there but how do I do my hair 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.420
 and it was pretty awful but 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.870
 obviously little by little I got 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.970
 used to 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.970
 and then I found really 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.220
 I was doing watching you with duel 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.290
 for firms and curly smaller to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.700
 small every week saw some shoot 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.520
 to play like a lot more tiredness you 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.510
 have very short hair well there I 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.660
 did nothing special 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.300
 sleep on it with a scarf 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.740
 in the morning I hold them a little I 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.200
 put back the jet to make my machine 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.470
 go and so that's evening I rinse hebdo 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.380
 throws to rehydrate my hair and 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.120
 then avoid that the accumulate by 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.260
 against Scottish taylor that I 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.700
 did not use at the time but I believe 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.380
 that this young one can really keep 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.390
 in cabbages several days it does not 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.430
 poses no problem it does not know 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.100
 too much hair my body when I got 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.980
 I my hair super short hair 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.260
 it shocked a lot because nobody 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.580
 did not see and I see like that at the same 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.780
 if I personally do not appreciate it 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.109
 too much I think I do not necessarily have a 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.840
 face enough to eat so and I want 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.220
 race not really for me well we 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.680
 said it works pretty well so that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.200
 go I started doing late sorting 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.750
 that I think at the end of your six months 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.560
 after we bishop so that must do so 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.870
 after one year post straightening the jav 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.000
 is enough long hours for 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.220
 so you can see them into daevas 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.440
 not too small and who hold 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.520
 so be long enough but I 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.380
 think maybe we can start 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.120
 earlier it will depend on the length of 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.560
 your time fires wanted to dedicate to 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.850
 your vanilla because more valves 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.660
 izon little more you will put 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.520
 time to realize them 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.140
 I only once distressed 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.050
 added since he returned to 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.330
 natural there so he was the first 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.919
 year in fact of my natural return for 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.000
 the holidays I had done that he actually 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.940
 since I have perfect since my hair 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.430
 of course my condition I get pretty 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.650
 easily take care I have not too much 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.310
 difficulties and more I finally love 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.310

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.280
 no i would have the paw of too big shaq 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.830
 I love my hair as they are I 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.330
 can do a lot of things with them 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.310
 I like the shock texture and in fact 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.780
 I always loved have hair 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.550
 curly about others and I mean 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.860
 good I can never have that and at 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.810
 final and well I have them a little bit and 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.550

 choices prized with kinky so I 'm 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.800
 not at all at all 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.960
 all at all I was doing 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.760

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.760
 in length with my natural hair
