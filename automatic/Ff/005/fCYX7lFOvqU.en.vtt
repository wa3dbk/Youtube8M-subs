00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.150
 Well yes I felt how the team got together one after another 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.780
 I think that there was confidence or something like that by winning 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:42.130
 Woman does not stand 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:45.820
 Well really came is a lot of people to really airport when we have written to the airport 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.620
 I don't really feel that I'm in the world, but that's amazing 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.770
 It was something happy 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.100
 Think of words 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.090
 No, it really is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.190
 Nde I think as Tteyuu probably keeper from before they enter came much like that of the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.530
 In particular 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.839
 It is not something to say the presence of a true two people but is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.340
 It's was great in Chichibu now you doing with or different members now but it is one person in it 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.030
 It doesn't mean it's not 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.750
 Even if you are one of the pitchers and you stand on the pitch 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.210
 Of various people 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.210
 That sort of it has got thinking but is not it heavy whether 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.210
 That's him, but they are not their own football 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.740
 Rashiku their 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.240
 If we win that kind of thing is one one of the game without thinking as a challenger to the former 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.020
 Nde I think that comes with me the results 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.020
 In addition, I am only conscious that there is a need for everyone to improve from daily practice 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.409
 I agree 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.509
 I do not know but everyone is doing what I do 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:59.259
 Isn't it just laughing alone? The smile of the e 3 is all that day by day 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.350
 Out because There has been doing is to say so to each other increase is each other 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.700
 By I think a smile 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.159
 That's why 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.159
 I think everyone is good smile is not what I think 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.900
 There are a lot of people coming to this girl slope really like this 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.319
 It's not already before we started when it comes to 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.379
 I think It 's not something out immediately Te result Yappa or was a kind of various stacking 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.280
 It is Fuku-chan who was the keeper himself 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:32.019
 Nanko's was or Onodera and his friends say so I am not very well known only or was it 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.960
 I think I really have myself now because I am, and that's not transient 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.250
 Though 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:41.000
 A little bit of football does not end at our own 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.010
 It is possible that you can put out some peppers from here to ensure that you get rooted 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.080
 To 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.080
 I thought that I want to protect the patient's world that is last to enter 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.900
 Also the Tteyuu the time being I'd seen but say want Well now well 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.900
 Smoked doing 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 I can only really get along well, and when it comes to things, things get better 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.540
 I think to also want to grow in absolute every day a little 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.110
 Not only as a writer but also as a person 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.920
 Is wondering because wonder if I do not participate to grow 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.920
 Spend every day 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.880
 Yes you really are a keeper 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.240
 Really it 's such is supported standing in everyone or that really can not do anything' s one person 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.569
 I become my keeper 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.280
 I think great 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.910
 Well, yes, if I got Ura's life, then if there is always a keeper behind me 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.440
 It was 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.520
 Now I can not keep my goal if I really want to keep that goal alone 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.730
 defense 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.860
 The course is limited more and more because it defends from the forward 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.970
 Finally everybody say so Toka want to take their own because they are stretched the body to wow the most best 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.090
 I'm such 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.129
 I mean everyone is doing it 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.129
 It was more feeling 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.879
 I want you to enjoy playing football at the same time I think I will stand 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.480
 Oh thanks for everything 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:09.060
 If you enjoy it, there are so many 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.060
 I think that I should be connected first
