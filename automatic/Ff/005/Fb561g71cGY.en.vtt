00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.250
What's going on?

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.610
Why am I wearing a high school uniform?

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.970
It's not even the uniform I actually did wear in high school.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.980
Is this the setup for this episode?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.440
I got a bad feeling about this...

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.480
If this is my role...

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.990
...then what parts do the others play?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.180
Hey, how are ya!

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.400
Did ya get breakfast yet?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.210
Good morning, Okajima-san.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.960
You look well as always.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.120
Yes, there is a god!

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.800
Looks like at least she's turned out nor-

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.240
Isn't this weather wonderful?

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.630
Aw'right... attendance time.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.320
Park your butts before I count to three.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.090
What're you looking at, Okajima?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.110
N-nothing...

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620
C'mon... You wanna die?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.400
I'm just glad it's - however strangely - appropriate.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.070
But what about Dutch? What part is he going to get?

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.050
HEEEY!

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.480
Which one of ya miserable runts wrecked my precious flowerbed!

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.770
Groundskeeper?!

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.560
Meanwhile, Benny-san...

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.480
...skipped school and spent the entire day glued to his PC, trolling internet forums.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.710
You suck! You all suck!

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.120
All of you! Go suck a tail pipe!

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.080
And that's all!
