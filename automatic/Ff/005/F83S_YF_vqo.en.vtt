but remember if you're lifting heavy and
you're<00:01:56.970> wanting<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.420> into<00:01:57.660> some<00:01:57.840> serious

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
you're wanting to get into some serious

you're wanting to get into some serious
Ollie<00:01:58.710> lifting<00:01:59.280> then<00:01:59.730> it<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.330> reduce<00:02:00.810> the

this tile now bearing that in mind one
of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> best<00:02:08.099> ways<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.819> utilize<00:02:09.270> these<00:02:09.780> tiles

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
of the best ways to utilize these tiles

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.949 
of the best ways to utilize these tiles
is<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:11.039> set<00:02:11.220> yourself<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.970> mini<00:02:12.390> platform

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
is to set yourself up a mini platform

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.069 
is to set yourself up a mini platform
because<00:02:13.650> remember<00:02:14.010> these<00:02:14.670> tiles<00:02:15.000> sit<00:02:15.450> 50<00:02:15.870> mils

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
because remember these tiles sit 50 mils

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.619 
because remember these tiles sit 50 mils
above<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> ground<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.969> set<00:02:18.329> them<00:02:18.480> up

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
above the ground if you do set them up

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.390 
above the ground if you do set them up
and<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.870> stand<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
and you stand in the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.369 
and you stand in the
all<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.640> them<00:02:19.819> they're<00:02:20.299> 50<00:02:20.629> mils<00:02:20.840> higher<00:02:21.079> and

all of them they're 50 mils higher and

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.199 
all of them they're 50 mils higher and
they're<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.799> reduce<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.790> range<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
they're going to reduce the range of

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.149 
they're going to reduce the range of
motion<00:02:23.599> that<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.379> one<00:02:24.799> of<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:24.980> best

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
motion that you have so one of the best

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.789 
motion that you have so one of the best
ways<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.400> do<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.939> is<00:02:26.480> build<00:02:27.170> up<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.439> layer<00:02:27.590> of

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
ways to do this is build up a layer of

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.899 
ways to do this is build up a layer of
plywood<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.909> 50<00:02:29.269> mm<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.599> then<00:02:29.930> stick<00:02:30.319> the

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
plywood to 50 mm and then stick the

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.429 
plywood to 50 mm and then stick the
tiles<00:02:31.909> on<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.180> outside<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.750> way<00:02:33.140> you've

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
tiles on the outside that way you've

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.170 
tiles on the outside that way you've
created<00:02:33.739> yourself<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.459> very<00:02:34.640> cheap<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
created yourself a very cheap and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.080 
created yourself a very cheap and
effective<00:02:35.390> platform<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.650> lifting<00:02:37.099> on<00:02:37.280> also

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
effective platform for lifting on also

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.149 
effective platform for lifting on also
to<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.480> bear<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:38.900> mind<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.530> might<00:02:39.769> want<00:02:39.980> to

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
to just bear in mind you might want to

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.330 
to just bear in mind you might want to
put<00:02:40.400> an<00:02:40.640> outer<00:02:41.000> rim<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.109> border<00:02:42.650> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
put an outer rim just the border the

put an outer rim just the border the
other<00:02:43.579> tiles<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.359> stop<00:02:44.569> them<00:02:44.780> from

other tiles just to stop them from

other tiles just to stop them from
moving<00:02:45.200> around

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
moving around

moving around
needless<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.519> say<00:02:46.579> they've<00:02:47.090> also<00:02:47.239> got<00:02:47.629> a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
needless to say they've also got a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.860 
needless to say they've also got a

relatively low bounce quality to them so

you<00:02:55.190> an<00:02:55.310> idea<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:56.180> kind<00:02:56.389> of<00:02:56.480> bounce<00:02:56.720> that

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
you an idea of the kind of bounce that

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:05.979 
you an idea of the kind of bounce that
you<00:02:57.079> get<00:02:57.290> out<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.470> these<00:02:57.680> tiles<00:03:04.720> then<00:03:05.720> from

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
you get out of these tiles then from

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.660 
you get out of these tiles then from
here<00:03:06.230> when<00:03:07.129> I<00:03:07.159> drop<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.609> bar<00:03:09.310> you'll<00:03:10.310> notice

here when I drop the bar you'll notice
it<00:03:10.819> doesn't<00:03:10.849> really<00:03:11.420> kick<00:03:11.780> up<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:11.989> much

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
it doesn't really kick up that much

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.910 
it doesn't really kick up that much
there's<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.159> bit<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.370> Bounce<00:03:13.639> there<00:03:13.970> but

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
there's a bit of Bounce there but

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.110 
there's a bit of Bounce there but
relatively<00:03:15.920> speaking<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.549> really<00:03:16.819> doesn't

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
relatively speaking it really doesn't

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.610 
relatively speaking it really doesn't
kick<00:03:17.299> back<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.720> much<00:03:17.930> which<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.230> pretty

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
kick back that much which is pretty

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.679 
kick back that much which is pretty
pretty<00:03:19.220> amazing<00:03:19.400> considering<00:03:20.209> how<00:03:20.510> much
