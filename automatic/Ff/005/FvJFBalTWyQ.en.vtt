 hello hello welcome one more day to me 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.879
 channel and today I'm going to ask for some 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:08.680
 blame because this video is supposed to 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.880
 of the home has gone up on Friday but 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.060
 I on Friday when I had to record 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.740
 is inside I got visits and I had to 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:21.880
 abandon the mission and nothing because I was 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.380
 recording today's video this 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.199
 two cards that is very useful and a 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.509
 recipe of this salad that I used 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.069
 in this week and I loved it and 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.750
 I am also going to you 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:37.260
 love and nothing my loves let's move on 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.570
 right away with the recipe 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.690
 the first recipe consists of a banana 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.159
 two plums half green apple and one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.159
 one or two stalks of celery 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.940
 the preparation is simple is very easy in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.880
 actually we put everything in the blender 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.070
 fairly chopped and this amount is 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.600
 for a glass exactly the amount that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 I'm giving you always going to be for 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 a shot for a glass ok to this amount 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.130
 more or less we are going to put a little 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 of water more or less half a cup for 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.140
 mix and better put little and then 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.580
 add that put too much at the beginning 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.550
 we beat and more or less can see that the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 amount is relatively small and is 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.850
 ready to serve this is the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.030
 consistency that should have frothy 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.190
 and quite well as the taste is soft 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.800
 is very rich I assure you that I do not know 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.090
 feels the taste of celery at all 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.250
 I am one of the person who does not like them 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.020
 not so raw and does not feel for 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.560
 nothing the plum and the apple cover it 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.540
 completely 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.180
 also tell you then that this recipe 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.740
 or rather another recipe that I did not record 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.630
 I also uploaded it to instagram so 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.610
 also follow me there where you can 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 just put three appointments that I do not upload 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:51.220
 in the channel well the cgt recipe consists of 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.810
 half lettuce one apple two kiwis and one 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 apple the lettuce can substitute for 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.490
 basil or 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.189
 scale for example you can also 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.020
 replace no problem with that what 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.719
 they can also put 12 depending 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.280
 Well, the point of each person for me 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.470
 like it more because it covers more the flavor 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.480
 well we put everything to the blender and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.890
 because of the volume of the lettuce 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.450
 see a little more amount but in the end 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.819
 it's going to be the same, I've put it 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.519
 pinch of cinnamon as they come and a spoonful 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.160
 of stevia to sweeten a little in 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.170
 those who wish it can only be 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.849
 use this to sweeten we use 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.319
 the same a trickle of water only 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.599
 in this case we have to be careful 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.430
 because lettuce is very much has the 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.099
 liquid if you put too much is going to 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.319
 get out very well watery this is all 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.829
 then we will be again and this is 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.840
 the consistency if they use for example 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.980
 basil or kale or whatever it is going to be 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.560
 much greener 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 a more intense green color as you use 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.920
 lettuce then a green color a little bit 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.020
 softer 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.940
 I killed it more or less as it is 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.010
 drink again does not feel at all 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.590
 the flavor neither of the lettuce nor of pencil 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.030
 for nothing I assure you do not think 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.459
 what we have done with the installed the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.890
 installed recipe is extremely easy and 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.110
 simple to make is a medium lettuce 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.680
 sweet pepper the color that you 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.300
 choose a little bit of tomato and also 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.050
 I've put a little bit of corn that I do not know 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.550
 go directly and to decorate and to 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.200
 how to make a mixture of flavors I've 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.660
 put a little bit of strawberries this is a 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.120
 single strawberry chopped finely delicious 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.709
 dressing is a tablespoon of oil 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.780
 tablespoon olive vinegar 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.549
 apple a little salt a little bit of 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.319
 pepper and a little garlic more to taste 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.019
 It gives a delicious taste we are going to move 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.240
 everyone and very rich nobody I hope 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.980

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.170
 and well as you saw my love these are 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.540
 the recipes that my adored of this 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.790
 week a tip to finish with the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.470
 video is that for example that of the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.300
 question of the adjudicated and it has 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.760
 asked a lot on instagram when he has 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.220
 uploaded the photos is that I take these is 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.550
 moody's eating snack or between 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.410
 meals or a small matter or else of 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.820
 the substitute of any of the meals 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.110
 when I do substitutes for some 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.550
 of the meals as I told you in the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.160
 previous video of the de muÃ±iz video 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.330
 or he added then something that is worth to them in 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.550
 the world for example if you do not have 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.160
 carbohydrates and those things so I make a 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.780
 quick easy thing with carbohydrates 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.370
 and proteins like for example could be 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.860
 a sandwich with wholemeal bread and a 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.870
 little bit of turkey ham for example and 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.180
 I drink is moody's a full meal 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.580
 that there is no lack of anything at all 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.050
 nothing and if it has not been eaten or in the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.330
 part for example breakfast has been 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.830
 I came back from the gym 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.600
 I want to take power then something to 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.080
 raise my vitamin level 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.379
 then I take the multi of these 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.340
 nothing else that you liked the video and 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.340
 until next time 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.460

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.299
 by all
