 a rose in front of me very interesting because we can afford very visual 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.099
 I start by peeling but for om I note all departures 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.099
 inside the white parts 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 I did not hold good dice and I know by the three colors 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.270
 I'm peeling the new 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.240
 I cut it 2 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 and I launch them as finely as possible 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 I'm peeling the m 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.850
 I dream the germ 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.560
 I wonderfully masses 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 in three different sites I do not pay if the cities of Lille 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.020
 I know by my friend we went in three I will assume for 2 to 3 minutes 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.600
 I add in each of his clients 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 peppers 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.980
 cya 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 his son season 9 of salt 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.690
 on one side we do not get tired 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.800
 cgs cook on soft fire the usa 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.340
 I'm going to the gelatin sheets to soften 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 in very cold water 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 I see my cream to make the whipped cream 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.460
 I have it maybe it's not really separately I'm starting 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.460
 by the young man then the glass and finally the red 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.300
 I add in each case mashed hot peppers a sheet of gelatin 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 drain 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.579
 I know by my whipped cream in three years one for each color 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.829
 I start by taking a portion 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.269
 whipped cream 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.400
 that I'm going to be slaughtered remain 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.930
 when we mix ready-to-wear waited between i can say that we 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.470
 could go two last thirds 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.799
 gently with a spatula I persist the first foam 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.079
 in a glass 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.489
 I keep in the fridge 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.639
 while my first big take I realize the second 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.509
 one third of cream 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.499
 I let it go back to room temperature and I'm waiting for both 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.959
 last thirds I pour the second goal on the first 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.700
 after the last layer but this hike laps at least an hour 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.169
 fridge 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.599
 navarro oise and now very cool 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.599
 I finish with a little more senior seine 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.179
 a little espelette pepper 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:07.679
 and some fresh herbs 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.499
 on the same principle much used other vegetables add spices 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.379
 at the beginning these elements agree that the little dice just jumped or so 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.379
 pine nuts 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:19.819
