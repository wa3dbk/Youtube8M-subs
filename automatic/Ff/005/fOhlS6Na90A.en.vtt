00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.920
 Hi guys, beauty here who talks at night 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.870
 and at the end of today we will play with a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.990
 little anger ancic on the server 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.400
 there mania I also want to enjoy and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.430
 explain to you 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.170
 why the lack of videos is not given 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.600
 The lack of live is because I 'm not 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 frequently posting videos and also 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.340
 I'm not doing lines 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.410
 Okay, so I'm going to go in here in a room 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.590
 romance that he is already all closed 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.920
 so I'll wait to open a new one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.149
 Come in and I'll be right back. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.379
 Ok guys, it's starting, it's going to start now. 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.570
 lightning strikes beauty then the already 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.530
 I want to start here by explaining to you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.719
 there is a lack of videos 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.219
 still going to start beauty 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.620
 So, my sister lately 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.100
 fell ill and wilson turned out tony that delight 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.880
 my sister and her and my flight too 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.200
 got sick the case of my sister was not 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.150
 that serious 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 but she has to continue taking 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.970
 remedy right? 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.500
 now my personal grandfather was very tense 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 and I thought he was going to die 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.420
 honestly it was very very tense but 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.810
 Thank God he has already improved. 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.509
 Okay, he's already much better today. 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.310
 February 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.159
 Let's solidify here today, 24th of 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.430
 February and is practically 100% more 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.360
 in these last days he was tense tense 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.369
 keyed up 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 I was hoping for the worst but thanks to 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.310
 God has not improved 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 So these last days is what 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.009
 rushing to the personal hospital is 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.259
 hospital to here hospital to here and I 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.719
 could not try to record a video that 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.420
 because type is the phone practically 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.659
 played all the time understood so for me 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.790
 stop at recording it too 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.459
 told the sheet the head was not with 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.099
 recording head and also up to my 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.239
 birthday but it is not was 22 now 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.069
 February 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.859
 I stayed at home 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.980
 Um, I did not care about that, people. 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:22.530
 birthday, people, every year, we 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.109
 It does but we could celebrate. 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.019
 This party's gonna make this party another day, huh? 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:30.719
 the health 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.120
 anyone is related my ne 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.519
 anyone of my age 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.420
 family is more important to their health 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.400
 first so now party like 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.919
 already passed and is already much better people 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.540
 Can you do anything any day? 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:51.120
 but that is the reason why I was not 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.430
 posting videos and was not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.739
 doing them there personally and now 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.989
 Carnival also coming carnival're right 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.129
 arriving there will stay a little while 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.180
 this proposal because I 'm going to have to 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.379
 travel 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.859
 Okay, then until the beginning of the month after 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.650
 Carnival there until the end of the carnival goes 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.230
 staying like this will not have many videos 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.169
 Frequent there will also not have lives 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.989
 but after then finish the carnival 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:22.290
 People come back with everything, God willing. 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.659
 the Brazilian people speak is that here the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.239
 Brazil same year only begins after the 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.900
 carnival 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:35.359
 So, we still have 20 raiders. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.049
 human and is not even very old 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:42.769
 which I think was the first time Tony 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.359
 It was kind of easy, right? 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:51.239
 could try another place the law to 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:52.579
 hide in a boat here does not taste 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.120
 doing here 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:00.689
 only that is a player or not to fall I think 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.739
 I already had it already looks that I could 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.519
 try to get on a crazy parco he does not 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.439
 gives 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:13.560
 I do not think so, but at least we have more 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:19.739
 Two minutes to stay here. 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.699
 As tomac raiders do not think we are 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.000
 good 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.810
 Let's wait, the guys will find the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.570
 people 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.650
 OK 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.350
 and that's it and if you guys like it 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.050
 this video, oh ohio said he's tense in the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.220
 man why do we stand too still? 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.960
 Time, right? 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.730
 depending on whether you are higher if 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.220
 possible you have to go out hunting the same 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.440
 crazy why I like each other more 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.870
 nobody says there's more action like 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.660
 Good to explain and the splash 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.030
 so if you like this video if 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.630
 want to help me leave that the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.520
 rocket and that did not like you can get the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.100
 dislike if not goals what can i do 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.470
 huh 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.440
 but that's it folks let's wait here 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.790
 Intoned to see if we were going to be framed. 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.610
 I hope not 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.460
 and I have many videos to record 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.390
 I personally started my channel right with the 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.740
 aim to show old games 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.110
 Of course I can do 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.570
 the gameplay of new games that I 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.000
 I've already done it here on the channel. 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:29.260
 I have a lot of old gameplay games. 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.660
 I want to do what's three other things 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:37.900
 Also, what I bought is a little bit 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.720
 time the manchester 3 and to speak to 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.730
 truth to you I did not play much myself 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.100
 I played those days now because even as I 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.850
 I was recording was not very active 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.400
 I have an offline play here and I 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.160
 I want to do here also a game I 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.410
 I think it's very good too 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.220
 playstation 3 already has batman arkham 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.140
 city and that I won in a draw there is 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.780
 it's a digital game 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.030
 ducked and was not physical media right that 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:12.550
 people buy in a store and maybe on a cd and 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:15.070
 dvd and I won the digital media draw 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.700
 enem and bass and it works like beauty 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.740
 It's another game that I played too. 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.460
 very little time but I found it very 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.550
 fuck what I wanted to do is follow in the 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.090
 channel playstation 3 games 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.400
 I think this is feasible and when I said that 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.260
 more serves minecraft will operate only 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.500
 I really want to do a lot 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.280

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.220
 started 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.050

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.550

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:15.580
 because of the lack of videos and I hope 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:18.130
