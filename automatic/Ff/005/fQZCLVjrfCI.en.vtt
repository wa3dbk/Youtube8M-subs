00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
would be worth less and less over the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.790 
would be worth less and less over the
years<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.990> so<00:03:53.990> yeah<00:03:54.170> that's<00:03:54.380> one<00:03:54.650> way<00:03:54.770> to

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
years so so yeah that's one way to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:20.420 
years so so yeah that's one way to
change<00:03:59.620> exercise
