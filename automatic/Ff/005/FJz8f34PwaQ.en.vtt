00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.819 
element of earth energy as well as fire
let's<00:01:48.810> feed<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> baby<00:01:50.130> form<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
let's feed it so this is the baby form I

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.170 
let's feed it so this is the baby form I
like<00:01:52.829> Ruby<00:01:53.220> Ruby<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> good<00:01:54.720> color<00:01:56.180> so

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
like Ruby Ruby is a is a good color so

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.550 
like Ruby Ruby is a is a good color so
here<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> feed<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
here it is and we're going to feed it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.100 
here it is and we're going to feed it
again<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.100> just<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.450> into<00:02:00.840> its<00:02:00.990> adult

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
again and just get it into its adult

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.630 
again and just get it into its adult
form

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.020 

it's<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.759> blank<00:02:09.030> basketball<00:02:10.730> all<00:02:11.730> right<00:02:11.880> so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it's like blank basketball all right so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.120 
it's like blank basketball all right so
here<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.570> is<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.960> adult<00:02:13.320> form<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:13.980> see

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
here it is in adult form as you can see

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.800 
here it is in adult form as you can see
very<00:02:14.640> very<00:02:15.270> similar<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.370> ice<00:02:17.550> dragon<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
very very similar to the ice dragon and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.280 
very very similar to the ice dragon and
here<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:21.510> wiggling<00:02:21.930> its<00:02:22.080> tail

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
here it is and it's wiggling its tail

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.030 
here it is and it's wiggling its tail
you<00:02:22.500> notice<00:02:22.800> there's<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:24.200> ruby<00:02:25.200> gem<00:02:25.530> stone<00:02:25.860> on

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
you notice there's a ruby gem stone on

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.490 
you notice there's a ruby gem stone on
its<00:02:26.190> tail<00:02:26.370> around<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:27.000> well<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:28.020> be<00:02:28.230> back

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
its tail around as well as it be back

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.150 
its tail around as well as it be back
and<00:02:28.890> its<00:02:29.040> head<00:02:29.280> right<00:02:29.520> there<00:02:30.830> okay<00:02:31.830> let's<00:02:32.040> get

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
and its head right there okay let's get

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.750 
and its head right there okay let's get
out<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.340> here

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
out of here

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.850 
out of here
so<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.240> got<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.930> dragon<00:02:34.410> let<00:02:34.530> me<00:02:34.620> go<00:02:34.740> in

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
so how I got this dragon let me go in

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190 
so how I got this dragon let me go in
here<00:02:34.890> actually<00:02:35.340> let's<00:02:35.670> look<00:02:35.730> at<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.180> yeah<00:02:37.020> it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
here actually let's look at this yeah it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.710 
here actually let's look at this yeah it
is<00:02:37.410> an<00:02:37.620> epic<00:02:38.040> type<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.489> dragon<00:02:38.910> how<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> got<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
is an epic type of dragon how I got the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.930 
is an epic type of dragon how I got the
dragon<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.410> used<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.800> energy<00:02:41.010> dragon<00:02:41.760> and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
dragon is I used the energy dragon and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.640 
dragon is I used the energy dragon and
the<00:02:42.300> tribal<00:02:42.870> dragon<00:02:43.790> 14<00:02:44.790> hours<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.650> 23

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the tribal dragon 14 hours and 23

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.370 
the tribal dragon 14 hours and 23
minutes<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.580> breeding<00:02:48.209> time<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.020> VIP

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
minutes was the breeding time for a VIP

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.830 
minutes was the breeding time for a VIP
but<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.070> lost<00:02:50.340> my<00:02:50.520> VIP<00:02:50.880> already<00:02:51.360> because<00:02:51.660> I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
but I lost my VIP already because I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.660 
but I lost my VIP already because I
don't<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.680> did<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.250> didn't<00:02:53.459> feel<00:02:53.580> like

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
don't know I did I just didn't feel like

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640 
don't know I did I just didn't feel like
renewing<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.390> because<00:02:54.690> obviously<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.440> didn't

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
renewing it because obviously it didn't

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.010 
renewing it because obviously it didn't
do<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.890> much<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.400> skewed<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.300> breeding

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
do that much in a skewed the breeding

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.900 
do that much in a skewed the breeding
time<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:58.620> people<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.280> actually<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.700> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
time for people to actually have to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.380 
time for people to actually have to
calculate<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.860> 20%<00:03:01.950> anyways<00:03:02.670> hatching<00:03:03.120> time

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
calculate that 20% anyways hatching time

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.110 
calculate that 20% anyways hatching time
is<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:04.170> day<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.800> two<00:03:05.100> hours<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.850> see

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
is one day and two hours so you can see

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.910 
is one day and two hours so you can see
a<00:03:06.150> big<00:03:06.450> difference<00:03:06.900> between<00:03:07.020> breeding<00:03:07.739> time

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
a big difference between breeding time

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.699 
a big difference between breeding time
and<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.790> hatching<00:03:09.209> time<00:03:09.450> it's<00:03:10.049> much<00:03:10.320> larger

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
and the hatching time it's much larger

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.310 
and the hatching time it's much larger
one<00:03:11.400> day<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.880> two<00:03:12.060> hours<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.900> hatching

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
one day in two hours is the hatching

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.350 
one day in two hours is the hatching
time<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:13.980> anyways<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.760> about<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.330> for

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
time but anyways that is about it for

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.199 
time but anyways that is about it for
