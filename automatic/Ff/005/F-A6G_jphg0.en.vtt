00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:16.650
 so let's go to the birthday girl's outfit 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:20.820
 to do and do it yourself today 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 We're going to need you the color you want. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.880
 you want the color that was the theme of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.939
 Your daughter's party, let's go. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.700
 need elastic can be the most 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.290
 Thick but I just got thin then it goes 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.280
 this even a little rose for you and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 then make the decorations next door too 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.649
 optional if you like 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.399
 the up part 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.879
 We're going to need one before me. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.530
 I got this one with a long sleeve but it can 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.070
 to be a short-sleeved 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.390
 We're going to need 9 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.170
 that here I do not quite know the name but 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.710
 can be a tissue so it does not get 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.320
 leaving the line but this here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.560
 I really do not know the name says that. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.530
 but I chose a green uno not so well 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.530
 since the exit is going to be green right? 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.189
 We're going to need a number. 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:40.320
 I printed here a number 5 is a sheet 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:43.079
 a4 a41 and even is it prints are a 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.100
 half because they were very interested 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.960
 big at number 5 any account 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.590
 that the birthday girl will make five 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.790
 families and we will also need 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.930
 a pair of scissors to cut the fabric 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.860
 cut the figure here for us later 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.979
 total 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.820
 this here we will need a 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.030
 pen to pass the number protect 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:17.370
 and an optional tape measure 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.920
 because the tulle here myself only by the eye 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.650
 Yes, I'm not asking for anything right. 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.060
 no but if you want you can meditate 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.670
 Good, and I'm with this doll that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.530
 Your child's body had its true 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.020
 had great then will there even is to 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 make it easier to leave 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.030
 so let's follow up as you want 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:11.330
 then the fabric was three meters and 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.330
 thirty - two pieces like that of 52 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.070
 centimeters to leave 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.070
 so let's make dollar outflows 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:36.830
 What a kiss, good girls, here it is. 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:39.200
 the end result is my daughter has 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.960
 six years this clothes that is not for her 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.960
 but she is here modeling a 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:51.140
 little chubby but it's okay just to 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.420

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.110
