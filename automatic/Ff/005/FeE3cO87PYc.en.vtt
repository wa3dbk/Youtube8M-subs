2000 milliampere our battery it's a
lithium-ion<00:03:24.450> battery<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.620> that's<00:03:25.890> all<00:03:26.069> we<00:03:26.280> do

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
lithium-ion battery so that's all we do

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.280 
lithium-ion battery so that's all we do
not<00:03:26.519> have<00:03:26.730> anything<00:03:26.970> else<00:03:27.269> inside<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.629> box<00:03:27.959> so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
not have anything else inside the box so

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.380 
not have anything else inside the box so

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
let me just quickly insert the pantry

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:38.059 
let me just quickly insert the pantry
and<00:03:30.420> turn<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.109> device

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.010
