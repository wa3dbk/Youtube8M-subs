00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.260 
forward jump hit back forward forward
jump<00:02:04.020> hit<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.280> back<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:06.000> bit

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
jump hit and then go back a little bit

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.010 
jump hit and then go back a little bit
if<00:02:06.479> he<00:02:06.780> does<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> x-ray<00:02:07.799> when<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.849> are<00:02:09.390> doing

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
if he does the x-ray when you are doing

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.740 
if he does the x-ray when you are doing
it<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.619> face<00:02:10.830> them<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> first<00:02:11.310> time

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
it when you face them the first time

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.809 
it when you face them the first time
simply<00:02:12.750> just

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
simply just

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.360 
simply just
and<00:02:14.180> press<00:02:14.750> retry<00:02:15.019> cuz<00:02:15.560> doing<00:02:15.829> this<00:02:15.950> makes<00:02:16.219> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and press retry cuz doing this makes the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.690 
and press retry cuz doing this makes the
challenge<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.879> little<00:02:16.909> easier<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.950> watch<00:02:19.430> out

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
challenge a little easier and watch out

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.699 
challenge a little easier and watch out
for<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.969> attack<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.719> the<00:02:20.900> ground<00:02:21.140> ground

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
for that attack and the ground ground

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.759 
for that attack and the ground ground
pound<00:02:22.069> those<00:02:22.459> are<00:02:22.790> what<00:02:22.969> makes<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.450> harder<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
pound those are what makes it harder the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.589 
pound those are what makes it harder the
x-ray<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:25.189> can<00:02:25.519> choose<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.000> use<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.420> I

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
x-ray you can choose to use it I

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.599 
x-ray you can choose to use it I
personally<00:02:27.170> would<00:02:27.319> like<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.280> use<00:02:28.430> it

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
personally would like like to use it

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.440 
personally would like like to use it
every<00:02:28.730> time<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.260> then<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.769> Goro<00:02:31.450> starts

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
every time I can so then if Goro starts

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.720 
every time I can so then if Goro starts
to<00:02:32.569> unleash<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.930> combo<00:02:33.349> on<00:02:33.530> me<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:33.769> can<00:02:34.099> just<00:02:34.340> use

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
to unleash a combo on me I can just use

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.569 
to unleash a combo on me I can just use
our<00:02:35.180> max<00:02:35.390> levitate<00:02:36.140> x-ray<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.220> it

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
our max levitate x-ray and it

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.839 
our max levitate x-ray and it
automatically<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.299> eliminates<00:02:39.579> Goro<00:02:40.579> from

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
automatically just eliminates Goro from

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.910 
automatically just eliminates Goro from
the<00:02:40.939> equation<00:02:41.389> and<00:02:41.569> then<00:02:42.379> you<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.680> start

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
the equation and then you can start

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.709 
the equation and then you can start
doing<00:02:43.159> that<00:02:43.579> I'm<00:02:43.670> doing<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.060> I'm<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.269> little<00:02:44.450> low

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
doing that I'm doing so I'm a little low

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.869 
doing that I'm doing so I'm a little low
on<00:02:44.750> healthier<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:45.500> see<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.889> see<00:02:46.099> what<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.280> what<00:02:46.849> I
