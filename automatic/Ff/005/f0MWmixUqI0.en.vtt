00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
and I just discovered something today

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.250 
and I just discovered something today
something<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:08.540> disappoints<00:00:09.540> me<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:09.900> NBA

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
something that disappoints me about NBA

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.910 
something that disappoints me about NBA
2k14<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.490> that's<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.849> attribute<00:00:12.059> caps<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
2k14 and that's the attribute caps and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.709 
2k14 and that's the attribute caps and
this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> something<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.269> didn't<00:00:15.630> even

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
this is something that I didn't even

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.859 
this is something that I didn't even
notice<00:00:16.049> until<00:00:16.260> today<00:00:16.890> because<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.880> haven't

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
notice until today because I haven't

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
notice until today because I haven't
really<00:00:19.230> been<00:00:19.260> upgrading<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:19.859> attributes<00:00:20.520> that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
really been upgrading my attributes that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.870 
really been upgrading my attributes that
much<00:00:21.210> yet<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:22.439> still<00:00:22.859> collecting<00:00:23.070> vici<00:00:23.760> I'm

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
much yet I'm still collecting vici I'm

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.540 
much yet I'm still collecting vici I'm
doing<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.900> realized<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:26.310> first

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
doing that now and I realized the first

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.980 
doing that now and I realized the first
thing<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.789> realized<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.570> speed<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
thing I realized is that my speed is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.999 
thing I realized is that my speed is
capped<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.769> 92<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.900> was<00:00:30.900> saving<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.470> V<00:00:31.710> seat

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
capped at 92 I was saving my V seat

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.220 
capped at 92 I was saving my V seat
upgrade<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.700> speed<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> make<00:00:34.110> an

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
upgrade my speed and when you make an

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.840 
upgrade my speed and when you make an
athletic<00:00:34.680> point<00:00:34.950> guard<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.219> start<00:00:35.579> off<00:00:35.700> with

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
athletic point guard you start off with

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.660 
athletic point guard you start off with
88<00:00:36.210> speed<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> said<00:00:37.320> I'm<00:00:37.530> pretty<00:00:38.129> close<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
88 speed so I said I'm pretty close to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.410 
88 speed so I said I'm pretty close to
maxing<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> start<00:00:41.250> upgrading<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
maxing out so I start upgrading and it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.920 
maxing out so I start upgrading and it
stops<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.290> 92<00:00:44.450> let's<00:00:45.450> stick<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> myself

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
stops at 92 let's stick it to myself

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.650 
stops at 92 let's stick it to myself
like<00:00:46.289> how<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.640> cap<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> speed<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
like how could they cap the speed of a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.920 
like how could they cap the speed of a
point<00:00:48.960> guard<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.350> 92<00:00:49.890> point<00:00:50.520> guards<00:00:50.850> are<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
point guard at 92 point guards are the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
point guard at 92 point guards are the
smallest<00:00:52.320> players<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> court<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.910> they

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
smallest players on the court so they

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.900 
smallest players on the court so they
should<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.750> turn<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> fastest<00:00:56.520> players<00:00:56.730> on

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
should in turn be the fastest players on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.889 
should in turn be the fastest players on
the<00:00:56.969> court<00:00:57.000> right<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.710> NBA<00:00:59.039> today<00:00:59.190> in

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
the court right in the NBA today in

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.420 
the court right in the NBA today in
today's<00:01:00.899> game<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> point<00:01:01.710> guards<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.129> really

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
today's game the point guards are really

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
today's game the point guards are really
fast<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.359> shocking<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.290> would

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
fast so it's shocking that they would

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.010 
fast so it's shocking that they would
cap<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.949> speed<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.430> 92<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.689> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
cap your speed at 92 but it's not just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.170 
cap your speed at 92 but it's not just
that<00:01:07.460> my<00:01:08.460> passing<00:01:09.180> rating<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> capped<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.290> 92

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
that my passing rating is capped at 92

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.870 
that my passing rating is capped at 92
my<00:01:12.180> ball<00:01:12.450> handling<00:01:12.780> rating<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.619> captain<00:01:14.100> 92<00:01:14.610> my

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
my ball handling rating is captain 92 my

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.080 
my ball handling rating is captain 92 my
layup<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> capped<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.020> 92<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.920> ball<00:01:17.189> security

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
layup is capped at 92 my ball security

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.450 
layup is capped at 92 my ball security
is<00:01:18.240> capped<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.290> seems<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.710> everything

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
is capped and it seems like everything

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.200 
is capped and it seems like everything
is<00:01:20.549> capped<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.180> 90<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:22.080> 92<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.549> most<00:01:23.790> important

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
is capped at 90 or 92 the most important

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
is capped at 90 or 92 the most important
attributes<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.900> point<00:01:25.200> guards<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.220> here's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
attributes for point guards but here's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390 
attributes for point guards but here's
the<00:01:26.790> kicker<00:01:27.259> here's<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.530> thing<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> doesn't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the kicker here's the thing that doesn't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
the kicker here's the thing that doesn't
make<00:01:29.490> any<00:01:29.700> sense<00:01:29.880> about<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.540> new<00:01:30.780> attribute

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
make any sense about these new attribute

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
make any sense about these new attribute
caps<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> fact<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.630> can

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
caps and that's the fact that I can

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
caps and that's the fact that I can
upgrade<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.590> post<00:01:35.009> hook<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:36.270> post

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
upgrade my post hook and my post

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.980 
upgrade my post hook and my post
fadeaway<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> 95<00:01:39.290> what<00:01:41.030> point<00:01:42.030> guards<00:01:42.509> it's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
fadeaway to 95 what point guards it's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
fadeaway to 95 what point guards it's
not<00:01:43.229> important<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> point<00:01:44.250> guard<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> go

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
not important for a point guard to go

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.850 
not important for a point guard to go
into<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> post<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> post<00:01:46.079> fadeaway<00:01:46.649> or

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
into the post and do a post fadeaway or

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.300 
into the post and do a post fadeaway or
a<00:01:46.920> post<00:01:47.460> hook<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.390> why<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.990> cat<00:01:49.259> fur<00:01:49.590> for

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a post hook so why is the cat fur for

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.460 
a post hook so why is the cat fur for
that<00:01:50.520> higher<00:01:51.180> than<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> cat<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.140> something

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that higher than the cat for something

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.850 
that higher than the cat for something
like<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> passing<00:01:53.310> rating<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.689> layup<00:01:55.200> rating

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
like a passing rating or a layup rating

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.300 
like a passing rating or a layup rating
or<00:01:56.130> ball<00:01:57.030> security<00:01:57.390> ball<00:01:58.020> handling<00:01:58.560> offhand

dribbling<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.450> doesn't<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:00.869> any<00:02:01.020> sense

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140

the most important attributes for a

the most important attributes for a

something<00:02:06.479> silly<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.049> post<00:02:07.590> fadeaway<00:02:08.330> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
something silly like post fadeaway and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.110 
that was beautiful that is montage
worthy<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.920> saved<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.070> replay<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.970> don't

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
worthy I saved that replay but I don't

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.760 
worthy I saved that replay but I don't
know<00:02:26.240> if<00:02:26.390> real<00:02:26.630> maker<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.080> back<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> game<00:02:27.710> I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
know if real maker is back in the game I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.920 
know if real maker is back in the game I
don't<00:02:27.980> think<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.790> also<00:02:29.570> when<00:02:29.810> you're

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
don't think it is and also when you're

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.480 
don't think it is and also when you're
in<00:02:29.960> replay<00:02:30.260> mode<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.680> can't<00:02:30.950> take<00:02:31.160> away<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
in replay mode you can't take away the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.370 
in replay mode you can't take away the
circling<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.240> year<00:02:32.480> well<00:02:32.660> actually<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.140> can

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
circling this year well actually you can

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.960 
circling this year well actually you can
but<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.890> hold<00:02:34.160> down<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.550> triggers

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
but you have to hold down the triggers

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.210 
but you have to hold down the triggers
you<00:02:35.600> have<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.960> hold<00:02:36.170> down<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.680> left<00:02:36.710> bumper

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
you have to hold down the left bumper

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.400 
you have to hold down the left bumper
and<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.850> right<00:02:38.060> bumper<00:02:38.450> at<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.690> same<00:02:38.930> time<00:02:39.230> to

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
and the right bumper at the same time to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.630 
and the right bumper at the same time to
take<00:02:39.560> away<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> circle<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.370> have<00:02:40.520> to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
take away the circle and you have to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120 
take away the circle and you have to
keep<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:41.000> held<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.260> makes<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.680> tricky<00:02:43.100> to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
keep it held so that makes it tricky to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.970 
keep it held so that makes it tricky to
control<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:44.000> camera<00:02:44.210> angle<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.170> record<00:02:45.830> your

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
control the camera angle and record your

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.270 
control the camera angle and record your
plays<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:47.120> anyway<00:02:47.480> back<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.650> attributes

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
plays but anyway back to the attributes

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.230 
plays but anyway back to the attributes
being<00:02:49.610> capped<00:02:49.940> now<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.810> funny<00:02:51.170> thing<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.650> all

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
being capped now the funny thing is all

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.790 
being capped now the funny thing is all
the<00:02:53.240> other<00:02:53.420> point<00:02:53.810> guards<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.290> game<00:02:54.500> are

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
the other point guards in the game are

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.460 
the other point guards in the game are
not<00:02:54.860> capped<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.180> when<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.450> play<00:02:56.660> against<00:02:56.960> cp3

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
not capped so when you play against cp3

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.180 
not capped so when you play against cp3
Derrick<00:02:58.310> Rose<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.440> Russell<00:03:00.440> Westbrook<00:03:01.160> and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.340 
Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook and
all<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.790> other<00:03:01.910> fast<00:03:02.300> guards<00:03:02.870> they<00:03:03.080> have

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
all the other fast guards they have

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.110 
all the other fast guards they have
above<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.430> 92<00:03:05.000> speed<00:03:05.390> they<00:03:05.630> have<00:03:05.840> above<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.350> 95

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
above a 92 speed they have above a 95

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.660 
above a 92 speed they have above a 95
ball<00:03:08.120> security<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:09.200> ball<00:03:09.440> handle<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.370> pass

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
ball security and ball handle and pass

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.600 
ball security and ball handle and pass
so<00:03:11.660> they're<00:03:11.900> not<00:03:12.140> capped<00:03:12.530> at<00:03:12.860> these<00:03:13.160> levels

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
so they're not capped at these levels

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.120 
so they're not capped at these levels
but<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:14.000> are<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.570> that's<00:03:15.290> weird<00:03:15.650> why<00:03:15.920> would

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
but we are and that's weird why would

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.490 
but we are and that's weird why would
they<00:03:16.250> cap<00:03:16.490> our<00:03:16.700> my<00:03:16.910> players<00:03:17.330> at<00:03:17.750> these<00:03:18.260> levels

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
they cap our my players at these levels

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.770 
they cap our my players at these levels
and<00:03:18.860> then<00:03:19.070> let<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> NBA<00:03:19.700> players<00:03:20.030> go<00:03:20.510> above

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
and then let the NBA players go above

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.990 
and then let the NBA players go above
the<00:03:20.990> levels<00:03:21.350> that's<00:03:22.220> weird<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.670> would<00:03:22.880> think

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
the levels that's weird you would think

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.630 
the levels that's weird you would think
if<00:03:23.210> they<00:03:23.450> had<00:03:23.660> this<00:03:23.840> cap<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.320> place<00:03:24.500> then<00:03:25.370> maybe

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
if they had this cap in place then maybe

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.160 
if they had this cap in place then maybe
that<00:03:25.880> was<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:26.210> something<00:03:26.360> they<00:03:26.570> did<00:03:26.780> overall

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
that was just something they did overall

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.730 
that was just something they did overall
to<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:28.070> position<00:03:28.550> as<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.700> whole<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.270> no<00:03:29.740> these

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
to the position as a whole but no these

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.890 
to the position as a whole but no these
caps<00:03:31.130> are<00:03:31.340> only<00:03:31.550> from<00:03:31.820> my<00:03:32.000> career<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.750> it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
caps are only from my career and it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.170 
caps are only from my career and it
doesn't<00:03:33.230> make<00:03:33.320> any<00:03:33.470> sense<00:03:33.590> because<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:35.060> I

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
doesn't make any sense because like I

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.030 
doesn't make any sense because like I
said<00:03:35.240> earlier<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.960> post<00:03:36.230> fadeaway<00:03:36.770> is<00:03:36.830> at

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.910 
said earlier the post fadeaway is at
ninety<00:03:37.370> five<00:03:38.140> point<00:03:39.140> guards<00:03:39.440> aren't<00:03:39.710> doing

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
ninety five point guards aren't doing

ninety five point guards aren't doing
post<00:03:40.130> fadeaway<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:40.850> why<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.270> higher<00:03:41.660> than

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
post fadeaway so why is that higher than

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.050 
post fadeaway so why is that higher than
a<00:03:42.140> passing<00:03:42.770> cap<00:03:43.010> when<00:03:43.520> your<00:03:43.640> point<00:03:43.940> guard

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
a passing cap when your point guard

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.760 
a passing cap when your point guard
you're<00:03:44.270> supposed<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.600> be<00:03:44.720> able<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.900> pass<00:03:45.170> so

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
you're supposed to be able to pass so

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.860 
you're supposed to be able to pass so
why<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.010> your<00:03:46.280> pass<00:03:46.490> capped<00:03:46.850> at<00:03:47.000> 92<00:03:47.510> but<00:03:47.750> your

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
why is your pass capped at 92 but your

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.020 
why is your pass capped at 92 but your
