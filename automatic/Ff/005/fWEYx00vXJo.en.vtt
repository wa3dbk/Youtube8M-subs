00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 among all users of spaceshames I am 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.460
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.050
 video dedicated to the trading leader 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809
 we are continuing our journey 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.099
 through the team of the syrian of the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.220
 a series of players are therefore 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.960
 distinct in this football season 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.600
 after seeing several players today 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.550
 it 's an attacker's turn 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 ciro immobile top scorer of the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 championship I would say surprise because I want to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 see if anyone had predicted 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.130
 immobile first top scorer e 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.350
 during championship anyway 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 great season for him to call 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.739
 at the world championships I would say almost for granted a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.270
 re-enter the list of 23 of prandelli 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.040
 in any case, to see the statistics 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.210
 starting as always at speed 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.980
 speed that is good for an attacker a 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.200
 all you need to do 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.899
 then aim at a sufficient speed 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.840
 only 83 84 as acceleration and speed 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.789
 maximum therefore not a good one 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.289
 physical strength even if sometimes 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.030
 it shows slightly less however it is 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.620
 very good and above the average of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.129
 other attackers therefore in various respects 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.450
 al higuain 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.640
 you see it stronger physically and therefore 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.670
 from this point of view the point of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 view of the physique really promoted for 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.110
 as for the shot they start at 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.100
 there are problems because why 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.009
 despite having 98 and therefore a value 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.439
 very very high and issued several 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.350
 clip that only gets one on one 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.600
 in front of the goalkeeper and wrong 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.229
 blatantly or the goalkeeper makes a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.140
 miracle 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 so in my opinion that is not there much 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.610
 I would say truthfully that it is much lower 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.759
 however, let's say greater than 90 why 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.579
 however, very often it marks in 98 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.799
 counting that higuain to 99 which one is 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.659
 clearly noted that unlike 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.920
 every ball he touched was almost 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.970
 always goals 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.969
 a shooting power is very good 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.189
 pulls good cannonballs from the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.270
 distance I've never tried 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.100
 grandiose as the first leg distance is longer 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.890
 a player to use in the area of 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.750
 wired high rigor so it is 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.179
 always in the right place at the right time 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.440
 with regard to foot stables 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.540
 weak only three stars weak foot 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.150
 this can be a problem since 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.069
 you will be obliged practically only areas 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.520
 right for the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.380
 dribbling is a little doubt even here it is not 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.000
 always constant because sometimes you succeed 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.530
 to release very easily because 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.200
 however, agility and dribbling don't 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.959
 I'm bad for an attacker like him 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.510
 other times it is practically a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.580
 curbstone cannot be turned two 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.500
 star ski so don't think about doing 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.110
 with this player and therefore sometimes 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.730
 there was a lot of disappointment other times you have 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.560
 seen in the clips where he got rid of 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.970
 david lewis with extreme ease 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.730
 as for the header 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.010
 here too sometimes it is extraordinary 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.959
 one meter and 85 is therefore not at all low 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.220
 other times it will never go to 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.290
 to tear off of course that when 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.000
 manages to take a he goes to score 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.580
 so if you can give him the ball 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.590
 hardly err on the head for 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.359
 regarding the cards and sand 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.430
 apply this the player the first is 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.930
 artist you were n't sure I had 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.750
 very common style for attackers 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.459
 because it goes up the passage and the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.160
 dreaming passage especially if it 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.840
 use as a unique tip and want 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.430
 throw the wings off guard or 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.769
 check in. In this case we are going to lie 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.269
 the throw to take them to the end 99 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.880
 try to improve it a little short 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.900
 editing is quite problematic 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.000
 we want to use this player 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.549
 definitely tip central because how 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.829
 we said high world so low 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.540
 I am not an attacking midfielder and I cannot 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.370
 recommend the classic of 5 series a 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.590
 with can beat quartist than boys 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.180
 it's something out of the square world 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.500
 right exterior square sharaawy 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.799
 they will just have to go cross that 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.319
 we stand still and balotelli that of 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.989
 head do not forgive certainly we talk about 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.120
 usual players that in defense don't 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.069
 pass anyone like a little hedgehog e 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.569
 diakitÃ¨ or in the formation I have it 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.530
 tried the leader got excellent 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.260
 results 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.440
 a 4 3 3 always standard a 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.940
 in this case we have poop that can 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.290
 lower lower in this case e 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.859
 can free it from the big 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.800
 distance 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.020
 gervinho and kalou also are 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.790
 improves s is the best at of 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.730
 series that will have to go to the bottom e 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.350
 then they can re-enter or otherwise jump 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.410
 the man and then go to serve motionless and 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.060
 he will simply have to stay in front 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.280
 prepare and mark when that is 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.750
 ball is a great player for 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.400
 finalize the action 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.840
 you will never have the problem that maybe 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.100
 they have higuain and gomez and it gets better 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.500
 better than some who go to 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.540
 lowering the bugs excused you will be immobile 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.890
 always high in attack then in 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.930
 conclusion the personal bad to good 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.960
 shooting power the work you're perfect e 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.850
 the sometimes extraordinary header 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.410
 sometimes not finalizing sometimes 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.300
 extraordinary times no 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.890
 drilling because it has only two stables 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.520
 style and the three weakest stars that 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.320
 they can annoy the 60 to 70 costs 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.090
 thousand priests so it is not little taking a 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.090
 mind that in series there are always 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.290
 army of paid as the balotelli bars 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.460
 etc. etc. 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.560
 I suggest you try it because anyway 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.420
 it's not bad but personally I preferred 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.190
 higuain second on pole that is not 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.310
 he particularly felt the middle average 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.150
 word still a great striker 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.590
 try it because it's always nice to change 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.060
 a bit the players so with today has 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.560
 ended serving liked left a 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.490
 lay a comment subscribed to the channel us 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.120
 I'll see you soon 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.120
 Hi everyone
