we are going to add the flame tamer

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.649 
we are going to add the flame tamer
underneath<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the heat up to high to bring it up to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
the heat up to high to bring it up to
pressure<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.430> dial<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.970> gonna<00:01:18.119> pop

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
pressure this little dial is gonna pop

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.280 
pressure this little dial is gonna pop
up<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> keep<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> flame<00:01:21.750> at

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
up and you want to keep the flame at

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.999 
up and you want to keep the flame at
about<00:01:22.799> medium<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.320> air<00:01:25.500> isn't<00:01:25.740> like

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
about medium so that the air isn't like

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 
about medium so that the air isn't like
spewing<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> pressure<00:01:27.060> cooker<00:01:27.210> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
spewing out of the pressure cooker but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.560 
spewing out of the pressure cooker but
it<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.840> has<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> nice<00:01:28.259> stream<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.420> then<00:01:30.420> when

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it just has a nice stream and then when

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.510 
it just has a nice stream and then when
that<00:01:30.689> 15<00:01:31.110> minutes<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.920> turn<00:01:32.130> off<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that 15 minutes out you turn off the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.810 
that 15 minutes out you turn off the
flame<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.630> let<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.900> come<00:01:34.110> down<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.470> pressure

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
flame you let it come down to pressure

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.160 
flame you let it come down to pressure
naturally<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> pot<00:01:37.140> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
naturally and then you have a pot of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.789 
naturally and then you have a pot of
brown<00:01:37.380> rice<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.520> our<00:01:38.670> rice<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.420> done<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.140> let

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
brown rice so our rice is now done I let

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.710 
brown rice so our rice is now done I let
it<00:01:40.890> come<00:01:41.040> naturally<00:01:41.549> down<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:42.000> pressure<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it come naturally down from pressure and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.350 
it come naturally down from pressure and
the<00:01:43.590> little<00:01:43.890> dial<00:01:44.130> has<00:01:44.460> gone<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> way

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the little dial has gone all the way

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.530 
the little dial has gone all the way
down<00:01:45.829> now<00:01:46.829> our<00:01:47.220> rice<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.820> ready<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> this
