week today we're gonna learn how to do a

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.620 
week today we're gonna learn how to do a
back<00:00:20.920> handspring<00:00:21.369> over<00:00:21.699> the<00:00:21.789> block<00:00:21.939> and<00:00:22.150> the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
back handspring over the block and the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.700 
back handspring over the block and the
final<00:00:22.900> progression<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.349> gonna<00:00:23.500> look<00:00:23.650> like

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
final progression is gonna look like

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.169 
final progression is gonna look like
this<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.400> now<00:00:27.400> we're<00:00:27.609> gonna<00:00:27.699> break<00:00:27.910> this<00:00:28.119> down

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
this and now we're gonna break this down

same comfortable but from a back

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.310 
same comfortable but from a back
standing<00:00:55.180> position<00:00:55.600> like<00:00:55.990> sup<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.960> technique

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
standing position like sup the technique

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.020 
standing position like sup the technique
here<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.710> similar<00:01:00.190> with<00:01:00.310> the<00:01:00.370> previous<00:01:00.460> one

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
here is similar with the previous one

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.039 
here is similar with the previous one
here<00:01:01.870> we're<00:01:02.140> jumping<00:01:02.470> up<00:01:02.620> with<00:01:02.980> both<00:01:03.190> legs<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
here we're jumping up with both legs so

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.110 
here we're jumping up with both legs so
you<00:01:05.110> should<00:01:05.350> stop<00:01:05.530> small<00:01:05.830> on<00:01:05.980> your<00:01:06.070> arms<00:01:09.120> now

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
you should stop small on your arms now

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.190 
you should stop small on your arms now
we're<00:01:10.240> going<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.390> learn<00:01:10.510> how<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.750> do<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> back

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
we're going to learn how to do a back

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.750 
we're going to learn how to do a back
handspring<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:12.160> can<00:01:12.340> see<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.580> progression

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
handspring you can see the progression

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:22.820 
handspring you can see the progression
here

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.410 

firstly<00:01:23.830> we<00:01:24.190> do<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> cartwheel<00:01:24.700> from<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.240> back

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
firstly we do a cartwheel from a back

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.050 
firstly we do a cartwheel from a back
standing<00:01:25.690> position<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.640> in<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.909> previous

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
standing position like in the previous

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.320 
standing position like in the previous
explanation<00:01:29.190> then<00:01:30.190> on<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.460> second<00:01:30.790> step<00:01:30.940> we

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
explanation then on the second step we

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.899 
explanation then on the second step we
need<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.479> swing<00:01:31.750> your<00:01:31.869> hands<00:01:32.050> not<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.560> side

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
need to swing your hands not to the side

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.960 
need to swing your hands not to the side
but<00:01:33.909> over<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.300> head<00:01:34.630> like<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.460> final<00:01:39.790> stage

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
but over a head like so the final stage

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.180 
but over a head like so the final stage
of<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.270> progression<00:01:40.450> will<00:01:41.200> be<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.740> straight

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
of this progression will be a straight

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.700 
of this progression will be a straight
back<00:01:42.490> handspring<00:01:43.119> over<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:43.990> head<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:47.290> as<00:01:47.500> we're

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
back handspring over a head now as we're

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.899 
back handspring over a head now as we're
getting<00:01:47.979> close<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.310> our<00:01:48.340> final<00:01:48.759> progression

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
getting close to our final progression

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.460 
getting close to our final progression
you<00:01:49.420> need<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.659> understand<00:01:50.050> that<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.440> a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
you need to understand that this is a

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.639 
you need to understand that this is a
difficult<00:01:50.830> move<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.729> you'll<00:01:52.330> be<00:01:52.479> adding<00:01:53.289> up

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
difficult move so you'll be adding up

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.350 
difficult move so you'll be adding up
some<00:01:53.860> height<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.340> working<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.330> your

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
some height and working on your

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.060 
some height and working on your
precision<00:01:55.750> small<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.530> build<00:01:56.710> up<00:01:56.860> confidence

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
precision small to build up confidence

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.130 
precision small to build up confidence
in<00:01:57.490> yourself<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.390> can<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.720> seriously

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
in yourself you can get seriously

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:12.840 
in yourself you can get seriously
injured<00:02:10.530> we're<00:02:11.530> here<00:02:11.769> first<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.550> all<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.730> need

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
injured we're here first of all I need

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.610 
injured we're here first of all I need
to<00:02:12.910> find<00:02:13.209> an<00:02:13.330> appropriate<00:02:13.780> place<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.320> do<00:02:14.440> this

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to find an appropriate place to do this

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.190 
to find an appropriate place to do this
move<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.940> get<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.330> comfortable<00:02:16.989> position

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
move you get in a comfortable position

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.530 
move you get in a comfortable position
and<00:02:17.620> don't<00:02:18.250> forget<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.760> sponsor<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.330> block

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and don't forget to sponsor the block

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.809 
and don't forget to sponsor the block
over<00:02:19.989> your<00:02:20.170> shoulder<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.400> first<00:02:21.580> step

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
over your shoulder so the first step

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.940 
over your shoulder so the first step
will<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.150> doing<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.690> cartwheel<00:02:23.290> from<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.769> back

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
will be doing a cartwheel from a back

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.840 
will be doing a cartwheel from a back
standing<00:02:24.280> position<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:33.549> now<00:02:33.700> you're

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
standing position like so and now you're

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.479 
standing position like so and now you're
gonna<00:02:33.910> do<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.299> more<00:02:34.720> straightly<00:02:35.489> slowly

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
gonna do this more straightly slowly

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:54.040
