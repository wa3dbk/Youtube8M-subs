it's running on a tease super fast LTE
network<00:01:59.780> for<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.080> fastest<00:02:00.470> 4G<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:00.950> can<00:02:01.250> get

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
network for the fastest 4G you can get

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.020 
network for the fastest 4G you can get
it's<00:02:02.090> got<00:02:02.300> 16<00:02:02.840> gigabytes<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.560> RAM<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:04.130> storage

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
it's got 16 gigabytes of RAM of storage

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.209 
it's got 16 gigabytes of RAM of storage
memory<00:02:05.210> built<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:05.719> plus<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.380> microSD<00:02:06.590> card<00:02:07.159> slot

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
memory built in plus a microSD card slot

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.130 
memory built in plus a microSD card slot
so<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.610> can<00:02:07.759> draw<00:02:07.909> another<00:02:08.090> 32<00:02:08.570> gigabytes<00:02:08.959> in

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
so you can draw another 32 gigabytes in

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.499 
so you can draw another 32 gigabytes in
there<00:02:09.259> if<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.410> like

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
there if you like

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.860 
there if you like
what<00:02:11.110> kind<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.099> an<00:02:12.280> Exynos<00:02:12.819> process<00:02:13.450> it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
what kind is that an Exynos process it

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.780 
what kind is that an Exynos process it
is<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.049> dual<00:02:14.439> core<00:02:14.739> processor<00:02:14.829> we're<00:02:15.670> not

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
is a dual core processor we're not

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.550 
is a dual core processor we're not
talking<00:02:16.209> specifically<00:02:16.659> about<00:02:16.780> manufacturers

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
talking specifically about manufacturers

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.819 
talking specifically about manufacturers
but<00:02:17.799> it's<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.040> 1.5<00:02:18.640> gigahertz<00:02:18.939> dual-core<00:02:19.829> okay

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
but it's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core okay

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.460 
but it's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core okay
