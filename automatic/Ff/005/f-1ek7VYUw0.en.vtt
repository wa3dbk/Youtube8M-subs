00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 The universal epistle of Saint Judas 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.450
 Apostle Judas Servant of Jesus Christ and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.190
 brother of jacobo to the calls 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.280
 sanctified in father god and saved 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.880
 in Jesus Christ mercy and peace and love 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.680
 or be multiplied beloved by the great 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 request I had to write you 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.930
 about our common salvation has 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 it was necessary to write you exhorting 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.359
 those who ardently contend for the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.619
 faith that has once been given to the saints 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 because some men have entered 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.030
 covertly those that from before 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.520
 had been destined for this 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.770
 condemnation ungodly men who 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 they turn into debauchery the grace of 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.860
 our god and deny God the only 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.840
 Sovereign and our Lord Jesus Christ more 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 I want to remind you that once 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 you have known that the lord having 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.760
 saved the people out of Egypt 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.469
 then he destroyed those who did not believe and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
 to the angels who did not keep their 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.750
 dignity but they abandoned their own 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.240
 he has kept them under darkness in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.000
 eternal prisons for the trial of the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.550
 great day 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.860
 like sodoma and gomorra and cities 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.830
 neighbors which in the same way 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.600
 that those having fornicated I have gone 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.720
 in pursuit of vices against nature 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.900
 were put for example suffering the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.660
 punishment of eternal fire notwithstanding 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.729
 the same way also these dreamers 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.220
 they defile the flesh they reject the authority 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.770
 and blaspheme of the higher powers 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.229
 but when the archangel migrated with 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.750
 tended to the devil disputing with him 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.759
 for the body of bassinet did not dare to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.479
 make a curse judgment against him 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.610
 but he said the Lord rebuke you but 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.680
 these blaspheme of how many things 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.899
 know and in which by nature 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.080
 they know they are corrupted like animals 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.630
 irrational there are of them because they have 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.910
 followed the path of cain and they launched 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.060
 for profit in the balaam error and 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.160
 they perished in the contradiction of core 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.590
 these are spots in your agapes that 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.259
 eating impudently with you be 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 patient themselves clouds without water and 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.450
 taken from here to there by the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.270
 winds autumn trees without fruit 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.340
 twice dead and uprooted beasts 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.890
 slings of the sea that foam on its own 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.989
 shame wandering stars for 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.629
 which is eternally reserved 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.120
 darkness of the darkness of these 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.849
 he also prophesied in ok seventh from 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.069
 Adam saying here the Lord came with 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.410
 his holy tens of thousands for 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.230
 prosecute everyone and leave 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 convicted to all the wicked of all 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.459
 his ungodly works that have done 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.530
 impiously and of all hard things 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.209
 that the ungodly sinners have spoken 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.910
 against him 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.730
 these are affectionate whisperers who 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.980
 they walk according to their own desires whose mouth 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.709
 he talks about inflated things flattering the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.870
 people to profit but 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.730
 you loved have memory of the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.489
 words that were previously said by the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.769
 apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.989
 those who told you in the last time 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.900
 there will be scoffers who will walk according to their 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.540
 evil wishes these are the ones that cause 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.079
 sensual divisions that do not have 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.760
 to the spirit but you dear ones 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.849

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.359
 preserved in the love of God waiting 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.719
 the mercy of our Lord 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.689
 Jesus Christ for eternal life to some 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:34.420
 who hesitate to convince others to save 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.030
 snatching those from the fire and from others 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.709
 have mercy with fear 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.859
 hating even the clothes contaminated by 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.500
 his flesh and he who is powerful to 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.540
 keep them without falling and introduce yourself without 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.510
 stain before his glory with great 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.019
 joy to the only and wise god of ours 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.349
