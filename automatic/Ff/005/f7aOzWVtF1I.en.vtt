I<00:01:04.049> found<00:01:04.379> myself<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.010> glue<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.760> dark<00:01:06.119> in

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
I found myself a glue that is dark in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350 
I found myself a glue that is dark in
color<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> won't<00:01:07.229> show<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
color so that it won't show and it is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
color so that it won't show and it is
really<00:01:09.659> strong<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.350> indoor/outdoor<00:01:11.040> glue

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
really strong it's indoor/outdoor glue

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
really strong it's indoor/outdoor glue
but<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> doesn't<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.510> many<00:01:12.990> VOCs<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.100> it's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
but it doesn't have many VOCs so it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.649 
but it doesn't have many VOCs so it's
not<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> cause<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> lot<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
not it's not going to cause a lot of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.820 
not it's not going to cause a lot of
odor<00:01:15.810> inside<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:16.380> house<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.990> 5<00:01:19.350> pounds

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
odor inside my house so it's 5 pounds

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.270 
odor inside my house so it's 5 pounds
per<00:01:20.009> square<00:01:20.040> foot<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.380> it<00:01:22.380> sticks<00:01:22.860> really

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
per square foot and it sticks really

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:48.100 
per square foot and it sticks really
easily<00:01:23.900> it's<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.229> light

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.120 

and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.200> guess<00:01:49.380> I'll<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> fit<00:01:50.040> another

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and I guess I'll have to fit another

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
and I guess I'll have to fit another
into<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.030> nice<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.509> dark<00:01:51.750> oh

so<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:49.930> just<00:02:50.410> noticed<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.190> one<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.640> these<00:02:51.940> was

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
so I just noticed that one of these was

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.230 
so I just noticed that one of these was
just<00:02:52.830> not<00:02:53.830> looking<00:02:54.190> at<00:02:54.370> straight<00:02:54.760> needed<00:02:55.120> to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
just not looking at straight needed to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.360 
just not looking at straight needed to
be<00:02:55.360> kind<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.690> pushed<00:02:55.960> off<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.200> little<00:02:56.440> bit<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.920> I

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
be kind of pushed off a little bit so I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.360 
be kind of pushed off a little bit so I
just<00:02:57.580> thought<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.940> had<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:58.870> great<00:02:59.080> idea<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.740> I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
just thought I had this great idea and I

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.420 
just thought I had this great idea and I
thought<00:03:00.520> I'd<00:03:00.700> put<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.000> little<00:03:01.060> nail<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.750> there

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
thought I'd put a little nail in there

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.310 
thought I'd put a little nail in there
so<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.790> could<00:03:04.000> dry<00:03:04.300> like<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.110> then<00:03:05.200> on

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
so it could dry like that and then on

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.950 
so it could dry like that and then on
this<00:03:05.410> pic<00:03:05.710> take<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.010> nail<00:03:06.160> in<00:03:06.310> later<00:03:06.810> now<00:03:07.810> I'm

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
this pic take the nail in later now I'm

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.470 
this pic take the nail in later now I'm
gonna<00:03:08.110> start<00:03:08.410> up<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:08.830> side<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.550> I'm

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
gonna start up on this side and I'm

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.270 
gonna start up on this side and I'm
gonna<00:03:10.690> need<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.140> do<00:03:11.290> some<00:03:11.530> cutting<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.980> make<00:03:12.130> it

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
gonna need to do some cutting to make it

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.880 
gonna need to do some cutting to make it
fit<00:03:12.460> so<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:13.720> as<00:03:13.930> simple<00:03:14.110> as<00:03:14.440> getting<00:03:14.620> your

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
fit so it's as simple as getting your

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.880 
fit so it's as simple as getting your
piece<00:03:16.530> lining<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.680> up<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:18.040> making<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.460> mark

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.190 

simple<00:03:23.890> as<00:03:23.980> that

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
simple as that

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.760 
simple as that
it's<00:03:26.200> like<00:03:26.380> butter<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:31.350> try<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.410> make<00:03:32.620> your

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
it's like butter you try to make your

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.070 
it's like butter you try to make your
glue<00:03:32.950> look<00:03:33.190> like<00:03:33.340> happy<00:03:33.670> faces<00:03:34.060> because<00:03:34.930> it

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
glue look like happy faces because it

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.410 
glue look like happy faces because it
will<00:03:35.230> make<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.500> feel<00:03:35.710> nice<00:03:36.300> when<00:03:37.300> you're

will make you feel nice when you're

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:46.020 
will make you feel nice when you're
doing<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:39.210> see<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:45.010> going<00:03:45.220> up<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:45.520> fast<00:03:45.550> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
doing it see it's going up so fast and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.370 
doing it see it's going up so fast and
that<00:03:46.180> makes<00:03:46.360> me<00:03:46.510> really<00:03:46.630> happy<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:47.230> I'm

used<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.620> having<00:03:47.800> to<00:03:47.950> do<00:03:48.160> my<00:03:48.250> projects<00:03:48.700> really

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
used to having to do my projects really

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.640 
used to having to do my projects really
fast<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.480> have<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.750> do<00:03:49.870> them<00:03:50.020> before<00:03:50.080> my<00:03:50.380> husband

fast I have to do them before my husband

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.250 
fast I have to do them before my husband
gets<00:03:50.680> home<00:03:50.980> he<00:03:51.940> gets<00:03:52.030> kind<00:03:52.270> of<00:03:52.390> nervous<00:03:52.840> with

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
gets home he gets kind of nervous with

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.870 
gets home he gets kind of nervous with
my<00:03:53.380> projects<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.070> so<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.310> like<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.610> have<00:03:54.760> them

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
my projects and so I like to have them

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.370 
my projects and so I like to have them
finished<00:03:55.209> by<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.390> time<00:03:55.480> he<00:03:55.810> knows<00:03:56.080> I'm<00:03:56.260> doing

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
finished by the time he knows I'm doing

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.770 
finished by the time he knows I'm doing
it<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:57.370> far<00:03:57.580> this<00:03:57.790> has<00:03:58.030> taken<00:03:58.180> me<00:03:58.480> about<00:03:58.630> an

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
it so far this has taken me about an

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.130 
it so far this has taken me about an
hour<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:01.030> hindsight<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.630> would<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:01.989> painted

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
hour in hindsight I would have painted

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.530 
hour in hindsight I would have painted
this<00:04:02.380> black<00:04:02.650> just<00:04:03.550> for<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.760> odd<00:04:03.940> chance<00:04:04.300> that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
this black just for the odd chance that

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.720 
this black just for the odd chance that
you<00:04:04.630> could<00:04:04.780> ever<00:04:04.900> see<00:04:05.200> behind<00:04:05.620> but<00:04:06.580> it's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
you could ever see behind but it's

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.160 
you could ever see behind but it's
turning<00:04:07.030> out<00:04:07.209> that<00:04:07.270> you<00:04:07.480> really<00:04:07.750> can't<00:04:07.989> see

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
turning out that you really can't see

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:20.370 
turning out that you really can't see
behind<00:04:08.290> anyways<00:04:08.800> but<00:04:16.230> Sally<00:04:17.230> Richardson<00:04:19.380> okay

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
behind anyways but Sally Richardson okay

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.500 
behind anyways but Sally Richardson okay
so<00:04:20.440> I'm<00:04:20.950> about<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.340> start<00:04:21.640> then<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.090> second

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
so I'm about to start then the second

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.659 
so I'm about to start then the second
half<00:04:22.720> I'm<00:04:23.169> really<00:04:23.590> excited<00:04:23.830> about<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.310> far

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
half I'm really excited about it so far

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.860 
half I'm really excited about it so far
I<00:04:24.700> think<00:04:24.850> it's<00:04:25.060> looking<00:04:25.240> really<00:04:25.570> good<00:04:25.690> and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
I think it's looking really good and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.450 
I think it's looking really good and
it's<00:04:26.169> gone<00:04:26.350> by<00:04:26.500> really<00:04:26.740> fast

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
it's gone by really fast

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.440 
it's gone by really fast
so<00:04:29.250> no<00:04:30.250> because<00:04:30.550> I'm<00:04:30.669> going<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.000> white<00:04:31.210> I've

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
so no because I'm going on white I've

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.630 
so no because I'm going on white I've
decided<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.900> paint<00:04:32.290> around<00:04:32.650> just<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.550> you

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
decided to paint around just so that you

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.120 
decided to paint around just so that you
can't<00:04:33.850> see<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.240> white<00:04:34.419> background<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.830> should

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
can't see the white background I should

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.980 
can't see the white background I should
have<00:04:36.220> done<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.430> ahead<00:04:36.880> of<00:04:36.910> time<00:04:37.150> but<00:04:37.930> I

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
have done that ahead of time but I

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.659 
have done that ahead of time but I
didn't<00:04:38.290> realize<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:38.950> it<00:04:39.220> doesn't<00:04:39.520> take<00:04:39.610> long

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
didn't realize so it doesn't take long

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.580 
didn't realize so it doesn't take long
I'm<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.060> going<00:04:40.510> around<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.870> edge<00:04:40.990> with<00:04:41.290> with

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
I'm just going around the edge with with

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.920 
I'm just going around the edge with with
black<00:04:41.830> paintbrush<00:04:42.280> no<00:04:42.460> big<00:04:42.610> deal<00:04:42.790> okay<00:04:43.000> so<00:04:43.750> I

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
black paintbrush no big deal okay so I

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.890 
black paintbrush no big deal okay so I
realized<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.680> should<00:04:44.919> start<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.610> bottom<00:04:45.970> so

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
realized I should start on the bottom so

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.780 
realized I should start on the bottom so
the<00:04:47.080> weight<00:04:47.260> of<00:04:47.290> each<00:04:47.680> tile<00:04:48.070> will<00:04:48.370> rest<00:04:48.610> on

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
the weight of each tile will rest on

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.300 
the weight of each tile will rest on
itself

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
itself

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.100 
itself
on<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.610> next<00:04:49.820> one<00:04:50.120> so<00:04:50.389> I<00:04:50.420> just<00:04:50.570> wanted<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.930> show

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
on the next one so I just wanted to show

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.310 
on the next one so I just wanted to show
how<00:04:51.350> this<00:04:51.970> it's<00:04:52.970> not<00:04:53.150> perfect<00:04:53.870> because<00:04:53.990> it's

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
how this it's not perfect because it's

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.980 
how this it's not perfect because it's
stone<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:55.790> way<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.180> doesn't<00:04:56.389> work<00:04:56.750> that

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
stone so this way it doesn't work that

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.720 
stone so this way it doesn't work that
great<00:04:57.050> but<00:04:57.500> sometimes<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:58.070> find<00:04:58.280> if<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.580> just

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
great but sometimes I find if I just

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.180 
great but sometimes I find if I just
turn<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.180> around<00:04:59.530> then<00:05:00.530> all<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.800> sudden<00:05:01.100> I

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
turn it around then all of a sudden I

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:16.740 
turn it around then all of a sudden I
get<00:05:01.250> like<00:05:01.669> a<00:05:01.700> much<00:05:02.060> nicer<00:05:02.330> fit<00:05:12.370> it's<00:05:13.370> too<00:05:13.550> easy

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.240 

so<00:05:17.750> I've<00:05:18.050> noticed<00:05:18.230> it<00:05:18.470> takes<00:05:18.680> about<00:05:18.800> half<00:05:18.950> an

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
so I've noticed it takes about half an

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.140 
so I've noticed it takes about half an
hour<00:05:19.400> for<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.450> dry<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:21.700> so<00:05:22.700> some<00:05:22.910> of<00:05:22.940> these

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
hour for it to dry and so some of these

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.659 
hour for it to dry and so some of these
spacers<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:24.050> can<00:05:24.230> take<00:05:24.410> out<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.650> put<00:05:24.950> some<00:05:25.190> nails

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
spacers I can take out I put some nails

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.420 
spacers I can take out I put some nails
in<00:05:25.910> just<00:05:26.180> to<00:05:26.330> hold<00:05:26.480> the<00:05:26.690> space<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.680> now<00:05:28.130> I<00:05:28.160> can

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
in just to hold the space and now I can

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.190 
in just to hold the space and now I can
easily<00:05:28.550> take<00:05:28.910> those<00:05:29.090> out<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.570> those<00:05:29.750> are<00:05:29.990> not

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
easily take those out and those are not

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.040 
easily take those out and those are not
going<00:05:30.470> anywhere<00:05:31.180> I'm<00:05:32.180> really<00:05:32.480> happy<00:05:32.690> with<00:05:32.990> how

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
going anywhere I'm really happy with how

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.050 
going anywhere I'm really happy with how
it's<00:05:33.500> coming<00:05:33.800> together<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.280> how<00:05:34.400> simple<00:05:34.760> it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
it's coming together and how simple it

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:46.780 
it's coming together and how simple it
is<00:05:43.150> because<00:05:44.150> it's<00:05:44.330> there<00:05:44.979> but<00:05:45.979> it's<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.640> it's

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
is because it's there but it's and it's

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.330 
is because it's there but it's and it's
there<00:05:47.090> but<00:05:47.389> there's<00:05:47.830> it's<00:05:48.830> bigger<00:05:49.070> than<00:05:49.250> that

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
there but there's it's bigger than that

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:57.869 
there but there's it's bigger than that
one<00:05:49.400> and<00:05:49.669> lighter<00:05:49.850> I<00:05:50.150> like<00:05:51.080> that

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.360 

I've<00:05:58.879> done<00:05:59.120> a<00:05:59.389> few<00:05:59.599> skinnies<00:06:00.110> there<00:06:00.830> so<00:06:01.340> I

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
I've done a few skinnies there so I

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.700 
I've done a few skinnies there so I
think<00:06:01.550> I<00:06:01.849> need<00:06:01.909> something<00:06:02.449> that's<00:06:02.629> big<00:06:03.379> fat

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
think I need something that's big fat

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.249 
think I need something that's big fat
and<00:06:03.979> long<00:06:04.819> enough<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.270> get<00:06:05.389> past<00:06:05.599> that<00:06:05.900> next

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
and long enough to get past that next

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.100 
and long enough to get past that next
line<00:06:06.729> so<00:06:07.729> that<00:06:07.789> looks<00:06:08.270> like<00:06:08.449> it<00:06:08.599> might<00:06:08.750> be<00:06:08.780> this

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
line so that looks like it might be this

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.740 
line so that looks like it might be this
one<00:06:09.379> or<00:06:09.409> this<00:06:09.740> one<00:06:10.419> there's<00:06:11.419> so<00:06:11.539> many

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
one or this one there's so many

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.649 
one or this one there's so many
different<00:06:12.319> choices<00:06:12.530> in<00:06:13.189> size<00:06:13.580> it<00:06:14.090> seems<00:06:14.479> like

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:14.659 
different choices in size it seems like

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.469 
different choices in size it seems like
I'm<00:06:14.810> never<00:06:15.189> I'm<00:06:16.189> never<00:06:16.520> matching<00:06:17.120> something

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
I'm never I'm never matching something

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.200 
I'm never I'm never matching something
up<00:06:17.599> that<00:06:17.629> I<00:06:17.780> don't<00:06:18.020> like<00:06:18.229> I<00:06:18.590> know<00:06:19.400> that<00:06:19.729> Tyler's

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
up that I don't like I know that Tyler's

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.929 
up that I don't like I know that Tyler's
use<00:06:20.569> these<00:06:20.930> little<00:06:21.349> spacers<00:06:22.009> but<00:06:22.460> I<00:06:22.490> find<00:06:22.819> the

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:22.939 
use these little spacers but I find the

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.749 
use these little spacers but I find the
nails<00:06:23.150> work<00:06:23.419> really<00:06:23.689> good<00:06:23.840> so<00:06:24.199> and<00:06:24.759> they're

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
nails work really good so and they're

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.040 
nails work really good so and they're
handy<00:06:26.169> like<00:06:27.169> me<00:06:27.879> well<00:06:28.879> I<00:06:29.030> got<00:06:29.210> to<00:06:29.330> the<00:06:29.360> top<00:06:29.690> and

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
handy like me well I got to the top and

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.450 
handy like me well I got to the top and
it<00:06:30.169> says<00:06:30.199> you<00:06:30.500> can<00:06:30.650> see<00:06:30.860> a<00:06:30.889> bit<00:06:31.099> of<00:06:31.129> a<00:06:31.250> problem

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
it says you can see a bit of a problem

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.550 
it says you can see a bit of a problem
I've<00:06:32.180> got<00:06:32.210> a<00:06:32.389> crown<00:06:32.690> molding<00:06:33.110> here<00:06:33.319> that<00:06:33.530> I

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
I've got a crown molding here that I

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.790 
I've got a crown molding here that I
have<00:06:33.770> to<00:06:33.800> angle<00:06:34.069> up<00:06:34.969> to<00:06:35.330> there<00:06:36.229> probably<00:06:36.590> were

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
have to angle up to there probably were

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.230 
have to angle up to there probably were
a<00:06:36.830> couple<00:06:37.219> different<00:06:37.550> ways<00:06:37.580> of<00:06:37.819> doing<00:06:37.969> this

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
a couple different ways of doing this

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.610 
a couple different ways of doing this
one<00:06:38.599> of<00:06:38.629> them<00:06:38.810> might<00:06:38.960> have<00:06:39.050> been<00:06:39.110> cutting<00:06:39.500> the

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
one of them might have been cutting the

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.589 
one of them might have been cutting the
molding<00:06:39.979> right<00:06:40.159> straight<00:06:40.729> to<00:06:40.879> the<00:06:41.000> wall<00:06:41.150> here

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
molding right straight to the wall here

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.200 
molding right straight to the wall here
and<00:06:41.780> giving<00:06:42.110> me<00:06:42.139> a<00:06:42.469> straight<00:06:43.159> edge<00:06:43.340> to<00:06:43.370> go<00:06:43.699> into

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
and giving me a straight edge to go into

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.850 
and giving me a straight edge to go into
that<00:06:44.719> probably<00:06:45.110> would<00:06:45.289> have<00:06:45.349> been<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.560> ideal

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
that probably would have been the ideal

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.640 
that probably would have been the ideal
way<00:06:46.509> but<00:06:47.509> you<00:06:47.690> know<00:06:47.840> when<00:06:48.229> you<00:06:48.349> have<00:06:48.500> people

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
way but you know when you have people

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.439 
way but you know when you have people
working<00:06:48.979> for<00:06:49.250> you<00:06:49.400> I<00:06:49.430> have<00:06:49.729> my<00:06:49.849> dad<00:06:50.000> do<00:06:50.270> the

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
working for you I have my dad do the

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.869 
working for you I have my dad do the
prep<00:06:50.690> for<00:06:50.960> me<00:06:51.080> so<00:06:51.469> I<00:06:51.770> have<00:06:52.340> to<00:06:52.400> work<00:06:52.610> with<00:06:52.729> what

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:52.879 
prep for me so I have to work with what

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.080 
prep for me so I have to work with what
I<00:06:52.909> got<00:06:53.139> and<00:06:54.139> the<00:06:55.129> tools<00:06:55.370> would<00:06:55.520> I<00:06:55.550> have<00:06:55.759> to<00:06:55.969> or

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
I got and the tools would I have to or

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.019 
I got and the tools would I have to or
so<00:06:56.300> I<00:06:56.539> have<00:06:56.870> paper<00:06:57.169> and<00:06:57.319> I<00:06:57.710> just<00:06:58.550> made<00:06:58.759> a<00:06:58.789> little

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
so I have paper and I just made a little

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:02.110 
so I have paper and I just made a little
guess<00:06:59.300> at<00:06:59.810> my<00:06:59.990> angle<00:07:00.550> so<00:07:01.550> that<00:07:01.759> I<00:07:01.789> don't<00:07:01.909> have

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
guess at my angle so that I don't have

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.640 
guess at my angle so that I don't have
to<00:07:02.240> practice<00:07:02.389> on<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:02.810> rock<00:07:02.990> and<00:07:03.289> I<00:07:03.440> can

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
to practice on the rock and I can

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.260 
to practice on the rock and I can
practice<00:07:04.069> on<00:07:04.219> the<00:07:04.279> paper<00:07:04.490> and<00:07:04.789> it<00:07:05.029> actually

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
practice on the paper and it actually

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.959 
practice on the paper and it actually
worked<00:07:05.599> the<00:07:05.690> first<00:07:05.960> try<00:07:07.990> so<00:07:08.990> using<00:07:09.440> my<00:07:09.469> paper

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
worked the first try so using my paper

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:12.309 
worked the first try so using my paper
template<00:07:10.969> that<00:07:11.000> I<00:07:11.180> made<00:07:11.449> I<00:07:11.690> cut<00:07:11.900> that<00:07:12.050> angle

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 
template that I made I cut that angle

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.029 
template that I made I cut that angle
and<00:07:13.029> now<00:07:14.029> I'm<00:07:14.270> just<00:07:14.569> dabbing<00:07:15.020> a<00:07:15.409> little<00:07:15.680> black

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 
and now I'm just dabbing a little black

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.999 
and now I'm just dabbing a little black
paint<00:07:16.430> on<00:07:16.819> the<00:07:17.210> cut<00:07:17.449> line<00:07:17.690> because<00:07:18.620> it's<00:07:18.800> going

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 
paint on the cut line because it's going

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:21.459 
paint on the cut line because it's going
to<00:07:19.069> be<00:07:19.190> seen<00:07:19.430> so<00:07:19.729> and<00:07:20.599> it's<00:07:20.719> as<00:07:20.870> simple<00:07:20.900> as

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:21.469 
to be seen so and it's as simple as
