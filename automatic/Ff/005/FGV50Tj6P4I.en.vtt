a gun and I was really happy that I

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.029 
a gun and I was really happy that I
finally<00:00:21.150> got<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.720> since<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.199> trying<00:00:22.800> for

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
finally got this since I was trying for

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.790 
finally got this since I was trying for
it<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.640> quite<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> bit<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.289> noticed<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.680> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it for quite a bit and I noticed that I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.650 
it for quite a bit and I noticed that I
haven't<00:00:26.010> put<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> commentary<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.390> quite<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
haven't put out a commentary in quite a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.620 
haven't put out a commentary in quite a
while<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:29.099> wanted<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
while and I really wanted to do one so I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
while and I really wanted to do one so I
thought<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.289> good<00:00:31.439> topic<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> be

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
thought a really good topic would to be

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430 
thought a really good topic would to be
actually<00:00:32.610> talking<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:33.960> thoughts<00:00:34.230> on

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
actually talking about my thoughts on

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.430 
actually talking about my thoughts on
the<00:00:34.559> DLC<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.329> only<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.899> trying<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.260> get

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the DLC so not only was I trying to get

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.950 
the DLC so not only was I trying to get
a<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:37.649> gameplay<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.820> also<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.690> trying<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
a good gameplay but also I was trying to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
a good gameplay but also I was trying to
do<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.410> something<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.770> involved<00:00:41.370> DLC

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
do it with something that involved DLC

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
do it with something that involved DLC
which<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.230> case<00:00:43.290> happened<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
which in this case happened to be the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.549 
which in this case happened to be the
Peacekeeper<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> guys<00:00:46.110> don't<00:00:46.379> know

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
Peacekeeper and if you guys don't know

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.690 
Peacekeeper and if you guys don't know
that's<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.039> new<00:00:47.190> SMG<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.200> dlc<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.950> i

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that's the new SMG in the dlc and i

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
that's the new SMG in the dlc and i
thought<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.149> pretty<00:00:51.390> cool<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.379> anyway

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
thought that was pretty cool but anyway

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.810 
thought that was pretty cool but anyway
since<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.100> already<00:00:53.250> talking<00:00:53.489> about<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
since I'm already talking about the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
since I'm already talking about the
gameplay<00:00:54.090> let<00:00:54.870> me<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.170> go<00:00:55.320> ahead<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.559> say

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
gameplay let me just go ahead and say

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.310 
gameplay let me just go ahead and say

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that the map i'm playing on is standoff

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
that the map i'm playing on is standoff
and<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:59.070> done<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.579> i'm<00:00:59.820> obviously<00:01:00.030> running

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and they done that i'm obviously running

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.529 
and they done that i'm obviously running
is<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> Peacekeeper<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.520> attachments<00:01:03.390> i'm

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
is the Peacekeeper the attachments i'm

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
extended mag as i always use on all my

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
extended mag as i always use on all my
energies<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:10.140> my<00:01:10.320> recommendation

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
energies and that's my recommendation

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.080 
energies and that's my recommendation
for<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> attachments<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.720> gun<00:01:14.090> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
for the attachments on this gun the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.219 
for the attachments on this gun the
perks<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.869> running<00:01:16.259> our<00:01:16.939> lightweight

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
perks are running our lightweight

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.820 
perks are running our lightweight
scavenger<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.490> dexterity<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.830> yeah

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
scavenger and I think dexterity or yeah

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
scavenger and I think dexterity or yeah
maybe<00:01:23.460> oh<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.180> anyway<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:25.200> would

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
maybe oh but anyway I really would

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
maybe oh but anyway I really would
advise<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> run<00:01:26.430> scavenger<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
advise you to run scavenger on this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.649 
advise you to run scavenger on this
since<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.770> doesn't<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> ammo<00:01:29.909> but

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
since it doesn't have a lot of ammo but

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.080 
since it doesn't have a lot of ammo but
actually<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.159> might<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.490> need<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.759> since

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
actually if you might not need it since

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
actually if you might not need it since
most<00:01:33.390> people<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.650> gun<00:01:34.860> anyway

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
most people actually use this gun anyway

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
most people actually use this gun anyway
so<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.270> run<00:01:36.600> around<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> pick<00:01:37.110> up

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so you can just run around and pick up

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.460 
so you can just run around and pick up
ammo<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:40.049> what

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
ammo as you go but I really would what

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.679 
ammo as you go but I really would what
advise<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> use<00:01:41.100> extended<00:01:41.820> mag<00:01:42.000> since

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
advise you to use extended mag since

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
advise you to use extended mag since
there's<00:01:42.899> only<00:01:42.990> 30<00:01:43.409> rounds<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> clip<00:01:44.369> for

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
there's only 30 rounds in a clip for

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.539 
there's only 30 rounds in a clip for
this<00:01:44.790> gun<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.170> low<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.680> SMG<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this gun which is really low for SMG and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.480 
this gun which is really low for SMG and
as<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.350> already<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> be
