00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.890 
skills of the fish actually look exactly
the<00:03:39.069> way<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.849> braid<00:03:40.090> looks<00:03:40.269> which<00:03:40.750> is

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
the way the braid looks which is

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.270 
the way the braid looks which is
actually<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.410> definition<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.130> know<00:03:42.250> a

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
actually the definition of you know a

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.640 
actually the definition of you know a
fishtail<00:03:42.700> braid<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.540> we<00:03:43.870> call<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.260> Hastur

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
fishtail braid but we call it the Hastur

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.379 
fishtail braid but we call it the Hastur
braid<00:03:44.889> so<00:03:45.130> that's<00:03:45.340> how<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.549> actually<00:03:45.760> looks<00:03:46.180> my

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
braid so that's how it actually looks my

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.900 
braid so that's how it actually looks my
mom<00:03:46.630> where<00:03:47.319> is<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.590> great<00:03:47.829> a<00:03:47.889> lot<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.400> the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
mom where is this great a lot and the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.280 
mom where is this great a lot and the
tire<00:03:49.150> d<00:03:49.269> do<00:03:49.389> like<00:03:49.569> i<00:03:49.599> said<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:49.930> going<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.169> look

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
tire d do like i said is going to look

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.259 
tire d do like i said is going to look
more<00:03:50.440> defined<00:03:50.620> than<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.190> it's<00:03:51.730> up<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:51.970> you

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
more defined than this it's up to you

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.119 
more defined than this it's up to you
but<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.959> how<00:03:53.139> you<00:03:53.200> actually<00:03:53.530> do<00:03:53.889> it<00:03:54.010> i

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
but this is how you actually do it i

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.740 
but this is how you actually do it i

can<00:03:58.450> show<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.569> guys<00:03:58.780> more<00:03:59.169> tighter<00:03:59.859> than<00:04:00.129> this

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
can show you guys more tighter than this

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.740 
can show you guys more tighter than this
and<00:04:00.519> in<00:04:00.639> more<00:04:00.760> detail<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.209> i<00:04:01.269> think<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.629> was

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
and in more detail but i think it was

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.349 
and in more detail but i think it was
simple<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.769> guys<00:04:02.889> got<00:04:03.129> an<00:04:03.340> idea<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.000> how

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
simple and you guys got an idea of how

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.440 
simple and you guys got an idea of how
to<00:04:04.419> do<00:04:04.629> it<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.290> that's<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.620> impacts

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
to do it so that's it impacts

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.059 
to do it so that's it impacts
this<00:04:06.599> is<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.959> finished<00:04:07.170> look<00:04:07.440> obviously<00:04:07.980> I

way the braid does i should say the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.510 
way the braid does i should say the
scales<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.079> put<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> v<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.130> guys<00:04:23.280> you
