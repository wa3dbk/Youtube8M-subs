00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.060
 Leichtbau is a paraplegic 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.670
 technical skills specialists and 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.909
 experts in interaction with 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.400
 generalists develop the vision 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.400
 can and can implement technologies 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.539
 lightweight construction summit of the automotive industry 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.850
 2013 experts of the manufacturer user 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.579
 and suppliers all meet in 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.109
 wÃ¼rzburg on this exchange it comes 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.929
 the lightweight construction is one 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.780
 cross-sectional technology a lightweight 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:47.149
 not everything is invented yet 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.350
 so much potential what materials what 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.269
 governments 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.280
 I really believe in the beginning 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.800
 if new materials and new ones 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.120
 manufacturing techniques and new 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.530
 Calculation methods come then means 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 it's also natural to it 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.429
 to set accordingly that is one 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.530
 great difficulty in organisms 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.750
 have grown over years and over years 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.880
 geared to specific objectives 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.180
 Strategies were technologies and 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.250
 perspectives on the lightweight summit 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.380
 the automotive industry and the safe the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.560
 experts from chaos meet experts 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.890
 who seek dialogue and is new to it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.660
 to have 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.660
 specially designed for that easy 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.830
 positive and the campus 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.780
 I'll be a little bit the topic 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.760
 Lightweight construction and shopping 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.960
 exciting topic 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.030
 total vehicle development at the same time 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.910
 all materials steel aluminum 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.760
 magnesium carbon fiber we have here as 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.200
 posts the future style vehicle us 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.580
 see another lightweight construction here 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.440
 potential of 25 percent in steel 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.690
 but I saw that very much now 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.580
 mixed so is partially 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.900
 but also orient a lot 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.160
 Suppliers from the plastics industry 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.970
 come first or 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.640
 aircraft industry 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.090
 So I think that's a very good mix 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.399
 lectures are 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.880
 this I will have my limits on what 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.170
 feasible is what aggression I am 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.620
 I am positively surprised 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.260
 one learns many details from the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.340
 industry many new topics comes very much 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.569
 easy in talks pleased me 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.790
 me very personal contact too 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.040
 here that your requirement is two days 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.340
 show intensive exchange especially 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.620
 one for realization and implementation 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.660
 Innovative lightweight construction concepts are needed 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.180
 new forms of cooperation with 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.640
 Suppliers meet the trailblazers 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.920
 of lightweight construction in the automobile construction on the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.920
 lightweight construction summit 2014
