00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.790 
going to be episode 4.5 since you guys
were<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.090> rather<00:00:23.420> adamant<00:00:23.720> that<00:00:24.140> instead<00:00:24.739> of

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
were a rather adamant that instead of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.530 
were a rather adamant that instead of
putting<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.279> banelings<00:00:25.669> on<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.060> attack

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
putting the banelings on the attack

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.030 
putting the banelings on the attack
command<00:00:26.869> I<00:00:27.079> put<00:00:27.320> them<00:00:27.439> on<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.680> move<00:00:27.860> command

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
command I put them on the move command

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.010 
command I put them on the move command
so<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.460> am<00:00:28.759> back<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.210> I<00:00:29.300> am<00:00:29.390> going<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:29.720> put<00:00:29.900> them

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
so I am back and I am going to put them

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.380 
so I am back and I am going to put them
on<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:30.290> move<00:00:30.470> command<00:00:30.739> now<00:00:31.610> I<00:00:31.640> am<00:00:32.060> I<00:00:32.300> have

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
on the move command now I am I have

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.150 
on the move command now I am I have
duplicated<00:00:32.960> this<00:00:33.140> exactly<00:00:33.620> what<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:33.920> first

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
duplicated this exactly what the first

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.430 
duplicated this exactly what the first
test<00:00:34.430> of<00:00:34.550> last<00:00:34.790> time<00:00:34.970> with<00:00:35.090> 130<00:00:35.630> verse<00:00:35.870> 50<00:00:36.290> I

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
test of last time with 130 verse 50 I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.530 
test of last time with 130 verse 50 I
think<00:00:37.070> that's<00:00:37.220> probably<00:00:37.579> going<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:38.120> be<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.300> bit

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
think that's probably going to be a bit

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.760 
think that's probably going to be a bit
high<00:00:38.720> especially<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.380> way<00:00:39.470> you<00:00:39.500> guys<00:00:39.710> are

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
high especially the way you guys are

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.980 
high especially the way you guys are
talking<00:00:40.280> about<00:00:40.370> it<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.390> I'm<00:00:41.630> actually<00:00:41.780> going

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
talking about it so I'm actually going

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.540 
talking about it so I'm actually going
to<00:00:42.110> go<00:00:42.230> ahead<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.500> pull<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.680> couple<00:00:42.950> banelings

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
to go ahead and pull a couple banelings

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.060 
to go ahead and pull a couple banelings
out<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:44.120> this<00:00:45.110> one<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:46.600> 110<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:48.710> know<00:00:48.800> let's

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
out of this one and 110 you know let's

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.580 
out of this one and 110 you know let's
go<00:00:49.220> 100<00:00:49.550> oh<00:00:51.970> wow<00:00:52.970> man<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.600> busted<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.410> out

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
go 100 oh wow man I just busted that out

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.440 
go 100 oh wow man I just busted that out
so<00:00:55.010> we're<00:00:55.160> going<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.340> do<00:00:55.400> 100<00:00:55.880> on<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.240> move

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
so we're going to do 100 on the move

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.880 
so we're going to do 100 on the move
command<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.200> road<00:00:57.350> chills<00:00:57.560> will<00:00:57.680> be<00:00:57.800> on

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
command and the road chills will be on

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.220 
command and the road chills will be on
the<00:00:58.010> attack<00:00:58.280> man<00:00:58.640> I<00:00:58.870> can't<00:00:59.870> think<00:00:59.990> of<00:01:00.110> any

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
the attack man I can't think of any

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.260 
the attack man I can't think of any
better<00:01:00.290> way<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.620> do<00:01:00.800> this<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.790> that's<00:01:02.030> exactly

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
better way to do this so that's exactly

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.450 
better way to do this so that's exactly
what<00:01:02.630> we're<00:01:02.840> going<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.050> do<00:01:03.170> here<00:01:03.220> and<00:01:04.220> sleep<00:01:04.400> a

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
what we're going to do here and sleep a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.890 
what we're going to do here and sleep a
little<00:01:04.670> bit<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:04.939> room<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.299> i<00:01:05.509> can<00:01:05.630> click

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
little bit of room so that i can click

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.569 
little bit of room so that i can click
behind<00:01:06.229> them<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.920> let's<00:01:07.189> give<00:01:07.340> this<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.490> shot

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
behind them and let's give this a shot

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.100 
behind them and let's give this a shot
we'll<00:01:07.939> probably<00:01:08.150> try<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:08.479> two<00:01:08.960> or<00:01:09.079> three

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
we'll probably try this two or three

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.140 
we'll probably try this two or three
ways<00:01:09.530> if<00:01:09.799> we<00:01:09.920> need<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.280> but<00:01:10.579> let's<00:01:10.850> give<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.060> a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
ways if we need to but let's give it a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.120 
ways if we need to but let's give it a
shot<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.450> see<00:01:11.509> how<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:11.720> goes<00:01:11.869> alright<00:01:12.140> so

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
shot and see how this goes alright so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
shot and see how this goes alright so
test<00:01:13.939> number<00:01:14.030> one

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.240 

well<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.810> don't<00:01:24.230> see<00:01:24.440> how<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:24.770> really<00:01:25.130> was

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
well I don't see how this really was

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.460 
well I don't see how this really was
much<00:01:25.460> any<00:01:25.670> better<00:01:27.130> well<00:01:29.050> let's<00:01:30.050> look<00:01:30.200> at<00:01:30.350> it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
much any better well let's look at it

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.730 
much any better well let's look at it
this<00:01:30.500> way<00:01:30.880> almost<00:01:31.880> 30<00:01:32.630> yeah<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.050> guess<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.410> was

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
this way almost 30 yeah I guess it was

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.150 
this way almost 30 yeah I guess it was
better<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:35.090> guys<00:01:35.270> are<00:01:35.540> right<00:01:35.720> because<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:36.500> did

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
better you guys are right because I did

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.830 
better you guys are right because I did
a<00:01:37.190> hundred<00:01:37.400> wings<00:01:37.820> are<00:01:38.510> 100<00:01:39.020> banelings<00:01:39.890> and

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
a hundred wings are 100 banelings and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.010 
a hundred wings are 100 banelings and
minus<00:01:41.840> 30<00:01:42.110> would<00:01:42.260> have<00:01:42.380> been<00:01:42.470> 70<00:01:43.540> 71<00:01:44.540> were

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
minus 30 would have been 70 71 were

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.730 
minus 30 would have been 70 71 were
needed<00:01:45.410> instead<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.100> 87<00:01:46.460> 290<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.230> I<00:01:48.260> guess

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
needed instead of the 87 290 so I guess

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.010 
needed instead of the 87 290 so I guess
I<00:01:49.010> stand<00:01:49.490> corrected<00:01:49.640> there<00:01:50.150> all<00:01:50.720> right<00:01:50.870> we're

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
I stand corrected there all right we're

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.940 
I stand corrected there all right we're
going<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.200> go<00:01:51.350> ahead<00:01:51.410> and<00:01:51.500> give<00:01:51.680> them<00:01:51.830> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
going to go ahead and give them the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.540 
going to go ahead and give them the
armor<00:01:52.280> back<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.120> try<00:01:53.540> that<00:01:53.720> again

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
armor back and and try that again

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.070 
armor back and and try that again
okay<00:01:55.550> guys<00:01:55.790> test<00:01:56.270> number<00:01:56.540> two<00:01:56.720> we're<00:01:56.900> going<00:01:57.020> to

roaches<00:02:05.150> is<00:02:05.330> again<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.720> will<00:02:05.869> go<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.140> plus<00:02:06.440> 3

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
roaches is again we will go to plus 3

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.889 
roaches is again we will go to plus 3
armor<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.670> did<00:02:07.850> reduce<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.330> banelings<00:02:08.720> in

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
armor and I did reduce the banelings in

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.490 
armor and I did reduce the banelings in
95<00:02:09.380> instead<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.920> 100<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:11.720> should<00:02:12.080> be<00:02:12.110> more<00:02:12.440> than

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
95 instead of 100 it should be more than

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.650 
95 instead of 100 it should be more than
enough<00:02:12.650> based<00:02:13.160> off<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.610> last<00:02:13.820> test<00:02:14.150> here<00:02:14.420> to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
enough based off the last test here to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.390 
enough based off the last test here to
be<00:02:14.780> able<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.990> clear<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.290> out<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.280> we're

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
be able to clear this out and we're

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.530 
be able to clear this out and we're
going<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.550> put<00:02:16.640> them<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.030> attack<00:02:17.300> come<00:02:17.450> in

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
going to put them on the attack come in

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
going to put them on the attack come in
and<00:02:17.630> we're<00:02:17.720> going<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.870> put<00:02:17.930> these<00:02:18.110> guys<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.350> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and we're going to put these guys in the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.740 
and we're going to put these guys in the
move<00:02:18.709> come<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.459> let's<00:02:20.300> try<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.540> test

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
move come in so let's try this test

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.530 
move come in so let's try this test
number<00:02:21.020> two<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.730> I'll<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.150> move<00:02:23.360> them

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
number two and I'll just move them

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.750 
number two and I'll just move them
around<00:02:23.600> as<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.020> need<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.380> if<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> guess

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.430 

what<00:02:30.760> did<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.379> love<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.440> he<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.930> weird<00:02:35.200> just

attacked him alright so out of that 16
baneling<00:02:47.830> survived<00:02:48.959> which<00:02:49.959> would<00:02:50.260> be<00:02:50.440> at<00:02:51.430> 95

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.550 

85-79<00:02:57.420> was<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.569> not<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.780> number<00:02:59.019> i<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.409> had

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
85-79 was that not the number i just had

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.400 
85-79 was that not the number i just had
last<00:02:59.769> time<00:02:59.890> 279<00:03:00.670> again<00:03:01.030> God<00:03:01.599> my<00:03:01.780> math<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.200> like

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
last time 279 again God my math is like

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.690 
last time 279 again God my math is like
I<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.680> can't<00:03:02.950> remember<00:03:03.069> what<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> just<00:03:03.549> did

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
I just can't remember what I just did

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.720 
I just can't remember what I just did
but<00:03:04.420> yeah<00:03:04.720> okay<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.680> really<00:03:05.950> didn't<00:03:06.459> change

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
but yeah okay so it really didn't change

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.910 
but yeah okay so it really didn't change
anything<00:03:07.000> again<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.840> yes<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.500> move<00:03:08.680> command

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
anything again so yes the move command

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.910 
anything again so yes the move command
so<00:03:09.549> far<00:03:09.819> has<00:03:10.060> been<00:03:10.090> better<00:03:10.480> than<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.470> attack

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
so far has been better than the attack

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.360 
so far has been better than the attack
command<00:03:12.959> I'm<00:03:13.959> gonna<00:03:14.140> go<00:03:14.260> ahead<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:14.500> go<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.709> 90

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
command I'm gonna go ahead and go to 90

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.110 
command I'm gonna go ahead and go to 90
I<00:03:15.690> think<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:16.750> was<00:03:17.019> my<00:03:17.200> third<00:03:17.410> test<00:03:17.709> 90<00:03:18.280> @<00:03:18.489> +<00:03:18.670> 3

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
I think that was my third test 90 @ + 3

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.039 
I think that was my third test 90 @ + 3
armored<00:03:19.560> versus<00:03:20.560> uh<00:03:21.510> Alice's<00:03:22.510> try<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.750> miss

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
armored versus uh Alice's try to miss

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.229 
armored versus uh Alice's try to miss
out<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.290> up<00:03:23.410> okay<00:03:24.280> everybody<00:03:24.549> I<00:03:24.760> think<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.180> is

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
out it up okay everybody I think this is

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.300 
out it up okay everybody I think this is
how<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.540> had<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> setup<00:03:26.260> for<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.500> final<00:03:26.829> test<00:03:27.040> I

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
how I had a setup for the final test I

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.910 
how I had a setup for the final test I
have<00:03:27.430> 50<00:03:27.790> roaches<00:03:28.269> plus<00:03:28.569> 3<00:03:28.870> armor<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.410> speed

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
have 50 roaches plus 3 armor and speed

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.530 
have 50 roaches plus 3 armor and speed
versus<00:03:30.640> 90<00:03:31.209> banelings<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:33.060> last<00:03:34.060> time<00:03:34.329> there

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
versus 90 banelings so last time there

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.780 
versus 90 banelings so last time there
were<00:03:34.660> what<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.200> roaches<00:03:35.470> left<00:03:35.919> at<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.549> end<00:03:36.669> of

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
were what for roaches left at the end of

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.670 
were what for roaches left at the end of
this<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.299> we're<00:03:37.840> going<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.079> do<00:03:38.169> move<00:03:38.349> command

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
this so we're going to do move command

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.069 
this so we're going to do move command
instead<00:03:38.919> of<00:03:39.130> TAC<00:03:39.310> command<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.780> roaches

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
instead of TAC command and the roaches

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.140 
instead of TAC command and the roaches
will<00:03:41.260> attack<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.859> let's<00:03:42.400> see<00:03:42.549> if<00:03:42.639> this<00:03:42.819> really

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
will attack and let's see if this really

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.610 
will attack and let's see if this really
changes<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.660> if<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:43.989> i<00:03:44.169> am<00:03:44.290> going<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.500> be

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
changes that if it is i am going to be

banelings are victorious with nine left

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.520 
banelings are victorious with nine left
which<00:04:08.550> means<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.940> took<00:04:09.090> 81<00:04:09.690> banelings<00:04:10.200> instead

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
which means it took 81 banelings instead

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.340 
which means it took 81 banelings instead
of<00:04:10.620> 79<00:04:11.160> 4<00:04:11.850> plus<00:04:12.030> 2<00:04:12.060> armor<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.720> armor<00:04:13.080> really
