 and this is the presentation of the shoe 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:15.030
 adidas of rose 4.5 as always we start 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.740
 from the amortization that in this of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.439
 rose is entirely in the midsole 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.119
 made up of gays so it's the classic 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.650
 foam used throughout the line 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.600
 adidas basketball 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 we also have a crash band so a 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 additional bearing in the area 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.650
 rear under the balloon formed 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.770
 from to the ip ring or adiprene we have more 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 also the insole then the in sol made 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.760
 from polyurethane cushioning 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 additional that adds up to all that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.940
 which I mentioned earlier regarding i 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.610
 materials of the upper of the and go 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.170
 a lower mesh state a fabric 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 synthetic and some upper layers 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.550
 then over lesti synthetic material 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.039
 we also have the web sprint that I am 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.129
 these bands tp which are added together 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.220
 to lower states to give support to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.560
 in the topical points of the upper 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.060
 regarding the fit the shoe 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 dress to site 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 so compared to the pink 4 that the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.939
 previous shoe that dressed half 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.950
 plus size 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.810
 half a large size here we have one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 very snug and right fit 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.270
 compared to our size for how much 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.060
 regards the support is one of the points in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.479
 which this shoe and more cells is a 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.070
 as true as when you wear then 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.110
 very very enveloping as I said before 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.360
 and as for the part 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.689
 back we have this ankle a lot 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.299
 high but still leaves us free 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.060
 back area and then gives us a 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.610
 range and motion is also united in us 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.080
 rear very very good neither 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 the midsole we always have ours 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.759
 so classic sprintframe this 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.970
 tp plate that goes to the side 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.280
 front for this one of beautiful and fine 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.729
 to the back in which it constitutes 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.130
 this is the counter or the cap you need 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.560
 as we said in other videos 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.080
 to keep placed in the part 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.720
 rear heel and ankle i 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.540
 elements in which there is the wan roll 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.269
 foot as general features on 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.610
 this shoe being however created 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.489
 a shoe is very light for roses 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.290
 which keeps us very low towards the ground 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.290
 good cushioning but anyway 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.540
 minimal and technology that I did not say 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.079
 first more motion regarding the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.410
 sole then poor reflection then 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.930
 very good almost the same flexibility 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 to the rus 4 then the previous model 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.940
 what changes most is in the per 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.920
 in the upper which is different in how much 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.260
 concerns the aesthetics has been cut 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.260
 also of the material and therefore the state 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.359
 given more ventilation has been improved 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.310
 the send fit of which long talked about before 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.230
 so this stuffing that if in the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.940
 back of the shoe 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.350
