00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
see how close it gets using the same

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.350 
see how close it gets using the same
tools<00:00:41.469> that<00:00:41.829> they<00:00:42.070> used<00:00:42.550> essentially<00:00:43.030> and

what can i say i mean it's built to last

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.249 
what can i say i mean it's built to last
right<00:01:02.920> i<00:01:02.950> mean<00:01:03.100> these<00:01:03.370> things<00:01:03.670> have<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.750> great

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
right i mean these things have a great

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.179 
right i mean these things have a great

good<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:13.750> mean<00:01:13.990> I<00:01:14.049> don't<00:01:14.079> think<00:01:14.350> you're<00:01:14.439> going

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
good I mean I don't think you're going

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.929 
good I mean I don't think you're going
to<00:01:14.619> get<00:01:14.710> close<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:14.979> 20<00:01:15.369> gigs<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:16.079> writing<00:01:17.079> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to get close to 20 gigs of writing and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.270 
to get close to 20 gigs of writing and
there<00:01:18.939> are<00:01:19.299> some<00:01:19.929> more<00:01:20.109> power<00:01:20.439> considerations

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
there are some more power considerations

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.929 
there are some more power considerations
that<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:21.579> might<00:01:21.789> want<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:23.310> obviously<00:01:24.310> being

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
that you might want and obviously being

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.139 
that you might want and obviously being
a<00:01:25.119> low<00:01:25.270> noise<00:01:25.479> low<00:01:26.409> power<00:01:26.679> this<00:01:27.249> is<00:01:27.429> great<00:01:27.880> for

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
a low noise low power this is great for

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.449 
a low noise low power this is great for
upgrading<00:01:28.899> your<00:01:28.929> existing<00:01:29.529> notebook<00:01:30.310> or

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
upgrading your existing notebook or

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.160 
upgrading your existing notebook or
macbook<00:01:30.880> or<00:01:31.029> whatever<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.719> is<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:31.959> you<00:01:32.020> might

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
macbook or whatever it is that you might

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.379 
macbook or whatever it is that you might
have<00:01:32.200> that's<00:01:32.560> using<00:01:32.859> the<00:01:32.889> older<00:01:33.520> hard<00:01:34.179> drive

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
have that's using the older hard drive

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.599 
have that's using the older hard drive
technology<00:01:35.079> this<00:01:35.529> is<00:01:35.740> definitely<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.520> to

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
technology this is definitely going to

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.209 
technology this is definitely going to
be<00:01:36.729> much<00:01:36.969> faster<00:01:37.299> now<00:01:37.799> looking<00:01:38.799> at<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.009> drive

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
be much faster now looking at the drive

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.639 
be much faster now looking at the drive
itself<00:01:39.429> we're<00:01:40.209> looking<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.509> at<00:01:40.899> basically<00:01:41.529> a

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
itself we're looking here at basically a

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.219 
itself we're looking here at basically a
standard<00:01:42.159> size<00:01:42.639> SSD<00:01:43.420> Drive<00:01:43.719> so<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.109> will<00:01:44.200> fit

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
standard size SSD Drive so it will fit

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.989 
standard size SSD Drive so it will fit
nicely<00:01:44.439> in<00:01:44.920> your<00:01:45.039> notebook<00:01:45.459> if<00:01:45.639> that's<00:01:45.819> what

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
nicely in your notebook if that's what

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.130 
doing the tests for write and read with
different<00:02:15.459> file<00:02:15.700> sizes<00:02:16.000> different<00:02:16.569> transfer

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
different file sizes different transfer

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.199 
different file sizes different transfer
rates<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.650> course<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.730> see<00:02:18.910> here

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
rates of course and you can see here

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.110 
rates of course and you can see here
that<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.510> reaches<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.110> peaks<00:02:20.349> at<00:02:20.700> 550<00:02:21.700> roughly

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that it reaches and peaks at 550 roughly

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.370 
that it reaches and peaks at 550 roughly
on<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.390> read<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.540> 490<00:02:25.540> so

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
on the read and on the right 490 so

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.470 
on the read and on the right 490 so
just<00:02:26.590> about<00:02:26.860> what<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.640> being<00:02:27.850> advertised

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
just about what is being advertised

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.750 
just about what is being advertised
there<00:02:28.810> but<00:02:29.050> not<00:02:29.200> quite<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:30.070> right<00:02:30.490> and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
there but not quite on the right and

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.900 
there but not quite on the right and
also<00:02:31.300> here<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.950> d<00:02:33.100> benchmark<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
also here on the d benchmark the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.290 
also here on the d benchmark the
sequential<00:02:34.450> read<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.620> see<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.890> 4k<00:02:36.370> read

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
sequential read you can see the 4k read

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.810 
sequential read you can see the 4k read
and<00:02:37.480> write<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:37.960> well<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.860> axis<00:02:39.340> x<00:02:39.610> which

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
and write as well and the axis x which

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.120 
and write as well and the axis x which
are<00:02:40.000> super<00:02:40.240> fast<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.930> course<00:02:41.230> now<00:02:41.890> on<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
are super fast of course now on the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.880 
are super fast of course now on the
crystal<00:02:42.520> disk<00:02:42.850> mark<00:02:43.570> benchmarks<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.590> can<00:02:44.740> see

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
crystal disk mark benchmarks you can see

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.060 
crystal disk mark benchmarks you can see
here<00:02:45.100> as<00:02:45.190> well<00:02:45.400> consistent<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:47.200> these<00:02:47.680> scores

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
here as well consistent on these scores

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.090 
here as well consistent on these scores
actually<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:48.790> I'm<00:02:48.910> seeing<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.960> pattern<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.560> on

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
actually so I'm seeing a pattern and on

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.290 
actually so I'm seeing a pattern and on
the<00:02:51.310> 8's<00:02:51.550> 64<00:02:52.590> read<00:02:53.590> test<00:02:54.250> suite<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.760> definitely

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
the 8's 64 read test suite it definitely

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.390 
the 8's 64 read test suite it definitely
reached<00:02:57.450> 537<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.230> random<00:02:59.620> read<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.130> it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
reached 537 on the random read so it

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.520 
reached 537 on the random read so it
actually<00:03:01.000> got<00:03:01.330> pretty<00:03:01.390> high<00:03:02.020> there<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.410> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
actually got pretty high there on the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.610 
actually got pretty high there on the
random<00:03:02.950> read<00:03:03.160> considerably<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.530> definitely<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
random read considerably so definitely a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.120 
random read considerably so definitely a
fast<00:03:05.950> drive<00:03:06.280> when<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:06.970> came<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:08.710> reading

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
fast drive when it came to the reading

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.580 
fast drive when it came to the reading
portion<00:03:09.430> okay<00:03:10.210> on<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.570> right<00:03:10.600> portion<00:03:11.230> of

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
portion okay on the right portion of

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.010 
portion okay on the right portion of
course<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.130> not<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:12.850> fast<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.660> then<00:03:13.900> again

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
course it's not as fast but then again

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.980 
course it's not as fast but then again
that's<00:03:14.170> what<00:03:14.590> they<00:03:14.710> did<00:03:14.770> advertised<00:03:15.460> now<00:03:16.090> here

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
that's what they did advertised now here

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that's what they did advertised now here
again<00:03:17.410> doing<00:03:18.190> some<00:03:18.400> linear<00:03:19.080> write<00:03:20.080> tests<00:03:20.890> you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
again doing some linear write tests you

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.430 
again doing some linear write tests you
can<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:21.400> here<00:03:21.790> how<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.450> performs<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
can see here how it performs and on the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.950 
can see here how it performs and on the
random<00:03:24.010> write<00:03:24.550> tests<00:03:25.030> again<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.600> get<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.780> good

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
random write tests again you get a good

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.070 
random write tests again you get a good
idea<00:03:26.350> which<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:26.980> more<00:03:27.450> realistic<00:03:28.450> when<00:03:28.930> we're

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
idea which is more realistic when we're

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.570 
idea which is more realistic when we're
talking<00:03:29.200> about<00:03:29.440> random<00:03:29.650> writes<00:03:30.190> right

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
talking about random writes right

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.400 
talking about random writes right
because<00:03:30.880> things<00:03:31.120> are<00:03:31.270> not<00:03:31.360> done<00:03:31.420> linear<00:03:32.020> when

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
because things are not done linear when

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.980 
because things are not done linear when
it<00:03:32.530> writes<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.850> dr<00:03:34.120> now<00:03:34.390> on<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
it writes to the to the dr now on the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.170 
it writes to the to the dr now on the
operations<00:03:35.800> per<00:03:36.070> second<00:03:36.520> you're<00:03:36.880> looking

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
operations per second you're looking

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.500 
operations per second you're looking
here<00:03:37.600> on<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.200> read<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.310> write<00:03:39.550> definitely

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
here on the read and write definitely

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.990 
here on the read and write definitely
close<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.890> advertised<00:03:42.430> amounts<00:03:42.910> that

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
close to the advertised amounts that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.720 
close to the advertised amounts that
they<00:03:43.150> said<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.780> not<00:03:44.410> bad<00:03:44.620> at<00:03:44.650> all<00:03:44.890> there<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.340> on

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
they said so not bad at all there and on

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
they said so not bad at all there and on
this<00:03:45.970> bench<00:03:46.360> which<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.140> real<00:03:47.440> world<00:03:47.890> copy

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
this bench which is a real world copy

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.910 
c drive to the ocz vertex 3 2 point 0
and<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:54.910> can<00:03:55.090> see<00:03:55.300> there<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:56.380> definitely

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
and you can see there that it definitely

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.850 
and you can see there that it definitely
performs<00:03:57.730> really<00:03:58.000> fast<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.860> opposite

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
performs really fast on that opposite

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.910 
performs really fast on that opposite
sending<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.550> from<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:01.240> SSD<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.990> my<00:04:02.170> C<00:04:02.380> Drive<00:04:02.410> it

sending it from the SSD to my C Drive it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.550 
sending it from the SSD to my C Drive it
took<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.910> little<00:04:04.030> bit<00:04:04.150> longer<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.780> there<00:04:05.320> are

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
took a little bit longer and there are

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.740 
took a little bit longer and there are
the<00:04:05.740> transfer<00:04:06.250> rates<00:04:06.459> for<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.600> that

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the transfer rates for that so that

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.930 
the transfer rates for that so that
gives<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> good<00:04:08.200> idea<00:04:08.260> on<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.070> real<00:04:09.370> world

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.470 
i'll put the pricing below if you're
interested<00:04:16.510> it's<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.200> great<00:04:18.480> substitution

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
interested it's a great substitution

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.570
