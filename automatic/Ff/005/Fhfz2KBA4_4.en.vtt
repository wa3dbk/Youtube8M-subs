this<00:07:01.360> tree<00:07:01.630> right<00:07:01.840> here<00:07:04.170> trying<00:07:05.170> real<00:07:05.440> hard<00:07:05.470> to

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
this tree right here trying real hard to

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.060 
this tree right here trying real hard to
get<00:07:05.920> to<00:07:06.070> that<00:07:06.100> other<00:07:06.370> limb<00:07:06.610> you<00:07:07.090> can<00:07:07.270> see<00:07:08.070> wants

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
get to that other limb you can see wants

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.860 
get to that other limb you can see wants
to<00:07:09.160> move<00:07:09.310> on<00:07:09.550> I<00:07:12.090> think<00:07:13.090> she<00:07:13.300> could<00:07:13.450> make<00:07:13.720> it

tree to the next she's moving away from

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:26.880 
tree to the next she's moving away from
the<00:07:19.660> scene<00:07:20.200> of<00:07:20.230> the<00:07:20.380> accident<00:07:20.470> I<00:07:25.560> think<00:07:26.560> she's
