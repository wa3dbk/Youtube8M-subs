the<00:00:24.420> reason<00:00:24.630> I'm<00:00:24.720> making<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.930> video<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.500> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the reason I'm making this video now is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.349 
the reason I'm making this video now is
because<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.189> double<00:00:26.460> experienced<00:00:26.820> weekend<00:00:27.210> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
because on double experienced weekend I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.269 
because on double experienced weekend I
believe<00:00:27.599> rap<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.140> always<00:00:28.500> will<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.859> double<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
believe rap as always will be double the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.900 
believe rap as always will be double the
percentage<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.510> RAF<00:00:31.170> will<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.619> 20%<00:00:32.009> bonus<00:00:32.489> on

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
percentage so RAF will be 20% bonus on

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.760 
percentage so RAF will be 20% bonus on
double<00:00:33.210> experienced<00:00:33.570> weekend<00:00:33.930> rather<00:00:34.500> than

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
double experienced weekend rather than

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.380 
double experienced weekend rather than
just<00:00:34.950> 10%<00:00:35.160> cuz<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.670> does<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.000> doubled

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
