00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 ah 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.640
 let's start with the press conference 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.440
 of trainer of the celta of vigo luis 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.110
 enrique and then the president will speak 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.000
 as you already know when you want questions 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.830
 for louis the first thing beyond the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 party that I gouge what has been 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.760
 lived at the end with the energy that has 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.599
 released that boat is not very well known 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.599
 what is and smoke of what 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.150
 if it has not been something ugly for everyone and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.340
 harmful even for 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.520
 for the protagonists for the public 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.560
 for all an isolated thing that tarnishes 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.780
 no case no hobby of any 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.280
 of no equipment but these events 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.900
 where you can go as many people 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.510
 suddenly he comes to these surprises 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.550
 unpleasant good in the end has not 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.870
 past nothing nothing serious 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.610
 and the match has been able to continue 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.979
 the years that you have as a technician like 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.460
 footballer had lived something similar not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 the version and we all want to create 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.549
 a flare and that was going to be just 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.009
 withdraw it but we have already seen coming to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.290
 joel with red eyes and with 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.399
 feeling that he was drowning and we already 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 we have realized that it was not a flare 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.750
 that it was something more dangerous then 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 the police told us they were a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.020
 tear gas species 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.260
 well I do not know I do not see the intention either 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.440
 surely your reasons will have but 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.360
 we will escape to all and be 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.790
 normal and logical reasons and things that 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.320
 they should not happen but we are subject 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.890
 always so that anyone can 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.270
 do something weird quickly louis 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 you told them the soccer players that 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.750
 withdraw to asia the turn of wardrobe 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.400
 logical in anticipation of what might be 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.200
 because you do not know that case at that time 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.250
 what can what can bring good 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.350
 we have seen that it stung a lot and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.970
 quickly there has been no need to say 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 nothing at all for all referees 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.350
 the players the audience even 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.370
 and an unpleasant experience but there 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.680
 stays 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.400
 and you have to talk about football too 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.610
 because I would like very important 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.620
 important victory for you yes very 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.280
 important very important to us 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
 we are in a good dynamic today if 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.950
 we talk about football and deserts 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.750
 I think the villarreal has deserved more 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.870
 that we without any doubt the second 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.610
 part had the party 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.819
 and controlled making them a lot of danger 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.209
 we have not been able to hurt them they have not 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.200
 used the spaces between lines and it 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.590
 they have earned the victory 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.330
 but this wonderful sport has 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.489
 these things and we have taken advantage of 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290
 a lack that in addition as numerous 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.480
 small players we have scored 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.370
 and from then on we wanted to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.329
 the possibility of winning and we have had 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.379
 that even scoring a second goal is 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.000
 It is obvious that this is not the way 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.409
 we seek to achieve 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.410
 salvation but I also tell you to be 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.950
 one gladly does not itch from time to time 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.400
 win an unjustified because 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.400
 it also comes well 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.130
 something else one more question if there is here 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740
 after that team 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.570
 good to emphasize the effectiveness because 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.650
 practically on average we have 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.580
 I made a goal and the delivery to my team was 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.980
 can you say 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.090
 that we play better or worse almost always in 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.740
 function of what the other rival does and 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.020
 of what the rival and the rival propose 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.370
 especially the second part in some 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.420
 phases of the first there has been more 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.540
 equality but especially the second 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.620
 part has been at a higher level it 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.110
 He deserved to see the game as I said 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.420
 before yes but my team has followed 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.040
 having faith we have tried to create 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.740
 problems in things that are more 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.670
 strong them but but for something they go 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.500
 fifth in the classification and predicted very 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.020
 good results and continues at this level 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.130
 that is how is the whole season they think 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.120
 that has been noticed in the casualties of 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.010
 villarreal 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.129
 that can be answered better by your 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.220
 coach I dedicate myself to value my 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.010
 template and 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.120
 and as we had casualties never 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.230
 we talk about players who are not 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.150
 we talk about the ones that are the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.260
 protagonists the important ones and a 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.420
 football team is that one team 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.880
 they can not always play for sanctions 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.310
 for injuries with which the important 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.330
 they are always the ones that are 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.330
 very well thank you thank you
