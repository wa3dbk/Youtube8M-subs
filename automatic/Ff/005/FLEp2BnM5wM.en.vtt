distinctive looking vehicles in the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.340 
distinctive looking vehicles in the
competition<00:00:14.809> tell<00:00:15.809> me<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> little<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.170> about

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
competition tell me a little bit about

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.740 
competition tell me a little bit about
it<00:00:16.500> sure<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.279> apt<00:00:17.490> era<00:00:17.730> tu<00:00:17.910> e<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.720> e

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it sure this is the apt era tu e to e

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.900 
it sure this is the apt era tu e to e
stands<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:19.680> passenger<00:00:20.220> electric<00:00:20.760> so

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
stands for two passenger electric so

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970 
stands for two passenger electric so
it's<00:00:21.029> an<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.270> electric<00:00:21.750> drivetrain<00:00:22.619> system

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
it's an all electric drivetrain system

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.429 
it's an all electric drivetrain system
so<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> plug-in<00:00:24.109> battery<00:00:25.109> electric

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
so it's a plug-in battery electric

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.929 
so it's a plug-in battery electric
vehicle<00:00:25.800> I've<00:00:26.010> always<00:00:26.250> wondered<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
vehicle I've always wondered about the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.060 
vehicle I've always wondered about the
handling<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.840> apt<00:00:27.960> era<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.710> its

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
handling of the apt era and its

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.299 
handling of the apt era and its
suspension<00:00:29.490> yep<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.660> handling<00:00:31.309> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
suspension yep how is the handling it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.430 
suspension yep how is the handling it
just<00:00:33.149> by<00:00:33.239> looking<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> vehicle<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.200> looks

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
just by looking at the vehicle it looks

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
just by looking at the vehicle it looks
like<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.829> rigid<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.670> our<00:00:35.790> team<00:00:36.000> has

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
like it would be rigid what our team has

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.790 
like it would be rigid what our team has
done<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.570> their<00:00:36.930> objective<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> try<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
done is their objective is to try and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
done is their objective is to try and
make<00:00:38.129> regardless<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> architecture<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
make regardless of the architecture the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.119 
make regardless of the architecture the
vehicle<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> make<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> handling<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
vehicle to make the handling and the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.830 
vehicle to make the handling and the
feeling<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.700> driving<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.059> nap<00:00:42.180> Tara<00:00:42.390> no
