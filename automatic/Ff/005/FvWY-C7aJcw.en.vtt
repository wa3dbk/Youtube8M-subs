00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello to everyone at Italease fleeing where 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.639
 emigrate australia which city ​​to choose 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.219
 I state that I live in melbourne I know 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 a bit similar for having worked there not 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 lived only worked 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.260
 I want to clarify I also visited though 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.039
 I've never visited on the brisbane airline 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.820
 tasmania etc. and so on 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.840
 so my vision is relatively 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.009
 reduced but obviously living here 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.960
 talking to other people who have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 lived in other cities there was etcetera 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 I can share what I think 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
 are the important things to take in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.379
 consideration the main thing 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 I think that Australian cities do 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.120
 they look a lot more like each other 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.829
 compared to the differences they can 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.410
 being there are all islands inside 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.949
 of Australia with huge distances between 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.320
 of them 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.680
 so once he starts living in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.559
 a city ​​basically alive and working 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.510
 on that island compared to living and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.850
 work in the austral which is not a 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.030
 a somewhat different concept so for example 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.810
 I live and work in melbourne 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.670
 I have not visited it for years now 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.770
 in other cities as I said before 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.280
 I had no opportunity to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.729
 revisit then realize that when 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.150
 choose the city ​​actually 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.420
 you will choose a really precise place 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.570
 where cities are built so 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 similar there is the sense month right-handed then 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.430
 the sit in where all the are 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.790
 skyscrapers and you the offices and many 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.890
 companies that operate precisely in the sense 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.710
 suite of business if then there is a behemoth 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.200
 of suburbs that extend 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.939
 just for kilometers and kilometers 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.330
 these cities are very extensive 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.880
 especially shit 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.260
 because there are 4 and a half million 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.500
 People pretty much all live 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.930
 in a house on their own a plan 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.110
 therefore precisely the dispersion of the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.180
 city is huge so this applies to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.480
 all cities more or less for all 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.090
 city ​​then realize that I repeat 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.430
 similar things are much greater 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.170
 compared to the differences what are the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.190
 the difference is the difference 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.470
 the main climate climate of 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.960
 melbourne is very different to seed 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.010
 baseball then it comes to 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.440
 choose the climate that's right for you and that 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.620
 then you will find a very hot climate 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.100
 that those who do not like the warm climate 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.650
 maybe you will do a lot of work or 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.570
 with you will find the climate of my book is 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.720
 very variable so if you do n't like it 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.800
 which skill you are to meet 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.600
 problems 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.640
 the other important issue is precisely the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.680
 economic question in the sense of 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.200
 from the point of view of the GDP 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.450
 job opportunities melbourne e 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.100
 sydney 4 and a half million people 4 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.600
 millions are almost economies 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.510
 self-sufficient in a sense there 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.560
 are job opportunities in all 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.090
 fields more or less depending on the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.410
 economic situation while 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.360
 the smaller electricity they offer 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.630
 has ris 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.230
 I don't speak Italian anymore 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.870
 fatigue due to boom and bust then 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.470
 in the bubbles for example we talk about 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.380
 now it's going great because it's there 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.410
 the mining sector that is 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.260
 therefore dragging the economy is fine 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:51.640
 low unemployment many opportunities 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.560
 work related to the sector 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.040
 when if and when this sector 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:04.220
 mining will find difficulties and maybe 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.500
 it will fall down maybe it will no longer be attractive 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.850
 as it is now so something to be 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.890
 keep in mind why one 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.450
 city ​​eg smaller not me 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.380
 I remember exactly how many people 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.540
 they live 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.560
 if I'm not mistaken a million and a half e 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.750
 so if a single sector is closely linked 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.440
 will suffer more if when this sector 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.350
 remember the speech is relatively 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.080
 not so much for big band though it is 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.050
 also a little bit towed 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.390
 not as much from the mining sector ed 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.820
 It is again a bit smaller 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.970
 there is more tourism there are others 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.800
 industries closer to prysmian than that 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.640
 they also drag it the speech is 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.710
 a bit different 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:52.000
 for what concerns adelaide instead 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.000
 much more quiet speed than 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.990
 basically it relies heavily on 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.310
 more perhaps to the sector than now 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.470
 of agriculture, etc. etc. 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.140
 but I repeat a calmer life a 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.030
 million people around 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.370
 if you like tranquility then 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.720
 adelaide is right for you 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.430
 so this to tell you that in my opinion 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.340
 all Australian cities are 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.430
 advisable because they are always all 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.140
 at the top of the list of those with the 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.380
 better quality of life 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.540
 then it is a question of seeing what they are 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.010
 those that are right for you 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.390
 and here it depends very much on what then 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.639
 from the importance you then place on 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.189
 various on various aspects of quality 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.360
 so i like melman to someone else 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.759
 I like and maybe the best climate 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.240
 best trip can pleasure signs to 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:54.060
 example to someone else who prefers 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:56.009
 more job opportunities more 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.180
 dynamics 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:03.810
 maybe he can be at destination from 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:07.860
 recommend this point to make a 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.490
 summary of the cities to emigrate to 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.830
 Australia 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:16.710
 then obviously the job issue is 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:20.099
 often the one that dictates the choice though 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.490
 I can assure you that I think all of them 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.650
 Australian cities can and do offer 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.810
 excellent quality of life 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.909
 it is then a question of whether the quality 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:35.819
 of Australian life can satisfy 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:39.389
 then the Italians because so many Italians 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:42.419
 maybe they come here they understand better 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.789
 what does it mean to live at the Australian e 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:48.060
 they realize that it is not exactly 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:49.800
 the lifestyle that suits them in 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.849
 see you soon see you on 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.849
 italy escape hello hello
