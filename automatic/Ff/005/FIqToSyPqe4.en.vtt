the third one being final stand now by
no<00:01:30.780> means<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> final<00:01:32.310> stand<00:01:32.579> one

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
no means to I think the final stand one

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
no means to I think the final stand one
would<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> last<00:01:33.810> expansion<00:01:34.409> pack<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
would be the last expansion pack this

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.640 
would be the last expansion pack this
early<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.689> seems<00:01:36.960> erratic<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
early because it just seems erratic to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.700 
early because it just seems erratic to
have<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.009> system<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:40.170> know<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
have that system as we know that for the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
have that system as we know that for the
three<00:01:40.860> had<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> expansion<00:01:41.700> packs<00:01:41.850> pre-made

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
three had the expansion packs pre-made

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.170 
three had the expansion packs pre-made
before<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.590> game<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.250> released<00:01:44.430> so

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
before the game was even released so

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
before the game was even released so
they're<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> same<00:01:46.200> lines<00:01:46.409> on

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
they're going with the same lines on

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.100 
they're going with the same lines on
battlefield<00:01:47.130> 4<00:01:47.399> what's<00:01:47.729> interesting<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
battlefield 4 what's interesting is the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
battlefield 4 what's interesting is the
middle<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.680> sec<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.369> dragon's<00:01:50.970> teeth<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.659> i

will<00:01:52.590> feel<00:01:53.040> free<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> speculate<00:01:53.850> at<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
will feel free to speculate at this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.469 
will feel free to speculate at this
point<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> i'm<00:01:55.079> sure<00:01:55.560> i'm<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.479> this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
point and i'm sure i'm going to this

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.249 
point and i'm sure i'm going to this
could<00:01:57.930> well<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.520> sort<00:01:59.520> after<00:02:00.049> dragon<00:02:01.049> or

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
could well be the sort after dragon or
