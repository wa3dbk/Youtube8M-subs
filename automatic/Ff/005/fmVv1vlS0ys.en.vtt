00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.779
 if it is that I feel very much because of 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:09.280
 that people are desperate with the 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.260
 destroyed cars and good does not know by 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.820
 where to start 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.920
 many times we advise you to go to 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.920
 mechanical first because many bring the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.400
 car in tow and good the first step to 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.320
 give is that the engine and the car work and 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.240
 then bring it to a washing station 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.580
 that what we really do 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.890
 is the one you could say the aesthetics of 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.810
 car 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.489
 in the case that you have water in the engine 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.920
 for example he did that where it's done in the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.190
 workshop is doing that is done in the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.220
 workshop is done in the workshop because 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 we more than alarms computers do not 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.410
 we play 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.620
 we do all kinds of already tell you what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.420
 is the aesthetics of the car polarized all 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.870
 that kind of thing but not the part 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 mechanical and in this case by the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.420
 flood there were engine problems 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.110
 computer problems and good everything 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.670
 that people do not know anyway 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.590
 the drying they are currently doing 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.180
 the wash they are currently doing 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.160
 was that of morals another that they had to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.920
 take out the whole car of course 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.979
 three or four times more time we had 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.900
 that reinforce the number of employees and 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.350
 well then there's the other issue of the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350
 speculation 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.950
 we try to charge the minimum rate and the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.960
 time also that you work while 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.840
 that customers have told us that they are coming 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.980
 that in other places they have quintupled the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.860
 Cost figure when it currently leaves 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.140
 wash the car with tossal and before and 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.440
 full work because it is not so much 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.660
 on the outside if you do not load carpets 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.490
 before the classic washing that good there 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.700
 a variety of washes that follows 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.110
 goes up to 150 pesos but the classic wash 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.040
 what does the whole world do 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.140
 Generally it is worth 50 pesos in this case 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.729
 they are charging up to 700 from 600 to 700 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.430
 that's why we wanted 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.280
 charge nothing but the excess of time 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.620
 that takes us and we are charging 200 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.530
 weights that is normal for a 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.670
 merchant and leaves him his profit and not 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.849
 speculate with the situation 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.240
 The upholstery sews the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.520
 Carpets are trying to leave the car dry 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.370
 everything that can hurt 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.040
 because those are parts that do not have 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.080
 recovery if they do not dry now you 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.120
 he said is that they took more staff to 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.710
 try to satisfy the animal yes yes 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.100
 we had to take a lot more staff 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.660
 because we even stay longer 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.140
 we close at 7 we are talking eight and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.540
 half nine because we did not end up with and 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.970
 not only that cars also bring us 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.820
 Upholstered of all kinds that we do not 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.200
 and many times because they are clients, 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.900
 we can say that no 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.690
 for example office armchairs armchairs 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.220
 of unarmed cars is not a case 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.220
 totally rare atypical
