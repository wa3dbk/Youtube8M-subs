00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
length now I'm gonna move over a little

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580 
length now I'm gonna move over a little
bit<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> opposite<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> form

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
bit to the opposite side and form

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.260 
bit to the opposite side and form
another<00:00:47.010> downward<00:00:47.370> letter<00:00:47.700> V<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.090> together

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
another downward letter V so together

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.290 
another downward letter V so together
they<00:00:48.719> form<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> letter<00:00:49.500> M<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
they form the letter M so I'm going to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
they form the letter M so I'm going to
be<00:00:51.420> repeating<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.989> process<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.829> this

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
be repeating this process or this

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.700 
be repeating this process or this
pattern<00:00:53.640> several<00:00:54.180> times<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.440> nail

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
pattern several times going down my nail

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.220 
pattern several times going down my nail
and<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.030> using<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.570> striper<00:00:58.050> brush

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and for this I'm using a striper brush

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.880 
and for this I'm using a striper brush
in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.100> size<00:00:59.399> short<00:01:00.359> I'll<00:01:00.750> remember<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.680> list

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.790 

in<00:01:29.310> between<00:01:29.730> my<00:01:29.850> zigzag<00:01:30.300> black<00:01:30.870> pattern<00:01:31.260> I'm

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
in between my zigzag black pattern I'm

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.840 
in between my zigzag black pattern I'm
now<00:01:32.160> applying<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:33.410> silver<00:01:34.410> glitter<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:35.130> I'm

now applying a silver glitter and I'm

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.430 
now applying a silver glitter and I'm
just<00:01:36.060> filling<00:01:36.300> in<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:36.570> areas<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:36.930> between

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
just filling in the areas in between

just filling in the areas in between
like<00:01:37.620> following<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.370> same<00:01:38.580> pattern<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.510> just

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
like following the same pattern but just

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.260 
like following the same pattern but just
in<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> different<00:01:39.930> color<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:41.340> using<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
in a different color and I'm using the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.720 
in a different color and I'm using the
acrylic<00:01:42.900> glitter<00:01:43.290> paint<00:01:43.650> but<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.580> also

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
acrylic glitter paint but you can also

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.240 
acrylic glitter paint but you can also
use<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> nail<00:01:45.480> art<00:01:45.660> polish<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.830> paints

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
use a nail art polish for these paints

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.820 
use a nail art polish for these paints
I'm<00:01:47.370> using<00:01:47.610> they<00:01:47.910> go<00:01:48.120> on<00:01:48.360> opaque<00:01:49.050> but<00:01:49.590> once

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
I'm using they go on opaque but once

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.850 
I'm using they go on opaque but once
they<00:01:50.100> dry<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:51.120> dry<00:01:51.330> glittery<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.620> color

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they dry they dry glittery and the color

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.040 
they dry they dry glittery and the color
you<00:01:52.950> chose<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.030> I'm<00:01:54.120> just<00:01:54.330> basically<00:01:54.600> going

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
you chose so I'm just basically going

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.530 
you chose so I'm just basically going
downward<00:01:55.560> filling<00:01:55.980> in<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.970> zigzagging

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
downward filling in or just zigzagging

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.380 
downward filling in or just zigzagging
the<00:01:58.380> bottom<00:01:58.880> black<00:01:59.880> pattern<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.970> your<00:02:03.210> last

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the bottom black pattern and your last

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
the bottom black pattern and your last
step<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.720> just<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.990> apply<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.260> topcoat<00:02:04.650> of<00:02:04.890> your

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
step is just to apply a topcoat of your

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.740 
step is just to apply a topcoat of your
choice<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.730> do<00:02:06.000> want<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.330> allow<00:02:06.690> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
choice you do want to allow the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.990 
choice you do want to allow the
background<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.620> completely<00:02:08.130> dry<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.760> that<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
background to completely dry so that the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.180 
background to completely dry so that the
colors<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:09.540> smear<00:02:09.869> into<00:02:10.140> each<00:02:10.260> other<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
colors don't smear into each other so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.610 
colors don't smear into each other so
now<00:02:11.370> let's<00:02:11.550> move<00:02:11.700> over<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:12.090> working<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.140> 3d

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
now let's move over to working on the 3d

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.940 
now let's move over to working on the 3d
bow<00:02:13.860> design<00:02:14.840> for<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.960> 3d<00:02:16.260> poem<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.860> be

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
bow design for the 3d poem going to be

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.920 
bow design for the 3d poem going to be

the liquid monomer and next I'm going to
be<00:02:27.540> forming<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.230> medium<00:02:28.710> sized<00:02:29.040> pearl<00:02:29.630> I'm

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
be forming a medium sized pearl I'm

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.510 
be forming a medium sized pearl I'm
gonna<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:31.020> placing<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> pearl<00:02:31.740> over<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.220> side

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
gonna be placing the pearl over the side

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.280 
gonna be placing the pearl over the side
of<00:02:32.730> my<00:02:32.850> finger<00:02:32.910> now<00:02:33.390> because<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.810> want<00:02:33.990> my<00:02:34.080> bowl

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
of my finger now because I want my bowl

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
of my finger now because I want my bowl
to<00:02:34.470> be<00:02:34.560> coming<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:34.950> sideways<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:36.330> I'm

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420

center outwards and I'm gonna place my

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.270 
center outwards and I'm gonna place my
brush<00:02:41.760> at<00:02:41.970> an<00:02:42.150> angle<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.350> fan<00:02:43.739> out<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
brush at an angle and just fan out the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.330 
brush at an angle and just fan out the
corners<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:45.709> bow<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.250> gonna

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
corners of my bow and this is just gonna

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.510 
corners of my bow and this is just gonna
be<00:02:47.459> one<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.940> sides<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.450> my<00:02:48.600> bowl<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.520> I'm

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
be one of the sides of my bowl and I'm

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.699 
be one of the sides of my bowl and I'm
just<00:02:50.670> gonna<00:02:50.790> continue<00:02:51.560> flattening<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
just gonna continue flattening out the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.290 
just gonna continue flattening out the
sides<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.370> little<00:02:53.400> bit<00:02:53.730> but<00:02:53.880> not<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> outer

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
sides a little bit but not the outer

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.570 
sides a little bit but not the outer
corner<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:54.989> I'm<00:02:55.080> just<00:02:55.200> gonna<00:02:55.320> poke<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.370> outer

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
corner so I'm just gonna poke the outer

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.710 
corner so I'm just gonna poke the outer
corners<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> little<00:02:57.390> bit<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.880> just<00:02:59.880> basically

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
corners a little bit and just basically

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.420 
corners a little bit and just basically
following<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.440> same<00:03:01.680> thing<00:03:01.980> that's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
following the same thing that's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.130 
following the same thing that's
following<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.910> same<00:03:03.120> pattern<00:03:03.540> I'm<00:03:03.840> gonna

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
following the same pattern I'm gonna

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.199 
following the same pattern I'm gonna
drag<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.280> inner<00:03:05.640> corner<00:03:08.030> downward<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.180> little

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
drag the inner corner downward a little

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.449 
drag the inner corner downward a little
bit<00:03:09.660> because<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.989> want<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:10.440> thinner<00:03:10.830> from

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
bit because I want it to be thinner from

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.900 
bit because I want it to be thinner from
the<00:03:11.640> inner<00:03:11.820> corner<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.489> basically<00:03:14.489> I'm<00:03:14.700> going

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
the inner corner and basically I'm going

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.850 
the inner corner and basically I'm going
to<00:03:15.000> add<00:03:15.180> another<00:03:15.360> pearl<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.989> same<00:03:16.230> size<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
to add another pearl the same size and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.370 
to add another pearl the same size and
do<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.370> same<00:03:17.610> exact<00:03:18.090> thing<00:03:18.230> forming<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
do the same exact thing forming the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:31.580 
do the same exact thing forming the
opposite<00:03:20.010> side<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.459> bowl

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.229 

because<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.739> got<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.190> black<00:03:33.430> powder<00:03:33.730> over

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
because I got the black powder over

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.210 
because I got the black powder over
other<00:03:34.599> areas<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:35.019> mine<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.560> just<00:03:35.709> cleaning<00:03:36.010> it

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
other areas of mine and just cleaning it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.339 
other areas of mine and just cleaning it
out<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.000> liquid<00:03:37.510> monomer<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.019> comes<00:03:38.200> off

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
out with the liquid monomer it comes off

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.900 
out with the liquid monomer it comes off
super<00:03:38.739> easy<00:03:41.250> next<00:03:42.250> I'm<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:42.400> going<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.819> be

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
super easy next I'm just going to be

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.850 
super easy next I'm just going to be
adding<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.300> tinier<00:03:43.810> pearl<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.470> center<00:03:44.830> of

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
adding a tinier pearl in the center of

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.680 
adding a tinier pearl in the center of
my<00:03:45.160> bowl<00:03:47.519> now<00:03:48.519> I'm<00:03:48.580> just<00:03:48.760> gonna<00:03:48.910> add<00:03:49.000> top<00:03:49.450> coat

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
my bowl now I'm just gonna add top coat

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.509 
my bowl now I'm just gonna add top coat
over<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.959> top<00:03:50.080> area<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.220> place<00:03:51.489> my

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
over the top area so that I can place my

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.880 
over the top area so that I can place my
two<00:03:51.849> crystals<00:03:52.540> over<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.870> top<00:03:53.140> area<00:03:53.680> and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
two crystals over the top area and

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.170 
two crystals over the top area and
remember<00:03:54.400> for<00:03:54.670> this<00:03:54.790> step<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.150> can

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
remember for this step you can

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.870 
remember for this step you can
definitely<00:03:55.480> also<00:03:56.110> use<00:03:56.290> nail<00:03:56.650> glue<00:03:56.880> especially

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
definitely also use nail glue especially

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.460 
definitely also use nail glue especially
if<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.060> don't<00:03:58.239> want<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.450> apply<00:03:58.630> topcoat<00:03:59.049> on

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
if you don't want to apply topcoat on

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.740 
if you don't want to apply topcoat on
top<00:04:00.129> of<00:04:00.310> your<00:04:00.459> crystals<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.299> way<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.540> don't

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
top of your crystals that way you don't

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.440 
top of your crystals that way you don't
lose<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> lot<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.470> detail<00:04:02.860> but<00:04:03.849> I'm<00:04:04.090> using

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
lose a lot of the detail but I'm using

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.479 
lose a lot of the detail but I'm using
the<00:04:04.690> top<00:04:05.200> coat<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.680> I'm<00:04:05.739> just<00:04:05.920> over<00:04:06.400> the

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
the top coat and I'm just over the

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.130 
the top coat and I'm just over the
bottom<00:04:06.760> area<00:04:06.910> adding<00:04:07.360> three<00:04:07.599> crystals

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
bottom area adding three crystals

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.140 
bottom area adding three crystals
rounding<00:04:08.680> them<00:04:08.799> off<00:04:08.950> over<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.430> bottom<00:04:09.760> area

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
rounding them off over the bottom area

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.580 
rounding them off over the bottom area
and<00:04:10.329> that's<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.079> that's<00:04:11.230> how<00:04:11.380> you're<00:04:11.530> gonna
