enough gamer it comes to mobile gaming

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.930 
enough gamer it comes to mobile gaming
as<00:00:52.299> his<00:00:52.479> device<00:00:52.750> has<00:00:52.960> about<00:00:55.890> 768<00:00:56.890> MB<00:00:57.159> of<00:00:57.190> RAM<00:00:57.430> so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
as his device has about 768 MB of RAM so

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.270 
as his device has about 768 MB of RAM so
I<00:00:58.110> don't<00:00:59.110> think<00:00:59.350> this<00:00:59.650> device<00:00:59.920> will<00:01:00.100> be

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
I don't think this device will be

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.450 
I don't think this device will be
capable<00:01:01.059> enough<00:01:01.600> for<00:01:01.870> playing<00:01:02.140> up<00:01:02.350> heavy<00:01:02.890> more

capable enough for playing up heavy more

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.189 
capable enough for playing up heavy more
high<00:01:03.670> level<00:01:03.699> games<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.449> all<00:01:04.540> so<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.049> is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
high level games and all so this is

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.539 
high level games and all so this is
where<00:01:05.379> I'm<00:01:05.500> just<00:01:05.619> starting<00:01:05.950> up<00:01:06.100> with<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.340> game

good<00:01:09.159> sometimes<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:09.880> just<00:01:10.000> not<00:01:10.810> taking<00:01:11.200> up

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
good sometimes it's just not taking up
