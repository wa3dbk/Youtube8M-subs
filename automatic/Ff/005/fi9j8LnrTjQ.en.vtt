00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello and I love 1000 pesos me 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.509
 may you today to our new series 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.400
 alone action welcome 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.639
 In all action we will be especially for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.860
 the offroad sport tutorials tips and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.949
 give tricks 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.949
 for the area part either big 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.030
 we have already dealt with topics 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.510
 what with regard to the preparations as 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.489
 it looks 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.220
 the right position on the motorcycle what 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.830
 To be very clear when motocross is 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.160
 or generally motorsport material is 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.780
 very important that you understand and there 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.220
 is important to me that I mean one 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.390
 takes neutral position 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.540
 I mean that with the four soder 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.780
 medium gradually centrally footrest kit to the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:08.860
 stands and takes a neutral position 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.860
 Hands on the handlebars loosely on the knees 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.900
 many make the mistake 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.110
 they are actually repackaging and printing 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.880
 not to the motorcycle and you can do that 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.520
 material then not so well balanced 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.140
 or move 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.460
 the motorcycle was consistently 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.909
 Much much better on this motto 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.930
 lead and there is actually important 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.680
 with the audience as I said 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.869
 the hands on the handlebars position the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.509
 harmonic automatic cabinet wall that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.479
 actually said pointing fingers up 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.020
 and branches of the left hand on 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:53.690
 clutch and very important hands 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:57.410
 is not on the body but outside 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 very important and that also something 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.280
 It is important that the child has something over 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.700
 handlebar is and will be a focus 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.700
 motorcycle 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.050
 that was the position for me 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.760
 pleasant is the right basic position 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.080
 But then the motorcycle changes 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.739
 respectively when braking or 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.140
 when accelerating 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.080
 Of course it is very important that you 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.010
 actually how to deal with the 4s 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.290
 makes brake still today behind and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:39.460
 then back to the front and that 's one 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:43.990
 Exercise that you just go along with 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.790
 front to back and forward that one 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.900
 the feeling you get my motorcycle in 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.520
 the final result has to be with engines 1 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.530
 because you can not go against the motorcycle 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.040
 but you have to fight with that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.250
 motorcycle 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.200
 that is actually one and all that 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.300
 needs to nurse and that's how you are 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.350
 motorcycle reacts 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:10.690
 drive now is not her 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:12.700
 musical instrument the contactless for the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.620
