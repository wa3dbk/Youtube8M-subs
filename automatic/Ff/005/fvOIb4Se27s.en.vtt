00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.440
 tutorial I will show you how to do this 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.649
 very simple nail art and where I did it 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 a white french accompanied by a 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.920
 wavy strip and fatah big litter 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.220
 it's very simple to do 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.489
 very particular is very delicate ea 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.739
 my opinion decorah very nails too 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.710
 if it is very simple as you can see 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.619
 and then the products we need 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.110
 I am a nail base I am 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.770
 using this beauty in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.360
 protecting the scott and is the first base 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.270
 that I've never used because not 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.229
 never used base and I must say that I 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.619
 is very pleased and therefore of the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.490
 advice then we need a polish 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.869
 white of the glitter 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.869
 I'm using these glitter 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.520
 tending to purple but inside they have 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.380
 in serious use cited tell her year of glitter 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.119
 on the electric blue light dark violet 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.579
 in short, there are colors but it is 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.049
 I 'm really really beautiful 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:55.649
 glitter then we need a brush from 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.649
 nail art 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.170
 a fan brush a small box a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.549
 container to pour all the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.410
 glitter and finally a top coat the enamel 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.540
 transparent I'm using this 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.750
 of the study sciences nile santis plate 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.350
 in the selection is and is the best I have 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.420
 never used 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.490
 so I highly recommend it really 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.500
 very very good then we start immediately 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.840
 taking our base extending it up 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.100
 all the nails after that will be well 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.110
 dry 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.210
 I 've already done this step later 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.700
 that it will be very dry we go to take 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:41.940
 our white nail polish to go to 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:46.080
 make arrows and en frange e 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.070
 really I've already done it is really 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.070
 very simple then just take it 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.800
 a little product with the brush call 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.280
 little 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.860
 keep your finger still and go to 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.890
 only move the brush in 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.530
 this way first on one side then 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.810
 you always regret a poor product 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 and do the same thing on the other hand 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.410
 stop your finger and move only the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.470
 brush in this way 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.840
 then if you want let it dry and then 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.180
 go over to redefine denis contours 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.820
 it is really very very simple if then 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.720
 you have problems I'll also make a video 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.840
 tutorial where I will show you how to do it 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.820
 France in detail 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.950
 then after that ours will be very dry 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:44.960
 our french we take ours 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:48.560
 our glitter our container 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.410
 nail art brush and our top 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.910
 cooked clear enamel we go to 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.870
 take one with our small brush 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:04.240
 small amount right on the tip e 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.240
 let's go for a wavy strip 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.620
 that does not end just at the end 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:17.060
 of the nail but it goes there a little almost to the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:18.530
 center see how these are not 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.810
 gone right at the end of the nail but 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.660
 he am I limited myself to remain one 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.660
 little more towards the center we say in the middle 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.410
 the review because I prefer to take it 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.190
 little by little rather than take it 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.190
 lot 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.140
 ok now let's take our little brush 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.490
 our clippers and wood opponents on 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.490
 ours on our fingernail 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.060
 we start to crush them gently 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.690
 on the nail so that they adhere 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:12.590
 perfectly with enamel and after 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.590
 we always remove gently 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.189
 here is if the curves do not exist there 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.039
 like how she managed very well there isn't 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:27.020
 need to remove all protection 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:31.360
 social we have always done with 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:36.580
 fan brush we can go to 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.580
 straighten all our design 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:05.010
 in this way ok now we can 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:08.270
 take our top coat and it 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.270
 we spread over all the nails 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:38.530
 very well 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.360
 as you can see it was very simple and if 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.070
 you have problems for the french let me 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.940
