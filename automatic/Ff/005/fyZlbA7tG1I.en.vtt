00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.920
 tasio adds a new high-speed lastiri camera demand that started with his 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.279
 acclaimed f1 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.769
 the high speed techint fh 20 incorporates almost the same technologies but it is 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.570
 More compact offers a higher resolution and is cheaper a quicker 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.719
 look at the main specs of the sample team 

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:29.050
 some differences between both models to start the sh 20 has a sensor 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.699
 new mao megapixels versus the six of the f1 edition was increased by 12 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.210
 at 20x and it has a 3-inch lcd screen while on f1 it is 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.490
 of 2 point eight 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.320
 and there are still many more changes 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.940
 since the new model is designed for a more basic larger audience 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.670
 that the one of the f1 the ex gh 20 cent smaller and compact casio has 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.730
 simplified the body by eliminating some of the controls in order to 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.030
 make it easier for potential users in the mode of 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.000
 ultra-fast bursts the camera can take up to 40 images per second with 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.010
 a resolution of 7 megapixels and a wide variety of possibilities for 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.410
 example the very shy mode and it takes multiple images of an object 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.370
 moving 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.910
 the camera identifies the object in question I made several shots and the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.940
 unites on a single background to create a single image containing a series of 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.520
 captures in motion 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.550
 the ultra-fast bursts are also useful to avoid civil losses the 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.340
 camera takes several shots and overlays them to create a clear image 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.480
 in this case the logo almost appears sharper in the image taken with 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.320
 high-speed stabilizer elmo that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.620
 the exchange fhb ​​features a slow motion mode a rendering of a lot 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.220
 success in the f1 model the camera records video up to a thousand frenz per second that 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.010
 when playing a standard speed of 30 trains per second 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.640
 creates a superheated camera effect 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.150
 and as only a few seconds of action become a file of 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.650
 pretty long video 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.970
 casio included basic controls to trim them 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.960
 besides the ex gh 20 can make up to 40 photos in precarious mode although 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.980
 do not finish pressing the trigger so it takes a bit to shoot 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.810
 you will still have the opportunity to take the picture you wanted 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.289
 for those interested maybe the best news is its price 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.299
 it will cost around 600 dollars much cheaper than the one thousand dollars of the 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.499
 gc 1 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.699
 the almost fh 20 just came out in japan and concón 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.349
 and will be available in the United States in October 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.649
 The departure date in Europe has not yet been announced
