00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.429 
the recoil is ridiculous it's way way
way<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.759> more<00:01:38.790> realistic<00:01:39.180> than

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
way way way way more realistic than

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
way way way way more realistic than
modern<00:01:40.439> warfare<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:41.189> any<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> call<00:01:42.180> duty

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
modern warfare or any of the call duty

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.740 
modern warfare or any of the call duty
series<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.560> matter<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.360> recoil

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
series for that matter it is the recoil

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.840 
series for that matter it is the recoil
is<00:01:45.869> realistic<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> sniper

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
is realistic as you can see the sniper

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569 
is realistic as you can see the sniper
here<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.240> recalling<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> pro<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
here is recalling like a pro there is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
here is recalling like a pro there is
bullet<00:01:50.909> lag<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.329> believe<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.020> can't<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.409> tell

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
bullet lag I believe you can't like tell

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590 
bullet lag I believe you can't like tell
much<00:01:52.740> because<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:54.030> short<00:01:54.329> range

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
much because this is a more short range

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
much because this is a more short range
sniping<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> boat<00:01:56.430> lag<00:01:56.610> i<00:01:56.790> believe

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
sniping but there's a boat lag i believe

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.130 
sniping but there's a boat lag i believe
which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.360> realistic<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> whole

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
which is more realistic so the whole

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.539 
which is more realistic so the whole
game<00:01:58.380> play<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.860> holistic<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.310> when<00:01:59.460> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
game play is more holistic you when you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.789 
game play is more holistic you when you
run<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.329> bounce<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.840> down<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.170> sway<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
run you bounce up and down you sway and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
run you bounce up and down you sway and
call<00:02:01.979> duty<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.610> smooth<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.990> you're

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
call duty it's more smooth this you're

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.420 
call duty it's more smooth this you're
like<00:02:04.320> choppy<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.860> over<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> place<00:02:05.189> you're

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
like choppy all over the place you're

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.130 
like choppy all over the place you're
gone<00:02:05.640> when<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.880> swipe<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.240> sides<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.869> like

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
gone when you swipe the sides it like

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380 
gone when you swipe the sides it like
you<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.890> dips<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.489> bit<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you can see it dips a little bit so the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.350 
you can see it dips a little bit so the
gameplay<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.259> totally<00:02:10.910> realistic<00:02:11.910> much<00:02:12.150> more

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
gameplay is totally realistic much more

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.490 
gameplay is totally realistic much more
realistic<00:02:12.480> than<00:02:12.780> any<00:02:13.080> other

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
realistic than any other

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.650 
realistic than any other
FPS<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.490> i<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:15.000> especially<00:02:15.510> more

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
FPS that i can think of especially more

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.420 
FPS that i can think of especially more
realistic<00:02:15.840> than<00:02:16.080> call<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> duty<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.250> that's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
realistic than call of duty so that's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.500 
realistic than call of duty so that's
something<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.210> definitely

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
something you like that is definitely

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.330 
something you like that is definitely
something<00:02:18.570> good<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.470> positive<00:02:19.770> for<00:02:20.250> this

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
something good and positive for this

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.610 
something good and positive for this
game<00:02:20.750> most<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.960> battlefields<00:02:22.470> if<00:02:22.530> I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
game most of the battlefields if I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.960 
game most of the battlefields if I
remember<00:02:22.860> quickly<00:02:23.160> are<00:02:23.280> more<00:02:23.460> realistic<00:02:23.670> like

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
remember quickly are more realistic like

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
remember quickly are more realistic like
this<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:25.980> like

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
this but I like that and I don't like

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.280 
this but I like that and I don't like
that<00:02:26.550> it's<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.120> better<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.840> also<00:02:27.990> slows

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that it's it's better but it also slows

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.290 
that it's it's better but it also slows
down<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.890> game<00:02:28.920> play<00:02:29.250> because<00:02:29.610> realistically

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
down the game play because realistically

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.500 
down the game play because realistically
you're<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.380> these<00:02:31.500> short

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you're not going to have these short

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.300 
you're not going to have these short
range<00:02:33.650> maps<00:02:34.650> where<00:02:34.920> you're<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.070> running

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
range maps where you're just running

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.470 
range maps where you're just running
around<00:02:35.520> killing<00:02:35.850> each<00:02:36.000> other<00:02:36.060> over<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.420> over

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
around killing each other over and over

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.090 
around killing each other over and over
and<00:02:36.600> over<00:02:36.660> again<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:36.990> dying<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.560> responding

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
and over again and dying and responding

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.260 
and over again and dying and responding
and<00:02:38.160> all<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.370> kind<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.610> stuff<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.970> spawning

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
and all that kind of stuff and spawning

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.330 
and all that kind of stuff and spawning
gets<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:39.720> effed<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.190> this

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
gets really effed up so in this in this

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.020 
gets really effed up so in this in this
game<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.940> realism<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:44.220> factor<00:02:44.730> because

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
game the realism is is a factor because

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.610 
game the realism is is a factor because
there's<00:02:45.180> more<00:02:45.420> there's<00:02:45.720> larger<00:02:46.050> Maps<00:02:46.260> and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
there's more there's larger Maps and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.530 
there's more there's larger Maps and
therefore<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.580> respawning<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.360> all

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
therefore the respawning is not all

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.090 
therefore the respawning is not all
after<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.020> she<00:02:49.590> don't<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.830> worry<00:02:50.010> about

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
after that she don't have to worry about

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.970 
after that she don't have to worry about
that<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.060> more<00:02:51.180> realistic<00:02:51.980> graphics

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
that so it's more realistic graphics

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.460 
that so it's more realistic graphics
wise<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.970> pc<00:02:54.540> version<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.170> i've

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
wise the pc version of this that i've

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.010 
wise the pc version of this that i've
seen<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.860> far<00:02:56.040> looks<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.820> much<00:02:57.510> better<00:02:57.780> but

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
seen so far looks so much better but

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.690 
seen so far looks so much better but
then<00:02:58.170> again<00:02:58.260> pc<00:02:58.860> always<00:02:59.220> looks<00:02:59.400> better<00:02:59.459> i

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
then again pc always looks better i

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.729 
then again pc always looks better i
guess<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.420> looks<00:03:00.450> fine<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.050> xbox<00:03:01.410> i<00:03:01.620> mean

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
guess it looks fine on the xbox i mean

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.500 
guess it looks fine on the xbox i mean
it's<00:03:01.860> not<00:03:01.950> fantastic<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.970> graphics<00:03:03.180> are

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
it's not fantastic but the graphics are

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.080 
it's not fantastic but the graphics are
right<00:03:03.810> they<00:03:04.590> look<00:03:04.739> alright<00:03:04.920> right<00:03:05.580> here<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.850> got

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
right they look alright right here I got

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.720 
right they look alright right here I got
a<00:03:06.120> little<00:03:06.270> tear<00:03:06.660> boom<00:03:07.590> double<00:03:08.220> kill<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.400> think<00:03:08.670> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
a little tear boom double kill I think I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.610 
a little tear boom double kill I think I
pick<00:03:08.910> up<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.180> more<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.720> inside<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
pick up one more this is inside the
