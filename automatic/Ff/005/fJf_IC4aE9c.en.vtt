00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.940
 worry in this video has to do 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.360
 four easy snacks and they were for 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.360
 die 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.750
 tartlets 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.070
 sobrasada 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.000
 spreadable cheese 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.000
 and kikos 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.070
 put on the bottom of the tartlet a little 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.610
 of sobrasada 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.439
 and finish filling with the cheese yo 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.030
 I used a cheese to the end be going 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.229
 but you can choose the one that most 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.179
 like now battered with the peaks that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.000
 I've crushed it before with the chopper 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:29.319
 but you can also do them with the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.319
 mortar if you do not have mincer 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.789
 it does not happen in crushing it because if 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.390
 they are as the dust will not be so 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.390
 crunchy 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 best 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.100
 pipe bread 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.310
 Aioli 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.220
 dry tomato 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.190
 olive oil and ham 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.280
 Start by smearing the pipe bread with the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.020
 lion and the aioli can be homemade but 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.000
 like in a video where I'm going to 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.520
 teach you to make quick snacks 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.520
 I advise you to buy it as in my case 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.160
 now add a little dry tomato very 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.750
 very chopped in olive oil os 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.190
 I recommend that you have it a while before 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.190
 because that way it will be more tender 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.230
 to finish this appetizer add a 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.230
 Serrano ham chip 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.580
 gazpacho 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.600
 beet 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.600
 and ham serrano 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.080
 refills the bottom of the shot glass 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.580
 with beets I crush them a bit 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.060
 by the blender so that they were not 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.690
 the slices so big 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.690
 two 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.220
 now add the salmorejo or say the same 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.110
 that with the homemade aioli will be much 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.210
 more good but as they are very very tapas 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.210
 fast we can buy it I've done 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.180
 two 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.380
 add a bit of ham in the part 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.380
 higher 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.200
 and placed low to make it more 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.200
 easy to eat 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:43.350
 bread sticks serrano ham sliced 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.480
 olive oil and oregano 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.180
 in pink to the slice of ham in the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.590
 little stick 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.379
 and placed in a tray 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.800
 This will be easier if the slices are 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.800
 fine 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:05.170
 now we only have to add oregano and 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.660
 olive oil to taste and you're 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.000
