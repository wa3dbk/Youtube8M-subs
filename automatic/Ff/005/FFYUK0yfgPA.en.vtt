00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.400 
decrease the fastest and the slowest
animation<00:02:28.610> speed<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.900> addition<00:02:30.050> I've

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
animation speed and in addition I've

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.990 
animation speed and in addition I've
also<00:02:30.560> included<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.640> fading<00:02:32.600> effect<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:34.000> let

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
also included that fading effect so let

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.750 
also included that fading effect so let
me<00:02:35.120> know<00:02:35.240> what<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.510> guys<00:02:35.600> think<00:02:36.520> that's<00:02:37.520> going

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
really slowly so animation that's going

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.530 
really slowly so animation that's going
really<00:02:41.570> fast<00:02:42.940> do<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.030> think<00:02:44.209> there's<00:02:44.360> been

doing<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.470> quadrant<00:03:04.390> test<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.739> is<00:03:06.890> going

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
doing a quadrant test so this is going

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.199 
doing a quadrant test so this is going
to<00:03:07.810> be<00:03:08.810> my<00:03:09.650> first<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.250> guess<00:03:10.459> performance

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
to be my first I guess performance

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.479 
to be my first I guess performance

the<00:03:30.709> way<00:03:30.829> I've<00:03:30.950> said<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.819> I'm<00:03:31.879> just<00:03:32.000> going

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
the way I've said it so I'm just going

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.990 
the way I've said it so I'm just going
to<00:03:32.180> go<00:03:32.299> ahead<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.599> go<00:03:33.349> into<00:03:33.500> quadrant<00:03:33.980> go<00:03:34.670> into

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
to go ahead and go into quadrant go into

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.250 
to go ahead and go into quadrant go into
a<00:03:35.030> full<00:03:35.720> benchmark

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.940 

I<00:03:43.849> remember<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.939> first<00:03:45.060> time<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.420> did<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
I remember the first time I did a the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.399 
I remember the first time I did a the
last<00:03:47.159> time<00:03:47.400> i<00:03:47.489> did<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.670> quadrant<00:03:48.150> benchmark<00:03:48.659> was

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
last time i did a quadrant benchmark was

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:54.050 
last time i did a quadrant benchmark was
on<00:03:49.709> version<00:03:50.280> 1.8<00:03:50.879> point<00:03:52.010> 18<00:03:53.010> i<00:03:53.250> believe<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.909> i

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
on version 1.8 point 18 i believe and i

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.990 
on version 1.8 point 18 i believe and i
got<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.540> school<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:56.720> 3600<00:03:58.459> which<00:03:59.459> was<00:03:59.670> quite<00:03:59.940> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
got a school of 3600 which was quite a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.350 
got a school of 3600 which was quite a
good<00:04:00.299> school<00:04:00.870> given<00:04:01.260> them<00:04:01.409> on<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.769> stock<00:04:02.069> rom

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
good school given them on the stock rom

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.670 
good school given them on the stock rom
the<00:04:03.360> school<00:04:03.659> is<00:04:03.690> about<00:04:04.190> 3300<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.510> anyway<00:04:06.810> let's

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
the school is about 3300 so anyway let's

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.569 
the school is about 3300 so anyway let's
compare<00:04:08.099> version<00:04:08.579> 1.9<00:04:09.390> point<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:10.049> 30<00:04:10.579> let's

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
compare version 1.9 point in 30 let's

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.339 
compare version 1.9 point in 30 let's
see<00:04:11.730> if<00:04:11.940> it's<00:04:12.090> improved<00:04:12.540> let's<00:04:12.840> see<00:04:13.019> if<00:04:13.140> it's

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
see if it's improved let's see if it's

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.219 
see if it's improved let's see if it's
got<00:04:13.470> worse<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:15.410> yes<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.620> don't<00:04:16.829> want<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:17.010> proceed

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
got worse so yes I don't want to proceed

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:25.779 
got worse so yes I don't want to proceed
okay<00:04:19.229> here<00:04:19.530> we<00:04:19.620> go<00:04:20.419> alright<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:21.720> I've<00:04:21.840> got<00:04:23.479> 4082

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
okay here we go alright so I've got 4082

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.950 
okay here we go alright so I've got 4082
just<00:04:26.789> not<00:04:26.940> sure<00:04:27.180> if<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.510> can<00:04:27.810> see<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:29.960> yeah

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
just not sure if you can see that yeah

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.439 
just not sure if you can see that yeah
it's<00:04:31.260> not<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:32.430> probably<00:04:33.000> wouldn't<00:04:33.270> be<00:04:33.360> able

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
it's not you probably wouldn't be able

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.689 
it's not you probably wouldn't be able
to<00:04:33.570> read<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:33.990> but<00:04:34.229> you<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:35.010> take<00:04:35.190> my<00:04:35.370> word<00:04:35.400> it

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
to read that but you can take my word it

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.300 
to read that but you can take my word it
says<00:04:35.910> 4082<00:04:36.949> so<00:04:37.949> there<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.220> go<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.310> this

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
says 4082 so there you go that is this

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.689 
says 4082 so there you go that is this
week's<00:04:41.580> update<00:04:42.060> on<00:04:42.690> miui<00:04:43.590> custom<00:04:44.220> firmware

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
week's update on miui custom firmware

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.290 
week's update on miui custom firmware
for<00:04:45.510> android<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:46.380> can<00:04:46.560> get<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:47.300> custom

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
for android you can get this custom

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.689 
for android you can get this custom
firmware<00:04:48.720> on<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.229> think<00:04:50.010> pretty<00:04:50.310> much<00:04:50.430> almost

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
firmware on I think pretty much almost

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.380 
firmware on I think pretty much almost
all<00:04:51.349> Android<00:04:52.349> devices

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
all Android devices

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.210 

Gallen<00:04:55.390> it's<00:04:55.540> got<00:04:55.780> quite<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.080> lot<00:04:56.290> on<00:04:56.500> the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
Gallen it's got quite a lot on the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.300 
Gallen it's got quite a lot on the
galaxy<00:04:57.640> s2<00:04:57.760> galaxy<00:04:58.180> s1<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:59.440> captivate<00:04:59.980> I

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
galaxy s2 galaxy s1 the captivate I

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.830 
galaxy s2 galaxy s1 the captivate I
think<00:05:00.970> they've<00:05:01.090> got<00:05:01.360> one<00:05:01.930> for<00:05:04.800> Motorola<00:05:06.840> Defy

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
think they've got one for Motorola Defy

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.380 
think they've got one for Motorola Defy
i<00:05:08.470> believe<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.720> anyway<00:05:12.030> thanks<00:05:13.030> for<00:05:13.060> watching

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
i believe so anyway thanks for watching

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.750
