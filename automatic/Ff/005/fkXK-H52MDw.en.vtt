00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello youtube friends for example you 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.130
 Another video of me the ranch this time 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.389
 Let's go to the director's fortress. Come on. 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.889
 to this scenario that had not yet 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.599
 shown to you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.340
 this scenario where they also appear in the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.350
 my evil favorite 2 which is nothing more 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 nothing less than the house of the vector because 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.269
 has a fortress because he has a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.890
 Very fucking safety in the fortress of 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.570
 books so this movie knows that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.460
 He takes great care of himself and cherishes 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.529
 the safety of entering or leaving more 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.989
 Of course the boys invented a way and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.460
 They manage to get there look deep inside the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.200
 Miners climbing up a hole 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 trying to get in and when are they going to enter 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.489
 A hand throws them out and looks at the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.500
 robot that also appears in the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.360
 film that is used by girls to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.010
 trying to enter the house that is the victor 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.789
 cookie addict I do not remember now 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.320
 the flavour 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.180
 so let's go there for the gameplay one more time 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
 here with my mother 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.020
 this scenario that it was triggered now 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 here at the end of 2014 million already 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.579
 is with incredible ten scenarios galera 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.800
 okay with ten scenarios Almir Rouche 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 a lot of things are not very different scenery 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.739
 Let's face it, this is not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 a common scenario is not 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.900
 He does not have bread boss for you to face. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.299
 but you find the vector here no longer 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 just you find the vector you 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.509
 it is the vector am the little friend 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.670
 his friend that for the one who watched the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.770
 movie that will already associated remember 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.509
 even before I show you here 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 and he's showing up there I do not know if it 's 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.520
 he or she is his family that appears 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 there in the middle of the full movie only there and you 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.030
 can now check that watched the movie 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.009
 It is already distrusting know they were 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.049
 Who played the game and I liked the scenario. 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.549
 enough of it I find it very beautiful has a 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.189
 visual futuristic I like these 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.439
 looks cleaner futuristic knows 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.240
 and clean house and perhaps also 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.399
 games and everything else 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.659
 Let's get it like Nicole because back there 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.880
 can check a little more closely 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.290
 with a motor outside the fortress that gift 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.210
 vector and let's see if we can 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.590
 collect all the bananas to define 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.630
 like a little bit because it's getting more and more 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.250
 difficult for him the people are not so 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 easy as it was back here in the game 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.759
 You're collecting all the bananas. 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.140
 Not bad, it's for collecting bananas. 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.210
 banana ends up becoming a bit 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.490
 useless one hour at least ranch 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.560
 the only thing that is always very useful 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.270
 are the chips and tar you too 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.950
 You can see I have a little bit with 31 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.410
 Achievements I'm not mistaken in some videos 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.390
 previous was with 100 200 chips 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.580
 is the next galera to spend 300 chips 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
 lately a deal, I'll show you 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.420
 in the next video for you so do not 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.650
 miss the next video of a mini ranch 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.970
 that I'm going to post on the channel 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.560
 If you also divide, you are not yet 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.270
 writing does not waste time and sign up 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.340
 who always had back of me and others 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.650
 most beautiful games on the channel then not 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.390
 it loses time and there is beauty and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.670
 Next video I'll tell you guys I'm going 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.170
 bring a good content for the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.210
 the new business channel that is already there 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.610
 few weeks in the game but was investing 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.800
 300 chips and it was really worth it and I 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.940
 I recommend you spend on this item 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.070
 I'll show you around the next 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.630
 video then did not then forget to leave 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.100
 I also liked this video, I'm thinking. 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.990
 Do you want more videos from milan? 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.730
 today on the channel but wants to leave what I 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.470
 I like it, look, this laser is that we 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.850
 have these barriers are a bit 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.100
 different from those times when people 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.870
 saw the other scenarios were the laser 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.250
 blues and maybe a slightly form 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.380
 more rustic than it seemed 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.510
 healing electricity even without being a 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.270
 laser right here really looks like a laser 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.460
 more modern and more sophisticated 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.680
 Look at this next round deal. 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.030
 generating that they resemble those cages that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.820
 we find there in the dramatic setting 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.510
 but the matter clear much more futuristic 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.010
 there they are very rustic there not around 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.450
 scenarios can also 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.880
 boys doing some crazy things like 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.770
 normal of any scenario he has named 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.750
 ranch cattle very curious north cadin 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.670
 You're doing a lot of nice game senate. 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.560
 And, a lot of the movie, man, I'm 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.450
 very anxious that will bring again 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.890
 from now on there right guy bringing 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.000
 a lot of cool is being very 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.860
 creative 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.750
 Look down there, the shark is the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.370
 shark that appears in the shark movie of 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.620
 boat he is the mascot of vec and oil 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.970
 vector there well well was sitting 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.650
 it looks like the remote control in hand 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.989
 switching from channel to plane doing some 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.850
 a security ruse in his house 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.040
 So you see, we pass over 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.480
 of the vector and whenever we go through 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.340
 it happens something different has 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.050
 several different animations and some 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.540
 quite bizarre even who is using the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.250
 his tablet to force himself and that's fine. 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.930
 How cool are you being? 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.270
 very creative name on a ranch in a 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.670
 game that I recommend is one of the best 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.380
 maybe the best game available 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.300
 currently there depends on your taste even 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.340
 I think the two best version games 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.859
 he is omnium ranch 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.020
 then maybe there comes the time year 2 then 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.610
 my west certainly is one of the 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.600
 best games of the year that we have in 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.260
 present 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.090
 in relation to the graphic and 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.100
 according to him the best game this with 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.660
 sure it is the best index game that 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.760
 undoubtedly he has the best 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.170
 graphics and is the one that has more content 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.060
 for you are exploring how I told 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.310
 You are ten scenarios since you have 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.920
 that establish some species of people 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.540
 squid within these miniaquarios here was 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.000
 destroying it also appears in the 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.830
 film that there was a weapon that launches ex 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.330
 wife with a bizarre will miss a 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.370
 idea wells off watching movies 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.050
 You know what I'm talking about. 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.270
 She's going to show the show staying here. 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.710
 We leave you here from the fortress of 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.820
 beckham will not change much more than 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.260
 I do not know what for you I said 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.150
 that's just when you go now 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.440
 going to find the doctor goes through 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.640
 one of the animations 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.440
 Depends it does some things 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.970
 different times and sometimes even 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.290
 He tries to get you but there's nothing to 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.730
 What are you doing if you do not 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.560
 face he has to push a button 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.910
 to defeat the doctor you simply 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.560
 pass by the same 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.960
 but do not fail to show it to you 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.230
 start all and until the next video 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.230
 went
