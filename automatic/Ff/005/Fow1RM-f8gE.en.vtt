domain groups to the sudoers file this

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.850 
domain groups to the sudoers file this
is<00:00:11.340> really<00:00:11.490> helpful<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:12.120> administration

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
is really helpful for administration

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.810 
is really helpful for administration
first<00:00:13.860> thing<00:00:14.040> you're<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> need<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.670> do

first thing you're going to need to do
is<00:00:15.059> open<00:00:15.420> up<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.929> terminal<00:00:16.199> window<00:00:17.270> meanwhile

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
is open up a terminal window meanwhile

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.910 
is open up a terminal window meanwhile
needs<00:00:18.630> note<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.289> logged<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
needs note that we are logged in as a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.019 
needs note that we are logged in as a
local<00:00:20.460> account<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:21.029> has<00:00:21.240> sudo<00:00:21.689> privileges

local account that has sudo privileges

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.900 
local account that has sudo privileges
so<00:00:24.029> start<00:00:24.359> off<00:00:24.510> by<00:00:25.250> typing<00:00:26.250> sudo<00:00:26.730> VI<00:00:27.449> sudo<00:00:28.080> and

so start off by typing sudo VI sudo and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.269 
so start off by typing sudo VI sudo and
then<00:00:29.910> your<00:00:30.090> password<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.689> prompts<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.279> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
then your password if it prompts you so

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
then your password if it prompts you so
this<00:00:32.460> opens<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:32.969> what's<00:00:33.239> called<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.600> sudoers

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
this opens up what's called the sudoers

this opens up what's called the sudoers
file<00:00:34.790> this<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.000> basically<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.899> configuration

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
file this is basically the configuration

what is my group name to figure out this
we<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.820> simply<00:01:06.180> open<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.869> new<00:01:06.900> terminal

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
we can simply open up a new terminal

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
we can simply open up a new terminal
window<00:01:08.189> type<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.650> SU<00:01:12.619> your<00:01:13.619> domain<00:01:15.710> double

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
window type in SU your domain double

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
window type in SU your domain double
backslash<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:18.470> then<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.619> username<00:01:20.720> what

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
backslash and then your username what

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
backslash and then your username what
this<00:01:21.869> does<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> SU<00:01:22.950> parts<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
this does is the SU parts which is a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
this does is the SU parts which is a
user<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:26.270> dirt<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> gas<00:01:27.680> double<00:01:28.680> backslash

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
user to dirt and gas double backslash

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120 
user to dirt and gas double backslash
test<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.900> need<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> type<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.619> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
test which is what we need to type in to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.480 
test which is what we need to type in to
use<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.820> Active<00:01:33.600> Directory<00:01:33.720> domain<00:01:34.350> account

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.319 

so<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:40.170> dirt<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.770> gas<00:01:41.009> /<00:01:41.850> test

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
so now we are the dirt and gas / test

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
so now we are the dirt and gas / test
user<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.200> far<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.799> terminal<00:01:44.189> windows

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
user as far as this terminal windows

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.889 
user as far as this terminal windows
concern<00:01:44.939> type<00:01:45.840> ID<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.369> terminal<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
concern type ID in your terminal and it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.600 
concern type ID in your terminal and it
will<00:01:49.020> display<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:50.240> user<00:01:51.240> ID<00:01:51.979> your<00:01:52.979> group<00:01:53.310> ID

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
will display your user ID your group ID

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
will display your user ID your group ID
and<00:01:54.140> then<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> groups<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> part

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and then the groups that you're a part

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.959 
and then the groups that you're a part
of<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.950> useful<00:01:59.159> because<00:01:59.520> we<00:01:59.820> can

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
of so this is useful because we can

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.889 
of so this is useful because we can
figure<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.500> right<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.710> dirt<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> gas

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
figure out right here dirt and gas

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.690 
figure out right here dirt and gas
domain<00:02:03.899> admins<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.860> group<00:02:05.219> we'd<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.579> to
