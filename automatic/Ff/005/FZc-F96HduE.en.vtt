00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
thing out of here got it stuck earlier

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.990 
thing out of here got it stuck earlier
in<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.360> winter<00:00:10.370> the<00:00:11.370> first<00:00:11.670> thing<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.940> do

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
in the winter the first thing I do

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.490 
in the winter the first thing I do
before<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.420> fire<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.809> up<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.049> try<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> move<00:00:13.349> it

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
before I fire it up and try to move it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.550 
before I fire it up and try to move it
is<00:00:13.650> uh<00:00:14.540> put<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.570> air<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.870> all<00:00:16.109> these<00:00:16.260> tires

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
is uh put some air in all these tires

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.279 
is uh put some air in all these tires
because<00:00:16.949> all<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.789> them<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.510> back<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.140> is

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
because all of them but the back one is

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.759 
because all of them but the back one is
flat<00:00:19.529> or<00:00:20.420> are<00:00:21.420> flat<00:00:25.400> like<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> I'll<00:00:28.529> grab<00:00:28.740> my

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
flat or are flat like so I'll grab my

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.819 
flat or are flat like so I'll grab my
nice<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.220> tank<00:00:31.610> fill<00:00:32.610> her<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.680> see<00:00:34.680> if

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
nice little tank fill her up and see if

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.119 
nice little tank fill her up and see if
I<00:00:34.890> can't<00:00:35.100> pump<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:35.520> move<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.940> thing<00:00:37.129> well

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I can't pump it up move this thing well

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.950 
I can't pump it up move this thing well
it's<00:00:38.370> kind<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> cold<00:00:38.850> let's<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it's kind of cold let's see if the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.810 
it's kind of cold let's see if the
compressor<00:00:40.379> works<00:00:44.539> nope<00:00:45.539> too<00:00:46.050> cold

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
compressor works nope too cold

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.250 
compressor works nope too cold
time<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> throw<00:00:47.969> some<00:00:48.270> heat<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> her<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> guess

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.810 

here's<00:00:52.260> how<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.710> compressors<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> work<00:00:53.610> in

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
here's how we get compressors to work in

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
here's how we get compressors to work in
Minnesota<00:00:54.590> or<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:55.949> heat<00:00:56.129> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 

a<00:00:58.590> couple<00:00:59.250> minutes<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.730> she'll<00:00:59.970> be<00:01:00.060> warming

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
a couple minutes and she'll be warming

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.460 
a couple minutes and she'll be warming
up<00:01:00.450> and<00:01:00.660> run<00:01:02.540> I'll<00:01:03.540> see<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.900> warmed<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
up and run I'll see you warmed up for a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.330 
up and run I'll see you warmed up for a
little<00:01:04.589> bit<00:01:04.800> let's<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.190> if<00:01:05.280> she'll<00:01:05.460> run

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.080 

perfect<00:01:10.040> well<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.579> tires<00:01:11.820> pumped

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
perfect well I got all the tires pumped

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.010 
perfect well I got all the tires pumped
up<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> new<00:01:12.869> battery<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.259> it<00:01:14.840> let's<00:01:15.840> see

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
up I got a new battery in it let's see

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.120 
up I got a new battery in it let's see
what's<00:01:16.200> gonna<00:01:16.560> happen

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
what's gonna happen

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:30.529 
what's gonna happen
see<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:17.970> she'll<00:01:18.149> fire<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:29.119> we'll<00:01:30.119> call<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
see if she'll fire up we'll call it a

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:31.100 
see if she'll fire up we'll call it a
smoke

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
smoke

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.990 
smoke
Dubey<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.070> ain't<00:01:32.189> no<00:01:32.250> mosquitos<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> get

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
Dubey there ain't no mosquitos to get

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.620 
Dubey there ain't no mosquitos to get
rid<00:01:33.149> of

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.970 

perfect<00:01:42.910> I'll<00:01:43.910> let<00:01:44.180> her<00:01:44.270> run<00:01:44.510> warm<00:01:45.440> up<00:01:45.650> and

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
perfect I'll let her run warm up and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.289 
perfect I'll let her run warm up and
then<00:01:46.070> I'll<00:01:46.160> see<00:01:46.340> if<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:46.520> can<00:01:46.670> move<00:01:46.790> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.730 

well<00:01:55.299> she's<00:01:55.600> pretty<00:01:55.780> well<00:01:56.049> warmed<00:01:56.380> up<00:01:56.530> now

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
well she's pretty well warmed up now

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:45.360 
well she's pretty well warmed up now
let's<00:01:57.399> see<00:01:57.580> if<00:01:57.670> she<00:01:57.850> moves

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.280 

but<00:02:46.370> as<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:46.700> can<00:02:46.849> see<00:02:46.909> seeing<00:02:47.480> going<00:02:47.900> nowhere

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
but as you can see seeing going nowhere

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.790 
but as you can see seeing going nowhere
I<00:02:49.720> got<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.870> here<00:02:51.140> right<00:02:51.439> now

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.780 

see<00:02:54.640> ain't<00:02:54.790> movin<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:57.280> good<00:02:57.520> for<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
see ain't movin not good for the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.660 
see ain't movin not good for the
transmission<00:02:58.270> though

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.730 

well<00:03:04.270> that<00:03:04.480> gives<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.960> an<00:03:05.020> idea<00:03:05.110> what<00:03:05.380> kind<00:03:05.530> of

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
well that gives you an idea what kind of

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.730 
well that gives you an idea what kind of
power<00:03:06.010> these<00:03:06.250> things<00:03:06.550> have<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:08.350> let<00:03:08.709> it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
power these things have I just let it

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.869 
power these things have I just let it
idle<00:03:09.040> first<00:03:09.819> year<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.300> she's<00:03:10.540> still<00:03:10.720> moving

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
idle first year and she's still moving

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.000 
idle first year and she's still moving
so<00:03:12.450> I'm<00:03:12.569> gonna<00:03:12.659> have<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.900> probably<00:03:13.469> attach<00:03:13.799> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
so I'm gonna have to probably attach it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.000 
so I'm gonna have to probably attach it
to<00:03:14.129> something<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.459> pull<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.790> out<00:03:15.859> time<00:03:16.859> to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
to something and pull it out time to

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.770 
to something and pull it out time to
start<00:03:17.249> the<00:03:17.370> van<00:03:17.549> maybe<00:03:17.879> I<00:03:18.260> think<00:03:19.260> so

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.059 

and<00:03:24.780> now<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.990> one<00:03:25.230> you've<00:03:25.380> all<00:03:25.530> been<00:03:25.709> waiting

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
and now the one you've all been waiting

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.330 
and now the one you've all been waiting
for

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
for

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.400 
for

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
on my Eve and e-150 got a battery in her

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.180 
on my Eve and e-150 got a battery in her
head<00:03:34.410> fire<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.770> right<00:03:34.800> up
