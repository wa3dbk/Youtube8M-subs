00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
knob here controls the water pressure

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
knob here controls the water pressure
and<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.379> main<00:00:40.559> temperature<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.309> want<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and the main temperature if you want it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
and the main temperature if you want it
really<00:00:41.579> hot<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.170> pressure<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.500> put

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
really hot and a lot of pressure you put

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.130 
really hot and a lot of pressure you put
it<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> three<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> an<00:00:45.899> eco

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it on the three this is kind of an eco

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.690 
it on the three this is kind of an eco
saver<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:46.890> there's<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> cold<00:00:47.430> water

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

one and then this also controls your
temperatures<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.320> make<00:00:52.320> sure

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
temperatures for it and just make sure

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
doors close like this and they usually

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:11.850 
doors close like this and they usually
stick<00:01:02.340> together<00:01:02.629> magnetically

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.230 

and<00:01:12.860> after<00:01:13.340> you're<00:01:13.460> done<00:01:13.580> showering<00:01:13.880> just

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and after you're done showering just

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
make sure you always pull the lever

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.840 
make sure you always pull the lever
again<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:16.460> turn<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.760> off<00:01:16.940> because<00:01:18.250> well

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.580 

alright<00:01:22.850> next<00:01:23.060> we<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:23.750> go<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.440> oven

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
alright next we have this go in the oven

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.530 
alright next we have this go in the oven
and<00:01:25.010> in<00:01:25.400> order<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.729> turn<00:01:25.880> on<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.119> any<00:01:26.240> part<00:01:26.510> of

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
and in order to turn on to any part of

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.820 
and in order to turn on to any part of
the<00:01:26.630> stove<00:01:26.840> or<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.050> oven<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.440> have<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.650> flip

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
the stove or the oven you have to flip

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.070 
the stove or the oven you have to flip
the<00:01:28.010> switch<00:01:28.280> gear<00:01:28.580> so<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.510> it's<00:01:29.900> kind<00:01:30.050> of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
the switch gear so that it's kind of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.359 
the switch gear so that it's kind of
like<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.350> heater<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.040> tap<00:01:31.220> is

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
like the heater so that the tap is

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.850 
like the heater so that the tap is
sticking<00:01:31.700> out<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.210> then<00:01:32.930> these<00:01:33.140> control<00:01:33.710> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
sticking out and then these control the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.499 
sticking out and then these control the
brands<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.400> top<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.000> some<00:01:35.300> of<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
brands on the top and some of the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.850 
brands on the top and some of the
burners<00:01:35.810> work<00:01:35.990> better<00:01:36.170> than<00:01:36.380> others<00:01:36.680> would

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
burners work better than others would

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.940 
burners work better than others would
expect<00:01:37.250> depends<00:01:37.550> on<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.330> permit<00:01:38.690> your<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:38.990> you

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
expect depends on you permit your in you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.870 
expect depends on you permit your in you
also<00:01:40.130> have<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.850> lights<00:01:41.060> up<00:01:41.300> here<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.470> fan

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
also have the lights up here and the fan

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.150 
also have the lights up here and the fan
there<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.830> then<00:01:45.830> here<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.789> oven<00:01:47.330> and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
there and then here is the oven and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.040 
there and then here is the oven and
these<00:01:49.160> are<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.490> settings<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.750> oven<00:01:50.930> that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
these are the settings of the oven that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.109 
these are the settings of the oven that
we<00:01:51.320> never<00:01:51.530> actually<00:01:51.770> figured<00:01:52.310> out<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:52.820> we<00:01:52.970> just

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
we never actually figured out so we just

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.430 
we never actually figured out so we just
kind<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.390> guess<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.930> can<00:01:54.080> turn<00:01:54.289> it<00:01:54.410> to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
kind of guess you can turn it to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.630 
kind of guess you can turn it to
whichever<00:01:54.830> one<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.190> want

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
whichever one you want

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.150 
whichever one you want
we<00:01:56.330> usually<00:01:56.479> use<00:01:56.810> these<00:01:57.050> two<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.619> remember

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
we usually use these two and remember

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.859 
we usually use these two and remember
here's<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.940> temperature<00:01:59.210> but<00:01:59.570> it's<00:01:59.720> in

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
here's the temperature but it's in

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.690 
here's the temperature but it's in
Celsius<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.979> don't<00:02:01.130> want<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.369> turn<00:02:01.580> it

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
Celsius so you don't want to turn it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.890 
Celsius so you don't want to turn it
probably<00:02:02.060> past<00:02:02.590> 200<00:02:03.590> area
