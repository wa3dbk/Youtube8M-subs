00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.710 
we couldn't figure it out
so<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.220> were<00:01:50.340> hit<00:01:50.520> set<00:01:50.729> by<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> police<00:01:51.270> we're

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
so we were hit set by the police we're
probably<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.829> looks<00:01:53.070> like

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
probably going to because it looks like

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
probably going to because it looks like
