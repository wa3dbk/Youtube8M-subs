okay have a look at this it is the Asus

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.279 
okay have a look at this it is the Asus
k61<00:00:27.529> IC<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.849> mighty<00:00:30.750> impressive

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
k61 IC and it is mighty impressive

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.950 
k61 IC and it is mighty impressive
actually<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.850> day<00:00:33.059> when<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.540> lot<00:00:33.840> of

actually and a day when a lot of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.569 
actually and a day when a lot of
notebooks<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.680> don't<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.250> very

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
notebooks out there don't have very

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.940 
notebooks out there don't have very
impressive<00:00:35.940> graphics<00:00:36.420> capability<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.739> one

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
impressive graphics capability this one

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.299 
impressive graphics capability this one
is<00:00:38.160> powered<00:00:38.790> by<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.000> discreet<00:00:39.510> NVIDIA<00:00:40.050> GPU<00:00:40.770> so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
is powered by a discreet NVIDIA GPU so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.680 
is powered by a discreet NVIDIA GPU so
it's<00:00:41.430> gonna<00:00:41.520> tear<00:00:41.940> through<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.300> about<00:00:42.360> any

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
well but let's talk about that graphics

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.179 
well but let's talk about that graphics
processor<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.530> quick<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:19.890> that's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
processor really quick because that's

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.060 
processor really quick because that's
really<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.119> heart<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.900> thing<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
really the heart of this thing and it is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.039 
really the heart of this thing and it is
really<00:01:23.700> awesome<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> Nvidia<00:01:25.200> GT<00:01:25.640> 220<00:01:26.640> M

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
really awesome it is the Nvidia GT 220 M

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.460 
really awesome it is the Nvidia GT 220 M
GPU<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:29.600> quite<00:01:30.600> powerful<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
GPU which is quite powerful for a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.580 
GPU which is quite powerful for a
notebook<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> same<00:01:33.509> time<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.380> going

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
notebook and at the same time it's going

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
notebook and at the same time it's going
to<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.799> very<00:01:35.159> useful<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.990> applications

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to be very useful when applications

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.170 
to be very useful when applications
start<00:01:37.170> taking<00:01:37.470> advantage<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.759> Nvidia

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
start taking advantage of the Nvidia

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.660 
start taking advantage of the Nvidia
CUDA<00:01:39.509> technology<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.159> course<00:01:41.189> means

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
CUDA technology and that of course means

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
CUDA technology and that of course means
it's<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.119> able<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.329> accelerate<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.960> lot

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it's gonna be able to accelerate a lot

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.289 
it's gonna be able to accelerate a lot
of<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.590> applications<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:46.229> nice

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
of your applications it is a really nice

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.420 
of your applications it is a really nice
small<00:01:48.299> package<00:01:48.799> as<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.100> see<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.340> not

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
small package as you can see it's not

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.760 
small package as you can see it's not
very<00:01:50.670> thick<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.509> over<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.350> right<00:01:52.590> hand

very thick at all over on the right hand

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.980 
very thick at all over on the right hand
side<00:01:53.070> you're<00:01:53.220> gonna<00:01:53.310> find<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:54.030> couple<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> USB

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
side you're gonna find a couple of USB

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929 
side you're gonna find a couple of USB
ports<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.590> well<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.979> your<00:01:56.310> headphone<00:01:56.759> and
