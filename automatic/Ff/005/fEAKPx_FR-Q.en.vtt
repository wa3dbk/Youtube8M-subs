to get first priority

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:18.240 
to get first priority
you<00:01:53.250> want<00:01:53.430> money<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:54.119> thing

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.260 

to<00:02:19.250> deploy<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.849> I<00:02:19.940> suppose

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
to deploy and I suppose

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:34.910 

continue<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.750> later
