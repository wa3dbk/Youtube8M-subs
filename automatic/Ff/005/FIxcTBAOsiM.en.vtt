00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.020
 solved the study can be art at the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.089
 Bergische university that was before three 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.710
 Since then a lot has happened 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.389
 Art students have moved 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.000
 from the small dark rooms at the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.280
 uni remote office way in the new premises 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.139
 on the uni campus grifflenberg and then 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.029
 something has changed it came one 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 new young short professor one 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.390
 berlin artist and also has 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.160
 again a lot of things turned upside down 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.029
 over fresh wind at the university and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.029
 understand how causes 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.550
 Gaffer himself is the great artist 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.770
 formats and installation preferred and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.050
 as a 35-year-old executive 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.380
 professors of the degree program has art 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.880
 she also prefers the Bergisch uni large 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.340
 in the main seminar she discusses 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.989
 current streets and low art the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.670
 art teacher from here on once 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.650
 schoolchildren must be let go 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.900
 Many also know Katja Pfeiffer here 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.750
 is also about contemporary art though 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.520
 Knowledge is not everything it gets into 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.970
 main seminar relative philipp kunz 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.920
 talked and in the seminal seminars so 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.020
 a painting 1 and 2 like the one in the bachelor 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.740
 Being on a daily basis is also practical 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 worked 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.790
 at the main study people or at 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.500
 to whom the study of painting 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.080
 make because the formats are so big that 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.430
 We are here on this 100 square meters 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.560
 do not get very far 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.330
 Actually, there is not enough pale here 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.950
 and to deal with color and canvas like that 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.560
 how the new professor is hers 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.720
 For students recommends thinking big 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 and paint big with students once too 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.210
 Great can teach my deepest 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.399
 art didactic convictions is 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.149
 So yes, that's the way to go 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:45.340
 which at least has to do that one 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.369
 Let's see how is that if I am 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.170
 a huge canvas in front of me has served 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.060
 is bigger than me for example that 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.979
 is just a completely different one 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.259
 work as if you are eternally on a din 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.119
 a4 sheet brush or on the left 3 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.920
 This is something different and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.270
 if you tried it once and times 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.490
 okay I have two here 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.509
 meter fifty that's bigger than me like 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.509
 I have to work on it 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.710
 like in the art academy she has one 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.440
 organized and hanging there 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.180
 they ask the big pictures first 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.410
 the prospective art teachers become one 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.970
 public like it is otherwise 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.760
 artists sculptures atelier im 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.010
 photography or film seminar with the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.680
 new professors held another 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.770
 Attitude and mood come to the fore 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.120
 creative to all elders where has become 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.400
 raised one sees also in one 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.180
 exhibition the objects have become 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:46.240
 changed in the sculpture happen 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.230
 Things quite different never seen before and 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.950
 just do not just stop 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.190
 a material or it is very 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 Professor has been diverse for over 20 years 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.180
 way of conducting the study course and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.280
 while maintaining a different style and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.980
 some other contents are conveyed by the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.360
 current dynamics, however, he welcomed to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.160
 mood is good in front of everything 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.620
 the students are all very excited 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.910
 because they make him feel stronger 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.520
 introducing contemporary art 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.200
 to become 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.150
 the black bread as I once the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.420
 maybe a future teacher too 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.550
 absolutely must or can enjoy 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.850
 that may come at the moment 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.370
 short but in principle I would say it 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.580
 is a very refreshing situation the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.380
 the students really motivated 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.630
 now there are more than 200 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.790
 students in all would like 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.070
 the second give something that they are for 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.320
 her and her creativity 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.240
 future students are responsible 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.560
 the better the art teacher that you do more 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.360
 understand the people and the less 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.760
 be ugly family homes 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.310
 built and the more somehow 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.070
 maybe just on something like that too 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.790
 is maybe just eight more 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.860
 given to the environment on the environment 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.780
 here at the University of Wuppertal has shown 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.710
 what positive power through art 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.690
 can arise 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.840
 your students have to do that now 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.840
 wear outside and we come
