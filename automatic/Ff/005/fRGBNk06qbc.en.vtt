00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.550
 the land cruiser is an icon at 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 Toyota and for good reason it exists since 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.920
 1951 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.230
 the current generation dates from 2003 when 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.030
 same and last year suffered a slight 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 cosmetic only restyling with a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.660
 new, larger grille and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.400
 LED daytime running lights placed under the lights 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
 before but only on version 5 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.789
 doors the technique does not evolve the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.920
 only proposed motorisation is always 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.990
 the case of centro the diesel of 190 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.800
 horses and here no question of version 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.720
 two-wheel drive 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.219
 the land cruiser is a real 4 4 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.480
 permanent who she is only the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.190
 choice between manual or 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 automatic and 3 or 5 doors 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 inside the restyling has almost 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
 nothing changed except the instrumentation and the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.360
 upper part of the center console 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.620
 including a 7-inch screen the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.850
 presentation is not luxurious but we 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.559
 is far from the rustic of the first 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.670
 generations a land cruiser 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.430
 today is more affluent 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.199
 that utilitarian access to the rear seats 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.100
 of our 3-door version requires a 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.420
 small gymnastics 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 once passengers are installed 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 have a lot of room it's 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.910
 always a side-opening door 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.530
 not always practical which gives access to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 a chest can practice from only 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.909
 380 one of the six cubic meters at startup 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 the 3-liter diesel causes some 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.720
 vibrations but remains rather discreet he 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.520
 is full of low-level health but 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 do not run out of 3500 laps 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.150
 it is backed by a car box at 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 the old enough slow and that gives 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.960
 sometimes the feeling of skating 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.670
 behavior side according to cruiser is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.560
 not a suv and suffers from both a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.630
 hopping comfort is an outfit of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.360
 largely perfectible road including 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.500
 cause of many cash movements 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.000
 but it is one of the best 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 six-hour brakes with its ground clearance 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 elevated a differential lock is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.299
 a short range according to cruiser fact 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.040
 part of a growing family 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.689
 reduced that of true fighters 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.729
 luxurious like the range rover neither too 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.229
 rustic as the defender its 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.880
 most direct competitor and pajero 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.799
 who like him is available in 3 or 5 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.689
 doors and it's in our configuration 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.579
 3 doors that the land cruiser is the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.369
 best in crossing thanks to a 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.990
 ventral angle more favorable to finish 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.610
 do not confuse the land cruiser any 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.659
 short like ours and the land cruiser 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.969
 sw 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.370
 this is another more luxurious model 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.600
 competitors during 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.600
 who is entitled only to a diesel v8
