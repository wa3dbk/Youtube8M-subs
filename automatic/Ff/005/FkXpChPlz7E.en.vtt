00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
worked out using ninety percent recycled
polyester<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.229> create<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.950> super

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
polyester to create this like super

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.770 
polyester to create this like super
flexible<00:01:08.790> fabric<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.720> us

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
flexible fabric what do you have for us

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:19.530 
flexible fabric what do you have for us
whoa<00:01:10.710> us<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.260> that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.390 

so<00:01:20.050> this<00:01:20.560> solar<00:01:21.520> panel<00:01:21.910> on<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.530> back<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:24.310> be

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
so this solar panel on the back can be

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400 
so this solar panel on the back can be
used<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.760> charge<00:01:25.090> up<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.510> wide<00:01:26.050> variety<00:01:26.170> of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
used to charge up a wide variety of

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.230 
used to charge up a wide variety of
consumer<00:01:26.710> electronics<00:01:27.310> including<00:01:27.910> your

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
consumer electronics including your

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.670 
consumer electronics including your

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
charger on it that converts voltage then

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.110 
charger on it that converts voltage then
it<00:01:32.920> comes<00:01:33.010> with<00:01:33.160> all<00:01:33.220> these<00:01:33.370> adapters<00:01:33.940> right

you throw in these like little sawdust

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.420 
you throw in these like little sawdust
oh<00:03:14.170> they're<00:03:14.440> pellets<00:03:14.769> right<00:03:14.980> yeah<00:03:15.100> which<00:03:15.250> are

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
oh they're pellets right yeah which are

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.850 
oh they're pellets right yeah which are
basically<00:03:15.549> breath<00:03:16.000> mints<00:03:16.360> for<00:03:16.860> compost

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
basically breath mints for compost

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.699 
basically breath mints for compost
rights<00:03:18.130> or<00:03:19.090> doesn't<00:03:19.450> reek<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.260> cuts<00:03:20.470> down

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
rights or doesn't reek so it cuts down

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.740 
rights or doesn't reek so it cuts down
on<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:20.980> smell<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.820> then<00:03:22.060> additionally<00:03:22.600> like

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
on the smell and then additionally like

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.050 
on the smell and then additionally like
it<00:03:22.900> sort<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.440> allows<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.040> chemical<00:03:24.489> reactions

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
it sort of allows the chemical reactions

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.490 
it sort of allows the chemical reactions
to<00:03:25.239> take<00:03:25.360> place<00:03:25.420> between<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.989> cultures<00:03:26.170> from

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
to take place between the cultures from

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.409 
to take place between the cultures from
the<00:03:26.590> soil<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.190> then<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.760> food<00:03:28.000> which<00:03:28.299> you

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
the soil and then the food which you

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.240 
the soil and then the food which you
then<00:03:28.600> add<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:28.989> right<00:03:29.320> afterwards<00:03:29.829> it's<00:03:30.040> very

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
then add on right afterwards it's very

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.800 
then add on right afterwards it's very
important<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.910> cut<00:03:31.180> your<00:03:31.359> food<00:03:31.570> into

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
important that you cut your food into

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.340 
important that you cut your food into
four

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
four

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.500 
four
inch<00:03:32.560> chunks<00:03:33.100> because<00:03:33.490> if<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.820> don't<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.330> can

inch chunks because if you don't it can

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.570 
inch chunks because if you don't it can
clog<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.960> machine<00:03:35.260> yeah<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.920> engine<00:03:36.250> rotates

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
clog the machine yeah the engine rotates

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.830 
clog the machine yeah the engine rotates
