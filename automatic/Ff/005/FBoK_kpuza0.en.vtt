00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
and I guess really at the end of day I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.039 
and I guess really at the end of day I
just<00:03:40.100> kind<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.459> felt<00:03:40.639> like<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:41.870> was

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
just kind of felt like it was

just kind of felt like it was
interesting<00:03:42.590> but<00:03:43.190> at<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> end<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.579> day<00:03:43.700> it's

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
interesting but at the end the day it's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.420

kind<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.209> just<00:03:44.389> another<00:03:44.690> generic<00:03:45.049> story<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:45.980> my

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
kind of just another generic story in my

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.340 
kind of just another generic story in my
opinion<00:03:46.639> I<00:03:46.970> thought<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:48.019> know<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:48.230> whole

idea<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.940> gladiator<00:03:49.940> s<00:03:50.269> kind<00:03:50.810> of

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
idea of gladiator s kind of

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.479 
idea of gladiator s kind of
that's<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.109> not<00:03:54.260> true<00:03:54.499> that's<00:03:55.189> what<00:03:55.340> she

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
that's that is not true that's what she

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.949 
that's that is not true that's what she
keeps<00:03:55.640> saying<00:03:55.760> she's<00:03:56.120> like<00:03:56.269> you<00:03:56.599> didn't<00:03:56.840> like

it<00:03:56.989> cuz<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.409> wasn't<00:03:57.739> demented<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.489> nasty<00:03:58.939> and

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989
