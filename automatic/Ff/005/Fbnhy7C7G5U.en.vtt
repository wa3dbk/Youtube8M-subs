 I leave with the video although girls before 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.980
 let's start by applying a test of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.260
 shadows life of africa and this is for 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.970
 that lasts all the shadows and everything 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.090
 to apply to my eyelid all day 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.650
 and now we need the palette that we're going 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.350
 to use and I will be using 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 the 120 colors of this sector is 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.550
 medex and I will be using this as 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.250
 balilla after this case cited 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.670
 with a cappuccino and after the coffee that 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.710
 come to one side too and then leave 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.769
 we can be using this green that 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.079
 come here and I'm indicating them and 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:57.030
 I'm saying how are we going to 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:57.030
 start by applying the cappuccino tone 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.620
 we are going to apply 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.899
 around the eyelid 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.189
 and we will discriminate 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.820
 Over there 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:27.480
 and then with the brush to apply 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.480
 color let's take like vanilla 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.990
 we're not going to be playing several 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.990
 let's go apply only 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.090
 the shape 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.880
 I'm going to take a pen and now if we are 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.880

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.640
 and this we will be blurring 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 several times to achieve the effect that 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.740
 marcadito we want is transferred to the kilo 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.740
 tomÃ¡s although the brush 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.890
 and now we continue working so that 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 there are many successes that remain nothing more 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.049
 what are we going to take in vanilla 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.049

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.650
 It is important that we work 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.770

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.560
 more than you can not go over it much 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.940
 time that is if you make a mistake and follow him 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.030
 going over and over and over 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.040

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.000
 and from there I'm going to go in 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.600
 and then here in the corner we're going to 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.600
 draw a triangle 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.690
 in tears 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.610
 to make a piquito and be like that 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.740
 as a whole way 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.250
 it will come here, it moves towards 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.950
 outside ok since we have this we are going to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.580

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.319
 flat brush let's apply it in the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.930
 lack of outside 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.859
 let's turn the brush and then the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.859
 another in the others 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.770
 then I'm going to take a little bit of the green 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.770

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.390

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.160
 After that, you will take a brown pencil and 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.410
