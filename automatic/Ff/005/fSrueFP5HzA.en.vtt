00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.560 
my Syrian hamster pumpkin spice spice
lives<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.890> 110<00:00:08.519> quart<00:00:08.849> bin<00:00:09.120> which<00:00:09.420> I

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
lives in a 110 quart bin which I

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.180 
lives in a 110 quart bin which I
purchased<00:00:10.019> from<00:00:10.110> Target<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.740> made<00:00:10.920> into<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
purchased from Target and made into a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.850 
purchased from Target and made into a
bin<00:00:11.400> cake<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.900> reason<00:00:13.170> why<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> bring<00:00:13.650> their

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
bin cake so the reason why I bring their

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.860 
bin cake so the reason why I bring their
cages<00:00:14.040> outside<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.940> cage<00:00:15.120> tours<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> because

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
cages outside for cage tours is because

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.359 
cages outside for cage tours is because
the<00:00:16.350> sunlight<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.859> provide<00:00:17.100> much<00:00:17.340> better

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the sunlight can provide much better

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.040 
the sunlight can provide much better
lighting<00:00:17.820> than<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.270> lighting<00:00:18.539> inside<00:00:18.840> my

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

you'll notice that I don't fill it up
all<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:09.989> way<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:11.009> since<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.400> do

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
all the way it's because since I do

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.190 
all the way it's because since I do
clean<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> hamsters<00:02:12.480> water<00:02:12.840> bottles

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
clean up the hamsters water bottles

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.760 
clean up the hamsters water bottles
every<00:02:13.470> day

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
every day
I<00:02:13.800> don't<00:02:14.460> fill<00:02:14.700> them<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:15.720> don't

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I don't fill them up because they don't

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.060 
I don't fill them up because they don't
drink<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.410> whole<00:02:16.560> thing

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
drink the whole thing

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.860 
drink the whole thing
so<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.460> would<00:02:17.580> be<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> big<00:02:18.120> waste<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.420> water<00:02:18.660> to

so it would be a big waste of water to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.630
