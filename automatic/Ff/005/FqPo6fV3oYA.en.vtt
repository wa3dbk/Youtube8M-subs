mini pc and you should be able to see it

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.810 
mini pc and you should be able to see it
in<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.209> bottom<00:00:16.480> of<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:16.750> screen<00:00:16.990> there

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
in the bottom of the screen there

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.810 
in the bottom of the screen there
perhaps<00:00:18.820> is<00:00:19.150> running<00:00:19.570> up<00:00:19.720> in<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:19.869> top

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
perhaps is running up in the top

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.490 
perhaps is running up in the top
left-hand<00:00:21.820> corner<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:26.260> you're<00:00:26.410> gonna

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
left-hand corner and if you're gonna

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.880 
left-hand corner and if you're gonna
call<00:00:26.710> we<00:00:26.920> did<00:00:27.100> this<00:00:27.280> little<00:00:27.520> trip<00:00:28.420> on<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.990> x

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
call we did this little trip on the x

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.130 
call we did this little trip on the x
205<00:00:30.550> ta<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.210> we<00:00:31.840> were<00:00:31.990> getting<00:00:32.320> I<00:00:32.820> guess<00:00:34.140> in

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
205 ta and we were getting I guess in

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.430 
205 ta and we were getting I guess in
this<00:00:35.739> this<00:00:36.430> area<00:00:36.850> around<00:00:37.390> 20<00:00:38.170> frames<00:00:38.350> per

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
this this area around 20 frames per

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.690 
this this area around 20 frames per
second<00:00:38.800> I<00:00:38.890> believe<00:00:40.770> late<00:00:41.770> teens<00:00:42.070> early

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
second I believe late teens early

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.060 
second I believe late teens early
twenties<00:00:43.180> so<00:00:43.450> it's<00:00:44.260> significantly<00:00:44.829> higher

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
twenties so it's significantly higher

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.520 
twenties so it's significantly higher
here<00:00:45.400> this<00:00:45.670> is<00:00:45.850> 720p<00:00:46.210> this<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.260> most

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
here this is 720p this is the most

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.639 
here this is 720p this is the most
setting<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:51.370> looking<00:00:51.550> pretty<00:00:51.670> good

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
setting and it's looking pretty good

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.990 
setting and it's looking pretty good
what<00:00:53.649> we'll<00:00:53.770> do<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.190> we<00:00:55.000> will<00:00:55.210> just<00:00:56.970> hit<00:00:57.970> a

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
what we'll do is we will just hit a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.549 
what we'll do is we will just hit a
couple<00:00:58.210> places<00:00:58.510> see<00:00:58.870> how<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:58.989> frame<00:00:59.230> rate<00:00:59.410> is

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
couple places see how the frame rate is

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.799 
couple places see how the frame rate is
and<00:00:59.890> at<00:01:00.610> least<00:01:00.760> give<00:01:00.910> you<00:01:00.940> some<00:01:01.300> idea<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.630> how

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
and at least give you some idea of how

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:47.060 
and at least give you some idea of how
this<00:01:02.020> plays<00:01:02.290> on<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:03.489> HP<00:01:03.790> screen<00:01:04.239> mini<00:01:04.420> PC

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.860 

you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.300> frame<00:01:48.510> rate<00:01:48.540> is

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
you can see that the frame rate is

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.510 
you can see that the frame rate is
actually<00:01:49.110> doing<00:01:49.470> quite<00:01:49.500> well<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
actually doing quite well on this this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.930 
actually doing quite well on this this
is<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.700> much<00:01:50.910> stronger<00:01:51.210> processor<00:01:52.940> I'm

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
is a much stronger processor I'm

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.300 
is a much stronger processor I'm
actually<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.480> of<00:01:54.540> surprised<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:56.040> high

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
actually kind of surprised at how high

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.620 
actually kind of surprised at how high
we're<00:01:56.580> getting<00:01:58.250> but<00:01:59.250> yeah<00:01:59.970> pretty<00:02:00.240> pretty

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
we're getting but yeah pretty pretty

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:10.580 
we're getting but yeah pretty pretty
good<00:02:08.540> all<00:02:09.540> right<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.020> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.410> dark

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
good all right this is kind of a dark

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.480 
good all right this is kind of a dark
area<00:02:10.890> let<00:02:11.520> me<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.790> go<00:02:11.880> into<00:02:12.030> another<00:02:12.210> one<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
area let me just go into another one and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.640 
area let me just go into another one and
right<00:02:14.490> back<00:02:14.700> all<00:02:15.450> right<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:15.960> are<00:02:15.990> in<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
right back all right here we are in the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.699 
right back all right here we are in the
blood<00:02:17.070> elf<00:02:17.310> area<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.120> am<00:02:18.300> NOT<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.720> seasoned<00:02:19.380> World

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
blood elf area I am NOT a seasoned World

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.080 
blood elf area I am NOT a seasoned World
of<00:02:19.890> Warcraft<00:02:20.550> player<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:22.670> we've<00:02:23.670> got<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> lot

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
of Warcraft player but we've got a lot

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.140 
of Warcraft player but we've got a lot
of<00:02:24.120> NPCs<00:02:24.990> here<00:02:25.230> which<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> good<00:02:26.190> thing<00:02:26.880> now

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
of NPCs here which is a good thing now

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.780 
of NPCs here which is a good thing now
the<00:02:27.990> framerate<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.440> crazy<00:02:29.250> high

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the framerate is crazy high

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.410 
the framerate is crazy high
so<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.390> liken<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.730> once<00:02:32.730> again<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.300> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
so I liken that once again this is the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:45.470 
so I liken that once again this is the
low<00:02:33.630> setting<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:44.640> think<00:02:44.850> until<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.120> just

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
low setting and I think until I just

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.199 
low setting and I think until I just
started<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.870> character<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.650> uh<00:02:48.470> let's<00:02:50.209> set

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
started this character so uh let's set

00:02:51.209 --> 00:03:00.850 
started this character so uh let's set
the<00:02:51.510> graphics<00:02:52.350> options<00:02:55.550> from<00:02:56.550> low<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.540> fair

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.560 

then<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.980> should<00:03:02.220> give<00:03:02.400> us<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.670> bit<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.360> hit

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
then I should give us a bit of a hit

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.009 
then I should give us a bit of a hit
there

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
there

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.670 
there
all<00:03:04.799> right<00:03:04.980> we've<00:03:05.160> dropped<00:03:05.430> down<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.590> 35<00:03:07.590> 36<00:03:08.070> 37

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
all right we've dropped down to 35 36 37

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:41.260 
all right we've dropped down to 35 36 37
and<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:12.860> little<00:03:13.860> bit<00:03:13.980> better<00:03:14.160> looking

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.070 

not<00:03:41.450> bad<00:03:41.690> anyways<00:03:42.170> let's<00:03:42.830> hit<00:03:43.010> another<00:03:43.160> area

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
not bad anyways let's hit another area

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.600 
not bad anyways let's hit another area
it's<00:03:45.080> all<00:03:45.170> about<00:03:45.380> seeing<00:03:45.650> how<00:03:45.830> we<00:03:45.890> perform<00:03:46.340> on

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
it's all about seeing how we perform on

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.750 
it's all about seeing how we perform on
the<00:03:46.820> different<00:03:47.240> spots<00:03:47.630> on<00:03:47.960> the<00:03:48.020> game<00:03:48.350> so<00:03:48.860> be

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
the different spots on the game so be

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.060 
the different spots on the game so be
right<00:03:49.940> back

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
right back

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.530 
right back
and<00:03:52.070> welcome<00:03:52.370> back<00:03:52.520> here<00:03:52.730> we<00:03:52.880> are<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.240> last

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
and welcome back here we are in the last

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.910 
and welcome back here we are in the last
part<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.170> we're<00:03:54.260> going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.410> take<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> look<00:03:54.800> at

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
part that we're going to take a look at

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.370 
part that we're going to take a look at
and<00:03:55.250> this<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.760> pinned<00:03:56.090> area<00:03:56.510> area<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:56.990> guess

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
and this is the pinned area area I guess

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.720 
and this is the pinned area area I guess
if<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.770> can<00:03:57.950> say<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.220> right<00:03:58.430> and<00:04:00.520> again<00:04:01.520> some

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
if I can say that right and again some

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.440 
if I can say that right and again some
very<00:04:01.880> nice<00:04:02.000> frame<00:04:02.270> rates<00:04:02.450> this<00:04:02.630> is<00:04:02.690> low<00:04:04.450> but

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
very nice frame rates this is low but

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.740 
very nice frame rates this is low but
this<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.350> kind<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.740> nice<00:04:07.030> area<00:04:08.030> very<00:04:08.360> lush

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
this is kind of a nice area very lush

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.870 
this is kind of a nice area very lush
looking<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.650> like<00:04:10.490> it<00:04:12.430> again<00:04:13.430> I'm<00:04:13.550> not<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.730> big

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
looking I like it again I'm not a big

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.740 
looking I like it again I'm not a big
wild<00:04:14.180> player<00:04:14.420> but<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:16.580> know<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.630> is

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
wild player but you know it is it is

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.490 
wild player but you know it is it is
kind<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.110> fun<00:04:18.320> game<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:20.230> can<00:04:21.230> see<00:04:21.380> how<00:04:21.440> people

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
kind of a fun game I can see how people

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.740 
kind of a fun game I can see how people
get<00:04:21.830> into<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:26.150> as<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.360> can<00:04:26.420> see<00:04:26.480> we're

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
get into it so as you can see we're

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.020 
get into it so as you can see we're
hitting<00:04:26.930> some<00:04:27.140> really<00:04:27.500> nice<00:04:27.680> frame<00:04:28.580> rates<00:04:28.820> but

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
hitting some really nice frame rates but

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.230 
hitting some really nice frame rates but
once<00:04:29.360> again<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:31.460> low<00:04:31.640> setting

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
once again this is the the low setting

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.590 
once again this is the the low setting
so<00:04:34.270> let's<00:04:35.270> boost<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.990> up<00:04:36.140> to<00:04:37.150> fare<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:41.300> see

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
so let's boost it up to fare and see

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.530 
so let's boost it up to fare and see
what<00:04:41.720> kind<00:04:41.900> of<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:42.020> hit<00:04:42.170> we<00:04:42.290> get

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.190 

right<00:04:49.990> so<00:04:50.140> we're<00:04:50.260> going<00:04:50.410> from<00:04:50.800> roughly<00:04:51.430> about

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
right so we're going from roughly about

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.890 
right so we're going from roughly about
Wow<00:04:53.200> going<00:04:53.680> from<00:04:53.920> just<00:04:54.250> under<00:04:54.640> 60<00:04:55.060> 59<00:04:55.360> frames<00:04:55.750> a

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
Wow going from just under 60 59 frames a

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:05.760 
Wow going from just under 60 59 frames a
second<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.430> 25<00:04:58.140> now<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:05.350> know<00:05:05.440> our<00:05:05.470> draw

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
second to 25 now you know our draw

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.490 
second to 25 now you know our draw
distances<00:05:06.370> up<00:05:06.610> at<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.810> details<00:05:08.230> are<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.440> little

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
distances up at the details are a little

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.240 
distances up at the details are a little
better<00:05:08.800> but<00:05:09.040> I<00:05:11.340> hear<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.330> shadow<00:05:13.780> is<00:05:14.320> the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
better but I hear that the shadow is the

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.710 
better but I hear that the shadow is the
thing<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.460> really<00:05:15.760> takes<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.120> big<00:05:16.270> hit<00:05:16.450> on<00:05:16.480> it

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
thing that really takes a big hit on it

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.310 
thing that really takes a big hit on it
so<00:05:16.870> let's<00:05:17.050> change<00:05:17.590> shadow<00:05:17.920> quality<00:05:18.190> from<00:05:18.520> fair

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
so let's change shadow quality from fair

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:28.200 
so let's change shadow quality from fair
down<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.830> low<00:05:24.270> Wow<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:26.050> we<00:05:26.140> went<00:05:26.290> from<00:05:26.410> about<00:05:27.210> 25

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
down to low Wow so we went from about 25

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.680 
down to low Wow so we went from about 25
up<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:30.120> 40<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.300> 44<00:05:32.110> teased<00:05:33.070> somebody<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:34.240> 9

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
up to 40 to 44 teased somebody to 9

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.680 
up to 40 to 44 teased somebody to 9
frames<00:05:34.990> a<00:05:35.170> second<00:05:35.640> just<00:05:36.640> by<00:05:36.880> removing<00:05:37.150> shadows

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
frames a second just by removing shadows

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.840 
frames a second just by removing shadows
down<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.170> low<00:05:38.320> so<00:05:40.500> yeah<00:05:41.500> I<00:05:41.530> think<00:05:42.430> this<00:05:42.670> is<00:05:42.730> a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
down to low so yeah I think this is a

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:50.420 
down to low so yeah I think this is a
nice<00:05:43.090> compromise<00:05:44.460> very<00:05:45.460> pretty<00:05:45.700> looking<00:05:46.000> game

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.620 

so<00:05:51.430> anyway<00:05:51.670> so<00:05:51.820> there<00:05:51.970> you<00:05:52.090> have<00:05:52.120> it<00:05:52.270> there's

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
so anyway so there you have it there's

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.180 
so anyway so there you have it there's
world<00:05:53.530> of<00:05:53.680> warcraft<00:05:54.160> on<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:55.720> HP<00:05:56.110> stream<00:05:56.470> mini

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
world of warcraft on the HP stream mini

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.620 
world of warcraft on the HP stream mini
pc<00:05:57.730> and<00:05:58.060> once<00:05:58.330> again<00:05:58.480> this<00:05:58.660> is<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:58.840> 200<00:05:59.830> -<00:06:00.330> 0<00:06:01.330> 10

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
pc and once again this is the 200 - 0 10

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.360 
pc and once again this is the 200 - 0 10
model<00:06:01.990> if<00:06:02.140> they<00:06:02.320> ever<00:06:02.470> make<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.770> model<00:06:03.130> change

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
model if they ever make a model change

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.470 
model if they ever make a model change
in<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:03.580> future<00:06:03.910> and<00:06:04.680> it's<00:06:06.240> it's<00:06:07.240> quite<00:06:07.390> good

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
in the future and it's it's quite good

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.300 
in the future and it's it's quite good
for<00:06:09.870> smaller<00:06:10.870> games<00:06:11.170> like<00:06:11.380> this<00:06:11.530> or<00:06:11.680> I<00:06:11.770> should

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
for smaller games like this or I should

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.260 
for smaller games like this or I should
say<00:06:12.520> less<00:06:13.330> graphically<00:06:14.200> intensive<00:06:14.770> games<00:06:15.270> so

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
say less graphically intensive games so

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.900 
say less graphically intensive games so
once<00:06:16.960> again<00:06:17.110> this<00:06:17.350> is<00:06:17.470> the<00:06:17.650> fair<00:06:18.160> setting<00:06:18.670> and

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
once again this is the fair setting and

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.240 
once again this is the fair setting and
we<00:06:19.570> just<00:06:19.810> turned<00:06:19.960> shadows<00:06:20.380> down<00:06:20.620> to<00:06:20.830> low<00:06:20.980> and

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
we just turned shadows down to low and

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.320 
we just turned shadows down to low and
that<00:06:21.280> seems<00:06:21.730> to<00:06:21.820> have<00:06:21.940> made<00:06:22.030> a<00:06:22.090> huge

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
that seems to have made a huge

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.820 
that seems to have made a huge
difference<00:06:22.450> in<00:06:22.990> framerate<00:06:23.730> so<00:06:24.730> anyways

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
difference in framerate so anyways

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.260 
difference in framerate so anyways
