 Translator: Etrit Adami Reviewer: Ervis Bregu 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
 You have the kind of magic I like, and I'm a magician, 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
 is the magic that uses technology 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
 to create illusions. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
 So I would like to tell you something I worked for. 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 It's an app 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
 that I think may be necessary for artists - 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
 multimedia artists in particular. 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
 This app sync videos 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
 between several mobile display screens. 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 And I owe these three IPods 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 from people here in the audience 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 to tell you what I mean. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 And I will use them to show you 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
 a bit about my favorite theme: 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 fraud. 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 (Music) 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 One of my favorite witches 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 is Karl Germain. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 He did this wonderful trek 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 where a rose will shatter 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 before your eyes. 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 But it was the production of a butterfly 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 which was the most beautiful. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 (Registration) Ladies and Gentlemen, 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 creation of life. 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 (Applause) 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 (Music) 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 Marko Tempest: When asked about cheating, 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
 he said this: 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 Folesi: Magic is the most honest profession. 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
 A magician promises to mislead you-- 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
 and he does. 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 MT: With the diaper I think of myself as an honest magician. 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 I use many tricks, 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 Which means 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
 sometimes I have to lie to you. 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
 Now I feel bad about it. 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
 But people are lagging behind. 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 (Blinking) Prit. 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 Girl in Phone: Hey, where are you? 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 MT; I got stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon enough. 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
 You've all done this. 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 (Laughter) 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
 Ladies: We will be ready for a minute, dear. 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
 Husband: It's exactly what I've always loved. 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
 Grungy: You're fantastic. 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
 MT: Fraud, 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.260
 is a vital part of life. 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.260
 Now surveys show 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
 that men say twice as much lies 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 how many grandsons - 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 assuming that the woman they asked was the truth. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
 (Laughter) 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 We are sorry to be in the lead 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 and to hide our weaknesses. 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 Chinese General Sun Tzu 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 said the whole war 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260
 is based on fraud. 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 Oscar Uaild 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.260
 said the same thing about romance. 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
 Some people 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
 cheat for leke. 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 Let's do a game. 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.260
 Three cards, three options. 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.260
 Speaker: A 5 will give you 10, and 10 will give you 20. 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 Now where is the lady? 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260
 Where is the queen? 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.260
 MT: This? 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 Sorry to lose you. 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
 Well, I did not bother you. 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
 You deceived yourself. 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
 Self-deception. 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
 This is when we fill our minds 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
 that lies is true. 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
 Sometimes it is difficult to see them both. 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
 Manipulated 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
 are experts in self-deception. 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
 (Shaving Machine) 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260
 They think they can win. 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
 They forget how many times have they lost. 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
 The brain is very good at forgetting. 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
 Bad moments are quickly forgotten. 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.260
 Bad moments 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.260
 disappear quickly. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.260
 That is why it is in the middle of a great cosmos, 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.260
 we are wonderfully optimistic. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
 Our self-deception 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
 it becomes a positive illusion - 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
 why movies 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 are able to lead us into extraordinary adventures; 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260
 why do we trust Romeo 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
 when he says he loves Zhulieten; 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.260
 and why singles singles of music, 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
 when played together, 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
 become a sonata and bring the meaning to mind. 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
 This is "The Light of the Moon." 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
 Her composer Debysi 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
 said that art 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.260
 was the most beautiful fraud of everyone. 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
 Art is a trick 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260
 that creates real emotions - 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.260
 a lie creates a real one. 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.260
 And when you give yourself that trick, 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.260
 it becomes magic. 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:53.260
 (Applause) 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.260
 Thank you. Thank you very much. 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.260
 (Applause)
