00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.210
 hello everyone my name is matÃ­as muÃ±oz 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.190
 espinoza and this is a new video made 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.339
 for elementary internet code in the 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.789
 which we will see how to install ruiz and the 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.789
 of skeet 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.930
 first the first thing we have to do 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 is to download and install ruins tyler 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.910
 is the act a what we have to download 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.099
 in our rugby version that that 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 need me for example I'm going to 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.270
 download version 2.0 point 0 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.670
 and also download the team of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.430
 here it has to be compatible with the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.750
 version 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 for example here it says to use 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.300
 for use with ruiz 187 and 193 it is used 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.790
 this version and here for the version of 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.780
 2.0 32-bit version is used 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.200
 I 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.550
 I'm going to download the 32 bit because 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.970
 I'm using a virtual machine and 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.610
 the virtual machine is in 32 bits as 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.880
 me and as I already have installed these 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.700
 two files east and east 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.600
 I'm just going to install them 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.850
 for that I'm going to downloads 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.280
 first installed in your install 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.290
 my English collection is accepted 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.040
 medical license here and here 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.770
 lend 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.010
 because I already had it installed but 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.010
 good 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.130
 and finish after this I have to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.549
 extract the file 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.570
 for that I give double click execute and what 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.930
 I'm going to extract in cee 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.430
 in a folder before 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.430
 this folder is going to create 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.939
 the one here will serve us to install 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.170
 gems that we do not know additional by 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:05.650
 example courses that you selected for 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.600
 to give you more potential with 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.370
 potentiality to the terminal and excellent 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.890
 ie with CKD and can not only 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.230
 install more gems than usual and other 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.200
 more things 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.750
 n 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.750
 now I 'm going to start the ruby 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.810
 and I'm going to modify this 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.130
 I'm going to leave here on this website 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.140
 I will leave in the description of my life 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.050
 in this web they come out as the steps there 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.520
 to continue to install the kit 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.390
 The first thing to do is go to the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.650
 kit folder where they are installed 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.150
 then we are going to do 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.150
 I do not know about skeet 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.750
 and execute the following command run 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.750
 ruby of each reverse point and nit 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.790
 click 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.810
 and then that generates a file 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.290
 set and mn 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.870
 I'm going to skip these steps and then 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.050
 finally I will run this this 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.440
 last step that your rubric point of 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.440
 view 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.989
 and with that we have the equipment installed 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.609
 now we can install gems 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.319
 for example as courses for example 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:48.170
 someone is pulsing 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.060
 that as I said just above to give 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.120
 more power in the divinity potential 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.650
 had finished 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.800
 well that's all we see in the 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.580
 next video 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.580
 and chau
