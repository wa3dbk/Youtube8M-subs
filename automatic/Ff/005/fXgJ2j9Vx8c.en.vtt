00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.120
 t 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.120
 m 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 queen m 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.300
 x 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.580
 but 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 rub 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 cube 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.119
 say the opposite
