00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.529
 and not ten years ago mean pressure in 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.339
 engine combustion chamber a was two 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.659
 times lower 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.299
 never before engine 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.949
 subjected to such severe loads 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.169
 online automakers 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.880
 seek to reduce the amount of harmful 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.179
 emissions indicated that in these conditions 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.669
 engineers must develop 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.289
 engine with all relevant 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.859
 more stringent environmental regulations 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.919
 damage to power cn so we created 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.850
 motor oil possessing a special 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.489
 resistance with new technology goose 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.540
 oil film 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.350
 technology reinforced machines are completed 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.539
 Ukrainian authorities is the last 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.350
 scientific advances the ranks of innovation 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.609
 development and build thanks to this new 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.559
 engine technology castrol edge 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.049
 maintains high film stability and 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.839
 ability to hold 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.659
 metal surfaces from 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.580
 of touch 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.370
 stocks we subjected castrol edge motor oil 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.500
 the toughest tests to 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.630
 evaluate the durability of a film counting machine and 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.520
 ultimate load resistance 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 and proved that they are essentially 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.120
 exceeds requirements 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.860
 industry standards for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.200
 automakers 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 and at night 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.490
 we invented a special technique 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.300
 testing to measure 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.620
 contact intensity 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.230
 between the cam investigated the case 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.070
 pusher class nasa this test allows 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.170
 assess the ability of the oil to prevent 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.820
 metal contact 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.630
 surfaces in contests 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.230
 having carefully studied the features of work 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.480
 different engine nodes we came to 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.689
 conclude that the maximum 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.289
 motor load falls on 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.030
 valve mechanism process 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.920
 specific pressure area contacts 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.690
 a loner became a boat can reach 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.070
 ten tons per square centimeter 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.049
 which is equivalent to the weight of two elephants in the calculation 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.240
 by one square centimeter 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.720
 as another you can bring 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.840
 following example 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.940
 imagine that you took a huge 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 dump and set it on a razor blade 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.510
 they are 4 this the pressure at the point of contact will be 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.730
 order gigapascals 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.079
 goodbye at the end 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.649
 in betting friction cam pushers arises 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.379
 similar pressure and engine oils it 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:09.899
 the only substance that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.810
 should prevent wear and tear 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.659
 zadir this and destruction details in 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.799
 conditions of the highest loads g 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.309
 Postimees motor operation principle 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:20.839
 oils based reactions to 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.120
 pressure applied 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.019
 in the contact zone, the thigh has become like or 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.640
 oil is experiencing extreme 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.590
 pressure and increases response 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.220
 sharpness reducing the area 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.629
 metal contact 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.840
 parts so the oils do not react 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.750
 only on the temperature change but also 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.110
 pressure tests were conducted on an example 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.349
 specific valve mechanism 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.709
 ooo center was exposed area 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.120
 metal contact 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.200
 surfaces under various loads and 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.840
 discharge rates 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.890
 we compared the castrol amount of work 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.550
 main competitor and make sure that our 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.040
 oil provides minimal 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.580
 metal contact 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.970
 body parts nasty according to the current 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.120
 engine oil castrol shoulders may look 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.830
 like any other liquid dancing but 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.480
 if we look at its composition on 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.790
 microscopic level with we will see that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.660
 oil has exceptional 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.610
 ability to resist 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.650
 bathing load
