00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:12.630
 lt-15 series stationary machines with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.059
 electric motor serial t15 is the most 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.859
 simple wood-mizer machines have 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.910
 excellent reputation among private 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.189
 entrepreneurs 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 this inexpensive equipment is easy 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 to move to the place of sawing tape 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 saw 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.029
 the most important element of any machine 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.130
 wood-mizer depends on its quality 90 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 percent success 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.239
 wood-mizer launches double hard saws 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.030
 which is iso standards 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.649
 9000 and provide maximum 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.460
 high-quality and productive work 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.879
 machine tools correct saw tension 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.820
 guarantees the accuracy of the cut standard 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.280
 The version of the machine LT-15 bed consists of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 two segments of 2 meters 70 centimeters 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.460
 or from three segments of one meter 95 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 centimeters if you need to cut 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.949
 longer logs 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 just buy and bed segment 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.670
 simple docking system allows 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.619
 quickly assemble the frame and align it with 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.659
 using supports which is regulated by 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.549
 height 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.759
 lateral stops hold the log during 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 load rotation and also provide 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.750
 precise cutting geometry special 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.369
 wedge compensates for log taper 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.080
 clamp and fix the log in a certain 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.909
 position 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.430
 the last cut can be done at height 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.430
 two and a half centimeters from the bed 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.549
 guide system transmits 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 Stability saw during operation 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.530
 operator can easily adjust 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.240
 position of the guides due to the system 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.830
 washed up and increase 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.430
 the duration of the saw and 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.630
 the quality of the cut operator exposes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.630
 scale board thickness 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.869
 limiters protect against excessive 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.860
 raising or lowering the head list 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.710
 moving head up down 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.580
 electric back and forth 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.649
 manually by 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.360
 handles 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.360
 machine alko 15 very easy to manage 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.810
 small but functional he 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.980
 equipped with an electric motor 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.980
 power 7 half kilowatts 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.120
 on request we can supply diesel 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.440
 engine v10 horsepower or 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.750
 gasoline engine 13 horsepower 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.780
 going fast and working reliably in 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.160
 Such is machine LT-15 more detailed 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.930
 information can be obtained from
