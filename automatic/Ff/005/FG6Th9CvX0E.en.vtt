I don't know if you guys have seen his

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.170 
I don't know if you guys have seen his
film<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.159> film<00:02:26.430> called<00:02:26.580> beast<00:02:26.909> with

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
film but it's a film called beast with

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.550 
film but it's a film called beast with
not<00:02:27.330> many<00:02:27.480> people<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.840> seen<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.470> he

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
not many people have seen it but he

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.140 
not many people have seen it but he
looks<00:02:28.739> like<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.129> if<00:02:29.250> you'd<00:02:29.430> know<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.000> main

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
looks like that if you'd know the main

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.520 
looks like that if you'd know the main
character<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.950> my<00:02:32.129> opinion<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.610> think<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
character and in my opinion I think that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.720 
character and in my opinion I think that
you<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.769> veins<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.310> over<00:02:35.580> his<00:02:35.700> face

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you know the veins all over his face

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.180 
you know the veins all over his face
when<00:02:36.390> they<00:02:36.540> are<00:02:36.959> doing<00:02:37.140> special<00:02:37.680> effects<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
when they are doing special effects and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.880 
when they are doing special effects and
stuff<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:39.150> they're<00:02:39.269> going<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.480> make<00:02:39.890> like

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
stuff I think they're going to make like

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.009 
stuff I think they're going to make like
those<00:02:41.340> veins<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.910> his<00:02:41.970> face<00:02:42.329> light<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:42.720> of

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
those veins on his face light up of

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.380 
those veins on his face light up of
electricity<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.829> maybe<00:02:44.430> light<00:02:44.909> up<00:02:45.060> his<00:02:45.209> mouth

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
electricity and maybe light up his mouth

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.539 
electricity and maybe light up his mouth
for<00:02:45.629> his<00:02:45.780> eyes<00:02:45.950> don't<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.040> about<00:02:47.220> his<00:02:47.340> nose

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
for his eyes don't know about his nose

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.650 
for his eyes don't know about his nose
maybe<00:02:47.790> he's<00:02:47.940> gonna<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.150> electricity<00:02:48.450> issue

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
maybe he's gonna have electricity issue

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.610 
maybe he's gonna have electricity issue
