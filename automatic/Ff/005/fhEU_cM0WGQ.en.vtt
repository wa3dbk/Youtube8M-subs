rid of mobs but what I think they should
do<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.860> well<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.399> give<00:00:38.520> me<00:00:38.579> your

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
opinion on it but do you think they

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.090 
opinion on it but do you think they
should<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.230> able<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> options<00:00:41.039> so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
should be able to have the options so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
should be able to have the options so
you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.219> disable<00:00:41.570> like<00:00:42.570> animals<00:00:43.440> because

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
you can disable like animals because

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.310 
you can disable like animals because
it's<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.329> annoying<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.870> creative<00:00:46.289> mode

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
it's really annoying on creative mode

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
it's really annoying on creative mode
you<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.980> there<00:00:47.100> building<00:00:47.430> something<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you just be there building something and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.529 
you just be there building something and
then<00:00:48.629> they'll<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.230> animals<00:00:50.539> coming

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
then they'll just be some animals coming

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
then they'll just be some animals coming
after<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.640> really

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
after you so I think that's really

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.760 
after you so I think that's really
annoying<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.440> should<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.680> able

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
annoying so I think you should be able

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
annoying so I think you should be able
to<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> option<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.899> see<00:00:57.899> don't
