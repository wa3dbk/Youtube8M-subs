sticking<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.810> through<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:45.100> perfectly

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
sticking it through like perfectly

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.210 
sticking it through like perfectly
through<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.510> bottom<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:47.650> your<00:03:47.800> heart<00:03:48.010> or

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
through the bottom like your heart or

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.670 
through the bottom like your heart or
whatever<00:03:48.460> like<00:03:48.670> right<00:03:48.880> here<00:03:49.500> because<00:03:50.500> it's

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
whatever like right here because it's

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.530 
whatever like right here because it's
just<00:03:50.770> like<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.400> goes<00:03:51.610> straight<00:03:51.880> through<00:03:51.910> here

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
just like it goes straight through here

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.950 
just like it goes straight through here
and<00:03:52.840> then<00:03:52.960> it's<00:03:53.110> harder<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.410> bend<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.960> in

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
and then it's harder to bend it like in

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.170 
and then it's harder to bend it like in
