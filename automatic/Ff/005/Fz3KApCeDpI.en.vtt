finish<00:03:25.280> off<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.730> head<00:03:25.910> because<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.170> will<00:03:27.260> be

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
finish off the head because it will be

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.820 
finish off the head because it will be
finished<00:03:27.860> simpler<00:03:28.310> if<00:03:29.180> we<00:03:29.209> do<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.450> now<00:03:29.830> just

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
sloppy right now but hopefully yeah I'm

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.490 
sloppy right now but hopefully yeah I'm
just<00:04:00.530> kind<00:04:01.069> of<00:04:01.160> trying<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.910> make<00:04:01.940> sure<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.269> don't

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
just kind of trying to make sure I don't

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.860 
just kind of trying to make sure I don't
overfill<00:04:03.500> my<00:04:03.620> memory<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.349> have<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:07.870> now

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
overfill my memory so you have that now

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.780 
overfill my memory so you have that now
open<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.440> up<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.250> all<00:04:10.910> up<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.329> first<00:04:11.720> floor

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
open this up and all up the first floor

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.300 
open this up and all up the first floor
right<00:04:13.790> there<00:04:14.290> then<00:04:15.290> take<00:04:15.590> scissors<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.950> cut

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
right there then take scissors and cut

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.140 
right there then take scissors and cut
it<00:04:19.400> up<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:20.030> top<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.780> book<00:04:20.959> back<00:04:22.150> do

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
it up to the top of that book back do

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.629 
it up to the top of that book back do
that<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.539> other<00:04:23.630> side

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.450 

this<00:04:29.270> would<00:04:29.479> be<00:04:29.599> much<00:04:30.080> impossible<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:31.280> make

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
this would be much impossible to make

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:41.589 
this would be much impossible to make
the<00:04:31.699> legs<00:04:31.879> in<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.330> we<00:04:32.539> do<00:04:32.689> this<00:04:38.919> so<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.599> don't

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
the legs in this we do this so I don't

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:52.429 
the legs in this we do this so I don't
have<00:04:41.749> that<00:04:41.779> I<00:04:42.909> feel<00:04:43.909> this

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.820 

put<00:04:53.439> that<00:04:53.620> up<00:04:53.740> on<00:04:53.889> both<00:04:54.279> sides<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:56.680> have

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
put that up on both sides so you have

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.089 
put that up on both sides so you have
that<00:04:57.509> now<00:04:58.509> it<00:04:58.659> kind<00:04:59.169> of<00:04:59.229> looks<00:04:59.379> like<00:04:59.469> paper<00:04:59.949> so

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
that now it kind of looks like paper so

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.480 
that now it kind of looks like paper so
far<00:05:00.310> down<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:01.469> now<00:05:02.469> just<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.860> finish<00:05:03.129> it<00:05:03.370> off

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
far down it now just to finish it off

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:13.629 
far down it now just to finish it off
and<00:05:04.479> fold<00:05:04.749> these<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.379> have

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:30.370 

and<00:05:14.259> make<00:05:15.259> them<00:05:15.759> so<00:05:16.759> they<00:05:16.909> are<00:05:17.240> blocks

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.870 

and<00:05:31.380> if<00:05:31.470> you<00:05:31.560> accidentally<00:05:32.040> tore<00:05:32.310> your<00:05:32.610> paper

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
and if you accidentally tore your paper

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.810 
and if you accidentally tore your paper
like<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.540> did<00:05:33.950> this<00:05:34.950> might<00:05:35.190> be<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.670> little

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
like I did this might be a little

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.390 
like I did this might be a little
trouble<00:05:39.200> you<00:05:40.200> want<00:05:40.380> to<00:05:40.440> make<00:05:40.560> sure<00:05:40.590> these<00:05:40.980> look

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
trouble you want to make sure these look

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:50.320 
trouble you want to make sure these look
nice<00:05:42.170> mine<00:05:43.170> doesn't<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:43.920> well<00:05:45.560> what<00:05:47.780> anyways

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
nice mine doesn't so well what anyways

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.950 
nice mine doesn't so well what anyways
so<00:05:51.330> now<00:05:52.170> all<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.500> got<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.740> do<00:05:52.890> is<00:05:52.920> strong<00:05:53.550> face

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960
