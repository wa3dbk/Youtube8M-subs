 to adjoin the corner doors here 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:24.100
 to god 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.620

 stock installed partition 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.860
 in the second compartment height or two seven hundred 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.170
 fifty on top we fired it up and made 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.190
 radius it does not reach the ceiling 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.280

 what kind of corner cabinet 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.670
 false panel cooked like this 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.690
 a fence at 50 millimeters, it will rise 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.690
 we have inspiration 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:51.819
 mount under he fasten to through them stuffing 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:58.709
 the panels blinded the false panels to our 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:04.239
 foam side and mounting tape 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:08.410
 masking tape so here she stands there 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.180
 dobore points moments on the lower rex we 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.319
 stuck 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.199
 two wedges under the rollers because the floor 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.410
 littered with 10 millimeters to his 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.970
 straighten the corners for bore that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.210
 we put it in the forest now we will 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.370
 mount false panel installed 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.389
 compartment doors 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:37.470
 combined here we will have 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:39.039
 drawings and applications of the door we pearl you 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.020
 such 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:47.650
 on how many to dry on here 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.590
 so when compressed and probably to 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:55.630
 tomorrow we will leave this view in the closet and 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.360
 turned out to be an angular stamp 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.099
 menu 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.099
