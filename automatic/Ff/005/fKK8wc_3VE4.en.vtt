 Hi guys, I dream of my life. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.740
 literary and I came today to do for you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.990
 a challenge I do not know if someone has already done 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.850
 something like that or not if someone has already done 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.250
 please correct me 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 but I had an idea to get some 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.260
 books from my bookshelf and use the title 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.199
 theirs to make a text 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 anyone who wants to make it feel comfortable or 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.420
 The rules I'm going to leave are only 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.239
 choose at least ten books and can only 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.790
 use between each title a maximum of three 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
 words and never can these words 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 to have a complete sense it has to be 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 it is their sense to behave 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.550
 with the boy it is not mandatory to use the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.870
 leaving the titles is only in the case of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.760
 be necessary 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 how I'm going to have to read the text and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.620
 show the books do not know how the video 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.050
 He'll stay then if he does not stay legal in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.079
 Aesthetic terms I'm sorry 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.059
 Come on, I made a charlotte letter. 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.390
 trade number 21 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.689
 Dear John, do you remember me at all? 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.340
 place of the past we had a meeting for 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.770
 one moment only 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.340

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.340

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.200
 the heart even to find it in a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.780
 I walked by crooked lines 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 in a world of glass knowing the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 advantages of being invisible 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.959
 it was a bridal veil one day to meet the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.750
 love at first sight 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.900

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.810

 back on the shelf I already had a job 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.860
 gigantic to catch everyone but I think 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.620
 it's worth it if someone wants to make 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.709
 that you will only remember to use 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.810
 a minimum of ten books to use if 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.000
 between the titles of a maximum of three 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.890
 words meaningless 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.890

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.910
