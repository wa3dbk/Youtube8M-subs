00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.379
 so or all the fun here again 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:17.850
 my eat hey people usecon skater 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.220
 a week is already over 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.320
 Today we come to my second episode 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.390
 First of all many thanks for that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 Great feedback I have quite a lot 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
 news in the war and I will 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.420
 the criticism in any case also to heart 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.239
 take a thing I understand only 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.610
 Unfortunately my not at all what that is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:50.820
 what should I pour with my rap 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:51.629
 departure a poor what you would it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.760
 also clarified 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.590
 big thanks to the people already 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.480
 main channel have subscribed to mine 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.940
 have put my facebook page 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.070
 even shared video 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.170
 big thanks, of course, to you too 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.470
 have only ever looked at my video 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:14.330
 You really are what you say 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.619
 So today we come to the news 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.509
 what makes a difference? 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.509
 Women's soccer from the men's football 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.300
 Women's football is really about women 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.370
 played 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.830
 but is that really how it was in iran 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.070
 now four colored players as men 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:46.380
 exposes what is going on yes and this 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.380
 player so the player the quasi 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.240
 We want these people to play 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.950
 excluded but according to avatar chemistry 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.230
 to which the medicine is the chef 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.470
 Iranian Football Association is that 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.890
 actually only half as wild 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.210
 men women 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.560
 the sticking point is that the men 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.450
 in the middle of the process of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.130
 Sexual transformation was when they were 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.690
 then they are allowed to do this 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.410
 in fact again in the women 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.680
 if they still play 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.850
 then you can not be male 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.530
 I do not understand why 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.480
 The result is that Iranian 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.010
 football association now really the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.050
 players also look under the skirts 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.840
 wants to really lead out are ok 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.700
 you a woman or are you once when 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.800
 you this obligatory gender 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.090
 they may have passed tests 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.340
 really for the women's team 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.140
 I would really care what 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.820
 you say I'm keeping me there 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.800
 in my opinion completely out and 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.600
 she is virgin and undefiled 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.480
 hear your opinion on it just write 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.470
 in the comments 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.470
 Now we come to the boxing 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.360
 on saturday the first march will occur the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.520
 wbo world champion robert stieglitz and the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.950
 berlin arthur abraham against each other 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.300
 hand so far so good 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.590
 explosive is the duel, however, because 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.750
 the two are already on the third 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.530
 a wm fight polish the face 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.750
 allowed 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.890
 that's the cornerstone of what 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.840
 I think so much now 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.480
 more interesting to find this tax is 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.330
 that this wm fight is transmitted to the cinema 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.530
 So will be in selected cinemas, at least 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.850
 from the German football 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.530
 National team knows that yes 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.660
 already the wm game for example 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.060
 also be transferred to the cinema but 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.650
 when boxing is the absolute neuland that 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.160
 There was even before in Germany even 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.010
 Not 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.990
 the duck well if I did not really 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.750
 interested in how you would feel 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.240
 ye the boxing match look at the cinema 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.620
 when I have my glass a bit 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.050
 annoying that the fight is not in now 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.470
 3d is transmitted because just like that 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.930
 guilty mouthguard and spit and 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.730
 blood to see everything but fly and 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.650
 Basically, what do you say to that ? 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.770
 When sports events in cinemas 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.510
 to be transmitted says the alg ii comes 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.880
 there is not really atmosphere on and 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.810
 I'm at home or in a pub 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.000
 much cooler 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.980
 or you can find them in the kilos 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.480
 mood especially good that cinemas 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.850
 Built like the deer stage you can 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.750
 wonderful ola wave let it start 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.300
 I know and comment on this video 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.350
 strip we'll just stay with you 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.100
 theme cinema 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.110
 because just that he almost like that 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.790
 I would have planned that person that we 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.470
 have just this transition here 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.810
 excellent because of my passion 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.240
 to the sport which an absolute film fan 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.280
 and because it is now in this movie about the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.990
 it is also about sport goes to you who 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.260
 I can do that wonderfully with a farmer 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.020
 It will be after 18 years now 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.630
 space jam 2 is speculating about it in the cinema 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.280
 bring to 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.500
 you already know dresses aliens call 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.510
 the looney tunes so bugs bunny daffy 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.540
 Duck and coal out to one 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.850
 basketball game 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.950
 the little nasty aliens the rg 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.960
 but only about that big believe themselves 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.250
 then the talent of nba players are 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.260
 once again not so small and 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.390
 seems to be invincible 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.980
 but luckily not 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.020
 talent caught by michael jordan 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.750
 because he joins the looney tunes 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.550
 There is a basketball hunt as a motto 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.080
 our special does not know then is 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.530
 the message actually not so anyway 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.080
 dolle and what space jam kempten 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.820
 could also do the story so what do I do 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.190
 So here we come back 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.440
 to the story in the footsteps of Michael 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.880
 the air is now supposed to be the kid 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.880
 do not talk anymore 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.570
 true king james namely lebron james 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.450
 multiple mwp of miami heat is said to be 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.510
 main role in space 2 to take over the 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.370
 was stupid at least for the first time claimed 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.930
 but that's just us from james 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.820
 now live interview has said that he 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.560
 not really aware of the topic 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.840
 and actually none at all 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.400
 has said, of course, is stupid 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.410
 he will take over the main role 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.150
 We do not really know that he does 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.010
 the main role 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.080

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.310

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.260
 I really do not like it and space 2 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.300
 I can only get worse than that 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.970
