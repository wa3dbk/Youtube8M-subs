00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.650

 from first postman on the ries this 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.150
 I hope 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.679
 I like it a lot of mountain 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.280
 experience in this room gathered without 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.399

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.399

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.429
 I would like to be with you next time 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.750

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.719
 base camp sit down my 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:00.719
 acclimatize 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.590
 People are simply not for it 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.990
 created the cruise altitude of a 747 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.040
 to work our bodies would 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.560
 literally start 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.530
 the question is, so we can get you up 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.530
 and down again before that happens 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.030
 almost hold 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 that is still suffering a few days 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.640
 and the rest of your life up to the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640
 man who was on the everest 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.640
 I can 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.490
 wanted whether now is already ran educate 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.490
 from the valley looks bad 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.430
 Sitting about people fixed and the current 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.290
 gets worse 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.720
 my problem the bottles are empty because 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.720
 go I do not let you back 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.940
 I do not like being 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.830
 Do you hope for me? 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.070
 you have to move 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.070
 No 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.310
 I love you 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.960

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.550

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.170
 we never escaped that was all 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.410
 part of their place do they want from 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.410
