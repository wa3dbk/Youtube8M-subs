field and it's bit of a flight line up
through<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.659> helps<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.020> with

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
through here and it just helps out with

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.190 
through here and it just helps out with
the<00:01:58.140> decoys<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.770> he<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.540> if<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.079> get

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the decoys really he just if I can get

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.719 
the decoys really he just if I can get
up<00:02:01.290> what<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.649> Gary<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> tree

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
up what if Gary can get up a tree

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.850 
up what if Gary can get up a tree
this<00:02:03.030> time<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.420> always<00:02:03.619> sticking<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.740> there
