very very similar I don't know how much
variation<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.859> is<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:35.329> yeah<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> think<00:01:36.479> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
variation there is but yeah I think this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
variation there is but yeah I think this
last<00:01:37.409> two<00:01:37.679> days<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.310> I've<00:01:38.459> just<00:01:38.729> seen
