00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.270 
factor which is the joys of working on
30-year<00:01:26.570> old<00:01:26.720> cars<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:28.130> this

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
car has one of the new OE our urethane

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.600 
car has one of the new OE our urethane
nose<00:01:32.210> coatings<00:01:32.750> on<00:01:32.869> them<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.979> when<00:01:34.130> we<00:01:34.280> did<00:01:34.460> our

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
nose coatings on them so when we did our

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.210 
nose coatings on them so when we did our
initial<00:01:34.850> test<00:01:35.329> fit<00:01:37.329> one<00:01:38.329> thing<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.810> we<00:01:38.930> found

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
initial test fit one thing that we found

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.370 
initial test fit one thing that we found
was<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:40.759> does<00:01:41.060> sit<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.540> properly<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
was in it it does sit in properly the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.240 
was in it it does sit in properly the
way<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:42.680> supposed<00:01:43.009> to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
way it's supposed to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.190 
way it's supposed to
but<00:01:43.880> our<00:01:44.000> mounting<00:01:44.360> points<00:01:44.390> are<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:45.049> a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
but our mounting points are just a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.870 
but our mounting points are just a
sphere<00:01:45.380> off<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.369> left<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:46.759> then<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
sphere off on the left and then the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.120 
sphere off on the left and then the
right<00:01:47.049> so<00:01:48.049> now<00:01:48.170> what<00:01:48.409> we're<00:01:48.560> going<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.799> do<00:01:48.950> is

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
right so now what we're going to do is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.130 
right so now what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:49.310> going<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.490> adjust<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.180> exactly<00:01:50.960> where

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
we're going to adjust this exactly where

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.170 
we're going to adjust this exactly where
we<00:01:51.350> want<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.920> then<00:01:52.610> we're<00:01:52.790> going<00:01:52.969> to<00:01:53.060> be

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
we want it and then we're going to be

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.410 
we want it and then we're going to be
using<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.750> drill<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.950> we're<00:01:55.909> just<00:01:56.090> going<00:01:56.360> to

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
using a drill and we're just going to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.499 
using a drill and we're just going to
drill<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.140> small<00:01:57.289> pilot<00:01:57.469> hole<00:01:58.149> into<00:01:59.149> that

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
drill a small pilot hole into that

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.719 
drill a small pilot hole into that
fiberglass<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.619> into<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.009> backer<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:01.460> that

be<00:02:06.320> exactly<00:02:06.680> where<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:07.250> want<00:02:07.490> them<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:08.200> won't

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
be exactly where we want them this won't

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.530

affect the structure of the nose in any
way<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.470> it's<00:02:12.680> something<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.070> do<00:02:13.370> at

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
way and it's something you can do at

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.400 
way and it's something you can do at
home<00:02:13.580> what<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> drill<00:02:14.330> takes<00:02:14.870> about<00:02:15.050> five

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
home what the drill takes about five

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.170 
home what the drill takes about five
minutes<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.830> do

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
minutes to do

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.970 
minutes to do
so<00:02:16.750> we're<00:02:16.870> gonna<00:02:16.959> go<00:02:17.200> ahead<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.470> do<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:17.920> now

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
so we're gonna go ahead and do that now

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.369 
so we're gonna go ahead and do that now
what<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.489> did<00:02:18.790> we<00:02:18.970> took<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.239> sharpie<00:02:19.750> marker<00:02:19.780> and

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
what we did we took a sharpie marker and

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.740 
what we did we took a sharpie marker and
we<00:02:20.530> went<00:02:20.739> into<00:02:20.890> our<00:02:21.040> holes<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:22.239> we<00:02:22.360> marked<00:02:22.629> our

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
we went into our holes and we marked our

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.350 
we went into our holes and we marked our
poles<00:02:23.019> exactly<00:02:23.650> where<00:02:23.829> we<00:02:24.010> want<00:02:24.220> now<00:02:25.180> we're

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
poles exactly where we want now we're

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.039 
poles exactly where we want now we're
just<00:02:25.480> going<00:02:25.689> to<00:02:25.780> slide<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.170> grille<00:02:26.379> back<00:02:26.620> out

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
just going to slide the grille back out

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.839 
just going to slide the grille back out
and<00:02:29.049> as<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.560> see<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.519> see<00:02:30.700> our

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
and as you can see you can see our

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.750 
and as you can see you can see our
mounting<00:02:31.530> pilot<00:02:32.530> areas<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.280> we're<00:02:33.430> gonna<00:02:33.549> be

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
mounting pilot areas that we're gonna be

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.839 
mounting pilot areas that we're gonna be
drilling<00:02:34.859> we'll<00:02:35.859> go<00:02:36.010> ahead<00:02:36.129> now<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.519> we'll

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
drilling we'll go ahead now and we'll

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.059 
drilling we'll go ahead now and we'll
drill<00:02:37.060> those<00:02:37.239> out<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.409> we're<00:02:38.590> gonna<00:02:38.709> put<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
drill those out and we're gonna put the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:52.009 
drill those out and we're gonna put the
grille<00:02:39.280> back<00:02:39.459> in

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.449 

all<00:02:53.019> right<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.500> we<00:02:53.590> drilled<00:02:53.890> all<00:02:54.069> our<00:02:54.250> holes

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
all right so we drilled all our holes

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.850 
all right so we drilled all our holes
out<00:02:54.730> take<00:02:55.629> their<00:02:55.810> grill<00:02:56.080> we're<00:02:56.349> gonna<00:02:56.470> set<00:02:56.739> it

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
out take their grill we're gonna set it

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.410 
out take their grill we're gonna set it
back<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.220> place<00:02:57.459> onto<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.910> car

from that and GM then you're going to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.070 
from that and GM then you're going to
have<00:03:20.709> five<00:03:20.920> mounting<00:03:21.370> screws<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.720> we're<00:03:22.959> just

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
have five mounting screws and we're just

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.660 
have five mounting screws and we're just
going<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.350> go<00:03:23.470> through<00:03:23.770> and<00:03:23.980> run<00:03:24.580> those<00:03:24.850> in

going to go through and run those in

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.300 
going to go through and run those in
that's<00:03:27.670> right<00:03:27.880> drop<00:03:28.390> them<00:03:28.890> all<00:03:29.890> over<00:03:30.250> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
that's right drop them all over the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.000 
that's right drop them all over the
place<00:03:30.640> hi<00:03:31.030> we<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:32.050> everything<00:03:32.410> else<00:03:32.709> when<00:03:32.920> we

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
place hi we like everything else when we

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.000 
place hi we like everything else when we
started<00:03:33.430> all<00:03:33.580> our<00:03:33.730> screws<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:35.019> we<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.470> got

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
started all our screws and we just got

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.520 
started all our screws and we just got
them<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.250> couple<00:03:36.459> turns<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:38.110> what<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.350> does

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
them a couple turns in and what it does

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.220 
them a couple turns in and what it does
is<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.800> nation<00:03:39.190> see<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.550> cannot<00:03:40.019> still<00:03:41.019> have

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
is the nation see you cannot still have

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.990 
is the nation see you cannot still have
some<00:03:41.440> adjustment<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:42.100> you<00:03:42.250> turn<00:03:42.459> them<00:03:42.580> all<00:03:42.730> in

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
some adjustment if you turn them all in

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.210 
some adjustment if you turn them all in
and<00:03:43.569> tighten<00:03:44.049> them<00:03:44.170> all<00:03:44.319> down<00:03:44.590> right<00:03:45.010> out<00:03:45.190> of

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
and tighten them all down right out of

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.309 
and tighten them all down right out of
the<00:03:45.430> gate<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:46.030> want<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.540> lend<00:03:46.660> up<00:03:46.810> at<00:03:47.019> them<00:03:47.200> in

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
the gate you want to lend up at them in

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.170 
the gate you want to lend up at them in
as<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.590> get<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:48.040> one<00:03:48.459> or<00:03:48.610> two<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.940> last

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
as you get to one or two of the last

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.850 
as you get to one or two of the last
ones<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.750> if<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.049> doesn't<00:03:50.200> line<00:03:50.470> up<00:03:50.500> perfectly

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
ones and if it doesn't line up perfectly

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.259 
ones and if it doesn't line up perfectly
you're<00:03:51.340> gonna<00:03:51.459> have<00:03:51.610> to<00:03:51.700> loosen<00:03:51.880> them<00:03:52.060> all

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
you're gonna have to loosen them all

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.050 
you're gonna have to loosen them all
back<00:03:52.450> up<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.560> we<00:03:53.709> did<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.010> just<00:03:54.040> finger<00:03:54.760> tighten

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
back up so we did is just finger tighten

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.539 
back up so we did is just finger tighten
them<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.420> couple<00:03:55.630> turns<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.920> go<00:03:57.069> back<00:03:57.280> through

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
them a couple turns and go back through

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.880 
them a couple turns and go back through
and<00:03:57.640> we'll<00:03:57.730> tighten<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.090> down

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:15.490 

and<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:05.720> will<00:04:05.900> be<00:04:06.080> installed

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.830 

you<00:04:15.980> just<00:04:16.190> want<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.489> get<00:04:16.670> them<00:04:16.760> tight<00:04:17.600> you

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
you just want to get them tight you

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.349 
you just want to get them tight you
don't<00:04:18.019> need<00:04:18.170> them<00:04:18.640> screamin<00:04:19.640> tight<00:04:19.880> against

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
don't need them screamin tight against

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.520 
don't need them screamin tight against
it<00:04:20.829> so<00:04:21.829> that's<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.250> install<00:04:22.670> on<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.530> really
