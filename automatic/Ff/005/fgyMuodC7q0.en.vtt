00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.389
 swap the ssd storage drive 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.400
 It's not a very complicated task. 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.490
 The biggest problem is the need to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.199
 install the entire system and reconfigure 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.960
 all programs after the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.689
 disc replacement, but if it does not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.970
 necessary today 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.580
 many applications for the cloning of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.640
 discs that prevents work and pain from 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.640
 head 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.450
 Let's do this with krones true blood. 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.079
 hd an application that comes with ssd 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.430
 quinton hype rex 480 we tested there 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.260
 little time but attention you can not 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.829
 clone a disk from a system 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.079
 installed on it so it is 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.899
 I need to start the machine from a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.600
 boot disk that already contains the software 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.320
 after selecting the language on the screen 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.629
 initial 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.870
 just choose the index club option 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.110
 menu made this a screen with two options 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.939
 should pop up automatic and mail 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.119
 the second option offers tools 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.340
 of advanced partitioning and how to 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.530
 first guide you through the process 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.860
 clearly and simply 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.960
 It's with this because we're going to work the screen 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 shows all the discs 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.939
 installed on your computer asking you to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 you select the source disk from the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.570
 data 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 choose the disk to be cloned and 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.590
 continue the next screen shows the same 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.119
 list of discs but this time you need 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.430
 selecting the destination disc appears in the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.729
 screen saying that all the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.290
 information on the destination disk will be 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.329
 replaced, make sure that you have 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.040
 chosen the right discs to not 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.530
 run the risk of losing some data 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.140
 important 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.500
 then a screen shows the summary of the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.049
 operation if the destination disk is 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.649
 larger than the source disk to partition 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.869
 will be automatically resized to 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.420
 speed of cloning depends on 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.050
 directly from the speed of the discs and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.170
 cut 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.740
 data contained in them after the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.570
 finish your new hd or ssd process 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.330
 It can now be used normally 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.720
 acronis true blood hd also offers 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.940
 backup partition option the process 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.370
 is very similar to cloning 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 just select the option b field on the screen 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.180
 initial 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.530
 then select the partition that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.630
 want to save the application will ask 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.710
 by the destination location of the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.170
 backup 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.600
 just select a drive that has space 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.260
 available and click get right name 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.510
 to create a backup this backup can 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.330
 be recovered later through the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.130
 reverse operation 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.990
 there are other cloning applications 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.610
 available on the market 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.180
 most of them work in a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.220
 similar to acronis true hd ie you 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.710
 selects the source disk from the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.210
 destiny awaits cloning come to an end 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.850
 and ready 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.170
 We hope to have helped you with this tip. 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.170
