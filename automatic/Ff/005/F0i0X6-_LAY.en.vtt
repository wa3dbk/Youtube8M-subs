up<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> tatra<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> my

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
up at the tatra just because of my

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
up at the tatra just because of my
excess<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.270> minerals<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.590> kind<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
excess of minerals so just kind of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 
excess of minerals so just kind of
matching<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.219> force<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:54.090> i<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.329> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
matching a force because i have this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
matching a force because i have this
third<00:00:54.690> base<00:00:54.870> i<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.140> he<00:00:55.350> doesn't<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.739> any<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
third base i know he doesn't have any of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
third base i know he doesn't have any of
these<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:57.390> Overlord<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.840> sitting

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
these because my Overlord is sitting

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
these because my Overlord is sitting
here<00:00:58.230> watching<00:00:58.410> any<00:00:58.800> traffic<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.430> goes<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
here watching any traffic that goes to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
here watching any traffic that goes to
the<00:00:59.910> area<00:01:00.329> meanwhile<00:01:00.989> look<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.039> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the area meanwhile look at all this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
the area meanwhile look at all this
creep<00:01:02.489> covering<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:03.660> great<00:01:03.989> for

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
creep covering this so that's great for

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.140 
creep covering this so that's great for
me<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.650> don't<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.339> he<00:01:05.460> doesn't<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> or

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150

he did destroy this overload so I'm

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.880 
he did destroy this overload so I'm
expecting<00:03:42.390> some<00:03:42.690> kind<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.110> expansion<00:03:43.709> soon

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
expecting some kind of expansion soon

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.620 
expecting some kind of expansion soon
but<00:03:44.100> i'm<00:03:44.220> putting<00:03:44.519> down<00:03:44.640> my<00:03:44.670> fourth<00:03:45.090> expansion

as well at the high yield minerals and

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.580 
as well at the high yield minerals and
he<00:03:47.940> doesn't<00:03:48.209> even<00:03:48.269> see<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.690> he's<00:03:49.170> been<00:03:49.320> very

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
even have a robotics facility so

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.060 
even have a robotics facility so
I've<00:03:54.420> never<00:03:54.690> seen<00:03:54.960> a<00:03:55.020> Protoss<00:03:55.410> player<00:03:55.620> not<00:03:55.830> yet

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
one of those just for the sake of

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.090 
one of those just for the sake of
getting<00:03:57.690> observers<00:03:58.350> did<00:03:58.590> he<00:03:58.710> even<00:03:58.860> know<00:03:58.980> about

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
getting observers did he even know about

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.550 
getting observers did he even know about
this<00:03:59.370> expansion<00:03:59.790> no<00:04:00.660> he<00:04:00.960> only<00:04:00.990> thinks<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.470> have
