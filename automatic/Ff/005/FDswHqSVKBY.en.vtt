00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
of the temperature and it's going to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.350 
of the temperature and it's going to
cook<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.820> lot<00:01:40.060> faster<00:01:44.670> my<00:01:45.670> suits<00:01:45.910> cooking<00:01:46.270> a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360

cook a lot faster my suits cooking a
little<00:01:46.510> bit<00:01:46.780> faster<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.320> this<00:01:47.500> side<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:47.830> I'm

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
little bit faster on this side so I'm

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.060 
little bit faster on this side so I'm
going<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.160> move<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.700> side<00:01:48.970> on<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.270> flame<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
going to move this side on the flame so

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.190 
going to move this side on the flame so
I<00:01:54.100> think<00:01:54.250> it's<00:01:54.610> ready<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.360> flip<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.900> like<00:01:56.050> to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
I think it's ready to flip I like to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.050 
I think it's ready to flip I like to
flip<00:01:56.410> my<00:01:56.560> omelet<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.340> know<00:01:57.700> it's<00:01:57.880> cooked

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.330 

Hegel

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.310 

so<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> think<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.790> get<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.300> can't<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
so I think I get I can't have the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:03:08.500 
so I think I get I can't have the
cottage<00:02:20.650> cheese<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.100> avocado

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.180 

okay<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.930> I'm<00:03:10.020> gonna<00:03:10.200> give<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.410> another<00:03:10.530> minute

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
okay so I'm gonna give it another minute

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.250 
okay so I'm gonna give it another minute
so<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.700> cottage<00:03:12.030> cheese<00:03:12.209> can<00:03:12.510> melt<00:03:12.810> inside

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
so the cottage cheese can melt inside

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.199 
so the cottage cheese can melt inside
and<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.160> want<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.400> show<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.640> something<00:03:14.970> else
