00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.110
 so many ways

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.979

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.650
 comment below this video is like 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.270
 always from youtube you will find all the links 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.460
 useful and also the necessary for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.650
 carry out this reaction 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.760
 I apologize if these jobs really are 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.270
 very simple 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.430
 however, I hope this video is there anyway 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.090
 both useful and inspirational face with 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.010
 your creations so good vision 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.710
 let's take the philharmonic for bracelets 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.260
 such as this in this way 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.560
 silver at this point we cut a 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.490
 piece and that is a quantity such as 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.700
 complete a lap then with pliers 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.000
 Cutters we cut about a round of 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.000
 wire 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.480
 done 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.890
 at this point at one end 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.080
 we make a small one and to do 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.470
 we help each other with a tip pliers 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.470
 comic 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.860
 that's it done this way 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.470
 at this point those are nothing else 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.110
 that decorate this circular base e 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.879
 so decide which to use 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.540
 I try to use these 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.360
 pearls these are 4 mm spring onions 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.970
 blacks these are always onions between 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.560
 from 6 mm always black instead then for le 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.060
 faceted 6 mm black and the whole 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.879
 interspersed with these washers 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:27.940
 this spacers this sedan is 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:30.370
 the code then start entering 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.140
 first the smaller pearls and more ad 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.140
 get to the biggest pearls 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.650
 so this is the final creation 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.590
 an alternative to this creation that 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.660
 easier 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.440
 it could be this I knew of 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.440
 philharmonic realized this oval that 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.530
 then it is decorated with the same must which 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.410
 golden the outer circle so I made a 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.230
 earring as simple as this one has it 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.900
 made a little more elegant a little more 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.390
 luxurious but at the same time always a lot 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.070
 light then earrings like these 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.870
 they are really very simple to make 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.760
 they can be done in many forms 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.550
 different 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.610
 clearly with different colors using 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.280
 tar the different ones but therefore they result 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.760
 of the two pounds very light however very much 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.440
 bright and very elegant I hope that 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.880
