00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.439
 Are you in the club Beijing like I always am? 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.869
 I'm happy to see you around here today. 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.789

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.640
 where he was quite successful here in 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.619
 channel that adds furniture to your home 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.689
 we will show in the mailbox one of the 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.460
 new items and have we have an envelope the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.590
 package the hammer 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.890
 the envelope or package are unique items 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.719
 that allow you to store items inside 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.000
 from the mailbox to another 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.100
 person playing in multiplayer my god 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.410
 heard a strange noise here and also 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.449
 detail god no one can take an item 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.390
 from inside or destroy the box 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.039
 if you are not the owner and do not 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.030
 this procedure here that I'm going to show 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.120
 for you 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.350
 got a hammer click the button 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.649
 right 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.250
 come on, come on, move it or now I 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.890
 Can I destroy your click again? 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.990
 I can not destroy any more and whoever draws 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.700
 can only draw the understand within it that 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.020
 was the owner of the mailbox 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.750
 this is very interesting for who played 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.170
 in multiplayer with that template to detail 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.960
 we still have here the hedge and the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 white fence both are variations of the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.600
 droughts there and we also have a6 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.289
 stone path that is made with two 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.360
 common stones from that sink 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.640
 for bird but it does not have any 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.770
 However, there was a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.710
 here our tap recalls 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.180
 that it does not work in a version 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.619
 1.542 does not boot 6.2 it works 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.689
 Funny I'm not out to get 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.469
 he may be tried or be a 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.920
 problem here in my game detail 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.100
 for it to work below it has to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.109
 have at least three to three water 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.229
 so we're making a hole in those 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.060
 here it fills up with water , this faucet goes 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.860
 to function 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.539
 tell me there in the comments in the version of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.370
 You too became Bulgarian, did not you? 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.530
 manages to catch the water that I not to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.130
 getting nowhere maybe 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.110
 because it is in the creative, right? 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.880
 it does not matter we will see after the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:28.060
 six take the test and tell me is another 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.800
 thing that we have now is not the chain 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.500
 rug I think had already appeared in the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.190
 previous version but we have the buzzer and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.000
 O 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.710
 opa occurred with not disguising my 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.420
 home and I need to run when I touch 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.490
 the bell 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.190
 good it fully functional does not need 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.520
 of toni networks or anything just put there and 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.990
 she will play several of the furniture here in the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.640
 my room you had already seen in the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.070
 previous version but for those who have not seen 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.750
 all displayed now if you turn everything off 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.180
 for you to see how it's next 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.280
 sit on my couch 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.110
 the functional're not quite in the dark 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.000
 season I'm with a redstone lamp 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.780
 on the ceiling to light up here and finish everything 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.870
 brand new 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.000
 if it does not look ugly you can grow creeper 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.880
 we have this counter where you can 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.010
 save items inside but it buggers 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.750
 Every time you put it on, it always goes. 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.850
 being turned to that side matters 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.770
 How do you put it on the wall? 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.600
 maybe in a next version they correct 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.650
 this coffee table does nothing 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.010
 too much 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.360
 aquino 4 4 put this kind of 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.000
 wardrobe 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.580
 this closet is a variation of the chest where 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.580
 you can stack it that's advantageous 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.290
 in comparison to the common 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.120
 You can not put anything on him. 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.190
 It would be interesting if it's playing. 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.900
 there even in a survival mode 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.910
 is not a very good variation here 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.920
 dining room I put a table 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.640
 made of wood and chairs made of 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.070
 wood 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.900
 this cloth on the table is actually 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.060
 a carpet of ours was an issue there 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.940
 means of creativity on my part 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.459
 modesty aside, here we have a new 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.230
 the new type of curtain is not 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.870
 in fact she had already appeared in the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.820
 previous version of this mode but continues 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.330
 working and working very well here 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.549
 I'm seeing bats where the 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.370
 adapt in the home lining that he has a 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.210
 Good open space here we have the same 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.120
 things 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.310
 and here we have the stove apia leaves 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.990
 show ap ap is that drinker of 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.430
 bird outside as 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.730
 the blinds at the front to give a 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.830
 better effect, it was really cool, huh? 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.050
 Let's go in the fridge, really. 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.370
 refrigerator is a chest you can keep 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.670
 just food 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.530
 we have here the zombie rotten meat in the part 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.350
 below we have a kind of stress that 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.810
 Use this freezer fuel to see the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.980
 it will cool at the little well 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.020
 style even from a furnace the food 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.200
 will change that way will not become a 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.080
 chilled meat to show zombie 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.350
 What if you have fuel for 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:13.360
 Freezer 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:15.310
 I want to see you my son here done that 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.290
 basic item you 're putting here goes 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.230
 stay full and you'll be able to cool 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.020
 again the zombie meat can be 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.170
 baked in here on our stove in the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.390
 furnace the bread from the stove is that it has and 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.680
 can bake up to nine items simultaneously 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.670
 it does not use any kind of 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.370
 fuel 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.250
 however it will not leave items like 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:41.110
 for example iron and only this food 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.590
 even from here the creative can not eat 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.680
 huh 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.570
 good one side the outside did not do anything 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.950
 different, we only have one 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.510
 some pool the hedge is common and 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.940
 I think it 's a bug inside my 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.910
 pool leaving the attack, right? 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.000
 when the water stop time and without drogba 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.120
 dengue mosquito also of the year 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.200
 could have just added that again 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.730
 in this mold 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.470
 I found it interesting that you bring 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.700
 I realized that you liked the 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.370
 previous version which it had submitted 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.440
 here on the channel is I will not be like 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.150
 graphing the items you can click on the 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.520
 link is showing up here too 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.770
 is in the description there already 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.140
 coffee of all the items here in this mold 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.520
 is chic except for the campaign that does not 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:30.570
 had the previous version 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.570
 so that big hug and one more
