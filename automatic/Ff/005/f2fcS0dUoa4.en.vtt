00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.860
 Why are people always outside my home? 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.608
 Why are people always outside my home? 

00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:08.254
 There are always people outside my house 

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:09.878
 How can I talk while they are here? 

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:10.955
 How do I make a video? 

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:12.846
 I'm trying to shoot video 

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.024
 Have they left ?? 

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:15.323
 They are gone! 

00:00:15.323 --> 00:00:17.142
 Well, hello everyone 

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.198
 My name is Tyler Oakley 

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:19.622
 My voice is a bit strange now 

00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:20.982
 Because I went out yesterday 

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:21.795
 I did not mean to go 

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:22.546
 But I did 

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.005
 I went out because it was a pleasant day 

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.814
 People are doing this 

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:27.891
 I think adults do 

00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:29.111
 I went out and told myself to know what, 

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:31.099
 I will ask for a soft drink 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.212
 With a little lemon, if anyone comes to me 

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:34.187
 He asked me why you should not drink 

00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:35.044
 I will say "I drink" 

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:36.283
 But I did not really drink (alcohol) 

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:37.543
 But someone offered a dose 

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:38.884
 Then I began to drink 

00:00:38.884 --> 00:00:40.611
 Because I said to myself 

00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:42.419
 Drinking is not harmful to him 

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.370
 But I stayed out until the second hour 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.392
 Back 

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:48.156
 Not at night, in the back 

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:51.245
 It was like a day of fourteen hours of tricks 

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:52.728
 I lost my voice somewhat 

00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:54.089
 But I wanted to shoot the video anyway 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.405
 Because it's time to ask me some questions and I'll give you the answer 

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:57.218
 let's start!! 

00:00:57.218 --> 00:00:58.173
 Do you see Anime? 

00:00:58.173 --> 00:00:59.473
 I watch it sometimes 

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:01.728
 I'm not an Anime fan 

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.593
 But I like some movies in this regard 

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:06.828
 I will not be addicted to them 

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:09.509
 But if there was a series to see, let me know 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.993
 Does your stool float or dive? 

00:01:10.993 --> 00:01:12.780
 In fact, rely on today 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.056
 (Laughter) I would have said 

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:17.514
 It is possible to enter the bathroom now and get out 

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.261
 And tell you what happened to the faeces 

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.415
 Will I do that? 

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.898
 I will return immediately. 

00:01:22.898 --> 00:01:25.885
 (Music) 

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.711
 Learn what happens when you study 

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.824
 You'll get lots of results 

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.814
 But there is a completely different result 

00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:34.175
 Today was completely different 

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:36.249
 Because I drank the coffee 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:37.934
 You know what coffee is doing 

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.556
 Make you protrude, and the stool does not look nice 

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:42.506
 I did something bad 

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:46.021
 What I did in the bathroom was nothing but religious 

00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:47.300
 As an answer to the question, 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.207
 Just like life, sometimes the stool floats 

00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:51.811
 And sometimes not 

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.660
 There is a rise and fall 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.281
 Sometimes you can not be above the water 

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.378
 But do you know what? 

00:01:57.378 --> 00:01:58.496
 in the end of the day, 

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:00.181
 You have to learn that all of us 

00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:03.291
 We wipe the bath of life 

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.282
 Hachtag Scheitsperachin 

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:06.561
 Why do you love YouTube videos? 

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.004
 Because I can know you 

00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.097
 I feel this is my chance to be able to communicate 

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.371
 With you and tell you about great things 

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:13.857
 Things can change the world 

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:15.014
 to the best 

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.472
 Sometimes 

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.154
 You donate thousands of dollars 

00:02:20.154 --> 00:02:22.185
 For charities that I love 

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:24.094
 We have raised $ 370,000 

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:26.635
 Very close to $ 500,000 

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:27.772
 If you do not donate yet 

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.133
 It's the perfect Christmas gift 

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.739
 I will love you forever if you donate 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.816
 Let me know when you donate 

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:33.157
 I will give you some love 

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:34.498
 Does your comfort resemble meat? 

00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:36.282
 I don "t think so 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.355
 Today, my smell does not resemble meat 

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:40.265
 But I will tell you 

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.256
 When I was at McDonald's, my smell was like meat 

00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:43.394
 I was returning to work from home 

00:02:43.394 --> 00:02:46.299
 Iow says my smell is disgusting 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.518
 As a plate of meat 

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:49.977
 I did not like it 

00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:51.704
 What is your favorite song to listen to in the bathroom? 

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.166
 They change every day 

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.300
 If you want to know any song I love now 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.944
 I have two links 

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.688
 This is not as two people say 

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:01.070
 Two links. One, two 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.860
 One of them will be at the bottom 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.770
 For favorite songs on Spotify 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.354
 And the other, at the bottom 

00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:07.817
 For quiet songs 

00:03:07.817 --> 00:03:09.117
 If you want to enjoy 

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:10.804
 Or if you want a quiet night 

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:12.084
 Or if you are studying 

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:13.689
 Click the links below 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.253
 They are free 

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:16.432
 Follow us on Spotify 

00:03:16.432 --> 00:03:17.914
 You will know my favorite songs 

00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:19.498
 They are there 

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:20.901
 What is the biggest goal without reason 

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.018
 You have in 2015 

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:24.538
 I do not like to say they can not reach them 

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.586
 I want everything to be available to everyone 

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:30.308
 Probably not this year 

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:31.485
 Maybe this problem 

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:34.659
 But I believe I can do anything 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.092
 If you work hard, nothing is impossible 

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.798
 Except this 

00:03:38.798 --> 00:03:40.403
 Do you keep a selection of your videos 

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:42.191
 No, they're boring 

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.771
 This is an example, 

00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:46.173
 I do not do that . Okay 

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:48.510
 This is a video without modification 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.034
 Enjoy 

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:55.031
 (Safir) 

00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.980
 Safir. 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.933
 I have a pizza place in my phone 

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:06.590
 Do you want a full video of this 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.845
 If you want, press impress 

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:11.264
 Maybe I'll make a video 

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:12.600
 From me so 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.792
 Did your mother eat a placenta when she bore you? 

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:17.233
 I don "t think so 

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:18.535
 If anyone will eat this 

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:20.323
 I will be 

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:22.740
 I am always starving 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.650
 "Will you eat this?" 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.133
 That's when I was born 

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:27.779
 "Did this happen to you?" 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:28.571
 Base five seconds 

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:29.912
 Well I'll eat placenta 

00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:31.334
 But if you do 

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:32.837
 It will be on Twitter 

00:04:32.837 --> 00:04:34.829
 Let's cook with Tyler Oakley 

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.071
 Well wait 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.183
 Siri, where can I find orange chicken? 

00:04:39.183 --> 00:04:40.606
 Siri did not find any restaurant 

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:42.658
 Who will write orange chicken! 

00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:44.101
 Siri, you 

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:45.726
 Siri now, now 

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:47.331
 (Laughter) 

00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.814
 That's all I have for today 

00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:49.771
 If you want to narrate video good to me 

00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:50.562
 Click there 

00:04:50.562 --> 00:04:51.618
 If you want to hear another podcast for me 

00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:52.451
 Press here 

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:53.975
 If you want to get out of my clothes 

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:54.869
 Be a week person 

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:55.681
 Click there 

00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:56.982
 Well, I love you 

00:04:56.982 --> 00:04:58.241
 Click impress 

00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.623
 I will love you more 

00:04:59.623 --> 00:05:01.552
 Send you orange chicken 

00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:02.549
 Because Siri will not do 

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:04.276
 I'll see you later 

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:05.793
 Bai! 

00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:10.610
 Siri where can I get orange chicken 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.104
 Seri did not find any recipes 

00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:16.220
 Someone outside my house said "Search Google" 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.056
 This is called disrespect 

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:21.378
 I came here to have a good time 

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:22.902
 And eating orange chicken 

00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:24.225
 Do not bother me, please
