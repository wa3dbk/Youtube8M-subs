00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.710 
this I'm playing in a Keith Richards
tuning<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.160> I<00:05:17.160> always<00:05:17.910> wanted<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.450> play<00:05:18.570> in

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.540 
tuning and I always wanted to play in
Keith<00:05:18.930> Richards<00:05:19.290> tuning<00:05:19.650> but<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:19.830> never<00:05:20.160> really

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
Keith Richards tuning but I never really

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.730 
Keith Richards tuning but I never really
had<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.730> reason<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:21.480> I<00:05:21.540> knew<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:21.960> someday<00:05:22.230> I

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
had a reason but I knew that someday I

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.450 
had a reason but I knew that someday I
would<00:05:23.490> be<00:05:23.790> forced<00:05:24.170> this<00:05:25.170> is<00:05:25.410> a<00:05:25.620> perfect

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
would be forced this is a perfect

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.310 
would be forced this is a perfect
opportunity<00:05:27.210> for<00:05:27.240> me<00:05:27.480> to<00:05:27.690> go<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:27.990> know<00:05:28.110> what

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
opportunity for me to go you know what

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.930 
opportunity for me to go you know what
you<00:05:28.440> can't<00:05:28.650> get<00:05:28.830> out<00:05:28.980> of<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.190> this<00:05:29.340> time<00:05:29.400> and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
you can't get out of it this time and

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
you can't get out of it this time and
it's<00:05:30.690> really<00:05:31.080> fun<00:05:31.350> so<00:05:31.880> I<00:05:32.880> guess<00:05:33.510> that's<00:05:33.720> what

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
it's really fun so I guess that's what

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.440 
it's really fun so I guess that's what
I'm<00:05:34.050> looking<00:05:34.380> forward<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.830> most<00:05:35.010> is<00:05:35.450> playing
