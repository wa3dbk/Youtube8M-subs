00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:05.729 
so I'm still in block shape the next

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.150 
so I'm still in block shape the next
step<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.960> I'm<00:00:07.050> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.229> go<00:00:07.470> with<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.800> band

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
step is that I'm going to go with a band

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.220 
step is that I'm going to go with a band
sign<00:00:08.460> I'm<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.879> cut<00:00:09.150> off<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.990> rough

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
sign I'm going to cut off the rough

sign I'm going to cut off the rough
extra<00:00:10.830> material<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.669> the<00:00:12.570> depth<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:16.040> where<00:00:17.040> I'm

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
extra material to the depth of where I'm

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.030 
extra material to the depth of where I'm
going<00:00:17.370> to<00:00:17.430> shape<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.970> neck<00:00:18.440> you<00:00:19.440> can<00:00:19.620> see<00:00:19.860> also

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
going to shape the neck you can see also

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.670 
going to shape the neck you can see also
I'm<00:00:20.550> jumping<00:00:21.390> ahead<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.200> glued<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
I'm jumping ahead but I have glued the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.310 
I'm jumping ahead but I have glued the
fretboard<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.520> this<00:00:23.670> point<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.870> and<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
fretboard on at this point so and the

fretboard on at this point so and the
reason<00:00:25.560> I've<00:00:25.710> glued<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.100> fret<00:00:26.280> port<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.790> is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
reason I've glued the fret port on is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.370 
reason I've glued the fret port on is
that<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.440> have<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.860> square<00:00:29.390> surface<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.780> clamp<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
that I have a square surface to clamp to

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
that I have a square surface to clamp to
I<00:00:31.620> don't<00:00:31.980> want<00:00:32.129> to<00:00:32.309> shape<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.149> roundness<00:00:33.629> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I don't want to shape the roundness of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.869 
I don't want to shape the roundness of
the<00:00:33.960> neck<00:00:34.289> before<00:00:34.559> I've<00:00:34.800> clamped<00:00:35.129> the

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
the neck before I've clamped the

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.450 
the neck before I've clamped the
fretboard<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.519> I<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:41.190> pieces

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
fretboard on so here I have the pieces

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
fretboard on so here I have the pieces

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
of the neck I've already cut off the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.959 
of the neck I've already cut off the
extra<00:00:44.960> for<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> depth<00:00:46.319> of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.699> neck

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
extra for the depth of the of the neck

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.939 
extra for the depth of the of the neck
but<00:00:48.420> that's<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.749> I<00:00:48.780> start<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.230> I've<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.769> my

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
but that's what I start with I've got my

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.279 
but that's what I start with I've got my
square<00:00:50.339> block<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.999> with<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> bandsaw<00:00:52.260> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
square block and with this bandsaw I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.579 
square block and with this bandsaw I
just<00:00:52.769> cut<00:00:53.039> cut<00:00:53.429> this<00:00:53.609> off<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.409> taking<00:00:55.409> it<00:00:55.530> away

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
just cut cut this off and taking it away

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.200 
just cut cut this off and taking it away
obviously<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.429> you're<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> shape

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
obviously when you're going to shape

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.479 
obviously when you're going to shape
something<00:00:57.749> any<00:00:58.079> big<00:00:58.559> chunk<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.069> that<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
something any big chunk like that that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.669 
something any big chunk like that that
you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.699> cut<00:00:59.969> off<00:01:00.319> beforehand<00:01:01.319> is<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
you can cut off beforehand is going to

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.880 
you can cut off beforehand is going to
save<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.069> a<00:01:02.100> lot<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.429> work<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.680> down

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
save you a lot of work so now I'm down

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.740 
save you a lot of work so now I'm down
to<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.309> point<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.420> want<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to this point and I'm going to want to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.920 
to this point and I'm going to want to
round<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.860> could<00:01:08.460> start<00:01:08.729> rasping<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
round this I could start rasping at this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.319 
round this I could start rasping at this
point<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.399> would<00:01:11.610> take<00:01:11.790> me<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.969> lot<00:01:12.210> of

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
point but that would take me a lot of

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.469 
point but that would take me a lot of
time<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.430> cut<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.729> off<00:01:15.000> with

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
time so I'm going to cut more off with

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.260 
time so I'm going to cut more off with
this<00:01:15.689> Sun<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.380> freehand<00:01:16.920> stuff<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.549> in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.569 
this Sun it's all freehand stuff and in
a<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.539> almost<00:01:19.079> hate<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.560> show<00:01:19.799> people<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579

for doing it this way it's a little on
the<00:01:26.369> dangerous<00:01:26.759> side<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.329> work<00:01:27.539> by<00:01:27.719> myself

a 45 degree here and a 45 degree here
I've<00:02:47.829> taken<00:02:48.099> off<00:02:48.310> quite<00:02:48.579> a<00:02:48.610> bit<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.879> material

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.069 
gradually going over and over this I'll
take<00:02:56.290> more<00:02:56.560> material<00:02:57.159> off<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.579> here<00:02:58.079> because

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
take more material off of here because

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.849 
take more material off of here because
this<00:02:59.379> is<00:02:59.560> where<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.829> meets<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.310> body<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:01.859> I'll

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
this is where it meets the body and I'll

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:25.930 
this is where it meets the body and I'll
do<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.129> I'll<00:03:03.250> just<00:03:03.489> do<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> little<00:03:03.879> bit<00:03:04.000> more

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.030 

you<00:03:26.940> can<00:03:27.120> see<00:03:27.330> I'm<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:29.000> roughing<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.150> out<00:03:30.300> and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
you can see I'm just roughing it out and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.860 
you can see I'm just roughing it out and
I've<00:03:32.040> also<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.550> healthy<00:03:32.910> caution<00:03:33.450> not<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
I've also have a healthy caution not to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.830 
I've also have a healthy caution not to
take<00:03:34.080> off<00:03:34.260> too<00:03:34.500> much<00:03:34.710> because<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:36.420> can't<00:03:36.660> get

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
take off too much because you can't get

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.540 
take off too much because you can't get
it<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:36.960> can't<00:03:37.320> glue<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.680> back<00:03:37.710> on<00:03:38.070> once<00:03:38.370> you've

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
it you can't glue it back on once you've

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.420 
it you can't glue it back on once you've
taken<00:03:38.760> off<00:03:39.030> too<00:03:39.270> much
