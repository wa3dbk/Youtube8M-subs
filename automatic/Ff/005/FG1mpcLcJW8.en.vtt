as<00:00:34.390> well<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:35.050> one<00:00:35.199> that<00:00:35.350> they<00:00:35.470> made<00:00:35.649> for<00:00:35.829> the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
Fighter for a video game that just was

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.959 
Fighter for a video game that just was
recently<00:00:41.950> released<00:00:42.130> so<00:00:42.579> I<00:00:43.950> guess<00:00:44.950> NECA<00:00:45.640> has

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
recently released so I guess NECA has

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.400 
recently released so I guess NECA has
made<00:00:46.690> figures<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.850> are<00:00:49.030> based<00:00:49.270> on<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.629> video

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
made figures that are based on the video

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.799 
made figures that are based on the video
game<00:00:50.469> it's<00:00:51.430> kind<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.640> surprising<00:00:52.090> that<00:00:52.120> sort

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
game it's kind of surprising that sort

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.590 
game it's kind of surprising that sort
of<00:00:52.930> toys<00:00:53.140> I<00:00:53.559> guess<00:00:54.129> lost<00:00:54.370> their<00:00:54.610> licensee<00:00:55.090> and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
of toys I guess lost their licensee and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.529 
of toys I guess lost their licensee and
Capcom<00:00:56.200> pretty<00:00:56.950> much<00:00:57.129> gave<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.579> NECA<00:00:57.760> so<00:00:58.510> I

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
Capcom pretty much gave it to NECA so I

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.610 
Capcom pretty much gave it to NECA so I
guess<00:00:58.719> that<00:00:58.960> guy<00:00:59.050> will<00:00:59.200> be<00:00:59.230> doing<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.870> all

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
guess that guy will be doing all the all

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.600 
guess that guy will be doing all the all
the<00:01:02.829> video<00:01:03.070> game<00:01:04.710> characters<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.890> guess<00:01:06.070> and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.890 
ulation you know obviously he's
double-jointed<00:03:59.349> here<00:03:59.919> on<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.370> elbow<00:04:00.900> these

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
double-jointed here on the elbow these

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.190 
double-jointed here on the elbow these
figures<00:04:02.410> have<00:04:02.680> such<00:04:03.099> stiff<00:04:04.090> stiff<00:04:04.510> joints<00:04:04.840> and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
figures have such stiff stiff joints and

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.349 
figures have such stiff stiff joints and
and<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:06.340> for<00:04:06.489> example<00:04:06.579> this<00:04:06.879> one<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.090> can't

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
and like for example this one I can't

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.849 
and like for example this one I can't
even<00:04:07.419> get<00:04:07.690> him<00:04:07.780> into<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.049> devil<00:04:08.349> there's<00:04:08.709> no

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
even get him into the devil there's no

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:09.809 
even get him into the devil there's no
way<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.099> I<00:04:09.160> want<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.400> do<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.579> because<00:04:09.669> I'll

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
way and I want to do it because I'll

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.089 
way and I want to do it because I'll
break<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:10.810> yeah<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.019> mean<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.500> guess<00:04:11.739> the

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
break it so yeah I mean I guess the

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.300 
break it so yeah I mean I guess the
paint<00:04:12.489> being<00:04:12.669> applied<00:04:12.970> right<00:04:13.239> away

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
paint being applied right away

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.670 
paint being applied right away
afterwards<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.549> guess<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:17.289> makes<00:04:17.530> them

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
afterwards I guess and it makes them

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.000 
afterwards I guess and it makes them
really<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:19.180> joints<00:04:19.510> mix<00:04:19.720> joints<00:04:20.680> get<00:04:20.829> pretty

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
really the joints mix joints get pretty

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.730 
really the joints mix joints get pretty
tight<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:22.030> then<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:22.990> got<00:04:23.110> double<00:04:23.440> jointed

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
tight and then you got double jointed

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.950 
tight and then you got double jointed
this<00:04:23.919> here<00:04:24.219> oh<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.580> there's<00:04:25.120> elbow<00:04:25.479> I'm<00:04:25.719> sorry
