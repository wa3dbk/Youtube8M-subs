00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.260
 hello everyone in this opportunity we ask 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.090
 to show them how to save up to 25% 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.650
 on your electric bill 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:30.559
 as very easy with this capacitor that 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:34.420
 I have in hands to start we have to 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:39.300
 in our capacitor we are going to put 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 cable number 12 on one of its edges 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 in the other terminal we would put another cable 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.519
 number 12 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.690
 that is , we would have to put a 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.289
 connector 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.190
 from its sides in the following ways a 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.859
 connector as well as this one 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.059
 the cable we peel it like this approximately 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.059
 this size 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.250
 we do the following way we put 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.510
 so we use a similar tool 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.090
 to this one that has back here 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.220
 the addition to make this kind of 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.220
 work we press it 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.490
 and as you see, we already have 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.229
 our cable 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.229
 we put it in the other terminal 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.780
 and we have already 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.119
 and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.130
 the two buttons with their cables there in 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.500
 the electrical distribution box 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.240
 We will always use as the cable 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.180
 the number 12 we will use a 20 a.m. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.760
 but a double man that double of 20 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:03.790
 amps 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:05.980
 let's find your space in the panel 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.560
 in the distribution box we are looking for 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.560
 your space and we're going to put 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.569
 a terminal in each part 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.830
 the break is here 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.830
 another terminal here 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.590
 we put them on the panel and this is what 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.870
 let's do if we want to know 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.069
 this capacitor by general 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.900
 we put it inside a box 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:50.200
 always goes terrified to the chassis if 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.359
 we want to have a signal in the box after 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.420
 once it is closed it is not 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:58.810
 arriving from the break to the capacitor is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.060
 connected we can put in how they see the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.390
 trained has several spaces for 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:11.970
 put them embroider we can put another 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.970
 basically here and we put it 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.080
 one of the legs of this pilot 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.640
 light bulb that is 110 volts in this 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.500
 case the airs of 220 but if it had 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.550
 one of 220 then I would have to put a 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.010
 terminal 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.010
 capacitor on one leg and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.569
 another in the other leg 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.569
 using this method 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:45.290
 and we would have 220 we put a 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.739
 bonÃ© en 1 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:53.390
 from the legs of the bulb and we bring 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:57.980
 of the panel a neutral and we put it in the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.470
 another in the other goal in the other leg of the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.940
 light bulb 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.840
 and so could we put two 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.599
 Bulbs one in each terminal 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.140
 in one bowl and another in the other eye bowl 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.600
 as long as we have air 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.509
 central conditioning in our house 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.080
 this capacitor will work very well 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:27.729
 will save between 20 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.100
 15 20 or 25 percent of our 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.610
 electric bill 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:38.420
 it is very important to know that if in the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:42.400
 electrical panel we do not have in that panel 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.000
 the central air conditioner 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.790
 we are not going to have 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.390
 this capacitor working in the way 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.300
 that he must work we never use 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.940
 paper capacitors we always use 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.130
 oil capacitors this is very 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.310
 important if we do not have in the panel the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.070
 central air conditioning we will have 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.100
 then the opposite effect 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.740
 to saving or we would have in a 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.470
 increase in the invoice from 15 to 20 o 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.070
 25 percent that's very important 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.070
 that zero 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.740
 if we have several panels in the house and 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.720
 We have different positions of equipment 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.090
 air conditioning in different panels 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.430
 we have to put a capacitor in each 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.400
 one of the panels as long as the 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.380
 panels are monophasic good friends 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.780
 this has been all for today
