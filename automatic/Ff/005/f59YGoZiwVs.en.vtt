00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 and now on this one on my foot 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.000
 she called me a Paki cling doing 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.000
 strip rip off all upas chest be 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.900
 hey guys, beauty agenda talking from 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.510
 so welcome to one more 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.970
 video leaked the video is already news 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 I do not know if I 'm the hand that matters 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 is that the flying skateboard back to the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.189
 future that smartphone is real he is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.960
 old real several companies tried 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 do but I think this was the most 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.950
 amazing I've ever seen is who did this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
 escape is true that invested in the project 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 skateboard is alex homs and was a project that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 already existed a range of products falling there and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.460
 invested heavily in this project 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.350
 more because they are commercial than by 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.910
 issue really make a flying skateboard 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.210
 but no matter what really matters 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 skateboard exists to gm together here and I took 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.239
 I will leave the link also from the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.879
 Original video for you to see us 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.590
 will see this year together and I'll take the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.079
 music I'll put my music on 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 background because right who does right 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 behind you know do not know how is 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 music situation but in the middle the people 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.810
 will see some things going to analyze for 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.280
 see what is fake what is not but it is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.619
 It's good to make it clear that it will not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.780
 see viewers on the street is beauty 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.610
 AHETA skate the Brazil already placed and then 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.840
 already has a vision a more or less vision 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.640
 lemme check 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 We have it here so we can not 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.299
 and that unfortunately already opens 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.040
 okay I will leave a little will 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.570
 stay together with my kiss music 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 what is so much trouble knowing 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.829
 really a hot float is not giving 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 to see what really floats you iscte 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.759
 the card climbs on top of him 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.470
 from that the assembly then does not 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.079
 People are going to explain how it works. 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.700
 It's real and this time it's real. 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.880
 they may notice that they do not have a car 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.049
 ropes and cables pulling brother better 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 in professional competition 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.530
 also out of the question of the world of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 skateboards but it's ross macmillan it 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.189
 tested the lexus hoverboard this is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.110
 control in spain 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.229
 Okay, you can see that really one day. 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.350
 they are playing in the middle of skateboarding 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.579
 no tuna go there to catch big 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.920
 As you can see, this is the most 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.890
 incredible is the skateboard passing over the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 Water is the content that is passionate about skateboarding. 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.220
 future he can go over the water 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.090
 without too many problems 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.150
 is amazing right fucking amazing car alex 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.610
 Watching this is scary right hand 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.230
 because anyone who smokes any stop 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.300
 the smoke and how this operation 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.980
 baguette is the following this skateboard 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.760
 that is there at the moment is that they are 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.290
 walking and such 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.410
 it was built only so that those who 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.770
 under the track layer 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.830
 even have a large blanket of magnets 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.500
 It's under that skateboard there's a 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.209
 brother a fucking superconductor I'll have 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 to read because it is very difficult to 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.480
 to understand is more or less what is a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.540
 track of 200 meters of magnetic blanket 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.730
 under the visa is included in the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.320
 Where the water is, here I am. 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.970
 I forgot exactly the part that is 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.920
 here is the flashlight of globo.com 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.459
 It's good to talk here 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.180
 the lexus robot was constructed with blocks 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.490
 material superconductors 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.950
 resistance to high electric flow 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.019
 stored temperature and temperature 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.880
 in small nitrogen reservoirs 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.010
 which is responsible for tracking 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.320
 the set - on behalf of seven degrees 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.230
 celsius because it explains white smoke 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.610
 leaving beauty then there is 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.050
 superconductors underneath this 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.820
 Big is very crazy when he 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.100
 get there he gets a part 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.590
 I really wanted only physics I do not have with 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.110
 the question of Iran and even makes a spark, right? 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.880
 so it's an extremely eye-catching situation 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.150
 This is very incredible. It's the first time 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.910
 I did not know how it worked and I stayed 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.950
 like that and I kept looking for cables 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.080
 and things that could make sense 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.060
 for the guy been going from skate to 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.200
 top of the water mending one ramp 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.250
 garage with enough idea because it is very 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.730
 crazy right 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.410
 Dating looks like this is a lot of hurt It 's too much 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.290
 we have to agree that there are 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.970
 many years a marketing campaign of the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.150
 lexus should really invest in the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.060
 the track of having this magnetic blanket 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.500
 down and to build on the skateboard 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.120
 true I think he 's the same 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.650
 project I've seen sometimes want a 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.419
 so floating the face to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.080
 from the needle running very fast 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.729
 briefly this is this system of the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.530
 This scene is very good, should we 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.330
 have a lot 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.940
 It's a pleasure to play and rob a car. 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.810
 a prototype kit was this is very crazy 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.610
 0 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.350
 the music is really good watch the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.880
 video will not even have the description I 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.320
 I put a song back there to 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.510
 You do not have to worry about days. 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.150
 and the people there spoke the staff 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.490
 that incentives including brother 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.440
 I play pink micron 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.110
 he said it's funny the fact that 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.310
 as it has no soil resistance is 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.139
 completely different from walking 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.760
 Skateboard Abusing Normal Skateboard You Do not 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.230
 can walk speaks guys falling in 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.720
 start presenting what is not a 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.130
 warm normal is one is completely 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.840
 different you have no resistance to your 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.710
 change posture to change everything needs change 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.660
 but hand in cream sent look at this 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.490
 Brother Focus I did not start 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.370
 can do nothing or skate in 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.350
 Up the water looks amazing thing 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.520
 caralh or caralh or write does not have 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.560
 car does not initially have a project 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.660
 as I said all mounted then 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.450
 unfortunately I still will not see skateboard 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.040
 flying is going around to some dude I 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.810
 is that so I honestly people who 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.790
 do not believe in the possibility that a 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.070
 day really happens and honestly 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.250
 I believe that one day can happen is 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.110
 that the insular 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.700
 cars because I think the 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.950
 technology will adapt a 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.750
 cool way know then be until in the 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.880
 but does not contemplate there are no 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.710
 rhymes and such and then he finally succeeds 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.570
 to apply this in a real way knows a 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.580
 skate park and tals 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.669
 What else can we do? 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.740
 over adapted technologies whether 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.500
 say as far as impossible as amanda 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.510
 good it is quite possible but a magnet blanket 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.430
 the whole city people to the streets of 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.440
 the cars start to float 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.200
 I think this phraya really because 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.690
 theory would not work or 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.729
 put in the closet help to adapt I 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.470
 I think the future the future seems to be 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.570
 pretty cool huh We are not here in 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.860
 future who has the composer but 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.990
 people are starting to enter into a future 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.460
 very interesting here and I decided opinion 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.680
 of you and that you found this 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.000
 incredible situation and if you liked 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.680
 video if you want more people with 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.539
 technology amazing things so who 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.310
 but have also already out but I will 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.330
 letting out on your favorite and if 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.310
 subscribe to the channel for much more 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.050
 content delegation was your show in 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.340
 but this video is what I expect everyone 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.630
 on a nearby and remembering farm not 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.729
 downloaded the app to the channel 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.289
 download now and stay inside everything 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.059
 What is happening here? 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.499
 ie the news that Leila denies 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:44.749
 interest is a version for 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:46.309
 android and has a version for the iof 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:48.589
 Thank you very much for the structure 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:50.979
 hence the package embrace is near and 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:50.979
 thanks
