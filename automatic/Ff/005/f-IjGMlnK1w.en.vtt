00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
products and it was only in 2013 where

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
products and it was only in 2013 where
they<00:01:55.409> switched<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.369> green<00:01:56.640> LEDs<00:01:57.119> which<00:01:57.360> is

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
they switched to green LEDs which is

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.990 
they switched to green LEDs which is
when<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:58.229> went<00:01:58.439> batshit<00:01:59.219> crazy<00:01:59.549> over<00:01:59.969> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
when I really went batshit crazy over a

you want the death ad death adder is in
most<00:02:39.810> popular<00:02:40.550> mouse<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.660> know<00:02:42.780> now<00:02:43.020> you

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
most popular mouse and you know now you

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.570 
most popular mouse and you know now you
can<00:02:43.320> actually<00:02:43.590> give<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.070> color<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.550> you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
can actually give it the color that you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.020 
can actually give it the color that you
want<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.930> either<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.560> spectrum<00:02:47.430> cycling

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
want and it is either a spectrum cycling

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.520 
want and it is either a spectrum cycling
which<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.360> says<00:02:48.540> which<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.870> basically<00:02:49.260> which

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
which it says which is basically which

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.560 
which it says which is basically which
I'm<00:02:49.800> guessing<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.370> cycles<00:02:50.850> through<00:02:51.090> all

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
I'm guessing is just cycles through all

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
I'm guessing is just cycles through all
the<00:02:51.810> colors<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.350> nice<00:02:52.560> way<00:02:52.890> or<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.490> can

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the colors in a nice way or you can

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.590 
the colors in a nice way or you can
choose<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.030> color<00:02:54.390> out<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.380> 16.8<00:02:55.980> million

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
choose a color out of the 16.8 million

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.960 
choose a color out of the 16.8 million
available<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.350> now<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.250> only<00:02:59.670> thing<00:02:59.790> I

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
available to it now the only thing I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.040 
available to it now the only thing I
would<00:03:00.090> say<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.510> shame<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.750> they've

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
would say is it's a shame that they've

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.050 
would say is it's a shame that they've
only<00:03:01.230> got<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.470> Kraken<00:03:01.860> 7.1<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.820> chroma

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
only got the Kraken 7.1 in the chroma

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.630 
only got the Kraken 7.1 in the chroma
range<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.540> because<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.560> 7.1<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.160> USB

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
range and because the 7.1 is a USB

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.720 
range and because the 7.1 is a USB
gaming<00:03:05.880> headset<00:03:06.420> which<00:03:06.959> then<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.430> ideal

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
gaming headset which then is not ideal

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.610 
gaming headset which then is not ideal
for<00:03:09.240> people<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.630> have<00:03:09.660> got<00:03:09.900> decent<00:03:10.200> sound

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
for people that have got decent sound

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.290 
for people that have got decent sound
cards<00:03:11.070> who<00:03:11.190> want<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> use<00:03:11.459> an<00:03:11.670> analog<00:03:12.090> headset

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
cards who want to use an analog headset

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300 
cards who want to use an analog headset
so<00:03:12.990> that's<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.320> little<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.770> an<00:03:13.890> oversight

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
so that's a little bit of an oversight

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.820 
so that's a little bit of an oversight
again<00:03:15.060> there's<00:03:15.240> no<00:03:15.300> dates<00:03:15.600> on<00:03:15.780> these<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.470> full

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
again there's no dates on these but full

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.250 
again there's no dates on these but full
spectrum<00:03:17.610> gaming<00:03:17.790> basically<00:03:18.630> it's<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.140> same

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
spectrum gaming basically it's the same

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.190 
spectrum gaming basically it's the same
products<00:03:19.800> but<00:03:20.190> with<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.209> customizable

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
products but with you know customizable

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.199 
products but with you know customizable
lighting<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.250> think<00:03:23.489> it's<00:03:23.730> about<00:03:23.940> time

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
lighting and I think it's about time

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.640 
lighting and I think it's about time
that<00:03:24.269> raise<00:03:24.570> did<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.140> it's<00:03:25.230> good<00:03:25.470> that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
that raise did that and it's good that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.830 
that raise did that and it's good that
they've<00:03:25.800> done<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.970> I'm<00:03:27.060> pretty<00:03:27.540> happy

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
they've done that and I'm pretty happy

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.690 
they've done that and I'm pretty happy
about<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.610> know<00:03:29.670> that's

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
about it and so that's you know that's

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.229 
about it and so that's you know that's
on<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.150> i<00:03:30.410> don't<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:31.680> i<00:03:32.340> will<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.730> buying

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
on that i don't think i will be buying

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.530 
on that i don't think i will be buying
into<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.080> those<00:03:34.230> because<00:03:35.010> i<00:03:35.489> don't<00:03:36.450> know

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
into one of those because i don't know

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.590

hesitant<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.939> try<00:04:57.120> as<00:04:57.270> well<00:04:57.419> at<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.599> same<00:04:57.659> time

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
because I didn't get on with a Taipan

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.679 
because I didn't get on with a Taipan
and<00:05:02.009> i<00:05:02.159> thought<00:05:02.340> i<00:05:02.520> would<00:05:02.789> but<00:05:03.029> you<00:05:03.360> know<00:05:03.389> i

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
just didn't get on with it but this one

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.490 
just didn't get on with it but this one
I<00:05:05.520> might<00:05:05.939> you<00:05:06.599> know<00:05:06.659> it<00:05:06.840> looks<00:05:07.020> nice<00:05:07.289> and
