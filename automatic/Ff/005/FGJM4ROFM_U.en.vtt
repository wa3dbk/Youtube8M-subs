00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.500
 hey people there is one today with the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.220
 budget plugin sexy mtd that is message 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.740
 of the day 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.570
 that basically changes everything 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 one at multiplayer in the server list 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.970
 so can see the mod the icon the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.050
 slot number and so on what exactly that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.050
 we'll see right after the intro 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.250
 Here we are already on the website 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.540
 by sexy arman t 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.800
 Here we see a little example how 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.020
 that can look like later 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.420
 It's easy to do that 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.399
 download 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.989
 keep downloading again 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.110
 let's go to the desktop drag that 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.260
 then we can do that again 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.059
 close this open then we go 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.589
 in the plugins folder pull that in there 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:02.629
 go back and start in 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.850
 server so when we get into the server 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.070
 list looks at the multiplayer 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.270
 it is already the first time relatively 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.100
 All right, it also has a fake slot 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.420
 is this number can be like 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.950
 and how many players online in cannes 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.500
 be shown you have already seen 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.909
 if you are going on it with the mouse 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.460
 not the players are displaying the online 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.530
 are but a given text so 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.450
 my text that you can still set 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.400
 for then displayed with color shortly and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.470
 so on the relatively new with 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.970
 different variables such as 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 the version or the online players 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.750
 for the server to work properly 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.130
 it must be short of your know it must 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.440
 you briefly on the server servers 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.900
 join and can then already 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:52.580
 directly flow again as soon as the server 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:55.790
 here is your new skin displayed as 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.350
 egghead and above it is 6 billion 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.020
 but you can still change everything 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.320
 namely in the config dot de ml the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.590
 would be in here then you go into 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.890
 plugins folder then in the sexy ermotti 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 the folder then once here is the ip 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:18.950
 list when it opens directly already 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.560
 that is my ip already hard I believe 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.930
 me that my apps 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.700
 no matter the case it knows like me 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.939
 look 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.010
 and then here is the image 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.560
 this lettering is about the skin 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.069
 is laid and just the reason once 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.709
 the conflict points html 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.590
 so you also best with Petersplatz 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.069
 then you can do this up here first 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.939
 plugin on or off watch the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.370
 song should look for updates then 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.379
 you can still see the different ones 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.780
 single functions regulate once 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:00.510
 mtd that's what it stands for 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.930
 yes it's a bitch and here is the mtd 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.450
 not different variants with the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.790
 variable server names you can in the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.000
 server folder at sava properties 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.819
 set the server name then you can 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.560
 you fake players here i want that 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.639
 We can tell you how to write down 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.120
 So many players are supposed to be online 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:27.510
 stop as fake i like that but i do 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.810
 I make it a lot of fun 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.060
 if you are in bratislava, for example , and there only 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.680
 for so many players while the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.449
 you pay for lock there you can 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.909
 there's something on it that works 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:41.549
 but then not see then but stop 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.470
 a little nicer and that 's with me 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.959
 not as I should also times on 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.180
 if then if that knows the ip and 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.599
 then has then then stands here 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.970
 hello neo co and no more hello guest 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.639
 and here you can fix it 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.310
 if you do not know who I am yet 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:05.069
 which is what then call me then 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.269
 should and in the guest in the event guest 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:14.419
 otherwise you can as well as for example 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:14.419
 my virtue of mine 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.959
 often more so that this is the avatar icon 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.900
 my head will be shown that 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.889
 to set up her cougar she wanted to be 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.500
 head is displayed 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.380
 over the image this is the lettering 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.840
 from crt d 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.990
 You can turn it on here then you can 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.760
 So you said a different say 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.810
 is not that 6 billion 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.340
 next to but should be of you stop 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.940
 You can do that in two ways 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.630
 once you can specify the way where 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.590
 that is say / sexy and maude 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.990
 idea and then stop that means or 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.460
 you can also just go there 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.550
 Write like that is 66 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.620
 match point png and then you have to 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.260
 image but in the main folder 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.160
 reintun so that would have to be here 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.169
 the end I will be saved from times 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:21.080
 i have quite accidentally in the corner 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.440
 my own lie leo co.kg yes that 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.740
 Right 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.700
 there you go here in the folder pulls that 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.380
 there where it is here it goes in here 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.770
 and then it will refer to it 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.169
 then the player message so that's the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.800
 if you go with the mouse on it 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.150
 and he will stop this text displayed 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.250
 again took to the server could the 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.710
 as I said in the server properties 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.630
 Setting and since you can hold on 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.419
 specify different things such as yours 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.760
 website which ip has the server and 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.770
 again with variable work like 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.020
 eg with the online players and the 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.950
 maximum players 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.550
 But here who have a small 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:08.150
 mistake made a tinker if you fake 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.740
 Players will not do that here 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.870
 that is how to transfer it purely 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:18.440
 Seeing it here says it is not 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:21.080
 mac maximum minus 12,000 125 in 1987 on it 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.289
 but here is then a maximum of 60 on it 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.240
 that means home the little club 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.700
 made 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.050
 then you can 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:34.630
 yes that's what already and 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.140
 memory we briefly video server because we 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:42.790
 had indeed changed many takes jan 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.360
 server reloaded is just about everything again 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.060
 in here 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.520
 In short, everything is short and I can do it 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.750
 not too long with additional 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.410
 reloaded we just press on 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.270
 refresh and see already here 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.670
 again mainz child then the writing 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.360
 seems a bit crazy but well 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.480
 no matter 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.480
 then here are the fake players too 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.860
 away and then everything is so far completely 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.030
 right yes that 's it knows any 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.710
 you could ask it in the 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.540
 comments write me ne send pn 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.050
 or on the website at support request 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.270
 send 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.270
 and then until next time
