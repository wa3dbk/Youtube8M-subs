your life but that's never looking then
just<00:03:07.720> gone<00:03:07.870> on<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.019> set<00:03:08.260> down<00:03:08.410> redstone<00:03:08.980> all

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
just gone on a set down redstone all

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.970 
just gone on a set down redstone all
along<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:11.079> top<00:03:11.350> layer<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.829> your<00:03:12.720> bridge<00:03:13.980> and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
along this top layer of your bridge and

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:23.130 
along this top layer of your bridge and
the<00:03:15.670> other<00:03:15.790> side<00:03:16.090> as<00:03:16.299> well<00:03:16.540> Oh<00:03:17.700> lag<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.959> then

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
the other side as well Oh lag and then

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.970 
the other side as well Oh lag and then
collect<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.799> light<00:03:24.070> up<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:25.030> here<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.980> now<00:03:30.120> swing

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
collect a light up to here and now swing

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.199 
collect a light up to here and now swing
that<00:03:33.450> beast<00:03:35.010> now<00:03:36.010> obviously<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.760> can<00:03:36.970> make<00:03:37.090> it

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
that beast now obviously you can make it

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.099 
that beast now obviously you can make it
go<00:03:37.299> for<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> lot<00:03:37.600> longer<00:03:37.799> but<00:03:39.930> obviously<00:03:40.930> for

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
go for a lot longer but obviously for

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.569 
go for a lot longer but obviously for
some<00:03:41.290> reason<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.650> don't<00:03:41.799> even<00:03:41.890> know<00:03:42.070> why<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
some reason I don't even know why the

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.180 
some reason I don't even know why the
redstone<00:03:43.060> circuit<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.859> stops<00:03:45.100> working

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
redstone circuit just stops working

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.090 
redstone circuit just stops working
after<00:03:45.880> something<00:03:46.570> like<00:03:46.690> 20<00:03:47.530> blocks<00:03:47.709> I'm<00:03:47.980> I've

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
after something like 20 blocks I'm I've

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.460 
after something like 20 blocks I'm I've
ensured<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.579> is<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.019> way<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.170> get<00:03:50.320> on<00:03:50.440> that

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
ensured it is but the way to get on that

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.509 
ensured it is but the way to get on that
is<00:03:50.859> with<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.040> repeater<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:52.750> then<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.370> had<00:03:54.459> a

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
is with a repeater but then if you had a

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.449 
is with a repeater but then if you had a
repeater<00:03:54.820> there<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:57.090> trapdoor<00:03:58.090> there<00:03:59.459> that

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
repeater there and a trapdoor there that

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.510 
repeater there and a trapdoor there that
was<00:04:00.549> very<00:04:00.579> good<00:04:00.820> but<00:04:01.180> whatever<00:04:02.190> this

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
was very good but whatever this

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.690 
was very good but whatever this
trapdoor<00:04:04.120> would<00:04:04.390> stay<00:04:04.660> down<00:04:05.100> so<00:04:06.100> all<00:04:06.460> of<00:04:06.520> these

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
trapdoor would stay down so all of these

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.150 
trapdoor would stay down so all of these
will<00:04:06.880> come<00:04:07.000> up<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.240> then<00:04:07.330> like<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.840> hear<00:04:08.170> would

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
will come up and then like to hear would

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.780 
will come up and then like to hear would
stay<00:04:09.400> up<00:04:09.430> or<00:04:09.970> down<00:04:10.270> so<00:04:10.960> uh<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:12.310> going<00:04:12.550> down

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
stay up or down so uh it's going down

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.820 
stay up or down so uh it's going down
the<00:04:12.970> side<00:04:13.150> but<00:04:13.960> it's<00:04:14.080> still<00:04:14.320> an<00:04:14.500> awesome

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
the side but it's still an awesome

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.070 
the side but it's still an awesome
advice<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.700> fact<00:04:15.850> then<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.450> would<00:04:16.600> be<00:04:16.630> cool

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
advice in fact then it would be cool

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.110 
advice in fact then it would be cool
because<00:04:17.530> it'd<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:17.739> like<00:04:17.920> a<00:04:18.190> two-way<00:04:18.850> when<00:04:19.030> you

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
because it'd be like a two-way when you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.640 
because it'd be like a two-way when you
have<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.300> go<00:04:19.390> halfway<00:04:19.570> across<00:04:19.900> close<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.530> one

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
have to go halfway across close that one

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.560 
have to go halfway across close that one
before<00:04:20.860> opening<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.430> can<00:04:21.700> be<00:04:22.210> pretty<00:04:22.360> sweet

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
before opening that can be pretty sweet

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.200 
before opening that can be pretty sweet
be<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.320> light<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.620> just<00:04:23.830> basic<00:04:24.340> how<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.940> make<00:04:25.090> you

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
be a light is just basic how to make you

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.390 
be a light is just basic how to make you
absorb<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.560> cool<00:04:26.740> because<00:04:26.800> if

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
absorb it and it's cool because if

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.530 
absorb it and it's cool because if
someone's<00:04:27.730> walking<00:04:27.820> across<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.390> don't

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
someone's walking across it you don't

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.110 
someone's walking across it you don't
want<00:04:28.570> them<00:04:28.980> open<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.070> they<00:04:30.340> will<00:04:30.490> fall<00:04:30.760> two

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
want them open it they will fall two

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.960 
want them open it they will fall two
blocks<00:04:31.300> down<00:04:31.450> into<00:04:32.230> water<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:33.400> then<00:04:33.610> close

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
blocks down into water you then close

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.720 
blocks down into water you then close
this<00:04:34.240> bad<00:04:34.450> boy<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.960> they<00:04:35.110> will<00:04:35.260> drown<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:36.610> it's

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
this bad boy and they will drown so it's

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.770 
this bad boy and they will drown so it's
also<00:04:36.850> an<00:04:36.970> efficient<00:04:37.300> way<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.390> stealing

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
also an efficient way of stealing

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.390 
also an efficient way of stealing
