sized and cook through well you're going
to<00:02:56.930> use<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.200> sharper<00:02:57.590> edge<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:58.130> will<00:02:58.489> help

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
to use the sharper edge this will help

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.390 
to use the sharper edge this will help
tenderize<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.410> chicken<00:03:00.440> if<00:03:00.829> this<00:03:01.070> side<00:03:01.250> is

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
tenderize the chicken if this side is

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.220 
tenderize the chicken if this side is
called<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.700> tenderizer

you<00:04:58.200> can<00:04:58.350> let<00:04:58.530> them<00:04:58.650> rest<00:04:59.010> if<00:04:59.250> you'd<00:04:59.400> like<00:04:59.580> or

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
you can let them rest if you'd like or

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.620 
you can let them rest if you'd like or
if<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:01.560> prefer<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.979> eat<00:05:02.430> them<00:05:02.640> immediately<00:05:03.090> it

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
if you prefer to eat them immediately it

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.150 
if you prefer to eat them immediately it
works<00:05:03.900> perfectly<00:05:04.350> fine

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
works perfectly fine

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.310 
works perfectly fine
so<00:05:05.730> now<00:05:05.880> it's<00:05:06.060> time<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.450> cook<00:05:06.600> these<00:05:06.870> cures

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
so now it's time to cook these cures

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.550 
so now it's time to cook these cures
I've<00:05:07.560> got<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.250> grill<00:05:08.610> pan<00:05:08.850> with<00:05:09.270> me<00:05:09.480> which<00:05:10.230> I'm

going to oil liberally just so that it

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.100 
going to oil liberally just so that it
doesn't<00:05:14.160> stick<00:05:14.360> now<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.570> don't<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:16.080> a

grill pan
it's<00:05:16.950> really<00:05:17.280> quite<00:05:17.490> okay<00:05:17.790> you<00:05:18.270> can<00:05:18.450> use<00:05:18.600> a

it's really quite okay you can use a

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.290 
it's really quite okay you can use a
dosa<00:05:19.110> tava<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.890> can<00:05:20.010> use<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.160> omelette<00:05:20.610> pan<00:05:20.820> you

dosa tava you can use a omelette pan you

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.330 
dosa tava you can use a omelette pan you
can<00:05:21.420> use<00:05:21.570> a<00:05:21.600> regular<00:05:22.290> pan<00:05:22.530> as<00:05:22.770> long<00:05:23.070> as<00:05:23.220> it's

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
can use a regular pan as long as it's

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.280 
can use a regular pan as long as it's
nonstick<00:05:24.210> because<00:05:24.360> nonstic<00:05:24.540> will<00:05:25.020> make<00:05:25.170> your

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
nonstick because nonstic will make your

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.700 
nonstick because nonstic will make your
life<00:05:25.410> easier<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.400> can<00:05:26.550> also<00:05:27.320> pop<00:05:28.320> this<00:05:28.500> in<00:05:28.680> the

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
life easier you can also pop this in the

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.470 
life easier you can also pop this in the
oven<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:29.310> will<00:05:29.490> work<00:05:29.670> just<00:05:30.030> fine

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
oven it will work just fine

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.800 
oven it will work just fine
so<00:05:31.140> once<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.560> pan<00:05:31.770> is<00:05:31.950> really<00:05:32.130> hot<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.810> oily

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
so once the pan is really hot and oily

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.340 
so once the pan is really hot and oily
you<00:05:34.020> can<00:05:34.200> feel<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:35.030> getting<00:05:36.030> hotter<00:05:36.300> all<00:05:37.050> you

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
you can feel is getting hotter all you

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.000 
you can feel is getting hotter all you
have<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.710> do<00:05:37.830> is<00:05:38.150> take<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.390> skewer<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:39.960> put<00:05:40.860> it

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
have to do is take the skewer and put it

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.920 
have to do is take the skewer and put it
diagonally<00:05:41.220> across<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:42.090> should<00:05:42.510> make<00:05:42.720> this

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
diagonally across it should make this

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.710 
diagonally across it should make this
sizzling<00:05:43.200> noise<00:05:43.530> if<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:44.340> doesn't<00:05:44.850> sizzle<00:05:45.030> then

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
sizzling noise if it doesn't sizzle then

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:57.400 
sizzling noise if it doesn't sizzle then
your<00:05:45.870> pan<00:05:45.990> isn't<00:05:46.200> hot<00:05:46.470> enough

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.280 

with<00:05:58.130> about<00:05:58.340> two<00:05:58.700> minutes<00:05:58.910> done<00:05:59.360> you<00:05:59.990> need<00:06:00.140> to

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
with about two minutes done you need to

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.940 
with about two minutes done you need to
just<00:06:00.470> make<00:06:00.770> sure<00:06:01.010> that<00:06:01.280> all<00:06:01.670> your<00:06:02.620> chicken<00:06:03.620> has
