00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:19.789
 Here at last the board of the Legacy Oh this 4 door b 4 is well Subaru 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:24.919
 In a car like Naha Shin's commitment has reached the top somehow 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:31.189
 Is it just as a little co-developed with this Porsche Actually 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:34.370
 Even though it is a joint development , Subaru's car making basically is so different from Porsche 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.480
 Because it is why does not change with no evaluation evaluation 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.540
 For example, the feeling of this roll is rather called Porschec 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.930
 It's close to the rewarder's feeling, isn't it? 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:51.290
 Specifically, this manual's rsk is slightly thicker than the Devil and the town 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 The roll rigidity became high 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.760
 It 's difficult for the ball to run when it runs on the highway 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.870
 But the car I'm very way is said Tteyuu well flat feeling I'm become flat 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.280
 Also 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.350
 Even if you are very high 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.409
 With less body roll 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.549
 May be understood Fu that flat because this side is European taste that is comfortable running enjoy 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.909
 I think 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.850
 Because the basics are also four wheel drive against the bill 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.360
 Good to be be-mer 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.040
 5 or more 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.630
 unique 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.690
 I'm thinking of hardware, but this is a sedan unlike a wagon 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.430
 The body is also stiff and stiff 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.590
 Unlike the wagon, the weight behind the sedan is lighter. 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.880
 In very dark handling 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:46.659
 Car that I complete moment of inertia or that inertia has become smaller 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.659
 The first impression is that you can run very well 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.860
 Suspension of course it was inherited from the Legacy wagon g tb 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.520
 Building and Taio 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:07.909
 It also has to back number of this rsk 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.149
 Tire comes with a tire of the configuration of 215,457 17-inch 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.239
 In this b 4 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.680
 A little timer tag north of this autopolis 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.680
 Let's run fully open 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.700
 That sound is pretty in various corners 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.210
 There or I'm a long time, which is turning but I was characterized by Aru in Harikon So 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.310
 The storehouse horizontal milk has been out for a long time 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:36.000
 So the suspension is pretty good and the cornering performance is not nice and fast 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.780
 It's a thing that can not run 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.670
 Come on 160170 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.670
 Supplement that came with limiter 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.770
 For users had I unfortunately minute 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.880

 I'm from five to three 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:02.050
 Even though it r late Godiva Te 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.050
 The controller is good because the soup log is slow 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.140
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:13.910
 It is a story in the diary aluminum that does not seem a little with Odagawa 2 liter saran 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.810
 I 'm going to reverse, but it's really good to have 2nd in control 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:22.230

 Start with Neutropea 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:53.959
 Is good Esther bt high's and handling performance is good balance point 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.959
 Good I feel that this close-fitting to a fine corner 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.510
 It is not whether to spin even if Gulliver Ru Well guess this is another really of 4-wheel drive feature
