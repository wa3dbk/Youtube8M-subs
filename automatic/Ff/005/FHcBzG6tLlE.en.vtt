wreck<00:01:06.300> section<00:01:06.810> we're<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.530> gonna<00:01:07.800> be

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
wreck section we're actually gonna be

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
wreck section we're actually gonna be
able<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> grind<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.790> onto<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> rail<00:01:09.270> cars<00:01:09.570> also

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
able to grind up onto the rail cars also

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.480 
able to grind up onto the rail cars also
got<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.470> power<00:01:10.710> lines<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.190> if<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
got a lot of power lines in it if you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.920 
got a lot of power lines in it if you
can<00:01:11.610> find<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.940> line<00:01:12.120> you<00:01:12.300> can<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.570> use

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
can find the line you can actually use

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840 
can find the line you can actually use
the<00:01:13.110> power<00:01:13.290> cables<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the power cables as a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
the power cables as a
so<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> deadly<00:01:15.840> dissent<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.380> no<00:01:16.590> surprise

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
so the deadly dissent here no surprise

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
so the deadly dissent here no surprise
it's<00:01:17.400> called<00:01:17.610> trees<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.810> decided<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it's called trees so what we decided to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
it's called trees so what we decided to
do<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.650> take<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> typical<00:01:20.460> SSX<00:01:21.180> course

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
do is take you know a typical SSX course

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
do is take you know a typical SSX course
and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.990> absolutely<00:01:22.350> jammed<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> full<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and then we absolutely jammed it full of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.120 
and then we absolutely jammed it full of
trees<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> main<00:01:24.600> riding<00:01:25.049> path<00:01:25.290> added

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
trees all in the main riding path added

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
trees all in the main riding path added
another<00:01:26.369> wrinkle<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.240> decrease<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
another wrinkle to that we decrease the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080 
another wrinkle to that we decrease the
visibility<00:01:28.470> significantly<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.549> really<00:01:29.790> fun

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
visibility significantly it's really fun

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
visibility significantly it's really fun
it's<00:01:30.330> really<00:01:30.390> fast<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:31.229> luck<00:01:31.409> without<00:01:31.590> one

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it's really fast good luck without one

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.760 
it's really fast good luck without one
so<00:01:32.580> finally<00:01:32.940> let's<00:01:33.360> talk<00:01:33.690> about<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.049> outs<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so finally let's talk about the outs so

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
so finally let's talk about the outs so
the<00:01:34.890> Alps<00:01:35.190> are<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.399> about<00:01:35.580> high<00:01:35.940> altitude

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the Alps are all about high altitude

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.700 
the Alps are all about high altitude
engineering<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> most<00:01:37.500> unique

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
engineering one of the most unique

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.139 
engineering one of the most unique
places<00:01:38.039> in<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.490> world<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:38.880> there's

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
places in the world where there's

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.990 
places in the world where there's
literally<00:01:39.539> rail<00:01:40.020> systems<00:01:40.680> carved<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.789> in<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
literally rail systems carved out in the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
literally rail systems carved out in the
inside<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> mountains<00:01:42.960> bridges<00:01:43.590> spanning

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
inside of the mountains bridges spanning

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.370 
inside of the mountains bridges spanning
from<00:01:44.280> peak<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.580> peak<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.630> seems<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.289> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
from peak to peak it seems like in the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
from peak to peak it seems like in the
Alps<00:01:46.710> they'll<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.429> run<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.640> chairlift<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Alps they'll just run a chairlift to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.180 
Alps they'll just run a chairlift to
anywhere<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.350> village<00:01:49.740> section<00:01:50.069> there's

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
anywhere so the village section there's

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.649 
anywhere so the village section there's
gonna<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.429> half<00:01:50.610> various<00:01:50.880> houses<00:01:51.030> fallen

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
gonna be half various houses fallen

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.809 
gonna be half various houses fallen
trees<00:01:51.899> falling<00:01:52.470> gondola<00:01:52.860> lines<00:01:53.069> all<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.700> which

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
trees falling gondola lines all of which

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.940 
trees falling gondola lines all of which
you<00:01:53.940> can<00:01:54.090> jump<00:01:54.330> or<00:01:54.509> grind<00:01:54.720> off<00:01:54.899> them<00:01:55.080> so<00:01:55.890> we

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you can jump or grind off them so we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.260 
you can jump or grind off them so we
can't<00:01:56.159> talk<00:01:56.310> about<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.670> album's<00:01:56.970> without

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
can't talk about the album's without

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.389 
can't talk about the album's without
talking<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.840> rock<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> Alps<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.250> home

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
talking about rock so the Alps is home

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.859 
talking about rock so the Alps is home
to<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.550> deadly<00:01:59.880> sin<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.240> rock<00:02:00.420> you're<00:02:00.750> gonna

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to the deadly sin of rock you're gonna

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
to the deadly sin of rock you're gonna
need<00:02:01.050> some<00:02:01.440> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> best<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.159> most<00:02:02.460> advanced

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
need some of the best and most advanced

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.990 
need some of the best and most advanced
equipment<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.600> SSX<00:02:04.050> offers<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.649> game

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.790 

so<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.149> concludes<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.869> SSX<00:02:10.229> massive<00:02:10.619> world

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so that concludes the SSX massive world
