00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
to it and then I'm gonna take my press I

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
to it and then I'm gonna take my press I
always<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.369> sure<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.579> find<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> arrow<00:01:45.180> part

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
big plop of the dust so I tap a little

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.409 
big plop of the dust so I tap a little
bit<00:06:00.419> into<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.870> lid<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.440> then<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.550> go<00:06:02.820> over<00:06:03.270> it

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
bit into the lid and then I go over it

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.120 
bit into the lid and then I go over it
creating<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.080> nice<00:06:04.320> light<00:06:05.479> pearly<00:06:06.479> shine<00:06:07.099> to<00:06:08.099> it

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
creating a nice light pearly shine to it

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.249 
creating a nice light pearly shine to it
and<00:06:09.889> so<00:06:10.889> I<00:06:10.919> dip<00:06:11.250> into<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.759> container<00:06:12.240> tap<00:06:13.080> it

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
and so I dip into the container tap it

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.060 
and so I dip into the container tap it
into<00:06:13.409> the<00:06:13.680> lid<00:06:13.889> and<00:06:14.330> then<00:06:15.330> dust<00:06:15.919> because<00:06:16.919> they

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
into the lid and then dust because they

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.560 
into the lid and then dust because they
really<00:06:17.550> do<00:06:17.699> find<00:06:17.970> that<00:06:18.060> if<00:06:18.180> you<00:06:18.270> go<00:06:18.300> directly

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570
