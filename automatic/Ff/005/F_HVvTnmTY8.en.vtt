painted<00:06:30.830> Brown<00:06:31.010> again<00:06:31.570> maybe<00:06:32.570> highlighting

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
painted Brown again maybe highlighting

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.400 
painted Brown again maybe highlighting
it<00:06:33.260> a<00:06:34.060> little<00:06:35.060> bit<00:06:35.210> with<00:06:35.360> Beach<00:06:35.840> golden<00:06:36.320> or

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
it a little bit with Beach golden or

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.920 
it a little bit with Beach golden or
whatever<00:06:36.650> and<00:06:37.340> then<00:06:37.490> add<00:06:37.700> some<00:06:37.940> pieces<00:06:38.750> of

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
whatever and then add some pieces of

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.980 
whatever and then add some pieces of
static<00:06:39.500> grass<00:06:39.740> yeah<00:06:40.070> there<00:06:40.370> I<00:06:40.550> think<00:06:40.990> this

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
static grass yeah there I think this

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.320 
static grass yeah there I think this
looks<00:06:42.260> way<00:06:42.830> more<00:06:42.860> realistic<00:06:43.460> than<00:06:43.850> a<00:06:43.880> fully

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
looks way more realistic than a fully

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.050 
looks way more realistic than a fully
totally<00:06:45.050> green<00:06:46.270> patch<00:06:47.270> of<00:06:47.480> grass<00:06:47.690> or<00:06:47.900> this<00:06:48.110> no
