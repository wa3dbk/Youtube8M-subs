00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.920 
think we're on 42 goal difference is
probably<00:00:37.079> changed<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.469> wait<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.540> buying<00:00:39.540> is

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
probably changed but wait and buying is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.069 
probably changed but wait and buying is
