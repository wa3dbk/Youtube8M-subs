wood-burning<00:00:20.619> stove<00:00:21.130> has<00:00:21.430> more<00:00:21.789> power<00:00:22.029> and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
wood-burning stove has more power and

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.450 
wood-burning stove has more power and
more<00:00:22.960> versatility<00:00:23.500> than<00:00:23.740> stoves<00:00:24.220> that<00:00:24.340> are

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
more versatility than stoves that are

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.700 
more versatility than stoves that are
much<00:00:24.699> much<00:00:24.910> larger<00:00:25.210> let<00:00:26.019> me<00:00:26.140> explain<00:00:26.439> how<00:00:26.650> we

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
much much larger let me explain how we

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.279 
much much larger let me explain how we
do<00:00:26.920> that<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.160> firebox<00:00:27.640> Nano<00:00:28.090> was<00:00:28.539> born<00:00:28.900> from<00:00:29.170> a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
do that the firebox Nano was born from a

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.710 
do that the firebox Nano was born from a
very<00:00:29.590> simple<00:00:30.039> idea<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:30.730> I<00:00:31.090> think<00:00:31.179> everybody

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
very simple idea that I think everybody

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.530 
very simple idea that I think everybody
understands<00:00:32.560> and<00:00:33.010> that<00:00:33.790> is<00:00:34.030> that<00:00:34.270> if<00:00:34.390> you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
understands and that is that if you

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.050 
understands and that is that if you
cross<00:00:34.840> your<00:00:35.170> sticks<00:00:35.560> in<00:00:35.800> your<00:00:35.920> fire<00:00:36.220> they<00:00:37.030> burn

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
cross your sticks in your fire they burn

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.600 
cross your sticks in your fire they burn
much<00:00:37.540> more<00:00:37.810> efficiently<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.650> with<00:00:38.740> much<00:00:39.370> less

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
much more efficiently and with much less

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.540 
much more efficiently and with much less
smoke<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.260> I<00:00:41.290> took<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.860> idea<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.370> I

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
smoke so I took that idea and I

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.480 
smoke so I took that idea and I
incorporated<00:00:43.360> it<00:00:43.480> into<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.050> design<00:00:44.440> of<00:00:44.710> the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
incorporated it into the design of the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.930 
incorporated it into the design of the
folding<00:00:45.910> firebox<00:00:46.480> nano<00:00:46.900> by<00:00:47.890> not<00:00:48.160> only<00:00:48.490> having

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
folding firebox nano by not only having

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.070 
folding firebox nano by not only having
one<00:00:48.970> side<00:00:49.630> feed<00:00:50.080> chute<00:00:50.440> but<00:00:51.100> by<00:00:51.280> having<00:00:51.670> two

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
one side feed chute but by having two

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.930 
one side feed chute but by having two
this<00:00:53.080> allows<00:00:53.500> you<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.830> feed<00:00:54.130> your<00:00:54.370> fuel<00:00:54.700> in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
this allows you to feed your fuel in

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
this allows you to feed your fuel in
from<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.330> side<00:00:55.600> which<00:00:56.080> is<00:00:56.260> very<00:00:56.470> convenient

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
from the side which is very convenient

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.840 
from the side which is very convenient
but<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.380> allows<00:00:59.710> it<00:01:00.040> to<00:01:00.190> cross<00:01:00.700> on<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.930> inside

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
but it allows it to cross on the inside

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.530 
but it allows it to cross on the inside
so<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:03.880> you<00:01:04.150> get<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.449> very<00:01:05.080> efficient

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so that you get that very efficient

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.510 
so that you get that very efficient
powerful<00:01:07.540> burn<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.500> comes<00:01:08.800> from<00:01:09.070> having

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
powerful burn that comes from having

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.210 
powerful burn that comes from having
your<00:01:09.700> wood<00:01:09.940> crossed<00:01:10.650> let<00:01:11.650> me<00:01:11.740> show<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:11.980> what

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
your wood crossed let me show you what

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.260 
your wood crossed let me show you what
that<00:01:12.250> looks<00:01:12.670> like<00:01:12.790> on<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.210> inside<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:16.210> we

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
that looks like on the inside now we

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.510 
that looks like on the inside now we
also<00:01:16.630> have<00:01:17.020> some<00:01:17.260> versatility<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.250> how<00:01:18.460> the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
also have some versatility and how the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.330 
also have some versatility and how the
pot<00:01:19.060> stand<00:01:19.510> works<00:01:19.930> with<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.470> firebox<00:01:20.950> Nano
