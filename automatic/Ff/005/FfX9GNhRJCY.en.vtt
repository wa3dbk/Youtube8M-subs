about<00:00:30.980> using<00:00:31.220> cotton<00:00:31.820> in<00:00:32.059> fly<00:00:32.689> sheet<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.170> you

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
about using cotton in fly sheet is you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.430 
about using cotton in fly sheet is you
have<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.530> great<00:00:33.860> breathability<00:00:34.870> on<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:36.199> fly

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
have a great breathability on a fly

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.319 
have a great breathability on a fly
sheet<00:00:36.469> like<00:00:36.800> this<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.129> don't<00:00:37.249> need<00:00:37.579> a<00:00:37.789> coating

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
sheet like this you don't need a coating

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.840 
sheet like this you don't need a coating
on<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.570> backside<00:00:39.309> what<00:00:40.309> we've<00:00:40.460> done<00:00:40.550> is<00:00:40.699> that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
on the backside what we've done is that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.579 
on the backside what we've done is that
we<00:00:40.940> treated<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.480> surface<00:00:41.899> where<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.379> water

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
we treated the surface where the water

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.979 
we treated the surface where the water
repellency<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:43.879> any<00:00:44.059> light<00:00:44.300> rain<00:00:44.570> will<00:00:44.600> just

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
repellency so any light rain will just

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.500 
repellency so any light rain will just
repel<00:00:45.350> off<00:00:45.499> the<00:00:45.679> fabric<00:00:45.999> if<00:00:46.999> you<00:00:47.059> have<00:00:47.329> more

repel off the fabric if you have more
heavy<00:00:47.749> rain<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:49.100> cotton<00:00:49.519> will<00:00:49.730> get<00:00:50.149> wet<00:00:50.329> and

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
heavy rain the cotton will get wet and

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.509 
heavy rain the cotton will get wet and
expanse<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.260> close<00:00:51.530> any<00:00:51.739> small<00:00:52.069> holes<00:00:52.339> you

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
leak it's in the tent the poles is what

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.569 
leak it's in the tent the poles is what
we<00:01:06.770> call<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.420> power<00:01:08.420> stability<00:01:09.110> frame<00:01:09.579> it's

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
we call a power stability frame it's

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.910 
we call a power stability frame it's
steel<00:01:11.000> pole<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.689> for<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.049> reason<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.560> really

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
steel pole and for that reason is really

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.870 
steel pole and for that reason is really
really<00:01:13.219> stable<00:01:14.799> at<00:01:15.799> Romans<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.460> have<00:01:16.640> our<00:01:16.759> own

wind simulator the midnight horizon is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.709 
wind simulator the midnight horizon is
tested<00:01:19.640> up<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.789> 169<00:01:20.750> kilometers<00:01:21.229> an<00:01:21.320> hour<00:01:22.719> to

tested up to 169 kilometers an hour to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.719 
tested up to 169 kilometers an hour to
make<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> tent<00:01:24.170> very<00:01:24.409> simple<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.219> pitch

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
make the tent very simple to pitch

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.630 
make the tent very simple to pitch
we<00:01:26.149> have<00:01:26.270> color-coded<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.860> poles<00:01:28.130> leave<00:01:28.399> and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
we have color-coded the poles leave and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.709 
we have color-coded the poles leave and
the<00:01:28.759> pole<00:01:30.100> for<00:01:31.100> added<00:01:31.310> stability<00:01:31.430> we<00:01:32.180> use<00:01:32.420> our

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
the pole for added stability we use our

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.160 
the pole for added stability we use our
storm<00:01:33.140> gas<00:01:33.320> system<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:34.939> Cynthia<00:01:35.270> webbing

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
storm gas system this is Cynthia webbing

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.719 
storm gas system this is Cynthia webbing
material<00:01:36.200> which<00:01:37.189> very<00:01:37.460> easily<00:01:39.219> connects<00:01:40.219> the

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
material which very easily connects the

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.929 
material which very easily connects the
fly<00:01:40.939> sheet<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.840> guyline<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.710> pole<00:01:42.939> so

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
fly sheet and the guyline to the pole so

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.969 
fly sheet and the guyline to the pole so
all<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.180> do<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.329> that<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.689> twist<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.649> webbing

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
all you do is that you twist the webbing

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.749 
all you do is that you twist the webbing
around<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.549> pole<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:48.280> attaches<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.609> guyline

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
around the pole and attaches the guyline

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.110 
around the pole and attaches the guyline
like<00:01:52.759> this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.360 

on<00:01:56.120> each<00:01:56.240> skyline<00:01:56.750> we<00:01:57.530> use<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> little<00:01:57.920> retainer

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
on each skyline we use a little retainer

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.220 
on each skyline we use a little retainer
so<00:01:59.000> when<00:01:59.120> you<00:01:59.180> pack<00:01:59.360> down<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.750> tent<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.080> can

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
so when you pack down the tent you can

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.440 
so when you pack down the tent you can
store<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.710> guideline<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.280> little<00:02:01.550> loop<00:02:01.700> so

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
store a guideline in this little loop so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.910 
store a guideline in this little loop so
it<00:02:02.540> won't<00:02:02.720> be<00:02:02.870> missed<00:02:03.080> up<00:02:03.260> for<00:02:03.500> next<00:02:03.650> time<00:02:03.800> you

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
it won't be missed up for next time you

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.000 
it won't be missed up for next time you
have<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.160> use<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.690> on<00:02:05.690> each<00:02:05.840> side<00:02:05.870> door<00:02:06.380> we<00:02:06.770> have

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
have to use it on each side door we have

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.540 
have to use it on each side door we have
a<00:02:07.040> ventilation<00:02:07.550> panel<00:02:08.830> which<00:02:09.830> can<00:02:10.070> be<00:02:10.220> closed

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
a ventilation panel which can be closed
