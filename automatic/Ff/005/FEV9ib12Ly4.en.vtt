team<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.960> pretty<00:00:25.170> cool<00:00:25.380> pokes<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.609> I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
team it's a pretty cool pokes and I I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.870 
team it's a pretty cool pokes and I I
thought<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.170> he<00:00:28.560> would<00:00:28.769> lead<00:00:29.070> off<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.670> like

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
thought that he would lead off with like

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.630 
thought that he would lead off with like
tyranitar<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:31.109> set<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.470> his<00:00:31.679> stealth<00:00:32.009> rock<00:00:32.340> so

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
tyranitar to set up his stealth rock so

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.940 
tyranitar to set up his stealth rock so
I'm<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.570> could<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.200> lead<00:00:34.440> off<00:00:34.590> my

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
I'm just like I could just lead off my

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.940 
I'm just like I could just lead off my
Galvan<00:00:35.430> chula<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.270> set<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.230> sticky<00:00:37.770> web

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
Galvan chula and set up my sticky web

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.770 
Galvan chula and set up my sticky web
because<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.489> honestly<00:00:38.640> thought<00:00:39.149> sticky<00:00:39.480> web

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
because I honestly thought sticky web

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.709 
because I honestly thought sticky web
was<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> best<00:00:40.410> option<00:00:40.879> for<00:00:41.879> me<00:00:42.270> although

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
was like the best option for me although

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
was like the best option for me although
he<00:00:43.079> does<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.530> star<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.430> feared

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
he does have a star me which I feared

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.040 
he does have a star me which I feared
would<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.719> rapid<00:00:46.170> spin<00:00:46.730> set<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.690> kind<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
would have a rapid spin set so I kind of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.049 
would have a rapid spin set so I kind of
had<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> look<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.489> other<00:00:50.850> than

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
had to look out for that but other than

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
had to look out for that but other than
that<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.350> figured<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.800> right

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that you know I just figured all right

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.049 
that you know I just figured all right
well<00:00:53.219> lead<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.610> Galvan<00:00:54.000> chula<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:56.059> we're

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
well lead with Galvan chula and we're

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
well lead with Galvan chula and we're
probably<00:00:57.360> gonna<00:00:57.600> set<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.989> sticky<00:00:58.350> web<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
probably gonna set up sticky web the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
probably gonna set up sticky web the
first<00:00:58.829> turn<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.280> we'll<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.730> he<00:00:59.940> leads

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
first turn and we'll see what he leads

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.020 
first turn and we'll see what he leads
off<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.170> whatnot<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.250> lead<00:01:02.760> off<00:01:02.910> with

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
off with and whatnot so I lead off with

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.910 
off with and whatnot so I lead off with
my<00:01:03.180> pretty<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.690> gap<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.110> chula<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.650> he

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
my pretty little gap in chula and he

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730 
my pretty little gap in chula and he
leads<00:01:05.159> off<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.430> his<00:01:06.000> dedenne<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.590> just

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
leads off with his dedenne and I'm just

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
leads off with his dedenne and I'm just
like<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.189> well<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.939> got<00:01:09.420> nothing<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
fear here so I'm just gonna set up my

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
fear here so I'm just gonna set up my
sticky<00:01:12.119> web<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.600> goes<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> volt<00:01:13.260> switch

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
sticky web as he goes for a volt switch

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
sticky web as he goes for a volt switch
it<00:01:14.159> doesn't<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> lot<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.540> only

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it doesn't really do a lot the only

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
it doesn't really do a lot the only
thing<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> does<00:01:16.229> hinder<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> fact

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
thing that it does hinder is the fact

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.300 
thing that it does hinder is the fact
that<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.479> focus<00:01:19.320> sash<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.100> no

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that I have a focus sash so that's no

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.399 
that I have a focus sash so that's no
longer<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.880> used<00:01:21.150> however<00:01:21.810> starving

comes<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:23.040> very<00:01:23.070> confused<00:01:23.490> by<00:01:23.909> this

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
comes in I'm very confused by this

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.330 
comes in I'm very confused by this
because<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.830> thunder

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
because I'm just gonna go for a thunder

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.880 
because I'm just gonna go for a thunder
and<00:01:26.549> he<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.880> goes<00:01:27.090> into<00:01:27.570> florges<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.829> very

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and he just goes into florges I'm very

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.789 
and he just goes into florges I'm very
like<00:01:29.490> confused<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> why<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.560> there

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
like confused as to why because there

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.920 
like confused as to why because there
was<00:01:31.920> no<00:01:32.280> real<00:01:32.490> benefit<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.659> hit

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
was no real benefit there if I hit

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.499 
was no real benefit there if I hit
Thunder<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.100> guess<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.420> have

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
Thunder then I guess and you would have

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.230 
Thunder then I guess and you would have
taken<00:01:36.689> damage<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.350> whatever<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.579> into<00:01:38.820> my

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
taken damage but whatever I go into my

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539 
taken damage but whatever I go into my
ferrothorn<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.890> figure<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.369> he's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
ferrothorn now because I figure if he's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
ferrothorn now because I figure if he's
setting<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.000> his<00:01:42.119> screens<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:42.960> I'll<00:01:43.229> use<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
setting up his screens then I'll use the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
setting up his screens then I'll use the
opportunity<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.850> set<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.240> stealth<00:01:45.659> rocks

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
opportunity to set up my stealth rocks

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.160 
opportunity to set up my stealth rocks
and<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.490> said<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.909> he<00:01:48.210> does<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.720> star

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and like I said I know he does have star

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.039 
and like I said I know he does have star
me<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.299> just<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> try<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.899> make<00:01:51.990> sure

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
me but I just have to try and make sure

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.679 
me but I just have to try and make sure
that<00:01:52.259> he<00:01:52.860> doesn't<00:01:52.890> try<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> rapid<00:01:54.420> spin

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that he doesn't try and get a rapid spin

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.819 
that he doesn't try and get a rapid spin
off<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.470> went<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.219> my<00:01:56.729> age<00:01:57.420> /<00:01:57.840> thinking<00:01:58.380> key

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
off so i went into my age / thinking key

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.139 
off so i went into my age / thinking key
for<00:01:59.100> some<00:01:59.250> reason<00:01:59.549> would<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> fighting

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
for some reason would have a fighting

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.050 
for some reason would have a fighting
type<00:02:00.390> attack<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.990> wasn't<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.619> sure<00:02:01.770> what

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
type attack I wasn't really sure what

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.389 
type attack I wasn't really sure what
chest<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.270> had<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> move<00:02:04.560> set<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.100> I'm

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
chest not had as a move set because I'm

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.370 
chest not had as a move set because I'm
still<00:02:05.670> fairly<00:02:06.000> new<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.750> actual

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
still fairly new to like actual

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.770 
still fairly new to like actual
competitive<00:02:07.979> battling<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> made<00:02:09.569> that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
competitive battling so I made that

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.290 
competitive battling so I made that
mistake<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.310> i<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.459> went<00:02:11.849> into<00:02:12.090> town

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
mistake and now i just went into town

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.250 
mistake and now i just went into town
flame<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.900> case

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
flame in case

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.470 
flame in case
was<00:02:13.349> gonna<00:02:13.439> earthquake<00:02:14.010> me<00:02:14.189> again<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.939> I<00:02:15.269> just

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
was gonna earthquake me again and I just

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.380 
was gonna earthquake me again and I just
went<00:02:15.659> for<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> acrobatics<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.239> get

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
went for the acrobatics just to get

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.690 
went for the acrobatics just to get
damaged<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.959> them<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.349> didn't<00:02:19.860> think<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.280> should

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
damaged on them I didn't think I should

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.110 
damaged on them I didn't think I should
go<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:21.239> flare<00:02:21.629> blitz<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.349> some<00:02:22.620> like

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
go for flare blitz and get some like

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.369 
go for flare blitz and get some like
residual<00:02:24.120> damage<00:02:24.269> on<00:02:24.599> myself<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.200> then

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
residual damage on myself and then

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.170 
residual damage on myself and then
tyranitar<00:02:25.980> comes<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> end<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.000> didn't

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
tyranitar comes in in the end it didn't

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.030 
tyranitar comes in in the end it didn't
really<00:02:27.269> matter<00:02:27.480> what<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> want<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:28.409> because<00:02:28.769> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
really matter what I want for because it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.619 
really matter what I want for because it
wasn't<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> do<00:02:30.209> much<00:02:30.420> more

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
wasn't really going to do much more

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.960 
wasn't really going to do much more
anyway<00:02:31.079> so<00:02:31.140> now<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.040> decided<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.610> call<00:02:32.760> back

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
anyway so now I decided to call back

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.809 
anyway so now I decided to call back
panel<00:02:33.329> town<00:02:33.629> flame<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.230> go<00:02:34.709> into<00:02:35.010> my

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
panel town flame and go into my

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.110 
panel town flame and go into my
ferrothorn<00:02:36.329> I<00:02:36.870> was<00:02:37.799> thinking<00:02:38.250> maybe<00:02:38.579> he'd<00:02:38.909> go

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
ferrothorn I was thinking maybe he'd go

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.259 
ferrothorn I was thinking maybe he'd go
for<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.019> stone<00:02:41.010> edge<00:02:41.310> or<00:02:41.670> something<00:02:42.090> or

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
for like a stone edge or something or

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.059 
for like a stone edge or something or
just<00:02:42.299> set<00:02:42.629> up<00:02:42.720> his<00:02:42.870> rocks<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.709> was<00:02:43.829> kind<00:02:44.040> of

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
just set up his rocks and it was kind of

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.000 
just set up his rocks and it was kind of
like<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.579> already<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.690> my<00:02:45.720> rocks<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.859> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
like I already have my rocks up and I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.289 
like I already have my rocks up and I
can<00:02:47.190> threaten<00:02:47.400> him<00:02:47.640> out<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:48.090> uh<00:02:48.510> um<00:02:49.440> uh

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
can threaten him out with uh um uh

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.699 
can threaten him out with uh um uh
jerebo<00:02:51.299> yep<00:02:51.810> that's<00:02:52.109> what<00:02:52.260> I'm<00:02:52.379> trying<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> say

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
jerebo yep that's what I'm trying to say

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.369 
jerebo yep that's what I'm trying to say
a<00:02:52.950> gyro<00:02:53.280> ball<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:53.879> he<00:02:54.480> has<00:02:54.629> bulletproof<00:02:55.200> from

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
a gyro ball so he has bulletproof from

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.129 
a gyro ball so he has bulletproof from
like<00:02:55.530> oh<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.459> annoying<00:02:57.030> ability<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.079> I

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
like oh this is annoying ability but I

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.649 
like oh this is annoying ability but I
can't<00:02:58.560> really<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.920> much<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.000> decided

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
can't really do much to it so I decided

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.899 
can't really do much to it so I decided
that<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.889> he<00:03:02.069> wasn't<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.519> go<00:03:02.730> for

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
that I think he wasn't gonna go for

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.399 
that I think he wasn't gonna go for
earthquake<00:03:03.329> again<00:03:03.629> because<00:03:04.109> he<00:03:04.319> was

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
earthquake again because he was

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.349 
earthquake again because he was
predicting<00:03:04.889> me<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.099> switch<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.549> my<00:03:05.579> talonflame

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
predicting me to switch in my talonflame

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.479 
predicting me to switch in my talonflame
that<00:03:06.720> time<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.139> he<00:03:07.349> went<00:03:07.500> for<00:03:07.680> stone<00:03:07.950> edge<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that time so he went for stone edge and

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.089 
that time so he went for stone edge and
I<00:03:09.209> made<00:03:09.389> a<00:03:09.420> good<00:03:09.599> play<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:10.230> assuming<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.920> he

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
I made a good play here assuming that he

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.680 
I made a good play here assuming that he
was<00:03:11.250> gonna<00:03:11.310> go<00:03:11.549> for<00:03:11.670> stone<00:03:11.909> edge<00:03:12.150> instead<00:03:12.540> of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
was gonna go for stone edge instead of

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.460 
was gonna go for stone edge instead of
earthquake<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.970> paid<00:03:15.450> off<00:03:15.599> because<00:03:15.810> now<00:03:16.170> my

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
earthquake and I paid off because now my

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.619 
earthquake and I paid off because now my
age<00:03:16.709> /<00:03:17.040> comes<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.000> figured<00:03:18.299> he<00:03:18.510> was

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
age / comes in and I figured he was

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.830 
age / comes in and I figured he was
choice<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.739> could<00:03:20.579> get<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.849> story<00:03:21.329> stands<00:03:21.599> off

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
choice so I could get a story stands off

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.330 
choice so I could get a story stands off
so<00:03:22.199> that's<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.709> kind<00:03:22.919> of<00:03:22.980> game<00:03:23.099> we're<00:03:23.310> playing

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
so that's the kind of game we're playing

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.580 
so that's the kind of game we're playing
right<00:03:23.760> now<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> swords<00:03:25.139> dance<00:03:25.319> off

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
right now and I got a swords dance off

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.110 
right now and I got a swords dance off
so<00:03:25.949> I<00:03:26.510> assume<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:29.370> get<00:03:29.519> some<00:03:29.699> lefties

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
so I assume that I can get some lefties

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.479 
so I assume that I can get some lefties
back<00:03:30.419> and<00:03:30.840> then<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.500> can<00:03:31.680> go<00:03:31.799> for<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> king<00:03:32.190> she'll

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
back and then I can go for a king she'll

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.330 
back and then I can go for a king she'll
get<00:03:32.760> some<00:03:32.970> more<00:03:33.150> lefties<00:03:33.599> back<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:35.190> was

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
get some more lefties back and I was

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.300 
get some more lefties back and I was
thinking<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.180> could<00:03:36.209> live<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.569> volt<00:03:36.870> switch

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
thinking that I could live a volt switch

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.039 
thinking that I could live a volt switch
after<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.699> have<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.120> much<00:03:39.359> help<00:03:39.569> because<00:03:39.959> i

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
after I have that much help because i

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.349 
after I have that much help because i
still<00:03:40.349> am<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.680> defensive<00:03:41.549> for<00:03:41.819> him<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.120> i<00:03:42.150> have

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
still am in defensive for him and i have

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.180 
still am in defensive for him and i have
a<00:03:42.389> lot<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.720> defense<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.500> he<00:03:43.530> gets<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.859> crit

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
a lot of defense but he gets a crit

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.420 
a lot of defense but he gets a crit
which<00:03:44.910> may<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:46.199> mattered<00:03:46.739> i<00:03:47.069> don't<00:03:47.280> really

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
which may have mattered i don't really

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.789 
which may have mattered i don't really
do<00:03:47.790> damage<00:03:48.269> calcs<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:49.049> either<00:03:49.199> way<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.560> was

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
do damage calcs but either way I was

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.599 
do damage calcs but either way I was
like<00:03:50.010> it's<00:03:50.970> annoying<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:52.319> know<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:53.280> whatever

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
like it's annoying you know but whatever

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.569 
like it's annoying you know but whatever
um<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.720> really<00:03:55.620> just<00:03:55.799> thought<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.069> could<00:03:56.370> live

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.939 
um I really just thought I could live
that<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.419> i<00:03:57.449> went<00:03:57.840> into<00:03:58.049> my<00:03:58.199> galvin<00:03:58.560> chillin

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
that so i went into my galvin chillin

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.520 
that so i went into my galvin chillin
now<00:03:59.099> because<00:03:59.579> I<00:03:59.940> figured<00:04:00.659> I<00:04:00.810> hey<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.019> can<00:04:01.379> just

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
now because I figured I hey I can just

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.069 
now because I figured I hey I can just
saw<00:04:01.739> kind<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.489> like<00:04:02.609> bug<00:04:02.879> buzz<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.659> you

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079

saw kind of like bug buzz it and you
know<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.859> I<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:06.000> some<00:04:06.180> reason<00:04:06.209> thought<00:04:06.659> it

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
know the I for some reason thought it

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.270 
know the I for some reason thought it
was<00:04:06.930> super<00:04:07.199> effective<00:04:07.290> because<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.919> forgot

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
was super effective because I forgot

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.180 
was super effective because I forgot
that<00:04:08.310> he<00:04:08.879> was<00:04:08.909> also<00:04:09.720> dual<00:04:10.290> typed<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.859> not<00:04:10.979> just

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
that he was also dual typed and not just

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.990 
that he was also dual typed and not just
pure<00:04:11.430> grass<00:04:11.669> so<00:04:11.970> whoopsie<00:04:13.310> but<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.669> does<00:04:14.970> work

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
pure grass so whoopsie but it does work

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.939 
pure grass so whoopsie but it does work
out<00:04:15.449> fine<00:04:15.750> because<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.199> forced<00:04:16.530> him<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.680> use

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
out fine because the forced him to use

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.310 
out fine because the forced him to use
earthquake<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.820> now<00:04:17.909> that<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.209> know<00:04:18.359> by<00:04:19.079> now

for a flamethrower just to be safe but I
figured<00:04:42.090> even<00:04:42.300> if<00:04:42.510> ty<00:04:42.660> ranch<00:04:42.870> heart<00:04:43.170> does<00:04:43.350> come

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
figured even if ty ranch heart does come

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
and I can easily just out speed in solar

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.330 
and I can easily just out speed in solar
beam<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.540> anyway<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.080> that's<00:04:49.710> gonna<00:04:49.890> take<00:04:50.160> his

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
beam it anyway so that's gonna take his

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.090 
beam it anyway so that's gonna take his
tyranitar<00:04:51.000> out<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.540> I'm<00:04:52.110> just<00:04:52.350> like<00:04:52.440> oh<00:04:52.710> yeah

so floor just comes in and I'm just like
all<00:04:56.280> right<00:04:56.340> that's<00:04:56.730> cool<00:04:57.030> I'm<00:04:57.300> gonna<00:04:57.540> probably

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
all right that's cool I'm gonna probably

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.810 
all right that's cool I'm gonna probably
use<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.470> opportunity<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:59.160> just<00:04:59.520> route

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
use this opportunity to just route

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.520 
use this opportunity to just route
because<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.450> didn't<00:05:00.930> see<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:01.140> as<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.380> threat

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
because I didn't see it as a threat

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.500 
because I didn't see it as a threat
because<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.340> only<00:05:02.490> thing<00:05:02.580> I<00:05:02.760> really<00:05:02.970> did<00:05:03.240> see

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
because the only thing I really did see

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.970 
because the only thing I really did see
it<00:05:03.630> do<00:05:03.840> was<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.640> moon<00:05:05.640> blast<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.419> uh<00:05:06.980> light

it do was a moon blast and uh light
screen<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:08.700> used<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.270> opportunity<00:05:09.450> to<00:05:10.260> get

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
screen so I used that opportunity to get

screen so I used that opportunity to get
up<00:05:10.620> a<00:05:10.740> light<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.250> lights<00:05:11.610> gate<00:05:11.790> I<00:05:11.940> used<00:05:12.419> that

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
up a light that lights gate I used that

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.360 
up a light that lights gate I used that
opportunity<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:13.350> roost<00:05:13.590> just<00:05:13.919> so<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.070> can<00:05:14.160> make

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
opportunity to roost just so I can make

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.490 
opportunity to roost just so I can make
sure<00:05:14.400> i<00:05:14.580> could<00:05:15.000> get<00:05:15.150> Charizard<00:05:15.810> in<00:05:15.930> at<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.200> later

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
sure i could get Charizard in at a later

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.680 
sure i could get Charizard in at a later
point<00:05:16.800> in<00:05:16.950> time<00:05:17.010> if<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.520> need<00:05:17.700> him<00:05:17.850> but<00:05:18.419> he<00:05:18.570> just

looks so cool I love him so at this

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.180 
looks so cool I love him so at this
point<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.050> was<00:05:22.169> just<00:05:22.350> kind<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.650> getting<00:05:22.919> some

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
point I was just kind of getting some

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.550 
point I was just kind of getting some
damage<00:05:23.550> off<00:05:23.730> on<00:05:24.000> him<00:05:24.450> just<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.050> get<00:05:25.200> damaged

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
damage off on him just to get damaged

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.200 
damage off on him just to get damaged
off<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.980> now<00:05:26.100> I<00:05:26.370> assumed<00:05:26.850> he<00:05:26.970> was<00:05:27.090> gonna

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
off and now I assumed he was gonna

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.440 
off and now I assumed he was gonna
switch<00:05:27.570> out<00:05:27.800> because<00:05:28.800> he<00:05:29.760> assumed<00:05:30.030> i<00:05:30.150> might<00:05:30.330> go

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
switch out because he assumed i might go

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.840 
switch out because he assumed i might go
for<00:05:30.600> another<00:05:30.750> flame<00:05:31.200> throwers<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.250> went<00:05:32.700> for

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
for another flame throwers so I went for

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.580 
for another flame throwers so I went for
a<00:05:32.910> solar<00:05:33.210> beam<00:05:33.540> this<00:05:33.780> turn<00:05:34.050> I<00:05:34.320> knew<00:05:34.500> it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
a solar beam this turn I knew it

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.200 
a solar beam this turn I knew it
wouldn't<00:05:34.860> kill<00:05:35.040> because<00:05:35.280> especially<00:05:35.729> he<00:05:36.090> had

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
wouldn't kill because especially he had

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.060 
wouldn't kill because especially he had
light<00:05:36.419> screen<00:05:36.870> up<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:37.470> did<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.680> good<00:05:37.919> amount

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
light screen up but it did a good amount

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.580 
light screen up but it did a good amount
of<00:05:38.310> damage<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.030> I'm<00:05:39.390> content<00:05:39.810> with<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:40.169> so

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
of damage and I'm content with that so

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.890 
of damage and I'm content with that so
now<00:05:41.220> I<00:05:41.250> decided<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.820> switch<00:05:42.060> out<00:05:42.270> into<00:05:42.720> my

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
now I decided to switch out into my

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.870 
now I decided to switch out into my
ferrothorn<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:44.040> was<00:05:44.190> assuming<00:05:44.460> he<00:05:44.700> was<00:05:44.790> gonna

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
ferrothorn I was assuming he was gonna

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.670 
ferrothorn I was assuming he was gonna
want<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.180> hit<00:05:45.300> me<00:05:45.330> with<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.660> water<00:05:45.990> type<00:05:46.290> attack

or a electric-type attacks so I assumed

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.250 
or a electric-type attacks so I assumed
hey<00:05:50.880> ferrothorn<00:05:51.390> can<00:05:51.660> take<00:05:51.810> both<00:05:51.990> of<00:05:52.020> those

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.740 
get to like uh I get to just stay out
here<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.490> I<00:06:00.000> decided<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.450> go<00:06:00.630> for<00:06:00.840> power<00:06:01.650> of

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
here and I decided to go for power of

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.990 
here and I decided to go for power of
what<00:06:03.750> do<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:03.870> call<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.020> para<00:06:04.470> whip<00:06:04.740> because<00:06:05.490> I

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
what do you call it para whip because I

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.990 
what do you call it para whip because I
assume<00:06:06.900> that<00:06:06.930> if<00:06:07.560> he<00:06:07.740> was<00:06:07.860> gonna<00:06:07.950> bring<00:06:08.340> in<00:06:08.610> his

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
assume that if he was gonna bring in his

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.870 
assume that if he was gonna bring in his
chest<00:06:09.600> not<00:06:09.900> also<00:06:10.200> i<00:06:10.830> actually<00:06:11.430> want<00:06:11.610> to<00:06:11.729> try

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
chest not also i actually want to try

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.310 
chest not also i actually want to try
and<00:06:12.000> kill<00:06:12.150> him<00:06:12.270> off<00:06:12.419> because<00:06:12.570> he<00:06:12.750> was<00:06:12.990> at<00:06:13.140> very

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
and kill him off because he was at very

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.320 
and kill him off because he was at very
low<00:06:13.500> health<00:06:13.740> too<00:06:13.919> so<00:06:14.100> power<00:06:14.340> what<00:06:14.580> was<00:06:14.760> just

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
low health too so power what was just

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.930 
low health too so power what was just
the<00:06:15.479> clearly<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.320> best<00:06:16.560> option<00:06:17.070> so<00:06:17.340> now<00:06:17.880> he

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
the clearly the best option so now he

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.480 
the clearly the best option so now he
goes<00:06:18.210> back<00:06:18.419> into<00:06:18.660> his<00:06:18.930> dead<00:06:19.140> Denny<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:20.130> I

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
goes back into his dead Denny and I

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.130 
goes back into his dead Denny and I
wasn't<00:06:20.910> really<00:06:21.030> sure<00:06:21.150> what<00:06:21.360> this<00:06:21.780> thing<00:06:22.020> was

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
wasn't really sure what this thing was

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.230 
wasn't really sure what this thing was
gonna<00:06:22.260> do<00:06:22.590> to<00:06:22.740> me<00:06:22.770> because<00:06:23.040> whatever<00:06:23.880> he<00:06:24.120> was

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
gonna do to me because whatever he was

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.730 
gonna do to me because whatever he was
going<00:06:24.360> to<00:06:24.419> hit<00:06:24.570> me<00:06:24.600> like<00:06:24.900> I<00:06:25.050> only<00:06:25.229> knew<00:06:25.440> that<00:06:25.590> he

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
going to hit me like I only knew that he

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.790 
going to hit me like I only knew that he
had<00:06:25.830> like.he<00:06:26.450> had<00:06:27.450> fairy-type<00:06:28.020> dad<00:06:28.320> he<00:06:28.680> had

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
had like.he had fairy-type dad he had

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.230 
had like.he had fairy-type dad he had
electric-type<00:06:29.340> attacks<00:06:29.370> and<00:06:30.000> I<00:06:30.090> wasn't

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
electric-type attacks and I wasn't

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.330 
electric-type attacks and I wasn't
really<00:06:30.450> fearing<00:06:31.020> anything<00:06:31.470> so<00:06:31.650> I<00:06:31.710> stayed<00:06:32.070> in

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
really fearing anything so I stayed in

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.670 
really fearing anything so I stayed in
even<00:06:32.729> at<00:06:32.850> that<00:06:33.000> i<00:06:33.270> was<00:06:33.419> a<00:06:33.450> pretty<00:06:33.810> high<00:06:34.080> hell<00:06:34.349> so

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
even at that i was a pretty high hell so

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.860 
even at that i was a pretty high hell so
I

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
I

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.690 
I
figured<00:06:35.320> that<00:06:35.350> whatever<00:06:36.250> he<00:06:36.400> was<00:06:36.460> going<00:06:36.670> to

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
figured that whatever he was going to

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.220 
figured that whatever he was going to
hit<00:06:36.880> me<00:06:36.910> with<00:06:37.180> wasn't<00:06:37.630> going<00:06:37.750> to<00:06:37.810> take<00:06:37.990> me<00:06:38.200> out

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
hit me with wasn't going to take me out

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.670 
hit me with wasn't going to take me out
so<00:06:38.740> talonflame<00:06:39.490> comes<00:06:39.910> in<00:06:40.120> and<00:06:40.330> I<00:06:40.900> expected<00:06:41.560> to

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
so talonflame comes in and I expected to

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.530 
so talonflame comes in and I expected to
die<00:06:41.890> here<00:06:42.340> so<00:06:42.640> I<00:06:42.670> kind<00:06:43.210> of<00:06:43.300> just<00:06:43.480> went<00:06:43.690> for<00:06:44.140> um<00:06:45.070> I

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
die here so I kind of just went for um I

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.150 
die here so I kind of just went for um I
kind<00:06:46.540> of<00:06:46.630> just<00:06:46.810> went<00:06:46.990> for<00:06:47.260> a<00:06:47.290> gyro<00:06:47.590> ball<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:48.010> get
