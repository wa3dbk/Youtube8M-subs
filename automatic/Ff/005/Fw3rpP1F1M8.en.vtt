the
the<00:03:34.349> overall<00:03:34.739> footprint<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.670> motorcycle<00:03:36.120> blog

the overall footprint a motorcycle blog

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.479 
the overall footprint a motorcycle blog
and<00:03:36.540> gets<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:37.050> little<00:03:37.470> bit<00:03:37.709> tighter<00:03:37.980> because<00:03:38.370> we

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
and gets a little bit tighter because we

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:47.240 
and gets a little bit tighter because we
got<00:03:38.640> more<00:03:38.910> bloggers<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.629> more<00:03:40.410> areas<00:03:40.800> and
