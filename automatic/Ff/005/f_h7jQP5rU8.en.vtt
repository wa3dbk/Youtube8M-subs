00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.830
 I'm one of tablet here on the 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.469
 press conference and we have this here 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.410
 brand new watch at sentry 2 and that 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.180
 compare first with the lg nexus 4 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.270
 and maybe a little more with that 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.110
 xperia t what every visitor gets here 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.410
 So no longer at but on the mwc 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:32.680
 here we go display technically have 72 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.379
 both 1280 720 pixels are their 1168 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.579
 pixel is the lexus 4 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.960
 both are running on android here we have 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.410
 a surface of the installed 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.780
 has been 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:51.760
 the whole thing is called in motion juli 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.760
 We also commit to the setting here 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.390
 okay that's the significantly newer android 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.160
 version 4.2 point 2 of course here 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.430
 get the newest immediately 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.259
 Updates that the advantage of the nexus 4g 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.060
 first android 4.1 but i think so too 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.770
 to get an update soon and both 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.689
 are very very fast so both have 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.409
 a quad core processor with 1.5 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.450
 gigahertz 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.969
 both have 16 GB of memory and continue 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.189
 Unfortunately, there was not a worker 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.179
 otherwise we have every lt 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.479
 category 4 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:27.709
 the 150 mbit per second here we have 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.899
 no lte installed and thus only 42 here 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.209
 I believe mbit per second 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.039
 and if you compare the backs 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.930
 at that time already a bit broken but 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.070
 that does not matter 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.900
 the material choice I guess 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.820
 decide and we have four 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.520
 Plastic is really good 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 and i do not clink anything here it is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.570
 really feels like one 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.950
 Very nice and, above all , nothing 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.600
 and the next one is a bit 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.540
 differently we have a glass website here 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.160
 the corinna glas and that's me 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.060
 made already residue you can see 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.100
 that happens otherwise he is already 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.010
 Rear are camera technically both 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 can video for HD recordings technically 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.100
 but at least from photos ago 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.970
 i here 13 megapixel camera and here 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.800
 is it an 8 megapixel camera and both 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.860
 to have 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.480
 I think that the camera clearly 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.480
 better is technically this will be here 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.700
 Battery times too in any case because with 2420th 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.430
 milliampere hours it has 200 million 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.890
 hours more than the nexus s has 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.680
 A few options with the one stream 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.060
 can save this price 400 euros 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.940
 for that was here we are from 299 euro 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.350
 while clear price performance technical 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.810
 the next here much better but 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.549
 that was just a beautiful one 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.769
 One can say that and suddenly 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.950
 you have to decide what you prefer 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.590
 So take that huawei sentry 2 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.260
 went the dsv 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.060
 as long as the video of tablet is a 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.450
 thumb and of course subscribes to the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.450
 damage
