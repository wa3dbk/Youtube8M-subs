 francesco belfiore always great 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.079
 protagonist but above all was of

 applaud and to support his 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.729
 sample 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.710
 a sample that aims directly at 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.400
 something important 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.400
 in its future 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.689
 Well 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 one of five males and some have 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:30.250
 judged 5 or problems a piece of 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.250
 117 111 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 Yes No 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.690
 here we are with mirko it was really hard 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.000
 a serious technical opponent but not a tough one 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.409
 I thought that we didn't think that it iniquates but 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.690
 I didn't think the technician was like that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.930
 because it moved well it was part of 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.460
 blows had a very hard blow however the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.310
 match was we solved you saw it 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.560
 all the friends of the beautiful but hard shots 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.230
 surely, however, two enemies were much 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.520
 maybe excited this building you 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.739
 these qualities weighed a little too much 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.380
 could stop my trainer mario e 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.630
 I start late carbon sharon 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.920
 diesel 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.850
 someone thought he did it on purpose 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.860
 to keep your fans on their toes 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.930
 it was a beautiful match he was a beautiful opponent 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.920
 that's what this victory means 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.390
 for you another step towards me 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.150
 I've always said I want to get in 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.410
 top of the world with mario now 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.840
 let's see a step worked in the meantime 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.970
 let's celebrate this evening mario si 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.420
 this evening there were also several here 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.080
 former champions to honor this 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.510
 appointment 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.420
 means that for mirko you can 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.630
 really close these doors for 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.670
 to arrive at the typical yes of yes yes they are 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.739
 convinceissimo mirko is ready for 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.610
 get to the world championships 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.519
 so to get to a world title 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.170
 you just have to work on some small ones 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.819
 nonsense after that 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.360
 we can do something even better 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.450
 here we are with francesco pension is over is 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.700
 finished an effort but it was really worth the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.739
 worthwhile we could say that was really true 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.630
 the penalty because it was a struggle that 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.790
 however it has an effective impact on the 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.860
 territory as well as on the career of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.220
 mirko larghetti naturally than with a 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.780
 hard meeting but very very nice where 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.880
 really showed off knowing 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.120
 suffer with determination and struggle 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.140
 he kept his champion belt 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.480
 of European Union 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.019
 here we are at the end also horn the mayor 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.090
 exhausted he suffered a lot to 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.170
 fine mirko did it do it 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.170
 be all happy 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.410
 indescribable emotion and also us with 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.700
 he will have to lose a bit but 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.340
 we too must therefore resume ourselves 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.830
 now we have to take the well-deserved break 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.870
 from which it is good was worth 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.120
 engage this building for a 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.510
 event that really has history is 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.069
 long 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.250
 we hope that here is not concluded 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.260
 tonight and then used for others too 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.410
 circumstances why 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.870
 the structure deserves and mirko surely 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.360
 even more 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.290
 welcome nino is a guest here tonight 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.620
 a tronista chronicler description of the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.930
 match but here's how you saw this 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.479
 boxer who wants to pursue the dream 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.010
 world that wants to follow him and it 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.479
 will reach I hope so 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.449
 tonight he showed he had 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.389
 above all, what you need is character 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:48.510
 will have to improve certain details 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:51.150
 technicians who also talked about it as you know 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.410
 which will be improved over time is one 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.340
 that can get far 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.290
 must corroborate yes also must put ourselves 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.600
 in conditions to do 12 rounds without 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.720
 hesitation without yielding because of 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.810
 get to really become champions 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.420
 you don't have to get tired of getting like that 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.820
 a marathon runner who eventually arrives in 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.670
 sprint here for mirko as it will be 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.470
 the luck component is important because 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.840
 you must also have that one above all 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.340
 being able to dispute certain meetings because if 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.430
 you can't get his green going 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.410
 they are in agreement but it is not luck 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:33.330
 certain meetings are with managers 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.340
 coni with their own managers who 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.560
 they know how to get to those 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.770
 fights and he has manager 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.020
 boni and will certainly arrive 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.760
 said even better and higher than 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.920
 what to celebrate another wine 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.030
 welcome I sincerely hope so too 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.030
 I want to see the samples 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.350
 Yes No
