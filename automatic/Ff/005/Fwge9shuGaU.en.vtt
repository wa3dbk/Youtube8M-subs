00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
I do like most is that it was a smoother

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.380 
I do like most is that it was a smoother
ride<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:13.100> not<00:04:13.370> only<00:04:13.520> that<00:04:13.760> but<00:04:13.940> like<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.330> was

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
ride and not only that but like it was

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.449 
ride and not only that but like it was
so<00:04:14.720> much<00:04:14.960> fun<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.500> like<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.710> thought<00:04:15.860> so<00:04:16.130> safe

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
so much fun and like I thought so safe

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.099 
so much fun and like I thought so safe
right<00:04:16.850> there<00:04:16.880> sitting<00:04:17.299> down<00:04:17.600> on<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:17.900> bike

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
right there sitting down on that bike

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.009 
right there sitting down on that bike
and<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:18.859> was<00:04:18.890> very<00:04:19.250> very<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:20.480> think<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.870> only

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
and I was very very I think the only

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.960 
and I was very very I think the only
real<00:04:21.530> break<00:04:21.560> I've<00:04:22.130> ever<00:04:22.340> ridden<00:04:22.580> was<00:04:22.850> like<00:04:22.940> a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
real break I've ever ridden was like a

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.210 
real break I've ever ridden was like a
tricycle<00:04:23.300> but<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:24.020> wasn't<00:04:24.320> as<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:24.740> great<00:04:25.070> as

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
tricycle but it wasn't as as great as

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220 
tricycle but it wasn't as as great as
this<00:04:25.370> one<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:25.850> what<00:04:26.480> did<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:26.720> like<00:04:26.870> about<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
this one so what did you like about the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.810 
this one so what did you like about the
Triton<00:04:27.770> what<00:04:27.920> made<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.220> different<00:04:28.400> from<00:04:28.640> other

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
Triton what made it different from other

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.510 
Triton what made it different from other
bikes<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:30.020> was<00:04:30.260> different<00:04:30.470> because<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:31.310> it

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
bikes it was different because like it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.940 
bikes it was different because like it
was<00:04:31.640> lower<00:04:31.880> than<00:04:32.000> regular<00:04:32.330> bikes<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.470> it's

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
was lower than regular bikes so it's

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.790 
was lower than regular bikes so it's
safer<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.690> stops<00:04:35.990> are<00:04:36.260> like<00:04:36.530> perfect

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
safer and the the stops are like perfect

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.730 
safer and the the stops are like perfect
so<00:04:37.700> when<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.330> come<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:38.990> sharp<00:04:39.350> turn<00:04:39.590> or

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
so when we come to a sharp turn or

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.960 
so when we come to a sharp turn or
something<00:04:39.950> we<00:04:40.040> can<00:04:40.190> just<00:04:40.370> slow<00:04:40.550> down<00:04:40.580> very

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
something we can just slow down very

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.080 
something we can just slow down very
easily<00:04:41.170> good<00:04:42.170> so<00:04:42.740> do<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.490> think<00:04:43.550> your<00:04:43.820> friends

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
easily good so do you think your friends

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.580 
easily good so do you think your friends
had<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.240> good<00:04:44.450> time<00:04:44.600> with<00:04:44.810> this<00:04:44.960> with<00:04:45.500> this

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
had a good time with this with this

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.690 
had a good time with this with this
Triton<00:04:46.010> bicycle<00:04:46.430> today<00:04:46.960> because<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:48.700> think

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
Triton bicycle today because I think

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.159 
Triton bicycle today because I think
four<00:04:49.880> people<00:04:50.180> are<00:04:50.270> like<00:04:50.480> my<00:04:50.630> friends<00:04:51.050> that

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
four people are like my friends that

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.920 
four people are like my friends that
don't<00:04:51.380> know<00:04:51.560> how<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.790> ride<00:04:52.790> a<00:04:52.820> bicycle<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:53.600> think

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
don't know how to ride a bicycle I think

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.330 
don't know how to ride a bicycle I think
they<00:04:54.050> can<00:04:54.230> definitely<00:04:54.410> learn<00:04:54.980> how<00:04:55.100> to<00:04:55.130> ride

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
they can definitely learn how to ride

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.470 
they can definitely learn how to ride
this<00:04:55.490> one<00:04:55.640> because<00:04:55.790> it's<00:04:55.910> really<00:04:56.000> easy

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
I think the Triton bicycles are perfect

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.150 
I think the Triton bicycles are perfect
for<00:04:58.910> middle<00:04:59.180> school<00:04:59.419> because<00:04:59.630> it<00:05:00.530> gives<00:05:00.800> all
