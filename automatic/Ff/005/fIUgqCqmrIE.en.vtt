the<00:04:10.160> feeling<00:04:10.250> from<00:04:10.610> some<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.510> shots<00:04:11.720> we

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
the feeling from some of the shots we

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.720 
the feeling from some of the shots we
saw<00:04:12.140> that<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.739> wasn't<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.160> most<00:04:13.310> pleasing

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
saw that it wasn't the most pleasing

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.690

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
execution here is that we're not very

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.170 
execution here is that we're not very

happy about we've got a bhalla k &amp; a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.450 
happy about we've got a bhalla k &amp; a
half<00:04:20.209> time<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.810> yeah<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:21.859> is<00:04:21.919> there's<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.340> lot
