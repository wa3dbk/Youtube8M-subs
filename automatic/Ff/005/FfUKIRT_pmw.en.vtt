00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.960 

promising<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.309> won't<00:01:04.580> be<00:01:04.730> able<00:01:04.910> to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
promising but I won't be able to

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.970 
promising but I won't be able to
synthesize<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.690> drug<00:01:05.930> anytime<00:01:06.380> soon<00:01:06.680> I

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
synthesize the drug anytime soon I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.340 
synthesize the drug anytime soon I
really<00:01:07.910> should<00:01:08.090> get<00:01:08.210> back<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.570> my<00:01:08.720> work<00:01:11.350> hmmm

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
really should get back to my work hmmm

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.490 
really should get back to my work hmmm
there's<00:01:13.250> still<00:01:13.670> power<00:01:14.000> but<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.930> casing<00:01:15.350> is

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
there's still power but the casing is

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.130 
there's still power but the casing is
cracked<00:01:15.860> I'm<00:01:16.729> astonished<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:17.540> exposure<00:01:17.990> to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
cracked I'm astonished that exposure to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.660 
cracked I'm astonished that exposure to
the<00:01:18.380> stealth<00:01:18.650> radiation<00:01:19.220> could<00:01:19.400> induce

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
the stealth radiation could induce

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.600 
the stealth radiation could induce
mutations<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.540> rapidly<00:01:20.960> more<00:01:21.860> importantly

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
mutations so rapidly more importantly

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.880 
mutations so rapidly more importantly
this<00:01:22.850> explains<00:01:23.390> why<00:01:23.540> my<00:01:23.900> research<00:01:24.380> into<00:01:24.770> this

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
this explains why my research into this

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.040 
this explains why my research into this

only one Avenue left for me I need to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.020 
only one Avenue left for me I need to

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
for her Lily is eccentric certainly but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.290 
for her Lily is eccentric certainly but
I've<00:01:57.170> never<00:01:57.320> felt<00:01:57.590> she<00:01:57.860> was<00:01:58.010> dangerous<00:01:58.300> more

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
I've never felt she was dangerous more

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.300 
I've never felt she was dangerous more
importantly<00:01:59.900> she<00:02:00.200> asked<00:02:00.710> if<00:02:00.800> she<00:02:00.979> could<00:02:01.130> help

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.610 
importantly she asked if she could help
me<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.640> some<00:02:01.850> way<00:02:02.060> I've<00:02:02.870> told<00:02:03.140> her<00:02:03.260> about<00:02:03.380> the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
me in some way I've told her about the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.190 
me in some way I've told her about the
risks<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.100> she<00:02:04.729> still<00:02:05.060> insists<00:02:05.630> on<00:02:05.810> helping
