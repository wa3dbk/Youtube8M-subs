the<00:01:35.310> hayward<00:01:35.640> gauge<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:36.090> well<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> answer<00:01:37.200> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the hayward gauge off well the answer is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.770 
the hayward gauge off well the answer is
10<00:01:37.799> volts<00:01:38.189> ok<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:38.850> once<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.630> want

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
10 volts ok so once you do that you want

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.899 
10 volts ok so once you do that you want
to<00:01:39.840> rewrap<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:40.560> new<00:01:40.740> gauge<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.369> teflon

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to rewrap your new gauge with teflon

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
to rewrap your new gauge with teflon
tape<00:01:42.119> ok<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.890> now

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
tape ok and then what you want to do now

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
tape ok and then what you want to do now

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
is going to turn the new gauge clockwise

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.289 
is going to turn the new gauge clockwise
and<00:01:46.530> you're<00:01:46.920> gonna<00:01:47.009> put<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.700> back<00:01:47.970> into<00:01:48.180> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
part of the threads we're gonna stick it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
part of the threads we're gonna stick it
into<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> female<00:02:01.350> part<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> filter<00:02:02.189> just
