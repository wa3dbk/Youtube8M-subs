00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.880
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.630
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.550
 movie about the dj phantom three today 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.230
 unfortunately only a short film because I am 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.730
 busy with some other things 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.030
 but maybe that helps one or the other 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.740
 other yes anyway what is it all about 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.320
 simply because you have beautiful film shots 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.200
 Because it is important that the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.079
 camera moves course as soft as 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.390
 are possible and that is possible when tilting 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.800
 the sky is relatively simple there's yes 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.560
 here this three girls at the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.960
 Remote control of the head and leaves it 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.880
 he is very very precise no 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.980
 also you can in the app the 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.079
 speed of the ride also 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.140
 times to adjust it looks different 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.450
 Schwenks because that's not 360 Â° 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.520
 gÃ¼mbel and a swing means that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.230
 always have to turn your whole head and 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.969
 that is not quite so 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.369
 just here is some exercise 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.590
 asked but there is a little trick 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.450
 with her your movements softer 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.689
 I can show you and I'll show you 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.689
 now 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.500
 in order to show you this we have to be the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.509
 but have to do remote control 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.430
 a little closer to that is not yet 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.470
 enough 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.649
 yes that's not bad but we 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.720
 have to get even closer to that's great 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.850
 actually close enough when we are 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.000
 Here you stick this stick once 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.520
 look in detail then you will 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.530
 maybe realize that the two parts 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.630
 there is a lower part 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.210
 here this conical part with 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.550
 this very first corrugation and there is 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.460
 the upper part with two more 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.350
 regulations and up here this crown 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.630
 village and that recognizes even if I 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.119
 turn it all up a bit 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.069
 you can screw it on here then 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.770
 Do you see that here the upper pair is 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.479
 now now releases from the bottom and that 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.549
 towards the top 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.319
 So you can screw it up and that 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.350
 Let's describe that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.230
 so here so clearly up here 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.600
 this stick now essential 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 higher and longer is even now the 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.500
 Locking now is easy now 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.739
 the lower part also upwards 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 screwed and as soon as he gets up 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.970
 arrived then we stabilize 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.440
 the two of us in that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.570
 twisting each other a bit like that 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.519
 and now it's normal 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.489
 and the stick is now 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.799
 much longer how big the 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.120
 difference between the two 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.320
 Stick them can be here 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.290
 if I'm a little bit like that again 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.959
 zoom out what brings to the whole now 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.090
 quite simply most of the taxes 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.579
 year in which you thumb up here 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.049
 have this crown lying and 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.450
 decide for a rich and 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.340
 controlled movement is of course with 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.489
 which speed you use the stick 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.859
 moved and in which way he in this 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.510
 Time is back at a small 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.970
 Sticks like this one 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.549
 there is the way the top of the head back 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.340
 is rather small and the larger the 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.810
 Of course, the billet gets bigger 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.870
 it's swinging up here, too, all the more 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.730
 bigger is the way the stick 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.260
 that means that you have to go back 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.720
 here in this way, of course 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.390
 can control more precisely because you have more 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.640
 sore 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.950
 more distance available and can be so 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.090
 softer pans make that work 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.040
 of course, for the height 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.250
 Here, too, you can head something 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.350
 increase or decrease more precisely 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.730
 also the other stick sticks out 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.590
 of course on request at height 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.600
 If you want that, you can adjust it 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.120
 then bring the same height 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.070
 or you let it like this that 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.350
 they have a bit longer for softer ones 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.280
 pans to get it all right 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.310
 you saw that 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.720
 Super fast adapt also in the field so 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.270
 that of course, anytime 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.580
 on the spot then you can decide how to do it 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.090
 would like to have and as it is for the current 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.080
 situation best leaves the one or 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.150
 others of you will become now 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.800
 maybe that's boring to say that 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.080
 I already knew that can almost 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.030
 all remote controls that's right 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.890
 but please consider for you I have the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.660
 not made film but rather for 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.400
 those who did not know that yet 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.410
 I did not know yet and I hope so 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.690
 could you guys who did not know that 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.580
 give it to the small tip like 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.430
 Maybe you your pans something else 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.350
 better , as always, I say 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.150
 thanks for watching and if you like mine 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.590
 I liked the movie then 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.240
 Of course, also about a nice 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.070
 Comment from you here under the film 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.500
 I'm definitely positive 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.790
 rating in no further and 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.010
 if it had not done yet 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.350
 then subscribe to this channel here or 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.880
 subscribe me on facebook then you will 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.250
 you always have the latest information 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.530
 movies inform if you have more 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.900
 you should have asked to change 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.090
 the remote control or the phantom 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.890
 3 or to other multi kopten and 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:02.330
 drones then look every fall in 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.330
