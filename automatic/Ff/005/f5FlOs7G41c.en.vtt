 I really love you I love you 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.730
 I will not bring you such old jokes 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.290
 like that old thing that got off the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.170
 bed to turn in it by 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.840
 example I'm going to talk about oldies but 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.270
 without mistreating old senility that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.250
 they are more spirits than one and I see them 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 on the beaches gloating the view with 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 the generous curvy girls and those girls 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.800
 which are much more provocative because they 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.260
 they make a bikini with a tie and 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.330
 leftover for bow still 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.510
 I heard an old man say out loud 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.070
 have 20 more years more will not be less 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.070
 flights just like that I do not think 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.530
 we continue living 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.290
 There are sculptors like the great painter 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.870
 Miguel Angel, this is a sculptor 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.969
 the eros a beautiful statue in the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.620
 palace of the brown enter two old ladies 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.359
 Spanish, look, you know what we're going to do 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
 I go on one side of the building 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.930
 museum and we go the other one because if you're not going to 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.609
 start look at this look at the other and none 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.439
 of the two we're going to see nothing so to the 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.810
 back we found ourselves at the door and 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.040
 we discussed everything that was when it was 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.400
 They found what you liked the most 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.560
 The eros the statue is beautiful that well 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.760
 He is a sculptor that monument 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.090
 what muscles all so big beautiful and 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.640
 I have made another muscle so 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.620
 tiny 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.620
 and the other says dress and cold 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.670
 sculpting is not the same as building 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.310
 like the masons those who work in 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.500
 the construction works cried 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.170
 bitter the widow before the coffin of 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.970
 husband and the inert body and the companion 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.060
 and it was thought that the last words would 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.459
 he said them to me and the last words I 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 the widow said to me and half restless 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.000
 jealous that my husband told me not to 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.000
 move the scaffolding 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.790
 everyone in their profession we go 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.360
 routing this as if it were 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.820
 railway 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.560
 he leaves it to a cousin who had 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.930
 that he was German he did not understand anything about 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.060
 railroads at the ticket office comes a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.190
 Sir, how is the train coming? 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.190
 tips imagine if it has to cost or what 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.980
 it's German and the railways are 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.120
 They route the flights are beautiful 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.130
 there are also people who stretch out 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.240
 parachutes are reckless stretches a 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.800
 guy here and he would not have 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.690
 parachute did not open falling 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.640
 suddenly at the speed that was coming down 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.160
 is crossed with another that rose 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.510
 and you say they know nothing about parachutes 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.510
 no and you boilers 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.560

 be bad you know what saves you in this 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.400

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.400
 also because I go straight to the tower 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.960

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.450
 of smiling smile good half 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.100
 redundant is not it was a crazy thing 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.230
 that does not come to tell stories because there 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.920
 than trying to find the courage to 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.320
 you have to encourage them 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.940
 it's not a crazy thing to be poor and 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.070
 find crazy stories 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.590
 They wanted to know how to vent a 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.470
 little that dining room because there was a lack of 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.840
 food supplies had scarce 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.700

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.230
 the crazy and agree as they answer 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.760
 we take them away so they can eat 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.510
 at least the house if we are saved from 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.410
 that budget 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.720

 six by six 36 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.449
 and since you do not get very easy you divide a thousand 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.449

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.280
