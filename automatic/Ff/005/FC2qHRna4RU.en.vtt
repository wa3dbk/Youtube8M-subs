00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.260
 tiles and a fridge. The full package. You can also succeed here. Everyone thinks 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.310
 of course with barbecues always directly on the meat which can be nicely barbecued. 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.099
 But there are many other options that can be done with certain types 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:50.629
 barbecues. Including for example baking a pizza. That among other things with this whole 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:03:01.230
 can be made very tasteful. Also this: specifically made to include pizzas in addition to the meat 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.139
 to barbecue in. And of course also the Weber that of his classic briquette models 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:15.560

 There are also many accessories for outdoor kitchens and barbecues. Natural briquettes. 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:31.489
 But nowadays you can work very nicely with different scents of wood. Making the taste of it

 the meat is affected in a very pleasant way in all sorts of ways. And all sorts 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:48.669
 other accessories to make barbecuing easier. Another important advantage with the Fonteyn
