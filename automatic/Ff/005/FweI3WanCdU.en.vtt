00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
so all the temps did they threw the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.959 
so all the temps did they threw the
water<00:00:12.269> layer<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:13.350> failed<00:00:13.700> trying<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.790> dig

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
water layer that failed trying to dig

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
water layer that failed trying to dig
out<00:00:15.090> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> inside<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.930> culvert<00:00:16.170> or<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
out of the inside of the culvert or the

out of the inside of the culvert or the
pipe<00:00:17.490> brother<00:00:18.529> resulted<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.610> side<00:00:20.790> of<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
pipe brother resulted in the side of it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.710 
pipe brother resulted in the side of it
blowing<00:00:21.300> out

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
blowing out

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.010 
blowing out
I<00:00:22.070> assume<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:24.360> not<00:00:24.540> the<00:00:24.660> right<00:00:24.750> stuff

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
I assume this it's not the right stuff

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.999 
I assume this it's not the right stuff
to<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.829> that<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:27.470> what<00:00:28.470> I've<00:00:28.559> got<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.829> is<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
to know that so what I've got here is a

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.950 
to know that so what I've got here is a
sand<00:00:29.279> point<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.759> don't<00:00:30.239> know<00:00:30.390> why<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.689> running

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
sand point I don't know why I'm running

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.450 
sand point I don't know why I'm running
the<00:00:31.020> water<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.500> sounded<00:00:31.919> like<00:00:31.980> good<00:00:32.160> idea<00:00:32.399> at

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the water it sounded like good idea at

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.780 
the water it sounded like good idea at
the<00:00:32.550> time

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the time

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.350 
the time
but<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.809> don't<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.200> doing<00:00:34.410> any<00:00:34.530> good

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
but I don't know if it's doing any good

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.579 
but I don't know if it's doing any good
what<00:00:36.360> happens<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:40.609> keep<00:00:42.530> wrecking<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
what happens is I keep wrecking the

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.590 
what happens is I keep wrecking the
drive<00:00:43.829> cap<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.910> matter<00:00:45.089> what<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.359> do

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
drive cap no matter what I do

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.259 
drive cap no matter what I do
and<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.170> his<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.440> calf<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.829> simply<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
and so his right calf is simply just a

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.729 
and so his right calf is simply just a
heavy-duty<00:00:48.510> pipe<00:00:48.839> fitting<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.499> cut<00:00:49.710> down

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
heavy-duty pipe fitting it's cut down

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
heavy-duty pipe fitting it's cut down
and<00:00:50.249> then<00:00:51.239> machine<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.350> lip<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.670> inside<00:00:54.050> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and then machine a lip on the inside the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
and then machine a lip on the inside the
idea<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.159> lip<00:00:56.339> screw<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> into<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
idea was if the lip screw it into the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.750 
idea was if the lip screw it into the
lip<00:00:57.179> of<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.300> pipe<00:00:57.539> hits<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.589> but<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.640> whatever

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
lip of the pipe hits it but for whatever

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.410 
lip of the pipe hits it but for whatever
reason<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.749> just<00:01:01.530> blow<00:01:01.859> him<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.129> out

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
reason I just I just blow him right out

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.110 
reason I just I just blow him right out
that's<00:01:03.420> that's<00:01:03.989> fine<00:01:04.230> whatever

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
that's that's fine whatever

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.870 
that's that's fine whatever
turns<00:01:07.050> out<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> hi-lift<00:01:07.650> jack<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.700> not

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
turns out with a hi-lift jack it's not

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.740 
turns out with a hi-lift jack it's not
all<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.120> flip<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> pool

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
all to flip the pool

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
all to flip the pool
I<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:10.340> hammer<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.490> down<00:01:11.729> pull<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:13.160> cut<00:01:14.160> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I just hammer it down pull it out cut it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.790 
I just hammer it down pull it out cut it
off<00:01:14.400> rethread<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> hammer<00:01:16.260> back<00:01:16.560> down

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
off rethread it hammer back down

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.310 
off rethread it hammer back down
obviously<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.850> back<00:01:18.120> to<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> areas<00:01:18.630> driven

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
obviously going back to the areas driven

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.950 
obviously going back to the areas driven
through<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.620> past<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.570> it's<00:01:21.570> easier

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
through in the past it's it's easier

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
through in the past it's it's easier
it's<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.590> easy<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.490> easy<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.940> sand

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it's not easy but it's easy the sand

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.110 
it's not easy but it's easy the sand
point<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.510> got<00:01:24.690> at<00:01:24.990> northern<00:01:25.680> hydraulics<00:01:26.160> 15

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
point I got at northern hydraulics 15

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.390 
point I got at northern hydraulics 15
inch<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> quarter<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.010> I'm<00:01:29.010> driving<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
inch and a quarter and I'm driving the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.530 
inch and a quarter and I'm driving the
whole<00:01:29.520> mess<00:01:29.730> with<00:01:30.470> fencepost<00:01:31.470> pounder<00:01:32.540> either

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
whole mess with fencepost pounder either

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.020 
whole mess with fencepost pounder either
way<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:34.140> an<00:01:34.320> event<00:01:34.440> it's<00:01:35.100> gonna<00:01:35.550> work<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
way we know an event it's gonna work the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.400 
way we know an event it's gonna work the
matter<00:01:36.210> getting<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:39.320> don't<00:01:40.320> know

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
matter getting it there so I don't know

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.010 
matter getting it there so I don't know
whether<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.620> call<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> success<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.430> failure

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.120 

yeah<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.620> will<00:01:45.770> work<00:01:45.920> eventually<00:01:48.070> it's<00:01:49.070> a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
yeah it will work eventually it's a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.420 
yeah it will work eventually it's a
tremendous<00:01:49.520> amount<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.760> work<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:51.250> there's<00:01:52.250> no

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
tremendous amount of work and there's no

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
tremendous amount of work and there's no
way<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.610> could<00:01:52.760> have<00:01:52.820> driven<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.150> through<00:01:53.300> that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
way I could have driven it through that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.690 
way I could have driven it through that
rock<00:01:53.630> layer<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.800> was<00:01:54.950> down<00:01:55.130> there<00:01:55.280> ten<00:01:55.490> feet

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
rock layer that was down there ten feet

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.320 
rock layer that was down there ten feet
but<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.720> seem<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.170> be<00:01:57.230> able<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.440> get<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.620> down<00:01:58.330> and

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
but I seem to be able to get it down and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.550 
but I seem to be able to get it down and
whatever<00:01:59.540> it<00:01:59.840> comes<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.230> waves

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
whatever it comes in waves

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.090 
whatever it comes in waves
it'll<00:02:01.550> just<00:02:02.110> leap<00:02:03.110> forward<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.620> by<00:02:03.710> leap<00:02:03.920> I

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
it'll just leap forward and by leap I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.460 
it'll just leap forward and by leap I
mean<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.600> quarter<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.690> an<00:02:05.780> inch<00:02:05.870> half<00:02:06.170> an<00:02:06.320> inch

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
mean a quarter of an inch half an inch

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.770 
mean a quarter of an inch half an inch
with<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.770> pound<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.490> then<00:02:07.970> times<00:02:08.240> it'll<00:02:08.600> just

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
with a pound and then times it'll just

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660 
with a pound and then times it'll just
crawl<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.890> you're<00:02:10.130> well<00:02:10.280> know<00:02:10.520> here

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
crawl and you're well know here

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.700 
crawl and you're well know here
sixteenth<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.240> there<00:02:11.360> said<00:02:11.630> time<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.590> can

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
sixteenth to there said time you can

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.740 
sixteenth to there said time you can
clearly<00:02:12.920> see<00:02:13.040> I've<00:02:13.520> totally<00:02:14.150> wrecked<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.570> top
