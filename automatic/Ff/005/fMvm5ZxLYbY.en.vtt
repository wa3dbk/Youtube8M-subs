00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
very interesting so let's start with the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.979 
very interesting so let's start with the
stats<00:00:39.890> you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.129> go<00:00:41.460> around<00:00:41.700> thirty<00:00:42.600> percent

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
stats you can go around thirty percent

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
stats you can go around thirty percent
grid<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.100> works<00:00:44.430> very<00:00:44.700> well<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.239> semi-pro

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
grid that works very well and semi-pro

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.340 
grid that works very well and semi-pro
sent<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.710> surgery<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.969> working<00:00:48.780> fine<00:00:49.110> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
sent the surgery that's working fine you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160 
sent the surgery that's working fine you
don't<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.010> hit<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> 30<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> 70<00:00:51.600> but

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
don't have to hit the 30 in the 70 but

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.819 
don't have to hit the 30 in the 70 but
it<00:00:52.440> should<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.770> around<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.760> stat<00:00:54.510> value<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it should be around that stat value so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.720 
it should be around that stat value so
go<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.059> 30<00:00:57.390> grid<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> 70<00:00:58.890> surgery<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
go with 30 grid and 70 surgery that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.889 
go with 30 grid and 70 surgery that
works<00:00:59.969> very<00:01:00.239> well<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.260> build<00:01:02.899> another

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
works very well with this build another
