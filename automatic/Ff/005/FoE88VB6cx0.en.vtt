 very useful and I love it 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.440
 well I see it very simple I'm a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.199
 person who has oil on the forehead 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.670
 in fact my skin is mixed but you can 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.250
 see I look I did makeup well 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.530
 over the face one over the other 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.989
 I use a sect guard map 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.960
 To tell you the truth, I know that some 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.210
 shops that sell some brands that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 do not sell that glitter strip is not that you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 today puts on the mask I do not spend 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.890
 money, not even because 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.780
 after I discovered that s tronic 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.640
 This tip I never want to know 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:11.790
 else the tip is simpler to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.939
 diner knows what he yields 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.820
 finally the water in the kitchen 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.799
 I always get some 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 I think now I will not leave again will I 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.640
 I always ask for some more that I did not like 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.890
 How am I going tonight to take in? 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.619
 home I always have two in the wallet 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.439
 for emergencies it is very simple you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 go get the part by the hour he comes 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.829
 so in the open here is to take this part and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.820
 you will catch on your forehead 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.820
 so 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.520
 and always walk the nose 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.679
 we look at the difference 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.319
 I can already see if it's not shining anymore. 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.319
 and look where all the fat has gone 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.479
 transparent 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:07.310
 It looks like I have an egg on my forehead. 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:17.290
 sometimes you get the part that does and who 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.290
 still and is pressing on the whole face 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.690
 and ready 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.790
 it's gone 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.310
 we need to shine but not so much right 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.180
 then this tip I hope you're 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.209
 liked 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.860
 I'm ready for another three hours. 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.860
