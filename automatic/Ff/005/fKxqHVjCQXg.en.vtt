00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:09.140
 eons of years ago came the ender 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.150
 kites and destroyed most of them 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.260
 civilization man killed several 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.090
 billion people 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.789
 many died by his violent 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.919
 but attacked those who survived it 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.630
 it gave it its dimension 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.390
 never banish on that never again 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.310
 come here through a few 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.130
 left over his power came over one 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.819
 more such deal they call that 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.460
 to change 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:34.100
 it turned almost all human beings like that 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.260
 called ender more will-less great 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.109
 slim and cuddly creatures the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.590
 no daylight and water off but how 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:46.059
 Only almost all people said 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.059
 This is my story 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.270
 One day I found on my field 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.270
 something strange 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.530
 I had looked at it and it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.530
 seemed to be a kind of ender pearl 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.369
 I knew that they would come from the end 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.780
 but I did not think about it 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.590
 and just put them in the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.590
 Board of Directors 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.630
 then it was finally time to sleep 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.630
 I thought that day would go already 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.440
 but in the night something seemed 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.440
 strange to have happened 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.489
 it was a morning like any other 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.489
 until I looked in the mirror 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.790
 the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.630
 Ender mountains had something with mine 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.630
 eye brought 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.860
 Of course, I immediately looked new man 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.459
 the back beads which change to 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.459
 were seen 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.420
 there were actually some to see 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.810
 because she was 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.810
 path 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.040
 I had to learn more about the ender pearl 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.090
 experienced and about what we always in 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.890
 eye was passed 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.819
 So I was looking for a book that I did 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.819
 had hidden somewhere 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.909
 one can 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.370
 I read to you in front of what in the high 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.300
 my beloved son if we have this 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.900
 if I probably already reads 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.900
 long dead 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.680
 if you chose this book 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.410
 you probably have some 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.190
 Changes to the body noticed strange 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.280
 turn 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.440
 This is the hands of those you can 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.160
 just temporarily demonizing house saw 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.810
 you have enough to do 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.060
 but you will not need them there 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.790
 I have an antidote in a year 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.350
 hid the old mill and go 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.960
 use them before it is too late the day 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.880
 Tended to the end so I wanted 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.880
 The best way to do it the next day 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.990
 when I woke up the next day 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.600
 the dealers continue to do so 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.490
 outspread 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:13.110
 my skin mutated into a kind 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:13.680
 black house like this was me now 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.600
 for sure 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.620
 I had to look for the 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.620
 go venom 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.470
 just standing in front of a little problem 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.050
 all bottles of buildings were empty 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.910
 So I checked if it was here 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:08.070
 maybe some sort of recipe book somewhere 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:10.650
 cup and actually at the top of the 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.910
 mÃ¼hle weinbuch that the recipe for the 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:18.990
 gegengift contained there one stood 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:22.740
 would need a bucket of water two ends 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.530
 eyes and a trader pearl around that 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.830
 to produce an antidote 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:33.390
 The only problem was that I did not have one 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:36.980
 So I had to be comfortable 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.980
 or looking for evil
