 of a dot behind the bridegrooms 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.990

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.740
 subjects 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.049
 immediately after 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.079
 the second after 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.549
 I only change the frame and I tilt it a little and it appears 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.379
 ciccio 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.359

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.139
 another object 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.419

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.719
 counteracting some easy images 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.389

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.619
 a central part

 second when in the pictures office a lot 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.439
 I saw the inclination of the 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.269
 of the vertical health of this object 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.569
 it the fundamental thing with the naked eye 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.669
 looking up, no one retires

 es an emilia stain 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.059
 consequently no noise was heard 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.249
 it was something that the camera is demonstrating 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.569
 and therefore 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.569
 film would seem 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.049
 unidentified object 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.989
 when I returned to the studio 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.930
 I put the photos on the computer doing these contrast operations for 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.769
 better visualize the object 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.989
 recommended these shots 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.989
 at the ufological center of turin 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:44.610
 tow immediately after these sales via high schools 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.169
 someone who 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.399
 of the experts of the case 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.399
 the answer was wille 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.899
 making me fill out a silmarillion yahoo.it information 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:59.949
 the sighting 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.199
 intel 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.469
 they replied that they were convoyed 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.369
 the god sent them 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:11.010
 the photos itc programs in original because peones examined by 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.609
 by some experts 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.259
 we have made our assessments by a comparison between the photos and the 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.489
 miniature of a satellite 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.620
 we realized that there could be a rational explanation for the images 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.860
 a satellite in orbit perhaps due to a phenomenon of solar reflections 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.430
 may have been taken up by the lens of the tank top photographer 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.270
 explanation how these works, but let's leave the question open to 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.429
 any other interpretation
