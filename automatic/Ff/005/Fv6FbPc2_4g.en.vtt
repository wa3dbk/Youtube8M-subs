00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 how to overcome pride and saint-omer 2 1 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.730
 willingness to die when a person is ready for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.950
 death then fear goes away 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.200
 fear fear and so on why am i 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.910
 sincerely and spoke at seminars and what not 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.929
 I'm afraid every seminar and spend as 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.929
 then fear 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:26.440
 no longer live with the knowledge of ideals 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.970
 a dream if a man lives a dream 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.739
 ideals and consciousness of pride 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.989
 irresistible but for living in the present day 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.760
 as if the grill is only here and now 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.530
 as Christ said do not worry and 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:47.650
 tomorrow and here it is the truth 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:51.250
 continue not to speak not to think badly and 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.650
 tough about the future when a person speaks 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.870
 here and so here so here it will be 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.610
 so and so on he fights with 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.570
 divine will is included in the program 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.790
 self-destruction 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.490
 that is, the future can not talk 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 categorically never because it's already 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.280
 fighting with god being determined from above 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.620
 so when h is lit it is possible 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.810
 especially dangerous to talk and think hard 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.760
 future when it comes to relationships with 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.759
 loved one I quarreled with him 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.789
 no longer know all this already being 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.549
 oncology can be that is to the future 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.159
 need to be properly treated 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.270
 Next, you need to hope first for God 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.130
 then over to 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.680
 this we all remember the phrase on god 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.740
 Hope not yourself 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.149
 because people always hoped for god 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.850
 she must be dialectic need 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.539
 hope for god and do something yourself 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.789
 Now it is one taught by Jesus Christ 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.189
 he spoke divine will absolutely 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.710
 primary if water changes as it were 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.479
 partnership and interaction with god ta 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.520
 the divine will is human as 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.409
 If so, the dialectic is that of Christ 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.869
 it turns out like dialectics and no 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.310
 if divine will is absolute if 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.429
 head hair will not fall dough until 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.400
 human will and no but paradox 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.069
 6 years and your will is your desire 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.470
 and never ask your wishes 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.620
 blow up and talent land into it 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.860
 completely different behavior model go 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.540
 farther 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.630
 overcoming pride is absolutely and 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.220
 acceptance by the will of God within 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.260
 absolutely and that's when you realize that everything 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.560
 absolutely going on divine 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.170
 to the will 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.900
 when you understand that if you internally 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.190
 tribe accept at least something means 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.440
 is it already a fight with god it is already 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.530
 self-destruction that's the point 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.620
 Christianity but accept the divine 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.250
 the will is absolute plane people not 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.510
 can then the interaction begins 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.440
 here is god he of course rules the world and how 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.160
 would God is now here's where it seems to be 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.310
 temporarily absent 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.209
 and there are some evil forces you need 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.280
 fight them 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.130
 so if everything is from God how to fight 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.570
 paralyzed human will to this 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.550
 in order to understand the essence and not this 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.830
 gods need here's a serious effort project 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.230
 produce need to feel 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.950
 that the soul must first be discarded 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.590
 consciousness namely in the soul there soul 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.870
 opposites may exist a 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.890
 at the level of consciousness they are no dock 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.890
 It is the neutralization reaction 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.370
 what else to overcome pride 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.799
 our first place no further regret 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.540
 about the past be able to take real 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.799
 sorry past bad thoughts about the future 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.720
 fear of the future 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:49.209
 these are also signs of pride skill 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.320
 conflict what is skill 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.120
 conflict and that is the ability to perform 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.299
 the law of unity and struggle 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.110
 of opposites is love to love 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.260
 your enemy 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.150
 when a person knows how to conflict then 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.799
 he must forget about himself so that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.769
 simulate the state of another he 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.680
 must renounce my self 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.410
 and this from overcoming pride therefore 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.799
 ability to interfere this is what 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.000
 the degree of victory is serious over pride 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.269
 notice what's going on now 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.160
 Russia 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:28.669
 First place in the world of divorce Russia 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.940
 occupies young people do not know how to conflict 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.560
 married went to the apartment something there you 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.050
 what are you? 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.690
 and everyone starts to prove his 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.250
 consistency who is more right who is more 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.289
 fair and the struggle here can't 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.319
 when the struggle ended in compromise 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.539
 goes to body level there is a scuffle and when 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.090
 going on a spirit level this is a topic who is right 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.880
 who is fairer here for the ending 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.500
 good compromise alone 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.270
 envisaged 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.639
 only at the level of the soul in the territory 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.110
 conflict is solved soul mutual 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.150
 concessions forgiveness and acceptance of a 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.039
 we are not able to interfere we are only in 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.340
 one plan we can completely yield 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.199
 don't resist the evil one's Christ 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.509
 spoke speak an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:23.120
 and I say don't resist evil you know 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:25.710
 what is the meaning of this it means that in the soul 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.789
 when we are offended we have no right 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.880
 take offense in response 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.030
 here it is and go all evil is not 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.969
 external is internal 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.349
 nonresistance to evil and that is not 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.199
 opportunity to respond hate and resentment and 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.940
 condemnation of the offense that they gave here 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:47.009
 it is a sense of the presence of god in 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.590
 all that else the right attitude to 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.199
 disease understanding of what 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.560
 pride is not the superiority of one over 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.750
 to others and also following links of pride and 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.690
 that is, the priority of human will over 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.889
 divinely it is from the priority of consciousness from 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:07.080
 soul when love is second from 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.430
 justice for 1 on sat on the ground 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.740
 this one of pride 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.539
 the fact is that the process of reviving the soul 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:18.270
 very heavy long agonizing but if 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.479
 man understands that in the first place 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:25.830
 there must be a god that love is more important 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:27.939
 understanding that you need to overcome your 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.729
 qualities 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:33.199
 negative looks like pride you need 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.849
 understand what needs to be overcome 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.629
 affection then sooner or later he is 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.629
 all overcoming
