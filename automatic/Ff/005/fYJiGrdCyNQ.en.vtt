in front of your face I got a quick

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
in front of your face I got a quick
simple<00:00:26.820> solution<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.599> let's<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
simple solution for that let's get to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.400 
simple solution for that let's get to
work

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.610 

as<00:00:35.410> I've<00:00:36.100> shown<00:00:36.130> in<00:00:36.550> my<00:00:36.700> other<00:00:36.940> videos<00:00:37.620> my

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
as I've shown in my other videos my

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.290 
as I've shown in my other videos my
personal<00:00:39.070> belief<00:00:39.130> is<00:00:39.610> venting<00:00:40.060> to<00:00:40.090> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
personal belief is venting to the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.660 
personal belief is venting to the
outside<00:00:40.750> is<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.050> very<00:00:41.350> best<00:00:41.650> way<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:41.890> go<00:00:42.130> using

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
outside is the very best way to go using

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.090 
outside is the very best way to go using
the<00:00:42.730> largest<00:00:43.360> fan<00:00:43.600> possible<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.770> create<00:00:45.010> a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
the largest fan possible to create a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.010 
the largest fan possible to create a
positive<00:00:45.340> airflow<00:00:46.030> coming<00:00:46.270> into<00:00:46.630> your<00:00:46.780> space

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
positive airflow coming into your space

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.010 
positive airflow coming into your space
but<00:00:47.890> what<00:00:47.950> do<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.250> do<00:00:48.489> if<00:00:48.850> either<00:00:49.270> due<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.720> the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
but what do you do if either due to the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.810 
but what do you do if either due to the
size<00:00:50.290> of<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.620> window<00:00:50.770> you<00:00:50.950> can't<00:00:51.370> really<00:00:51.670> get

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
size of the window you can't really get

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.900 
size of the window you can't really get
an<00:00:51.940> adequate<00:00:52.270> fan<00:00:52.750> in<00:00:52.960> here<00:00:52.989> or<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.610> have

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
an adequate fan in here or you have

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.450 
an adequate fan in here or you have
extreme<00:00:55.360> temperatures<00:00:55.930> outside<00:00:56.170> hot<00:00:56.830> or<00:00:57.070> cold

your landscaping downstairs is going to

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.270 
your landscaping downstairs is going to
die<00:01:07.660> if<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.110> put<00:01:08.320> all<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:08.619> drywall<00:01:08.920> and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
die if you put all that drywall and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.490 
die if you put all that drywall and
plaster<00:01:09.430> dust<00:01:09.910> on<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.240> what<00:01:10.990> do<00:01:11.050> you<00:01:11.110> do<00:01:11.259> then

the solution that I have for this is as

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.109 
the solution that I have for this is as
simple<00:01:14.080> as<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> shopback<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.340> wouldn't<00:01:16.060> even

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
simple as a shopback I wouldn't even

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.389 
simple as a shopback I wouldn't even
