00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
goes because it's fun you don't have to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
goes because it's fun you don't have to
rely<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.790> stupid<00:01:08.790> teammates<00:01:09.119> camping<00:01:09.510> in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
rely on stupid teammates camping in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
rely on stupid teammates camping in
corners<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.170> getting<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.740> kills<00:01:10.979> at

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
corners and not getting really kills at

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.679 
corners and not getting really kills at
all<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> then<00:01:11.939> plus<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> run<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
all and then plus when you run the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.000 
all and then plus when you run the
suppressor<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.320> gun<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> doesn't<00:01:13.890> take

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
suppressor on this gun it doesn't take

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
suppressor on this gun it doesn't take
away<00:01:14.159> any<00:01:14.549> damage<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:16.200> can

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
away any damage at all because you can

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
away any damage at all because you can
basically<00:01:16.619> kill<00:01:17.009> someone<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.610> four

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
basically kill someone in about four

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.280 
basically kill someone in about four
shots<00:01:18.060> across<00:01:18.270> map<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
shots across map even with the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.960 
shots across map even with the
suppressor<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> very<00:01:20.549> good

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
suppressor on so it is a very good

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.070

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
kill you so you need that and then I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.610 
kill you so you need that and then I
also<00:02:55.910> use<00:02:56.120> amplify<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.630> sound<00:02:57.080> or<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.319> news

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
also use amplify to sound or the news

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.530 
also use amplify to sound or the news
that<00:02:57.890> aren't<00:02:58.160> using<00:02:58.310> dead<00:02:58.550> silence<00:02:58.970> because

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
that aren't using dead silence because

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.390 
that aren't using dead silence because
many<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.019> these<00:03:00.170> Christmas<00:03:00.890> tubes<00:03:01.160> right

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
many of these Christmas tubes right

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.770 
many of these Christmas tubes right
around<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:01.819> time<00:03:01.880> if<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.540> are<00:03:02.569> watching

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
around this time if you are watching

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.509 
around this time if you are watching
this<00:03:02.930> video<00:03:03.080> laters<00:03:03.470> might<00:03:03.769> not<00:03:03.920> apply<00:03:04.100> but<00:03:04.430> it

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
this video laters might not apply but it

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.789 
this video laters might not apply but it
probably<00:03:04.730> will<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.840> Christmas<00:03:06.140> tubes<00:03:06.350> do<00:03:06.620> not

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
probably will the Christmas tubes do not

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.229 
probably will the Christmas tubes do not
have<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.070> clue<00:03:07.310> about<00:03:07.340> sound<00:03:07.850> boring<00:03:08.120> they

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
have a clue about sound boring they

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.460 
have a clue about sound boring they
probably<00:03:08.570> don't<00:03:08.750> have<00:03:08.840> headsets<00:03:09.290> because

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
probably don't have headsets because

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.210 
probably don't have headsets because
they're<00:03:09.590> just<00:03:09.769> getting<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.010> game<00:03:10.160> for

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
starting perks all that has to be first

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.960 
starting perks all that has to be first
and<00:03:50.600> then<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.810> that's<00:03:51.500> my<00:03:51.680> nine<00:03:51.950> or<00:03:52.370> as<00:03:52.790> my<00:03:52.910> next

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
special spark I run dead eye on this is

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.090 
special spark I run dead eye on this is
basically<00:03:56.269> because<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.320> like<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.829> be<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.070> the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
basically because I like to be on the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.319 
basically because I like to be on the
streaks<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.579> have<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:58.850> extra<00:03:59.000> damage

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
streaks to have that extra damage

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.400 
streaks to have that extra damage
because<00:03:59.720> that<00:03:59.900> could<00:04:00.049> be<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.320> difference

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
because that could be the difference

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.319 
because that could be the difference
between<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.980> winning<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.340> gunfight<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.120> not

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
between you winning and gunfight and not

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.759 
between you winning and gunfight and not
winning<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.600> good<00:04:02.780> fight<00:04:02.989> so<00:04:03.290> that's<00:04:03.470> why<00:04:03.590> we're

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
winning a good fight so that's why we're

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.170 
winning a good fight so that's why we're
dead<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.220> then<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.370> actually<00:04:04.579> don't<00:04:04.940> run<00:04:05.150> a

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
dead I and then I actually don't run a

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.729 
dead I and then I actually don't run a
third<00:04:05.390> specialist<00:04:05.900> because<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.380> like<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.620> get
