00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello everyone dear friends my name is 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.929
 Sergey and we continue to do reviews on 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.719
 mods for skyrim and today we have 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.350
 actually the third part of our review 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.720
 loved one 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.850
 heavenly castle and today I promised you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.250
 their own barrier what is the promise is 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.539
 promise to do besides, I forgot to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 actually show one location 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 they are called so not that they without 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.030
 mine brides mine is mines where you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.910
 You can buy the weapon that you remember 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.969
 we took anyone to risk in the forge 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.070
 weapons from the author jets what weapons 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.489
 more precisely the armor from the author here you can 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.289
 it's all buy to panic here itself 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.149
 and that is the nazi of the sky mines well 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.190
 if you want to go yourself then go 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 I honestly have time for this 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.920
 how today's release will be busy all 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.120
 arena and honestly the arena here from 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.840
 teleport opens only in 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.629
 dungeon 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.550
 as well as samarin can be reached in two 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.360
 core but it is much tagged from it but about 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.830
 it later so let's talk a little bit 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 in more detail we go down the ren dungeons 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.780
 through the portal here everything will be very cool 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.939
 let's go there but I honestly 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.680
 honestly go there that is without any 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.680
 childbirth laziness therefore 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.760
 let's do something like this 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.350
 here we see 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.750
 and same 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.090
 a neighbor clear memory I have media in Tyr 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.720
 forces all arenas and at the same time balyk guy 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.290
 got pout 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.290
 it happens 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.450
 I do not really know what that actually 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.740
 to see me the theory of this whole castle from 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.540
 okay figs with her by the way you can 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.550
 come down in an honest manner 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.630
 just as stated and miniatures from 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.160
 miniature arena here you are looking not in 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.020
 dungeon and those by the way who of those 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.570
 outgrown enter here is truly a huge 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.490
 skeleton and here is very long but here it is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.270
 by the way there are not yet 30 they are very weak on 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.330
 in fact, the 12th is actually here at 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.950
 we still have a chest in which there is 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.510
 any kind of trash skeleton first 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.230
 harmless but if the amendments touched one 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.610
 from the chests they will immediately attack you 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.350
 the vastness of the years she repeats they don't 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.970
 more harmful than ordinary skeletons of the same here 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.760
 such stairs that are not worked out 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.530
 that it was possible to step in them so 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.320
 Here we are on the arena itself 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.740
 arenas are in the sky right now let's 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.240
 I will explain a little something firstly here 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.160
 can again reach from both Whiterun 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.070
 I persuaded but it is a very long long 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 thiogammator path which is unlikely for you 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.420
 whether Kapets will ever like it 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.769
 here there are many roads many ways from 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.360
 there from there and I'm honestly not very long 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.040
 it's just easier to teleport from the castle 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.989
 that i tim i am one of those so sake 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.950
 fun powder it wasn't very good 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.500
 in any case, the arena is more precisely how 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.160
 can be said for classrooms and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.300
 class room or need a key 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.739
 key weight is given on the key immediately 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.100
 after you come on itself 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.560
 arena 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.410
 the key is in this box 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.540
 so boring so called what in these 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.280
 can say such special 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.650
 class places that is class there 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.739
 archer touch so forth is them 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.070
 there is a lot of things so are we a little 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.450
 later consider as you yourself arena 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.110
 let's look at an example 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.150
 the tower of the magician and here to go is low 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.840
 enemies with which one or another class 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.980
 less difficult to cope well this is not 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.000
 all Tower mage's tower and all these 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.400
 this morning weapons and proper armor under 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.590
 your class and everything is possible at all 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.989
 the whole game that is, you see a lot here 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.519
 the whole staff of magnus and early still there 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.370
 many stole all unnecessary 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.610
 pebble answer repeat 10 enemies 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:09.260
 which enemies are not weak I will not 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.750
 time to waste I do not know here let me 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.810
 beats and 80 before running here you need a variety 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:21.650
 poses of dangerous suits go up 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:25.310
 all about him upstairs and see 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.030
 dummies will see by the way from the lot of marine 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.490
 agent here it is even pure apparel 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.860
 the robes of your own tunic on 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 please a lot of different robes a lot 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.710
 actually different scrolls for you 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.080
 small such alchemical argument is not 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.650
 Decepticon Chemical Rights Tribune 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.240
 gardener 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.199
 But take there is a small chemical 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.139
 crown circle right here sleep brief 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.599
 purely some kind of rest and every 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.550
 equipment let's say there might already be 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:03.590
 up top is waiting for us and how it is only 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:07.460
 and which we can run like that 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:12.680
 so in general and in each tower of such 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.419
 Towers for only 4 that the swordsman the robber and 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.460
 here we will begin a huge lag 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.479
 because it starts here itself 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.320
 arena and yes I became fungi 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:26.690
 they are a writer let's take pines because 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.870
 it's hard for me to hide these hidden 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.880
 like I'm a doctor, and all on show at 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.389
 idea if not lairing it i'm a little 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.990
 logan and 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.729
 then little by little you press and beginners 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.160
 one gates the party opens but 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.050
 some for some reason they are all 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.250
 the gates opened and now these beards are in essence 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.699
 and there is the arena itself 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.800
 that is, you just take and wet all 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.720
 drow graph not only drow graph as you can see 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.610
 choice if so crushed here 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.690
 it is not only mourning that is concluded 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.470
 any evil spirits in anapa 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.950
 atrones 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.480
 here so the same for one of these drow 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.610
 the graph is just the key of that is a 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.220
 blood I do not remember there through through 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.930
 Theseus went through the team so I was 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.120
 because I would not like to not eat 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.120
 key look in one of these drow graph 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.980
 I have a key I hope for a relay 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.780
 get the key and all that stuff 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.370
 in the treasury can go your own 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.710
 that is, the purpose of the lease is to turn on 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.690
 treasury but me . like this 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.190
 itself is but me partially 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.440
 To be honest, I need a little bit here. 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.070
 because I don't like to fight it all 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.170
 wickedness 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:45.630
 so go on, you are all evil and such 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:48.060
 ice oh god we got into one of the towers 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.650
 the tower is a long way fish well in general here 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.930
 so now our countries rock today 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.940
 release repeat in theory if no bugs 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.169
 they should appear in turn while he 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.060
 push levers on this something 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.370
 committed no got out of there somehow 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.310
 Makar in general in any case at least 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.890
 I will finish this 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.300
 could clearly told about the celestial act itself 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:11.160
 mess up already so let's see 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.669
 How could clearly told about compare 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.320
 with her lock and that's how it is in general 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.320
 give clean clean sky 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.199
 as it is, as they say 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.090
 the whole bride 's three-piece castle 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.949
 I hope you really liked it 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.930
 there is a castle too much and 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.780
 cheat well as they say people are different 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:35.419
 so subscribe put likes 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.970
 rate the sea ​​as yourself 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:42.430
 by signing or rather by general 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.430
 all the best and see you soon
