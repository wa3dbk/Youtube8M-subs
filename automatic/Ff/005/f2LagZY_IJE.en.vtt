00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.050
 hello friends today let's see how it 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:11.050
 they make abstract images or drawings or 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:14.350
 paintings here we can see are very 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.570
 easy to do and really very very 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.079
 fun too so all the 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.960
 families older children we can 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:26.349
 enjoy this machine capable of doing 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.900
 Well, these authentic works of art, 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.329
 that I do not have more metro we will see how 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.370
 you do the materials that we're going to 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.430
 need is a large cardboard box 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 it has to be quite broad a cedé 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.990
 a stopper he cited so plastic he has 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.820
 to enter right into what is the axis of the 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.780
 motor a hot silicone gun 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.090
 a pile then for the electric theme 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.180
 watercolor painting and good as an 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.650
 tupper these for to raise a little 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.650
 and put the mechanism this electric and 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.330
 of the engine the first good the little maderita 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.059
 it has to be exactly the same 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.729
 size that the sheet that we will use 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.510
 in this case it's a din a4 so when 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.399
 mediando the e but you can find it 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 let's do the little hole to put the 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.660
 good engine there let's mark more or 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.229
 less how lucky is it 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.840
 tupper this one has just in the center a 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 marquita and well we use the torch and a 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.399
 knife we ​​will heat it to red and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.470
 cut it like butter so 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.800
 we will be giving you there evaluation 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.990
 we go without problem we will make the little hole 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.350
 we see that the engine fits perfectly 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.060
 so this part is already finished 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.490
 let's do the same but in the cardboard 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.250
 to know the center then from corner to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.230
 corner and we make a cross wherever 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.240
 the lines and that's the center of the box 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.950
 the same thing with the knife in this 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.530
 case then you do not need to heat it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.010
 we focus on the middle we know what is the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.680
 diameter make the hole and with the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.410
 knife let's go plucking until 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.490
 we get through the hole we put the 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.130
 motor and to mount we put the box we put 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.160
 the engine we present we see that it fits well 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.170
 perfect is aligned so we're going to 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.900
 start to stick paste with silicone 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.750
 hot first this part then we join 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.790
 what is the tupper with the box when 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.980
 it has cooled it is already well joined 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.050
 let's go around and that's where 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.910
 we will put a little more silicone 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.520
 hot to leave everything firm since 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.040
 this is going to turn very very fast we go with 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.840
 the basis of the paper the same to know the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.170
 corner corner center and where it 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.540
 cross the stripes that is the good center 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.340
 this is the bottom part of above 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.560
 when you buy a CD player but 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.590
 good if you do not have a cedé will serve the same 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.620
 we put it in the silicone center 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 hot stick 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.110
 ok and now the stopper cited in the middle is 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.230
 a piece of plastic that made a 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.370
 hole that just fits the shaft and good 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.340
 we put it there with silicone 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.560
 hot and we wait for it to cool and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.370
 I left all that I made a good piece 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.430
 we see that everything is almost assembled 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.670
 perfect assembly was very very free well 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.599
 that the electric subject two clamps 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.450
 crocodile one for the positive another for 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.819
 I have used the negative even though 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.769
 they are necessary or essential but 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.769
 good makes the work of 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.239
 connected so once we close 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.480
 the circuit will see how the engine 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.430
 begins to turn and our base therefore 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.310
 there starts to take revolutions very very 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.940
 really fast really 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.970
 Now let 's already the last step as 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.849
 who says is like fixing the paper to the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.360
 we make wood as well as a fold 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.330
 on the adhesive tape 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.280
 and we put it in each corner we put 4 1 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.500
 2 3 and 4 and on top of the paper 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.630
 but then we can we can 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.060
 remove without problems we closed the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.240
 circuit again we connect the motor and 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.100
 starts spinning so good the machine 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.480
 it's done now let's do the 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.130
 painting what is said this is watercolor good 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.079
 Well, the Chinese sell it in any 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.850
 We are going to sell paint 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.440
 a little bit with water because it comes out a bit 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.960
 thick we will put it in 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.780
 and color in each cup and then with 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.610
 spoons then we will scatter it by 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.010
 the leaf we mix until we get a 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.460
 liquid consistency but not much but 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.680
 it's good that the liquid is quite 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.320
 truth let's start with the colors 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.480
 I started by the brown is dropped 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.370
 well to the taste everyone his imagination 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.950
 and well the colors that I have had 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.680
 You can mix how many 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.290
 you want a lot of little that already at the pleasure of 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.140
 painter and the artist here you see is not that 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.540
 that slows down the masterpiece comes out 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.320
 It takes off very easy and we let it dry 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.900
 well where we want but that one hour 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.180
 will continue to stay dry good friends 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.000
 you have seen how easy fast and 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.890
 entertaining is to use and get these 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.130
 results with the drawing machine 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.200
 abstract so you 're going to 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.970
 remain the same or even better because 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.380
 well I just have these colors 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.600
 sure you can get 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.510
 some more that highlights more the paintings 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.730
 and good these abstract effects that 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.100
 we have managed to do so nothing 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.569
 mates I hope you liked it and 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.759
