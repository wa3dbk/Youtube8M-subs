00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Today we will show you how to do 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.450
 eyelid makeup guys and this 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.980
 was inspired by an order of gavin 98 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.650
 065 so I will show you how to go from 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.330
 the eyes like that to others so the idea is 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 Make your makeup stand out 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 despite your small eyelids as soon as 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.840
 to make up for all guys and prayers 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.460
 expert because I have the next record of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.650
 for I have my own fallen so that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 makes it have less space and for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.010
 papers leave us why we use 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 colorful shadows or who thinks then 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.849
 they will see me for nothing what has to 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.009
 change is the way they make up 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.809
 his eyelids and that's exactly how 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.090
 teach so when times are we go 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.879
 guys what you want to do is concentrate 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.739
 most attention around 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.410
 those I remove around the ball in their 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.969
 eye and then the colors that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.489
 Concentrate on the most external parts 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.770
 and more up so they can be 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.210
 see this part of here is really what 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.190
 less important because many times 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.739
 you may not see it when you open your eye 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 it's like it's gone so you can 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.270
 see them in a makeup for these 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270
 situations 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 and what I want to do is bring a little 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.080
 of darkness or a strong color of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.509
 that you're black in the dark rooms 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.369
 it can be good dark blue whatever 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.500
 but let it be a deep color to the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.650
 most external part of your eye so 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 we share external I mean here and here 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.549
 and at the top wants to make a 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 girl that is pretty finite 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.210
 so if you are going to use an eyeliner 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.210
 pencil make sure you have a tip 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.870
 and then he will do the same in the part 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.550
 Exterior 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.010
 very well I would very much thank the part 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.970
 higher because if you can not close a 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.970
 little more your part 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.430
 then as it is applying darkness 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.920
 on this side what I am doing is like 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.320
 to take my eye beyond what 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.660
 next I'm going to do so it's worth 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.510
 not doing this and this can 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.510
 go over it with a very thin brush and 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.620
 black shadow nothing to avoid it so that 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.620
 do not stick then up 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.580
 next they are going to take their shadow that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.170
 want to use and then use purple 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.610
 but with chalk of color that is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.650
 They try to get a little pin 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.570
 zarzis thick because I think it is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.160
 the simplest to apply for this 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.720
 way we're going to make it third has 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.340
 quieter could do any 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.170
 type of brush and now what they want 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.780
 do is look to the front and open your 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.330
 eyelid and see where they're going disappear 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.440
 and the color and place this color on 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.440
 that then for me here when he has 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440
 fact 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.300
 and then apply it 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.090
 and I want again to concentrate this color 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.459
 on this side as on the outside 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.440
 of the eye looking at what starts with the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.250
 external part and this is going to open a 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.250
 little bit more eyes 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.260
 now what is this pigment going to do 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.420
 white and an intense color is used in 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.010
 wake boxing hipnotik is the white what 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.989
 wants is a color that is more striking 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.190
 maybe it's resplendent by the 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.379
 finished so it could be for example 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.790
 blue but you answer it feels can 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.310
 draw attention and was how it will be 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.040
 this a small brush and it is wet 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.349
 and will apply it in this internal part 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.489
 that then with the extra that you are 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.739
 doing is again concentrates the 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.269
 attention to the roll your mobility the eye and 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.060
 this about here by the time of the 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.530
 abode perhaps or sadder than not 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.569
 apply shadows never in this part 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.750
 because pretty looks nothing more spacious 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.790
 then as you can always send 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.860
 in different ways and so close everyone 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.930
 the points is like seeing if many 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.430
 ways I'm not saying that you never 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.810
 apply man here but for 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.310
 purposes this video this in case 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.700
 I feel sir or what he is going to do is 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.590
 apply it 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.760
 from tear since we 're going to 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.629
 center the largest amount 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.629
 in the colony 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.280
 a little 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.050
 and to do this I will open the call them the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.670
 attention and attention that in another type 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.830
 of bet will be concentrated this part 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.930
 superior the others work in the account 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.430
 of the packaging extremely important this 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.980
 what you leave secret teach me will be 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.630
 much bigger and you can use the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.090
 spectacular mask because I feel 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.829
 that makes in these huge so I 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.020
 I'm about black and apply 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.020
 be superior and the inferiors also 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.810
 and if they have small eyelids 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.620
 and the rest of the protests use the 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.479
 compensated by the eyeliner you are top 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.069
 models of black what we are in the 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.720
 shadow that you are cold on paper 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.000
 instrument that meritxell on white 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.340
 version and super important mask me 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.990
 I'm willing that I love it that way 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.610
 then in your comments messages and 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.240
