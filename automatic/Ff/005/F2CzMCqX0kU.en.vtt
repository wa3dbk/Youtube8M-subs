 emotion of hysterical nerves of 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.620
 craving he even proposed as how 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.340

 little things with everything I have been very bad santa 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:46.990
 a decided theme 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:50.650
 if only you little devil and coal 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.940
 I'm going to confess one thing when I was 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.800
 little one had such a hard time but I think of 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.350
 true because I was like obsessed 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.990
 when I went to sleep and thought 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.990
 that I have to sleep if not for 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.810
 sleep I have to sleep 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.490
 even listening to noises listened to the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.489
 kingdoms until also the imagination 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.980
 that I had one I heard the reindeer and I saw 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.830
 how things moved 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.870
 imagine things there is a deadly stove 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.700
 that is fine moving all night and 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.080
 today he will close his eyes and listen to 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.840
 sounds no one would even say sleep 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.070
 slept a little but good at 7 the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.230
 tomorrow I had the lamparones again 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.880
 open you know what had happened that 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.350
 it's happened that the panic had passed 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.160
 of little mother yesterday for Christmas 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.160
 never more 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.100
 whatever Christmas is, it is 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.340
 true that during those days suffers like 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.870
 base the affection the generosity only 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 that's why I think it's worth it 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.529
 it's wonderful if you have not behaved 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:11.719
 very well you are still on time 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:11.719
 Merry Christmas, all of us are not us 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:16.549
 Many are many or I 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.639
