00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950

here<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.489> think

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
here I think

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.390 
here I think
the<00:02:12.960> one<00:02:13.140> coming<00:02:13.410> up<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.040> sentry

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400

gun<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.780> horoscope<00:02:15.780> right<00:02:15.960> there<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.440> would<00:02:16.740> get

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
gun I horoscope right there I would get

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.000 
gun I horoscope right there I would get
some<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.540> much<00:02:18.660> hate<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.020> one<00:02:19.350> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
some so so much hate on that one and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.470 
some so so much hate on that one and
hearts<00:02:20.280> go<00:02:20.430> right<00:02:20.610> there<00:02:20.820> but<00:02:21.540> when<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:24.210> when

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
hearts go right there but when I so when

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.330 
hearts go right there but when I so when
you<00:02:24.540> click<00:02:24.780> scope<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.890> timing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you click scope it's all about timing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.760 
you click scope it's all about timing

there<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:34.140> was<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:35.010> so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
there and just like that it was it's so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.800 
there and just like that it was it's so
smooth<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.240> nice<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.050> looks<00:02:37.080> good<00:02:37.550> but<00:02:38.550> uh

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
smooth and nice and it looks good but uh

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.610 
smooth and nice and it looks good but uh
hardscoping<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.080> more<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:42.480> scope<00:02:43.410> in

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620

scoping<00:02:47.850> i<00:02:48.090> would<00:02:48.450> use<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:49.250> lot<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> lower

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
scoping i would use a lot like a lower

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.210 
scoping i would use a lot like a lower
sensitivity<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.500> i<00:02:52.910> would<00:02:53.910> say<00:02:55.190> three<00:02:56.190> four

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
sensitivity like i would say three four

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.000

two<00:02:57.060> three<00:02:57.210> four<00:02:57.510> one<00:02:58.170> might<00:02:58.410> be<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.590> little<00:02:58.800> too

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
two three four one might be a little too

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.520 
two three four one might be a little too
slow<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.250> people<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.910> then<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> quick<00:03:01.140> scoping

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
slow for people and then a quick scoping

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.220 
slow for people and then a quick scoping
it<00:03:02.010> pretty<00:03:02.640> much<00:03:02.730> arranges<00:03:03.210> for<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.630> yourself

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
it pretty much arranges for you yourself

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.260 
it pretty much arranges for you yourself
because<00:03:04.500> i<00:03:04.620> use<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.920> as<00:03:05.070> that's<00:03:05.370> sick<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.000> at

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
because i use it as that's sick and at

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.020 
because i use it as that's sick and at
six<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.800> absolutely<00:03:08.160> perfect<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.790> me

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
six and it's absolutely perfect for me

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.720 
six and it's absolutely perfect for me
because<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:10.680> don't<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.430> those<00:03:11.580> high

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
because I don't like those high

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.730 
because I don't like those high
sensitivity<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.720> always<00:03:13.050> mess<00:03:13.290> up<00:03:13.530> like

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
sensitivity so I always mess up like

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.070 
sensitivity so I always mess up like
when<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.430> tried<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.820> drag<00:03:15.120> C<00:03:15.300> open<00:03:15.510> one<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.930> I'm

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
when I tried to drag C open one and I'm

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.430 
when I tried to drag C open one and I'm
off<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.290> target<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.800> always<00:03:16.950> flinched<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
off the target I always flinched the the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.310 
off the target I always flinched the the
right<00:03:19.680> analog<00:03:20.010> stick<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.210> absolutely<00:03:21.330> just

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
right analog stick and I absolutely just

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.710 
right analog stick and I absolutely just
missed<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.250> target<00:03:23.430> horribly<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:26.480> with<00:03:27.480> that

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
missed the target horribly and with that

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.830 
missed the target horribly and with that
it<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:29.580> really<00:03:29.880> sucks<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.300> but<00:03:30.510> don't<00:03:30.690> get

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
it it it really sucks you but don't get

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.220 
it it it really sucks you but don't get
any<00:03:31.020> kills<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:32.270> to<00:03:33.270> practice<00:03:33.690> quick<00:03:33.870> scoping

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
any kills and to practice quick scoping

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.920 
any kills and to practice quick scoping
like<00:03:34.980> maybe<00:03:35.580> I'll<00:03:35.760> put<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.940> tutorial<00:03:36.390> out<00:03:36.690> there

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
like maybe I'll put a tutorial out there

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.200 
like maybe I'll put a tutorial out there
for<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.200> guys<00:03:37.230> because<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:38.040> know<00:03:38.370> maybe<00:03:38.640> many

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
for you guys because I know maybe many

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.490 
for you guys because I know maybe many
of<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.450> people<00:03:39.660> don't<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.260> how<00:03:40.470> to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
of you people don't know how to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.170 
of you people don't know how to
quickscope<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.430> learned<00:03:41.670> off<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:42.000> a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
quickscope and I learned off of a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.120 
quickscope and I learned off of a
YouTube<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.080> how<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.410> quickscope<00:03:43.710> and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
YouTube on how to quickscope and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.360 
YouTube on how to quickscope and
partially<00:03:44.610> playing<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.030> my<00:03:45.150> friends<00:03:45.630> and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
partially playing with my friends and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.030 
partially playing with my friends and
it's<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.850> pretty<00:03:47.970> hard<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.360> get<00:03:48.570> down

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
it's it's pretty hard to get down

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.210 
it's it's pretty hard to get down
because<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.220> took<00:03:50.400> me<00:03:50.550> about<00:03:50.600> let's<00:03:51.600> see<00:03:51.780> I

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
because this took me about let's see I

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.100 
because this took me about let's see I
started<00:03:53.220> trying<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.090> September<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.810> pretty

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
started trying in September and I pretty

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.160 
started trying in September and I pretty
much<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.470> stood<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:55.920> December<00:03:57.170> September

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
much a stood in December September

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.550 
much a stood in December September
December<00:03:58.350> yeah<00:03:58.800> so<00:03:58.980> that's<00:03:59.160> about<00:03:59.480> September

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
December yeah so that's about September

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.680 
December yeah so that's about September
October<00:04:01.560> November<00:04:01.950> zoom<00:04:02.520> about<00:04:03.090> three<00:04:03.360> months

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
October November zoom about three months

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.350 
October November zoom about three months
worth<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:04.130> playing<00:04:05.130> ecology<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.790> didn't

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
worth of playing ecology you I didn't

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.150 
worth of playing ecology you I didn't
play<00:04:06.510> during<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.840> weekdays<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.980> played

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
play during the weekdays I just played

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.590 
play during the weekdays I just played
during<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.490> weekend<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.120> got<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.330> pretty

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
during the weekend and I got a pretty

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.400 
during the weekend and I got a pretty
good<00:04:09.690> hang<00:04:09.960> of<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:11.660> I'll<00:04:12.660> put<00:04:12.870> put<00:04:13.290> out<00:04:13.380> a

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
good hang of it and I'll put put out a

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.080 
good hang of it and I'll put put out a
tutorial<00:04:13.770> maybe<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.610> there<00:04:14.820> for<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.060> guys

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
tutorial maybe if out there for you guys

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.180 
tutorial maybe if out there for you guys
I<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.780> would<00:04:16.020> practice<00:04:16.170> on<00:04:16.470> combat<00:04:16.920> training

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
I I would practice on combat training

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.220 
I I would practice on combat training
that<00:04:18.090> that's<00:04:18.390> probably<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.750> best<00:04:18.960> thing

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
that that's probably the best thing

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.130 
that that's probably the best thing
because<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.880> black<00:04:21.299> ops<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.720> weren't<00:04:21.989> really

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
because in black ops you weren't really

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.020 
because in black ops you weren't really
able<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.590> quickscope<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.729> wasn't<00:04:23.880> really

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
able to quickscope and it wasn't really

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.690 
able to quickscope and it wasn't really
fun

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
fun

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.540 
fun
so<00:04:26.880> now<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.210> blackops<00:04:28.750> ear<00:04:28.990> it's<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.890> more<00:04:30.520> of

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
so now in a blackops ear it's a more of

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.910 
so now in a blackops ear it's a more of
a<00:04:30.730> quick<00:04:31.240> scope<00:04:31.480> friendly<00:04:31.870> game<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.830> get

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
a quick scope friendly game and you get

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.370 
a quick scope friendly game and you get
to<00:04:33.070> practice<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:33.790> targets<00:04:34.330> moving<00:04:34.810> targets

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
to practice it on targets moving targets

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.990 
to practice it on targets moving targets
and<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:36.310> guns<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:39.000> that's

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
and that have guns so that is that's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.270 
and that have guns so that is that's
what<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.240> learned<00:04:40.480> off<00:04:40.690> her<00:04:40.900> cup<00:04:41.470> for<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.100> while

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
what I learned off her cup for a while

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.730 
what I learned off her cup for a while

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.980 
during the first two weeks I got it
practice<00:04:51.880> quick<00:04:52.060> scoping<00:04:52.420> getting<00:04:52.660> familiar

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
practice quick scoping getting familiar

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.730 
practice quick scoping getting familiar
with<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.230> gun

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740

quick show that's all and I'd say the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.050 
quick show that's all and I'd say the
best<00:05:43.330> quickscoping<00:05:44.020> is<00:05:44.260> a<00:05:44.580> list<00:05:45.580> uh<00:05:45.760> right

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
best quickscoping is a list uh right

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.390 
best quickscoping is a list uh right
there

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
there

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.190 
there
