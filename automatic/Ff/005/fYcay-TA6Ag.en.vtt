you anyway so that's all done now and
yeah<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.020> took<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.530> longer<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.070> thought

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
yeah it took a lot longer than I thought

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.209 
yeah it took a lot longer than I thought
but<00:00:41.579> I'm<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.120> happy<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.540> over<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.219> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
but I'm so happy it's over with and the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.740 
but I'm so happy it's over with and the
reason<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.550> getting<00:00:44.760> 70<00:00:45.090> mining<00:00:45.480> right<00:00:45.600> now

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
reason I'm getting 70 mining right now

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.979 
reason I'm getting 70 mining right now
is<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:47.480> going<00:00:48.480> through<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> abyss

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is because going through the abyss

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.529 
is because going through the abyss
there's<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> little<00:00:50.280> mining<00:00:52.489> entranceway

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
there's like a little mining entranceway

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
there's like a little mining entranceway
you<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.660> having<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> higher<00:00:55.230> level<00:00:55.590> gives<00:00:55.949> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you know having a higher level gives you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
you know having a higher level gives you
a<00:00:56.100> greater<00:00:56.309> chance<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> getting<00:00:56.940> through<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.109> i

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a greater chance of getting through so i

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.920 
a greater chance of getting through so i
just<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.550> 70<00:00:59.910> mining<00:01:00.239> am<00:01:00.359> already<00:01:00.570> 70

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
just want to get 70 mining am already 70

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.470 
just want to get 70 mining am already 70
agility<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> agility<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> other

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
agility and agility is one of the other

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
agility and agility is one of the other
doors<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.199> through<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.710> yeah<00:01:05.549> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
doors you can go through so yeah just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.320 
doors you can go through so yeah just
having<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> higher<00:01:06.180> chance<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.369> making<00:01:08.369> your

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
having a higher chance and making your

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.140 
having a higher chance and making your
money<00:01:09.510> per<00:01:09.810> hour<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> little<00:01:10.860> bit<00:01:11.220> it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
money per hour go up a little bit it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
money per hour go up a little bit it's
just<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.450> nicer<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.680> yeah<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.220> method

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
just gonna be nicer but yeah this method

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
just gonna be nicer but yeah this method
right<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.090> probably<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.750> 50k<00:01:16.259> an<00:01:16.500> hour<00:01:16.619> or

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
right here probably like 50k an hour or

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.490 
right here probably like 50k an hour or
so<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.299> too<00:01:18.450> bad<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:19.140> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.350> fun

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so so it's not too bad it's kind of fun

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
so so it's not too bad it's kind of fun
as<00:01:19.619> well<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> change<00:01:21.509> from

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
as well it's I get a change from

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.560 
as well it's I get a change from
runecrafting<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.500> anything's<00:01:23.009> better<00:01:23.250> than

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
runecrafting so anything's better than

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
runecrafting so anything's better than
doing<00:01:24.570> laps<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> bank<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.040> getting<00:01:26.460> more

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
doing laps of the bank and getting more

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
doing laps of the bank and getting more
pure<00:01:26.850> essence<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.540> can't<00:01:28.200> explain<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
pure essence out I can't explain the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
pure essence out I can't explain the
fields<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> felt<00:01:29.220> when<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.369> 91<00:01:29.790> message<00:01:30.240> came

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
fields I felt when that 91 message came

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.740 
fields I felt when that 91 message came
up<00:01:30.600> mane<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> greatest

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
up mane but one of the greatest

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.469 
up mane but one of the greatest
accomplishments<00:01:34.439> I've<00:01:34.560> had<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.130> far<00:01:35.479> 2007

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
probably the greatest and just getting

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.429 
probably the greatest and just getting
ruin<00:01:41.159> crafting<00:01:41.549> again<00:01:41.869> without<00:01:42.869> runespan
