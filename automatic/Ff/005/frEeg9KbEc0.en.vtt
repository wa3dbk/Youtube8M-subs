americans so we thought the time

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.330 
americans so we thought the time
schedule<00:02:35.640> was<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:37.050> PM<00:02:37.410> again<00:02:37.980> nighttime

but unfortunately it was in the am so we

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.120 
but unfortunately it was in the am so we
thought<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.630> flight<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.320> was<00:02:43.500> coming<00:02:43.800> back<00:02:43.830> at

the
whole<00:04:24.350> deal<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.669> think<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:25.970> would<00:04:26.060> be

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
whole deal and I think it would be

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.540 
whole deal and I think it would be
pretty<00:04:26.300> neat<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.870> also<00:04:27.830> have<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.190> make<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.370> few

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
pretty neat I also have to make a few

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.070 
pretty neat I also have to make a few
