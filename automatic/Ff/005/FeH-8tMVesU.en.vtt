00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
on some natural harmonics and little

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.390 
on some natural harmonics and little
melodies<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.870> can<00:00:04.080> do<00:00:04.200> with<00:00:04.290> it<00:00:04.410> standard

tuning<00:00:05.670> here<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:05.940> go<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:14.240> should<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.450> use<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.780> in

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
tuning here we go I should I use that in

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.450 
tuning here we go I should I use that in
one<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.139> songs<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:16.949> got<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.190> break<00:00:17.310> this

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
one of my songs so we got to break this

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.070 
one of my songs so we got to break this
down<00:00:17.670> quick<00:00:18.060> natural<00:00:18.779> harmonics<00:00:19.289> go<00:00:19.410> 5d<00:00:20.779> v<00:00:22.430> g7

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
down quick natural harmonics go 5d v g7

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.990 
down quick natural harmonics go 5d v g7
b5<00:00:25.080> g<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.670> again

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
b5 g and do that again

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.720 
b5 g and do that again
so<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:30.710> three<00:00:31.710> times<00:00:31.980> total<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.610> then

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
so we have it three times total and then

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.560 
so we have it three times total and then
go<00:00:32.850> 5b<00:00:33.590> v<00:00:35.660> g7<00:00:36.660> b<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.290> 5<00:00:38.100> g<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:39.180> repeat

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
go 5b v g7 b and 5 g and just repeat

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
go 5b v g7 b and 5 g and just repeat
that<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.989> know<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> short<00:00:40.710> lesson<00:00:40.890> I'm

out<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.340> tough<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.610> were<00:00:56.699> dropped<00:00:56.969> D<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
out it's tough we were dropped D so I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
out it's tough we were dropped D so I
had<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> compensate<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.890> those<00:00:59.010> chords<00:00:59.430> so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
had to compensate for those chords so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
had to compensate for those chords so
anyways<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.780> mess<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:01.890> natural

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
anyways just mess with these natural

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.490 
anyways just mess with these natural
harmonics<00:01:02.670> 5<00:01:02.879> 7<00:01:03.239> 12<00:01:03.359> are<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> best<00:01:03.930> frets<00:01:04.199> form

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
harmonics 5 7 12 are the best frets form

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
harmonics 5 7 12 are the best frets form
but<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.640> hit<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.939> other<00:01:06.060> spots<00:01:06.330> as
