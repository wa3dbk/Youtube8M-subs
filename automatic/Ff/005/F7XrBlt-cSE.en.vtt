edge of the toilet tubing so it's like

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.580 
edge of the toilet tubing so it's like
that<00:03:05.810> push<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.989> right<00:03:07.170> down<00:03:07.519> right<00:03:08.519> down<00:03:08.579> there

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
that push it right down right down there

going to take about that much now I've
got<00:04:20.760> they're<00:04:21.760> gonna<00:04:21.940> know<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:22.840> have

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
got they're gonna know that you have

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.620 
got they're gonna know that you have
stuff<00:04:23.110> in<00:04:23.260> there<00:04:24.180> you're<00:04:25.180> going<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.510> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
stuff in there you're going to do the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.810 
stuff in there you're going to do the
same<00:04:25.900> thing<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.380> step<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.190> other<00:04:27.460> side

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
same thing and step the other side

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.810 
same thing and step the other side
that's<00:04:28.810> like<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.260> it<00:04:30.190> kind<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.460> looks<00:04:30.639> like<00:04:30.729> a

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
that's like that it kind of looks like a

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.890 
that's like that it kind of looks like a
piece<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.060> candy<00:04:31.360> um<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.530> cuz<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:37.419> cuz<00:04:37.660> i

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
piece of candy um just cuz I just cuz i

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.120 
piece of candy um just cuz I just cuz i
have<00:04:38.200> long<00:04:39.190> i<00:04:39.520> refer<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.000> my<00:04:40.630> pieces<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:41.830> paper

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
have long i refer to my pieces of paper

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.680 
have long i refer to my pieces of paper
is<00:04:42.340> longer<00:04:42.669> than<00:04:42.760> not<00:04:42.910> we<00:04:43.060> just<00:04:43.210> going<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.479> kind

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
is longer than not we just going to kind

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:56.760 
is longer than not we just going to kind
of<00:04:43.780> cut<00:04:44.020> this<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:45.870> size

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.130 

so<00:04:57.770> like<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.580> now<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.720> then<00:04:59.870> they<00:04:59.990> have<00:05:00.080> to

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
so like that now and then they have to

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.890 
so like that now and then they have to
attack<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:00.740> through<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.700> get<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.420> inside

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
attack you through to get to the inside

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.090 
attack you through to get to the inside
to<00:05:03.230> get<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.650> tree<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.250> that<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:05.870> one<00:05:06.100> now

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
to get to the tree so that is one now

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.320 
to get to the tree so that is one now
another<00:05:07.370> one<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:07.760> don't<00:05:07.940> really<00:05:08.060> have<00:05:08.270> to

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
another one you don't really have to

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.310 
another one you don't really have to
typically<00:05:08.930> make<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.530> but<00:05:10.460> um<00:05:10.690> it's<00:05:11.690> just<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.960> old

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
typically make it but um it's just a old

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:20.080 
typically make it but um it's just a old
duct<00:05:12.680> tape<00:05:12.890> tube<00:05:15.760> t<00:05:16.760> um<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:18.260> have<00:05:18.880> type<00:05:19.880> two

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
duct tape tube t um that I have type two

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.580 
duct tape tube t um that I have type two
of<00:05:20.150> these<00:05:20.300> in<00:05:20.360> their<00:05:20.600> cage<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:21.050> can<00:05:21.260> glue<00:05:21.440> them

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
of these in their cage you can glue them

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.000 
of these in their cage you can glue them
together<00:05:21.800> but<00:05:22.130> I<00:05:22.160> suggest<00:05:22.730> not<00:05:22.880> because<00:05:24.010> they

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
together but I suggest not because they

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.130 
together but I suggest not because they
can<00:05:25.220> try<00:05:25.550> and<00:05:25.610> chooses<00:05:26.030> as<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.360> glue<00:05:26.600> but<00:05:27.020> the

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
can try and chooses as the glue but the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.750 
can try and chooses as the glue but the
good<00:05:27.320> thing<00:05:27.350> about<00:05:27.530> these<00:05:27.830> toilet<00:05:28.220> or<00:05:28.640> are

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
good thing about these toilet or are

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.570 
good thing about these toilet or are
these<00:05:28.880> um<00:05:29.410> touch<00:05:30.410> cheap<00:05:30.590> tubes<00:05:30.830> is<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.310> really

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
these um touch cheap tubes is the really

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.330 
these um touch cheap tubes is the really
thick<00:05:32.410> so<00:05:33.410> it's<00:05:33.530> harder<00:05:33.740> for<00:05:33.770> them<00:05:33.980> to<00:05:34.040> chew

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
thick so it's harder for them to chew

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.170 
thick so it's harder for them to chew
through<00:05:34.550> um<00:05:35.890> so<00:05:36.890> I<00:05:36.950> like<00:05:37.100> to<00:05:37.130> use<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:37.850> they<00:05:37.970> can

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
through um so I like to use and they can

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.680 
through um so I like to use and they can
roam<00:05:38.390> and<00:05:38.960> they<00:05:39.080> can<00:05:39.290> run<00:05:40.070> on<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:40.610> stuff<00:05:41.540> like

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
roam and they can run on and stuff like

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.700
