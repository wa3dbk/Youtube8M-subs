madrid with and without bail with the
Welsh<00:01:29.479> wizard<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.200> squad<00:01:30.470> they<00:01:30.649> have<00:01:30.740> a

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
Welsh wizard in the squad they have a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.639 
Welsh wizard in the squad they have a

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
76.3 win percentage and they score about

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.680 
76.3 win percentage and they score about
three<00:01:34.009> point<00:01:34.250> 0<00:01:34.340> goals<00:01:34.580> per<00:01:34.820> game<00:01:34.850> now<00:01:35.390> without

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
three point 0 goals per game now without

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.200 
three point 0 goals per game now without
him<00:01:35.930> they<00:01:36.080> have<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.259> 70<00:01:36.680> 6.9<00:01:37.430> win<00:01:37.759> percentage

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
him they have a 70 6.9 win percentage

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.910 
him they have a 70 6.9 win percentage
and<00:01:38.390> score<00:01:38.660> two<00:01:38.869> point<00:01:39.170> three<00:01:39.229> goals<00:01:39.680> per<00:01:39.890> game

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
and score two point three goals per game

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.950 
and score two point three goals per game
so<00:01:40.520> they<00:01:40.670> win<00:01:40.910> games<00:01:41.210> at<00:01:41.390> about<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.690> same<00:01:41.720> rate

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
so they win games at about the same rate

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.900 
so they win games at about the same rate
but<00:01:42.320> that's<00:01:42.500> point<00:01:42.860> seven<00:01:43.250> goals<00:01:43.460> less<00:01:43.700> per

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
but that's point seven goals less per

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.520 
but that's point seven goals less per
game<00:01:44.119> than<00:01:44.450> with<00:01:44.600> him<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.960> squad<00:01:45.050> and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
game than with him in the squad and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.950 
game than with him in the squad and
that's<00:01:46.070> not<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.310> small<00:01:46.580> number<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.360> obviously

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
that's not a small number so obviously

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.690 
that's not a small number so obviously
