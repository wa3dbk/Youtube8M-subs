good<00:00:01.410> evening<00:00:01.820> tonight<00:00:02.820> I<00:00:02.850> figured<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.389> might

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
good evening tonight I figured I might

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.130 
good evening tonight I figured I might
as<00:00:03.689> well<00:00:03.990> make<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.040> video<00:00:05.400> describing<00:00:06.210> how<00:00:06.750> I

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
as well make a video describing how I

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.470 
as well make a video describing how I
usually<00:00:07.470> make<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.189> rings<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> make<00:00:08.910> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
usually make the rings that I make to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.039 
usually make the rings that I make to
use<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> chainmail<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.860> make<00:00:11.040> so

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
use in the chainmail that I make so

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.600 
use in the chainmail that I make so
basically<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.170> start<00:00:13.590> out<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.070> spiffy

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
basically I start out with this spiffy

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.310 
basically I start out with this spiffy
little<00:00:14.639> rig<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:16.340> you've<00:00:17.340> got<00:00:17.840> two<00:00:18.840> upright

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
little rig here you've got two upright

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.759 
little rig here you've got two upright
boards<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.270> they<00:00:21.439> they<00:00:22.439> don't<00:00:22.619> necessarily

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
boards and they they don't necessarily

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.439 
boards and they they don't necessarily
have<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.340> clamped<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> desk<00:00:24.090> they<00:00:24.300> just

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
have to be clamped to a desk they just

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.630 
have to be clamped to a desk they just
have<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.660> stay<00:00:24.840> upright<00:00:24.990> somehow<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.769> then<00:00:26.550> I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
have to stay upright somehow and then I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
have to stay upright somehow and then I
have<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> rod<00:00:28.130> attached<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.789> drill<00:00:30.710> which

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
have a rod attached to a drill which

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.040 
have a rod attached to a drill which
spins<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.910> another<00:00:33.120> rod<00:00:33.450> which<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.750> not

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
spins and then another rod which is not

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229 
spins and then another rod which is not
attached<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.620> drill<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.880> stays

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
attached to the drill which just stays

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
attached to the drill which just stays
put<00:00:37.910> then<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.239> take<00:00:39.600> some<00:00:39.629> wire<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.280> have

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
put then I take some wire which I have

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
put then I take some wire which I have
here<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.149> 18<00:00:42.750> gauge<00:00:43.050> galvanized<00:00:43.649> steel

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
here this is 18 gauge galvanized steel

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.029 
here this is 18 gauge galvanized steel
wire<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:45.629> made<00:00:45.840> several<00:00:46.260> coils<00:00:46.530> already

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
wire I have made several coils already

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.750 
wire I have made several coils already
there's<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.120> hole<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.440> mandrel<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
there's a hole in the mandrel which is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.319 
there's a hole in the mandrel which is
this<00:00:51.059> rod<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:53.820> attached<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
this rod here the one that's attached to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
this rod here the one that's attached to
the<00:00:56.420> drill<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:58.550> stick<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> end<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> wire

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the drill I stick the end of the wire

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.979 
the drill I stick the end of the wire
through<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.730> hole<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.600> end<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> there

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
through the hole on the end of there

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.810 
through the hole on the end of there
then<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.280> wind<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.180> wire<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.900> so

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
then I wind the wire a little bit so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
then I wind the wire a little bit so
let's<00:01:08.930> just<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.710> somewhere<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:13.640> watch

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
let's just put this somewhere and watch

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:24.920 
let's just put this somewhere and watch
the<00:01:15.840> show<00:01:22.880> I'm<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.150> sure<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> can

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the show I'm not sure if you can

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.090 
the show I'm not sure if you can
actually<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.070> doing<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:28.100> think

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually see what I'm doing here I think

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.649 
actually see what I'm doing here I think
I'll<00:01:29.280> stack<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> little<00:01:30.329> higher

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
I'll stack you a little higher

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.429 
I'll stack you a little higher
definitely<00:01:33.659> should<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.930> able<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.320> what

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
definitely should be able to see what

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.740 
definitely should be able to see what
I'm<00:01:34.530> doing<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.790> putting<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.240> glove<00:01:36.570> on

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
I'm doing now I'm putting this glove on

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.109 
I'm doing now I'm putting this glove on
because<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> makes<00:01:37.170> guiding<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> wire<00:01:38.310> along

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
because it makes guiding the wire along

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.980 
because it makes guiding the wire along
the<00:01:39.479> mandrel<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> bit<00:01:40.140> more<00:01:40.320> comfortable

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
the mandrel a bit more comfortable

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
the mandrel a bit more comfortable
basically<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> drill<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
basically now I have the drill and I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:57.910 
basically now I have the drill and I
start<00:01:45.420> spinning<00:01:45.720> it

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.280 

and<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:59.270> want<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.510> make<00:01:59.600> sure<00:01:59.810> that<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.110> keep

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and you want to make sure that you keep

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.370 
and you want to make sure that you keep
the<00:02:00.500> rings<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:01.130> though<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.880> loops<00:02:02.120> of<00:02:02.390> wire<00:02:02.750> on

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
the rings as though the loops of wire on

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.080 
the rings as though the loops of wire on
here<00:02:03.710> as<00:02:03.830> tight<00:02:04.100> as<00:02:04.220> possible<00:02:04.670> because<00:02:04.820> that

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
here as tight as possible because that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.350 
here as tight as possible because that
makes<00:02:05.350> tighter<00:02:06.350> rings<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.190> if<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.030> have

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
makes tighter rings and if you have

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.690 
makes tighter rings and if you have
loose<00:02:08.569> rings<00:02:08.869> that's<00:02:09.140> just<00:02:09.350> not<00:02:09.530> good

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.190 

then<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.940> take<00:02:17.150> your<00:02:17.390> happy<00:02:17.720> little<00:02:17.840> bolt

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
then you take your happy little bolt

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.010 
then you take your happy little bolt
cutters<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:20.230> snip<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.910> you'll<00:02:26.540> wind<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.930> up

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
cutters and snip and you'll wind it up

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.060 
cutters and snip and you'll wind it up
the<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.260> way<00:02:29.290> then<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:33.440> line<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.770> up<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:33.980> you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
the right way then you line it up so you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.860 
the right way then you line it up so you
can<00:02:34.190> actually<00:02:34.220> get<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.390> take<00:02:35.660> this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
can actually get to it you take this

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.810 
can actually get to it you take this
little<00:02:36.140> loop<00:02:36.440> here<00:02:36.940> cut<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.590> then<00:02:40.580> you

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
little loop here cut it and then you

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.240 
little loop here cut it and then you
slide<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:44.450> completed<00:02:44.960> coil<00:02:45.260> out<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.100> map

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
slide the completed coil out of the map

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.820 
slide the completed coil out of the map
and<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.990> basically<00:02:50.990> how<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.260> make<00:02:51.530> rings

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
and that is basically how you make rings

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.430 
and that is basically how you make rings
for<00:02:52.370> chain<00:02:52.580> mail<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.120> then<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.870> cut

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
for chain mail and then you have to cut

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.980 
for chain mail and then you have to cut
them<00:02:54.590> out<00:02:54.740> with<00:02:55.010> said<00:02:55.490> bolt<00:02:55.730> cutters<00:02:56.090> which

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
them out with said bolt cutters which

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.920
