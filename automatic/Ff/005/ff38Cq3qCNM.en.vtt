 That's how this wood color looks 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.960
 I have a tutorial that I am going to 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.760
 go up when I was doing this for 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.849
 that you see how they can paint their 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.340
 cardboard so it looks wood color this 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.320
 is simulating the table that is seen for the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.660
 what the table looks like 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.520
 but wood color looks nothing else what 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.240
