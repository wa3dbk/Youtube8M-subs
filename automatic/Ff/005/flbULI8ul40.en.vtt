00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.860
 I want to introduce you to the number 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.030
 which were 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.059
 developed based on cancellation fees 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.389
 and hours real time perez 13 07 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.599
 clock displays temperature 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.390
 current number low rise able 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.730
 there is an alarm clock 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.699
 as you can see the alarm clock 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.529
 This is shown by the points 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.829
 on off 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.829
 and changing the status of the button alliance 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.320
 time is not visible 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.760
 it either goes out from pressing 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.580
 for light up 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.890
 The percentage setting of the clock means we have but 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.840
 we are living 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.300
 when you press 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.850
 mode buttons 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.960
 we could 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.900
 under the appeal one time 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.360
 constantly time 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.280
 either time number 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280
 round 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.060
 either time is temperature 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.650
 also cover 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.650
 Well, the last mode is just the temperature 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.370
 oooh like niki sensor 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.790
 here 18 to 20 is located 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.060
 relatively close to cancellation 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.940
 a little bit he is a singer 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.200
 temperature readings a little 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.580
 overestimated 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.110
 desirable to carry away 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.980
 so moving the basic mode during 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.190
 temperature number 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.310
 tuning 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.850
 for settings 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.330
 we push 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.960
 send button 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 here it is 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 Sargis buttons cancel there let's say 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.080
 current cycle 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.080
 20 hours 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.160
 next button trial 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
 set the selected time 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.980
 will go over 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.840
 and settings current number 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.710
 in the same way he intends 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.350
 day month 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.480
 next year 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.760
 in setup mode here nowhere else 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.070
 are displayed 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.509
 it was just clear what is high 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.369
 can change the reason rub 2010 to 2099 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.989
 and so on 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.299
 more flexible aroused 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.559
 The point is clear. 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.969
 alarm clock 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.239
 fence because it's not easy 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.239
 bulygin empty 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.039
 we don't fit the circle 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.659
 turn on will live 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.659
 heard our key 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.680
 here the value of the year is probably all 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.369
 chinese watches 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:07.619
 some will say well 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.939
 all that we all will continue to save 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.819
 after all, thousands of drawing will be 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.739
 play again 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.129
 circuit feeds 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.219
 in the top five 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.629
 Power Glaser Source 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.619
 and real time clock 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.159
 standard thousands 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.409
 sqm 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.119
 it will be a year like everyone 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.129
 as you can see quite simply miracle nobody 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.299
 conveniently 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.500
 archers only feed that pen
