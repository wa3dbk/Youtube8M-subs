00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.540
 also note the advances that 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.820

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.760

 annexed to the good municipal presidency 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.970
 or me 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.200
 the governor will make official here in the

 of this and other municipalities to the crusade 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.260
 national against hunger what 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.970
 implications for a web municipality 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.780
 so the implications that they have 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.980
 is that we will have to join forces 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.080
 federal government state government 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.720
 municipal government to beat the 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.730
 main lags that we have move 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.640
 the indicators fundamentally in three 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.230
 sheds what is feeding what 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.390
 which are the basic services to the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.480
 housing and the dignification of 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.640
 housing spaces themselves and we are going to 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.070
 make a mix of resources not yet 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.170
 we sign the annexes we do not know how much 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.000
 is going to be but if we assure that it will be 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.250
 a mixture that will allow the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.940
 municipality count at least so 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.310
 except I tell you with about five six 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.810
 seven eight million more than those 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.760
 we destine ourselves to combat 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.180
 the poverty that today is going to be very positive 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.510
 we see them from very with very good eyes yes 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.150
 and it is already late for us here 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.009
 through fake TV this means of 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.930
 communication to which is very seen 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.439
 all our countrymen then tell them 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.879
 that we are working that we feel the 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.009
 fact that they are not here with us 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.229
 that we know they are doing to improve their 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.119
 welfare but from here what 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.469
 we remember with a lot of love and that 

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:47.379
 we are working and that the day that 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:49.629
 come see your land see your municipality 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.770
