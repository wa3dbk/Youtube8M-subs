this video so you can go watch it when I

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.830 
this video so you can go watch it when I
was<00:00:11.190> finishing<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.730> stairs<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.360> house<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
was finishing the stairs in this house I

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.829 
was finishing the stairs in this house I
had<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.080> come<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> way<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.519> could

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
had to come up with a way that I could

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.290 
had to come up with a way that I could
scribe<00:00:15.839> my<00:00:16.199> treads<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.100> risers<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.090> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
scribe my treads and my risers so that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.330 
scribe my treads and my risers so that
when<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> made<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.260> cut<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> miter<00:00:19.980> saw

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
when I made the cut on the miter saw

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.000 
when I made the cut on the miter saw
they'd<00:00:21.210> fit<00:00:21.510> perfect<00:00:22.050> every<00:00:22.350> time<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> was

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
they'd fit perfect every time I was

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.769 
they'd fit perfect every time I was
using<00:00:23.189> expensive<00:00:23.670> material<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.570> don't

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
using expensive material and I don't

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.170 
using expensive material and I don't
want<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> blow<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.680> any<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.460> more

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
want to blow it on any of them and more

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
want to blow it on any of them and more
than<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.570> didn't<00:00:27.960> want<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.349> big<00:00:28.680> gaps

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
than that I didn't want to have big gaps

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.580 
than that I didn't want to have big gaps
and<00:00:29.429> cracks<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.179> gnarly<00:00:30.660> imperfections<00:00:31.470> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and cracks and gnarly imperfections that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.090 
and cracks and gnarly imperfections that
I'll<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.949> cover<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.700> trim<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> out

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
I'll have to cover up with trim so out

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340 
I'll have to cover up with trim so out
of<00:00:35.160> necessity<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.969> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> came<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
of necessity I kind of came up with a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.750 
of necessity I kind of came up with a
jig<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> jig<00:00:39.360> does<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:41.370> tells

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
jig and what the jig does is it it tells

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.209 
jig and what the jig does is it it tells
you<00:00:42.030> exactly<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.870> scribe<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.559> treads<00:00:43.920> or

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
you exactly how to scribe your treads or

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
you exactly how to scribe your treads or
your<00:00:44.370> risers<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.660> care<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.079> good<00:00:46.320> your

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
your risers I don't care how good your

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
your risers I don't care how good your
framer<00:00:46.829> laws<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.550> careful<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.149> were

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
framer laws and how careful they were

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.560 
framer laws and how careful they were
the<00:00:48.809> likelihood<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.610> stringers<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the likelihood that your stringers your

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.650 
the likelihood that your stringers your
skirt<00:00:51.960> boards<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.890> Squire<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:54.030> pretty<00:00:54.449> low

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
skirt boards are Squire is pretty low

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
skirt boards are Squire is pretty low
there's<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.440> some<00:00:56.370> deviation

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
there's going to be some deviation

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.299 
there's going to be some deviation
there's<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.629> some<00:00:57.899> angle<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
there's going to be some angle to it so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
there's going to be some angle to it so
if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.520> picture<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.300> back<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> tread

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
if you can picture the back of a tread

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
if you can picture the back of a tread
and<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> front<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> tread<00:01:02.510> there's<00:01:03.510> going

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and the front of the tread there's going

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.039 
and the front of the tread there's going
to<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.960> some<00:01:04.439> angle<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.299> end<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.810> not

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to be some angle on the end it's not

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.469 
to be some angle on the end it's not
going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.530> 90<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.939> got<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> figure

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
going to be at 90 so you got to figure

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
going to be at 90 so you got to figure
out<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.560> scribe<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.250> tread

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
out a way that you can scribe your tread

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
out a way that you can scribe your tread
so<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.960> adjust<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.530> miter<00:01:13.770> saw<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so that you can adjust your miter saw to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.510 
so that you can adjust your miter saw to
make<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.820> cut<00:01:15.090> perfect<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> jig<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.220> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
make that cut perfect so the jig that I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600 
make that cut perfect so the jig that I
came<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.830> he<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.430> pretty

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
came up with it was he was pretty

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.969 
came up with it was he was pretty
rudimentary<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.540> its<00:01:21.720> design<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.950> has

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
rudimentary in its design and it has

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
rudimentary in its design and it has
some<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.759> has<00:01:23.970> some<00:01:24.150> Falls<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
some you know has some Falls to it but

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.999 
some you know has some Falls to it but
it<00:01:25.290> served<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> need<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.909> had<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.009> my

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
it served the need that I had and my

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.200 
it served the need that I had and my
treads<00:01:29.340> fit<00:01:29.610> perfectly

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
treads fit perfectly

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.960 
treads fit perfectly
you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> laid<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> scrub<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
you know I laid it in there I scrub you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.170 
you know I laid it in there I scrub you
know<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:34.009> width<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.400> my<00:01:35.520> angle<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
know got my width and my angle and I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450 
know got my width and my angle and I
scribed<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.750> lines<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:38.040> cut<00:01:38.310> my

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
scribed my lines and then I would cut my

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.819 
scribed my lines and then I would cut my
treads<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.180> bit<00:01:39.299> heavy<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
treads a little bit heavy because I

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.289 
treads a little bit heavy because I
didn't<00:01:41.159> necessarily<00:01:41.250> want<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> fit<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
didn't necessarily want them to fit the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.560 
didn't necessarily want them to fit the
first<00:01:42.450> time<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.549> didn't<00:01:44.880> fit<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.299> take

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
first time and if they didn't fit I take

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
first time and if they didn't fit I take
it<00:01:45.720> back<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> saw<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.770> shave<00:01:47.189> off

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it back to the saw and just shave off

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.819 
it back to the saw and just shave off
some<00:01:47.460> sawdust<00:01:48.210> flakes<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.930> took<00:01:48.990> them<00:01:49.259> back

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
some sawdust flakes and I took them back

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.520 
some sawdust flakes and I took them back
boom<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:50.820> fit<00:01:51.060> perfect<00:01:51.540> every<00:01:51.899> single<00:01:51.930> tread

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
boom they fit perfect every single tread

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.249 
boom they fit perfect every single tread
and<00:01:52.649> every<00:01:52.860> single<00:01:53.159> riser<00:01:53.509> fit<00:01:54.509> perfectly<00:01:55.110> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and every single riser fit perfectly so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.950 
and every single riser fit perfectly so
the<00:01:55.619> jig<00:01:55.890> did<00:01:56.219> its<00:01:56.399> job<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.630> said<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the jig did its job now like I said it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
the jig did its job now like I said it
was<00:01:58.049> pretty<00:01:58.110> rudimentary<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.979> its<00:01:59.189> design<00:01:59.579> in

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
was pretty rudimentary in its design in

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.039 
was pretty rudimentary in its design in
fact<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:03.049> thing

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
fact this is it right here this thing

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.510 
fact this is it right here this thing
around<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:05.509> used<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.780> used<00:02:07.110> rulers<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
around here I used I used rulers on the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.350 
around here I used I used rulers on the
end<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> basically<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.360> this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
end you know and basically you know this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.430 
end you know and basically you know this
adjusts

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
adjusts

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.140 
adjusts
this<00:02:13.920> adjusts<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.980> know<00:02:17.130> that's<00:02:17.820> how<00:02:18.030> it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
this adjusts and you know that's how it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.540 
this adjusts and you know that's how it
worked<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.740> big<00:02:19.890> problems<00:02:20.310> with

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
worked but one of the big problems with

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.270 
worked but one of the big problems with
it<00:02:20.730> was<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.240> couldn't<00:02:21.510> lay<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> flat<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:23.100> got

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it was you couldn't lay it flat it's got

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.820 
it was you couldn't lay it flat it's got
that<00:02:23.430> wet<00:02:23.760> wobble<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.320> reason<00:02:25.350> is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that wet wobble in it and the reason is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.640 
that wet wobble in it and the reason is
because<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.490> put<00:02:27.000> these<00:02:27.360> bolts<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> on

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
because I put these bolts here on the on

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.920 
because I put these bolts here on the on
the<00:02:29.220> bottom<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.880> they<00:02:29.970> raised<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.450> whole<00:02:30.600> jig

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the bottom so they raised the whole jig

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.880 
the bottom so they raised the whole jig
up<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.190> was<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.370> little<00:02:32.580> bit<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.850> problem

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
up so that was a little bit of a problem

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.140 
up so that was a little bit of a problem
doing<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.040> didn't<00:02:35.520> cause<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.000> know<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
doing that didn't cause you know it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.720 
doing that didn't cause you know it
didn't<00:02:36.420> cause<00:02:36.720> me<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.050> mess<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.460> kind

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
didn't cause me to mess up but it kind

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.290 
didn't cause me to mess up but it kind
of<00:02:38.880> aggravated<00:02:39.420> me<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.840> was<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> problem

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
of aggravated me so that was a problem

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.930 
of aggravated me so that was a problem
the<00:02:42.300> knobs<00:02:42.770> weren't<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.890> best<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.430> think<00:02:44.640> I

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the knobs weren't the best I think I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.330 
the knobs weren't the best I think I
robbed<00:02:45.300> them<00:02:45.570> off<00:02:45.690> my<00:02:46.020> my<00:02:46.470> feather<00:02:46.710> boards<00:02:47.190> off

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
robbed them off my my feather boards off

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.360 
robbed them off my my feather boards off
my<00:02:47.520> router<00:02:47.760> table<00:02:48.440> in<00:02:49.440> fact<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:49.950> knob<00:02:50.190> here

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
my router table in fact this knob here

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.030 
my router table in fact this knob here
on<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.760> end<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.210> too<00:02:51.450> big<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.650> would<00:02:52.800> kind

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
on the end was too big so it would kind

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610 
on the end was too big so it would kind
of<00:02:53.510> interfere<00:02:54.510> with<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> skirt<00:02:55.080> board<00:02:55.350> when<00:02:55.590> I

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
of interfere with the skirt board when I

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.040 
of interfere with the skirt board when I
was<00:02:55.770> trying<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.100> tighten<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.520> down

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
was trying to tighten it down

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.500 
was trying to tighten it down
the<00:02:58.260> whole<00:02:58.440> jig<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:59.040> not<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.580> very<00:02:59.790> beefy<00:03:00.270> I

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the whole jig is not not very beefy I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.720 
the whole jig is not not very beefy I
just<00:03:01.260> used<00:03:01.470> old<00:03:01.680> scrap<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.370> had<00:03:02.520> laying

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
just used old scrap that I had laying

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.450 
just used old scrap that I had laying
around<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.150> shop<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.800> real<00:03:05.040> real

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
around the shop so it's not a real real

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.900 
around the shop so it's not a real real
beefy<00:03:05.820> jig<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.990> like<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.230> said<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.500> did<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.800> job

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
beefy jig but like I said it did the job

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.460 
beefy jig but like I said it did the job
so<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.940> made<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.210> video<00:03:09.330> showing<00:03:09.870> how<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.200> use

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
so I made the video showing how you use

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.290 
so I made the video showing how you use
this<00:03:10.710> jig<00:03:10.980> even<00:03:11.310> showed<00:03:11.520> how<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.730> make<00:03:12.060> it

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
this jig even showed how to make it

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.970 
this jig even showed how to make it
through<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.050> up<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.440> channel<00:03:13.680> never

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
through it up on the channel never

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.530 
through it up on the channel never
thought<00:03:14.220> anything<00:03:14.490> about<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:15.150> lo<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.480> behold

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
thought anything about it lo and behold

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.500 
thought anything about it lo and behold
it<00:03:15.930> became<00:03:16.200> one<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.440> my<00:03:16.590> more<00:03:16.800> popular<00:03:17.010> videos

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
it became one of my more popular videos

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.930 
it became one of my more popular videos
which<00:03:18.510> told<00:03:19.200> me<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.800> other<00:03:19.950> folks<00:03:20.280> are<00:03:20.580> kind

anything for sale but you know I kind of
showed<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> how<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.430> make<00:03:38.550> one<00:03:38.880> for<00:03:39.120> free<00:03:39.270> in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
showed you how to make one for free in

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.750 
showed you how to make one for free in
the<00:03:39.600> video<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.830> little<00:03:40.980> more<00:03:41.220> time<00:03:41.430> passed

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the video so a little more time passed

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.000 
the video so a little more time passed
and<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.180> got<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.600> few<00:03:42.810> more<00:03:42.990> of<00:03:43.050> these<00:03:43.200> inquiries

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and I got a few more of these inquiries

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.730 
and I got a few more of these inquiries
so<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:45.150> decided<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.900> will<00:03:46.050> try<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.230> sell<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> few

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
so I decided I will try to sell a few

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.680 
so I decided I will try to sell a few
these<00:03:47.010> things<00:03:47.310> but<00:03:47.550> also<00:03:47.730> wanted<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.390> improve

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
these things but also wanted to improve

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.210 
these things but also wanted to improve
the<00:03:48.900> design<00:03:49.050> on<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.770> that's<00:03:49.890> what<00:03:50.070> I've

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
the design on it and that's what I've

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.340 
the design on it and that's what I've
done<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.850> that's<00:03:51.570> what<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.810> want<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.140> show<00:03:52.290> you

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
done and that's what I want to show you

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.130 
done and that's what I want to show you
to<00:03:52.530> do<00:03:52.970> one<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> biggest<00:03:54.450> improvements<00:03:55.050> in

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
to do one of the biggest improvements in

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.660 
to do one of the biggest improvements in
this<00:03:55.290> jig<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.770> now<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.310> lay<00:03:56.460> this<00:03:56.610> thing

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
this jig is now you can lay this thing

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.290 
this jig is now you can lay this thing
flat<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:58.770> course<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.160> raised<00:03:59.400> up<00:03:59.610> right<00:03:59.820> here

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
flat of course it's raised up right here

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.050 
flat of course it's raised up right here
but<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.230> other<00:04:01.350> improvement<00:04:02.100> is<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.030> a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
but the other improvement is this is a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.260 
but the other improvement is this is a
beefier<00:04:03.570> jig<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:04.230> using<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.920> wider<00:04:05.490> carriage

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
beefier jig I'm using a wider carriage

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.740 
beefier jig I'm using a wider carriage
you<00:04:07.020> know<00:04:07.110> water<00:04:07.380> little<00:04:08.160> extension<00:04:08.760> arms<00:04:09.150> so

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
you know water little extension arms so

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.450 
you know water little extension arms so
it's<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.960> beefier<00:04:10.380> jig<00:04:10.620> it's<00:04:10.890> stronger<00:04:11.310> it's

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
it's a beefier jig it's stronger it's

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.650 
it's a beefier jig it's stronger it's
not<00:04:11.580> going<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.850> break<00:04:12.060> even<00:04:12.420> though<00:04:12.540> it's

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
not going to break even though it's

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.630 
not going to break even though it's
suspended<00:04:13.020> right<00:04:13.350> here<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.220> can<00:04:14.340> lay<00:04:14.460> this

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
suspended right here you can lay this

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.700 
suspended right here you can lay this
thing<00:04:14.700> flat<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.540> makes<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.900> big<00:04:16.140> difference

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.710 
thing flat that makes a big difference

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.060 
thing flat that makes a big difference
and<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.670> functional<00:04:18.210> use<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.510> this<00:04:18.780> jig<00:04:19.140> I'm

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and the functional use of this jig I'm

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.020 
and the functional use of this jig I'm
using<00:04:20.280> better<00:04:20.580> knobs<00:04:20.880> now<00:04:22.400> right<00:04:23.400> here<00:04:23.760> these

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
using better knobs now right here these

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.270 
using better knobs now right here these
knobs<00:04:24.360> are<00:04:24.630> more<00:04:24.780> functional<00:04:25.080> these<00:04:26.010> are

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
knobs are more functional these are

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.810 
knobs are more functional these are
small

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
small

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.940 
small
so<00:04:27.090> they<00:04:27.180> don't<00:04:27.330> interfere<00:04:27.510> with<00:04:27.950> your

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
so they don't interfere with your

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.340 
so they don't interfere with your
stringer<00:04:29.640> or<00:04:29.670> your<00:04:29.940> skirt<00:04:30.270> board<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.930> that's

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
stringer or your skirt board and that's

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.710 
stringer or your skirt board and that's
better<00:04:31.680> now<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.550> way<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.000> made<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.450> so

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
better now the way that I made this so

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.230 
better now the way that I made this so
that<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.960> can<00:04:34.110> lay<00:04:34.230> it<00:04:34.380> flat<00:04:34.560> is<00:04:35.010> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
that you can lay it flat is a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.580 
that you can lay it flat is a
countersunk<00:04:36.240> those<00:04:36.510> bolts<00:04:37.020> right<00:04:37.200> there<00:04:37.440> on

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
countersunk those bolts right there on

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.640 
countersunk those bolts right there on
the<00:04:37.770> end<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:39.540> there's<00:04:39.750> bolts<00:04:40.110> are<00:04:40.290> counter

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
the end so there's bolts are counter

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.290 
the end so there's bolts are counter
sunk<00:04:42.500> now<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.560> carriage<00:04:43.950> itself<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.640> routed<00:04:45.180> a

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
sunk now the carriage itself is routed a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.730 
sunk now the carriage itself is routed a
little<00:04:45.510> more<00:04:45.690> accurately<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.470> I've<00:04:46.560> got

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
little more accurately and I've got

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.610 
little more accurately and I've got
better<00:04:46.890> tolerances<00:04:47.670> in<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:49.200> way<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.530> I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
better tolerances in it the way that I

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.380 
better tolerances in it the way that I
remove<00:04:49.950> this<00:04:50.130> material<00:04:50.340> here<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.210> that

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
remove this material here and that

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.520 
remove this material here and that
carriage<00:04:53.390> now<00:04:54.390> another<00:04:54.630> improvement<00:04:55.020> is<00:04:55.350> in

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
carriage now another improvement is in

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.680 
carriage now another improvement is in
this<00:04:55.680> extension<00:04:56.130> wing<00:04:56.520> there's<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.330> slot<00:04:57.630> that

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
this extension wing there's a slot that

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.620 
this extension wing there's a slot that
runs<00:04:58.080> through<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.500> thing<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.450> the<00:05:00.450> boat

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
runs through that thing and the boat

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.420 
runs through that thing and the boat
rides<00:05:00.960> through<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:01.350> but<00:05:01.500> also<00:05:01.680> bored<00:05:02.190> out<00:05:02.400> a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
rides through it but also bored out a

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.850 
rides through it but also bored out a
wider<00:05:02.760> slot<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.540> that<00:05:03.570> that<00:05:03.870> bolt<00:05:04.230> can<00:05:04.620> ride

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
wider slot so that that bolt can ride

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.120 
wider slot so that that bolt can ride
you<00:05:05.430> know<00:05:05.460> below<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.970> surface<00:05:06.210> so<00:05:07.010> you<00:05:08.010> know

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
you know below the surface so you know

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.000 
you know below the surface so you know
just<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:09.030> better<00:05:09.270> fit<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.720> finish<00:05:10.140> plus

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
just a it's a better fit and finish plus

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.250 
just a it's a better fit and finish plus
if<00:05:11.460> there<00:05:11.670> was<00:05:11.760> ever<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.180> reason<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:13.110> you

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
if there was ever a reason that you

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.530 
if there was ever a reason that you
would<00:05:13.380> have<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.800> put<00:05:14.310> these<00:05:14.580> little<00:05:15.180> angle

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
would have to put these little angle

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.910 
would have to put these little angle
wings<00:05:15.780> on<00:05:16.050> top<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.830> lay<00:05:17.520> this<00:05:17.790> carriage<00:05:18.270> flat

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
wings on top and lay this carriage flat

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.600 
wings on top and lay this carriage flat
like<00:05:19.920> this<00:05:21.590> those<00:05:22.590> bolts<00:05:22.980> wouldn't<00:05:23.280> be<00:05:23.370> in<00:05:23.490> the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
like this those bolts wouldn't be in the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.940 
like this those bolts wouldn't be in the
way<00:05:23.640> and<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.000> can<00:05:24.180> do<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.740> of<00:05:25.740> course

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
way and you can do it of course

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.710 
way and you can do it of course
everything<00:05:26.430> else<00:05:26.610> works<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.120> same<00:05:27.360> on<00:05:27.570> this

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
everything else works the same on this

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.330 
everything else works the same on this
jig<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.230> just<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.650> know<00:05:28.740> kind<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:29.010> loosen

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
jig you just you know kind of loosen

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.580 
jig you just you know kind of loosen
down<00:05:29.520> your<00:05:29.670> knobs<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.890> extends<00:05:31.890> like<00:05:32.100> that

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
down your knobs and it extends like that

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.410 
down your knobs and it extends like that
loosen<00:05:34.590> it<00:05:34.680> here<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.280> can<00:05:35.460> extend<00:05:36.240> it

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
loosen it here and you can extend it

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.690 
loosen it here and you can extend it
that<00:05:36.630> way<00:05:36.810> or<00:05:37.170> you<00:05:37.410> know<00:05:37.650> angle<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.280> however

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
that way or you know angle it however

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.090 
that way or you know angle it however
you<00:05:38.970> need<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.230> this<00:05:40.230> thing<00:05:40.440> will<00:05:40.560> extend<00:05:40.860> out

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
you need to this thing will extend out

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.440 
you need to this thing will extend out
about<00:05:41.310> 45<00:05:41.850> inches<00:05:42.330> maybe<00:05:42.810> 45<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.590> half<00:05:44.450> so

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
about 45 inches maybe 45 and a half so

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.360 
about 45 inches maybe 45 and a half so
it<00:05:45.540> ought<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.780> measure<00:05:46.020> any<00:05:46.380> tread<00:05:46.950> or<00:05:47.160> riser

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
it ought to measure any tread or riser

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.060 
it ought to measure any tread or riser
that<00:05:47.640> you'd<00:05:47.880> ever<00:05:48.030> have<00:05:48.440> little<00:05:49.440> wings<00:05:49.680> here

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
that you'd ever have little wings here

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.400 
that you'd ever have little wings here
on<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.340> end<00:05:50.610> or<00:05:50.850> long<00:05:51.450> enough<00:05:51.840> so<00:05:52.110> that<00:05:52.260> they

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
on the end or long enough so that they

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.570 
on the end or long enough so that they
can<00:05:52.730> scribe<00:05:53.730> a<00:05:54.260> standard<00:05:55.260> size<00:05:55.500> tread<00:05:55.950> I<00:05:56.340> think

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
can scribe a standard size tread I think

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.560 
can scribe a standard size tread I think
they're<00:05:56.700> about<00:05:56.880> 12<00:05:57.150> inches<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:59.450> you<00:06:00.450> know

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
they're about 12 inches and you know

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.190 
they're about 12 inches and you know
this<00:06:00.780> is<00:06:01.100> this<00:06:02.100> is<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.460> jig<00:06:02.730> in<00:06:03.090> it<00:06:03.270> it's<00:06:04.020> a

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
this is this is the jig in it it's a

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.250 
this is this is the jig in it it's a
better<00:06:04.440> design<00:06:04.920> I've<00:06:05.280> made<00:06:05.490> about<00:06:06.260> three

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
better design I've made about three

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.320 
better design I've made about three
evolutions<00:06:07.920> in<00:06:08.070> this<00:06:08.250> design<00:06:08.610> and<00:06:09.000> it<00:06:09.090> just

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
evolutions in this design and it just

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.480 
evolutions in this design and it just
it's<00:06:09.540> more<00:06:09.780> functional<00:06:10.080> now<00:06:10.500> and<00:06:10.860> so<00:06:11.430> I've

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
it's more functional now and so I've

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.130 
it's more functional now and so I've
been<00:06:11.610> trying<00:06:11.820> to<00:06:11.970> pick<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.180> rainy<00:06:12.480> day<00:06:12.570> once<00:06:12.990> a

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
been trying to pick a rainy day once a

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.630 
been trying to pick a rainy day once a
month<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.560> making<00:06:13.710> up<00:06:13.950> five<00:06:14.160> or<00:06:14.190> ten<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:14.490> these

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
month and making up five or ten of these

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.250 
month and making up five or ten of these
things<00:06:14.970> to<00:06:15.150> kind<00:06:15.330> of<00:06:15.390> keep<00:06:15.450> on<00:06:15.750> hand<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.170> I

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
things to kind of keep on hand that I

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.690 
things to kind of keep on hand that I
can<00:06:16.440> sell<00:06:17.840> I've<00:06:18.840> built<00:06:19.140> a<00:06:19.230> lot<00:06:19.350> of<00:06:19.410> jigs<00:06:19.860> now<00:06:20.250> so

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
can sell I've built a lot of jigs now so

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.500 
can sell I've built a lot of jigs now so
when<00:06:21.330> I<00:06:21.360> build<00:06:21.660> these<00:06:21.870> things<00:06:22.170> they're<00:06:22.950> more

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
when I build these things they're more

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.880 
when I build these things they're more
consistent<00:06:24.510> repeatable<00:06:25.020> each<00:06:25.260> time<00:06:25.590> that<00:06:25.800> I

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
consistent repeatable each time that I

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.950 
consistent repeatable each time that I
built<00:06:26.130> it<00:06:26.340> so<00:06:26.640> my<00:06:27.000> quality<00:06:27.390> control<00:06:27.780> has<00:06:27.930> never

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
built it so my quality control has never

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.230 
built it so my quality control has never
been<00:06:28.290> better<00:06:28.560> I've<00:06:29.520> sold<00:06:29.790> a<00:06:29.850> few<00:06:30.030> of<00:06:30.120> these

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
been better I've sold a few of these
