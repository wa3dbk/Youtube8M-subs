00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 so now i will show you the switch 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:28.159
 the ship on the example of a quickly assembled 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.159
 horseradish lowered spring raised 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.159
 raised 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.950
 good afternoon now i will show you 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.460
 ship management rather self 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.009
 switching on the example of the fast national 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.960
 Khalez ship from a small plane 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:53.420
 which is designed for quick 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:02:00.050
 currents in this place flow is weak 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:03.440
 it will be easiest to show work here 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:11.069
 current is a weak boat worth water 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:15.060
 almost horizontal and and really nose 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.110
 does not even raise its current 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.000
 on the left, that is, the working position of the pendulum 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.190
 it is pressed against the left cross member of the frame and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 cross member 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.620
 Now I have slightly increased I think 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.620
 see here it is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.900
 lie to the left 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.770
 this is our working position when biting 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.650
 fish or if you need to go down 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:56.440
 flow you just loosen the spinning 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.630
 lower and raise going on 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:08.670
 switching is the same in reverse 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:11.040
 the side is all very simple 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.630
 sorry 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.239
 show how it works quickly and hardly 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:23.430
 I can but now try to take off one 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.430
 with tripod can be 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.269
 This is my sovzvodny ship for 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.269
 fast speck
