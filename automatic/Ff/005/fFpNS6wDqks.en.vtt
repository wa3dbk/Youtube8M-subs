00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 I regard this here is an engine of a 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.960
 33-crankshaft trimmer 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.880
 It's new, I'm going to take it down for you. 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:27.840
 demonstrate where the problem was already 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:37.579
 it's all soltan let the cylinder and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:52.500
 this one is the one that is right on the 33rd 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 but the Christian and if it is his he he 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 enter just have no slack that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.799
 It's hard to see it there. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 in the video but does not have the piston 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:10.760
 came with the kit you see the difference of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760
 two 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:37.500
 what came is a few millimeters less 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:41.369
 then you put here gets a break and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.770
 if there is probably a 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 26 remembered trimmer 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:55.759
 the rings came correct so much that it looks 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.840
 You take the ring I took from this one. 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.840
 he does not even go in here 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:32.960
 Are you finding the right one without a break? 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:38.690
 practically without slack and another is with 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.410
 off then this is the piston shaft 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.130
 smaller 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.130
 OK
