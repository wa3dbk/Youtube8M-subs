00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.880 
hardest thing I've ever done
like<00:02:07.750> I'm<00:02:07.900> in<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.080> best<00:02:08.319> shape<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.590> my<00:02:08.770> life

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
like I'm in the best shape of my life

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.400 
like I'm in the best shape of my life
and<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.759> I'm<00:02:10.090> I'm<00:02:10.569> really<00:02:10.690> glad<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.230> did

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
and and I'm I'm really glad that I did

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.949 
and and I'm I'm really glad that I did
that<00:02:11.560> transition<00:02:12.480> everything<00:02:13.480> can<00:02:13.750> start

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
that transition everything can start

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.600 
that transition everything can start
making<00:02:14.080> more<00:02:14.410> sense<00:02:14.680> when<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> reason

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
making more sense when you have a reason

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.729 
making more sense when you have a reason
to<00:02:15.970> fight<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.569> think<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.140> makes<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.470> even<00:02:17.590> more

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
to fight I think that makes it even more

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.340 
to fight I think that makes it even more
inspiring<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:19.030> train<00:02:19.270> an<00:02:19.480> amazed<00:02:19.780> when<00:02:20.319> you

inspiring to train an amazed when you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.470 
inspiring to train an amazed when you
can<00:02:20.680> find<00:02:20.950> other<00:02:21.190> things<00:02:21.310> outside<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.239> box

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.460 
can find other things outside the box
that<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.290> motivate<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.959> weight<00:02:26.200> class

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
