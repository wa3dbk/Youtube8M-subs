00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi how are you on this occasion 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.569
 I bring this makeup for these 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.970
 next halloween parties or day of 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.590
 dead according to your region this makeup 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.840
 what can you do with elements that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.840
 you have in your house and you do not need to buy 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.150
 absolutely nothing about the skin 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.630
 completely clean stroke a half 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 circle in the lower eyelid then 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.960
 filling with a white pencil all 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.960
 in a semicircle 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.250
 over the white area like a shadow of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.050
 same color 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.050
 this to intensify the target 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.490
 then especially my upper eyelid 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.490
 I apply a base for shadows 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.110
 I use the same white shadow under 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.110
 the eyebrow 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.110
 then with a sponge brush I apply 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.990
 a little blue shadow on the eyelid 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.030
 mobile was doing very soft touches 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.030
 so as not to stain the white area 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.250
 with the brush diffused it takes a bit of 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.110
 light blue and placed it over the basin and 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.590
 It retouched slightly below the white 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.590
 Eyebrows 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.810
 I start filling my eyebrows with a 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 dark brown 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.900
 then on the brown color I put a little 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.900
 red - colored 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.479
 I brush a brush through my eyebrows and then 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.020
 I correct the imperfections with a little 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.020
 of corrector 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.270
 yes 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.910
 with a sponge I'm removing the excess 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.520
 with a black eyeliner I trace a 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.520
 semicircle on the white area 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.069
 then on these lines I apply some 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.170
 false eyelashes 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.709
 this to simulate having some eyes 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.709
 enormous 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.999
 then in the upper eyelid to a 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.999
 outlined until joining it with the previous 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.200
 or not 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.540
 but not 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.290
 to get rid of the white color 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.640
 surplus I apply a little bit of concealer and 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.640
 with the sponge said it 1 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.120
 then I draw some small lines to 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.120
 pretend to have huge eyelashes 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 to finish the eyes he applied mask of 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.500
 tabs 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.390
 then applied the makeup base that 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.650
 I always use all over my face 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.650
 including the lips 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.940
 i 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.170
 to simulate having small lips 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.960
 like a doll line my 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.780
 lips with a red color until before 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.890
 get to the corner this like doing 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.890
 a heart 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.539
 and 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.539
 here 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.990
 on the line part was applied a 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.990
 little lipstick in a very similar tone 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.120
 and then apply quite blush on a 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.120
 very specific area 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:10.279
 with my brown pencil I made some small 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:12.679
 spots simulating freckles and then 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:15.459
 on these same I placed a bit of 

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.459
 red tone 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.779
