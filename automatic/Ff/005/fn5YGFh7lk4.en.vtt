 [music] 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:10.220
 our loyalty and share 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.350
 tejer and tasks 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.600
 continue the series in hot hot 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.850
 interview and main demo demo demo as 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.470
 you feel great you just 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.779
 won the moon tell a little about this 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.670
 let's start the game from the end but in principle 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.860
 at the end how it turned out very complete zero 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.169
 I do not know how it happened by itself not 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.029
 apparently he expected from he played like that 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.520
 as if I typed clean to the public I don't know 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.960
 it seemed to me but actually 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.900
 the result was 0 my favor 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.610
 I'm glad this escort is good but there is 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.890
 a little more detail you get on 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.600
 munu you expected us to stay no i 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.570
 didn't expect just played and hoped 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.790
 the rival gets caught as easily as possible 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.710
 be that as it granted the request 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.370
 read what got with arhat the moon 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.350
 Basically, I was well pleased 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.700
 there was no such thing after you 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.490
 the program plays on you 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.870
 12 you somehow would not know or 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.360
 motivation for revenge or vice versa and 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.740
 somehow a little bit afraid of this match, I did not 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.939
 I was afraid on the contrary did not want so 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.189
 win because a little was 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.770
 upset you i ha I so I lost that 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.659
 English game but it turned out 2 but I 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.189

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.230

 wandered around the city on the show will be 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.909
 Interestingly, the city is still like that 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.010
 it would work out because not 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.270

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.250
 what was it and how was it yesterday 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.270

 China knows as well as words such mat 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.470
 can not be said and the search will not speak 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.959
 Well, in principle, I thought so, but also 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.380
 all nafig went to bed wake up and I 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.050
 replaced by a Turk from an elf but not at home 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.220
 everything came so bad came played won two 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.209
 match of three that was just grabbe 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.709

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.730
 I could not than such a specific play 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.760
 because all my chips knew but the principle 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.260
 signal standard for such a group 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.220
 so as soon as possible to come 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.230

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.769

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.769

 they were running asking for apparently not at all 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.840
