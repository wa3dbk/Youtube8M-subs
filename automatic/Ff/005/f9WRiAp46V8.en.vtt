00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 for starters we answer the question but to this 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.620
 microphone or stereo 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.240
 let's look at his device 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.820
 unscrew the two screws and remove the cover 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.889
 now we see 2 perpendicular 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 located primer one is directed 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.630
 forward the other side is opposite 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.670
 the output switch we get 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.460
 surround sound created not by 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.619
 stereo base as usual and apparently for 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
 phase difference count 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.800
 return the casing in place and go 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.830
 test microphone in urban 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830
 conditions 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.570
 significant lack of microphone 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.640
 is poor insulation from noise 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.980
 transmitted right through his body 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.670
 the problem is compounded due to hard on 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.110
 complete camera mount 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.820
 As a result, the noise gets recorded. 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.720
 manual focus and simple 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.410
 touches the camera had to do 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.810
 soundproof mount with 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.709
 using polyurethane foam and cut 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.709
 bicycle cameras
