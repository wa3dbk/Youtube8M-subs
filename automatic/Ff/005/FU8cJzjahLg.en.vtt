00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
just the actual raw gameplay files on my

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.140 
just the actual raw gameplay files on my
computer<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.310> could<00:02:59.459> probably<00:02:59.640> afford<00:02:59.819> to

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
computer that I could probably afford to

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.670 
computer that I could probably afford to
take<00:03:00.299> like<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.569> month<00:03:00.840> off<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.170> call<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.440> duty

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
take like a month off of call of duty

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.619 
take like a month off of call of duty
and<00:03:01.709> nothing<00:03:02.310> really<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:02.670> change<00:03:02.970> on<00:03:03.299> my

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
and nothing really would change on my

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.910 
and nothing really would change on my
channel<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.079> I'm<00:03:04.140> thinking<00:03:04.410> about<00:03:04.590> really

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
channel so I'm thinking about really

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.360 
channel so I'm thinking about really
straying<00:03:05.910> away<00:03:06.060> from<00:03:06.510> cod<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.280> bringing<00:03:08.280> up

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
straying away from cod and bringing up

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.830 
straying away from cod and bringing up
lots<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.819> other<00:03:08.940> games<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.540> channel
