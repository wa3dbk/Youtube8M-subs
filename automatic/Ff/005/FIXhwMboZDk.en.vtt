00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
information contained within it and that

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.629 
information contained within it and that
important<00:00:12.780> information<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.410> course<00:00:13.590> was<00:00:13.920> this

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
important information of course was this

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.140 
important information of course was this
is<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.120> last<00:00:15.800> Golden<00:00:16.800> Lotus<00:00:17.039> daily<00:00:17.820> video

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
is the last Golden Lotus daily video

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.960 
is the last Golden Lotus daily video
that<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:18.600> doing<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.140> over<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.760> in

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
that I'm doing it's over now this is in

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 
that I'm doing it's over now this is in
I<00:00:21.210> think<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:21.960> also<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.760> information

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
I think there was also some information

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.310 
I think there was also some information
about<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.000> release<00:00:24.390> date<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.720> world<00:00:25.289> of

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
about a release date for world of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
about a release date for world of
warcraft<00:00:25.769> mists<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:25.980> pandaria<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.060> think

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
warcraft mists of pandaria but I think

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.150 
warcraft mists of pandaria but I think
this<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.260> quite<00:00:28.470> clearly<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> most

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
this was quite clearly the most

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.350 
this was quite clearly the most
important<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.119> informations<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.750> provided

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
important of the informations I provided

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.720 
important of the informations I provided
so<00:00:33.360> finally<00:00:33.960> I've<00:00:34.200> managed<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.800> turn<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
so finally I've managed to turn to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
so finally I've managed to turn to
exalted<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> Golden<00:00:36.930> Lotus<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
exalted with the Golden Lotus and this

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.610 
exalted with the Golden Lotus and this
grunts<00:00:38.070> me<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.180> final<00:00:39.540> part<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
grunts me now the final part of the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010 
grunts me now the final part of the
quest<00:00:40.890> chain<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.910> will<00:00:42.149> lead<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> an<00:00:42.840> end

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
quest chain which will lead to an end

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.540 
quest chain which will lead to an end
and<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> involves<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.070> phasing

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and it involves some more phasing

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
and it involves some more phasing
outside<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.079> quite<00:00:46.320> cool<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
outside so it's quite cool to see that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
outside so it's quite cool to see that
because<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:47.820> i<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:49.079> vale<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> eternal

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
because now i see the vale of eternal

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.819 
because now i see the vale of eternal
blossoms<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.940> different<00:00:51.329> light<00:00:51.620> this<00:00:52.620> was

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
blossoms in a different light this was

the right tiles if you don't stick onto
the<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.229> tiles<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.490> you'll<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.939> hit<00:01:09.180> by

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.140 
this this serpent dragon serpent boss
and<00:01:15.180> I've<00:01:15.960> got<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.470> say<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.070> boss<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.610> great

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and I've got to say this boss was great

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210 
and I've got to say this boss was great
if<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.659> first<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.500> can't<00:01:19.710> stand<00:01:19.979> still

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
if I first of all you can't stand still

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.179 
if I first of all you can't stand still
because<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.479> fires<00:01:21.780> those<00:01:22.200> rings<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
because it fires those rings of

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.730 
because it fires those rings of
electrical<00:01:23.909> charges<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.479> yourself<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
electrical charges at yourself so if you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.080 
electrical charges at yourself so if you
stand<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> start<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> tick<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:26.909> some

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
stand in them you start to tick for some

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600 
stand in them you start to tick for some
great<00:01:27.330> big<00:01:27.540> damage<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.590> drags<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.310> over

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
great big damage it then drags you over

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
great big damage it then drags you over
the<00:01:29.700> side<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> bottom<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the side down to the bottom there and I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
the side down to the bottom there and I
just<00:01:32.100> decided<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.909> sit<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.689> wait<00:01:34.049> for

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
just decided to sit back and wait for

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.950 
just decided to sit back and wait for
its<00:01:34.470> attacks<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.950> dissipate<00:01:35.430> however<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
its attacks to dissipate however as you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469 
its attacks to dissipate however as you
saw<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.979> covers<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.549> floor<00:01:38.970> completely

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
saw it just covers the floor completely

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.319 
saw it just covers the floor completely
in<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.799> hefty<00:01:41.250> electrical<00:01:41.729> charge<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> if

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
in that hefty electrical charge and if

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.510 
in that hefty electrical charge and if
you<00:01:42.450> stand<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.439> take<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:43.860> 40<00:01:44.340> k

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you stand in it you take about 40 k

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.109 
you stand in it you take about 40 k
damage<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.009> impressed<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.939> this

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
damage so I was very impressed with this

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.060 
damage so I was very impressed with this
boss<00:01:48.360> fight<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.869> its<00:01:48.990> mechanics<00:01:49.500> considering

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
boss fight and its mechanics considering

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.730 
boss fight and its mechanics considering
its<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.310> solo<00:01:50.820> boss<00:01:51.320> because<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.649> only

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740

my best advice in the situation's to try

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.860 
my best advice in the situation's to try
get<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.530> these<00:03:58.620> groups<00:03:59.099> as<00:03:59.340> best<00:03:59.609> as<00:03:59.760> possible

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
get to these groups as best as possible

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.449 
get to these groups as best as possible
because<00:04:00.870> you're<00:04:01.169> only<00:04:01.260> power<00:04:01.620> your<00:04:02.280> power

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.839 
only stays on you for a certain amount
of<00:04:04.019> time<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.380> then<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.590> drops<00:04:04.919> I'm<00:04:05.489> not<00:04:05.790> sure

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
of time and then it drops I'm not sure

of time and then it drops I'm not sure
there<00:04:06.780> are<00:04:06.900> three<00:04:07.169> bosses<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.829> give<00:04:08.010> you

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
there are three bosses that give you

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.289 
there are three bosses that give you
their<00:04:08.220> power<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.489> i'm<00:04:08.639> not<00:04:08.730> sure<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.090> drops

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
their power so i'm not sure if it drops

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.789 
their power so i'm not sure if it drops
off<00:04:09.540> when<00:04:09.720> you've<00:04:09.810> got<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.989> third<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.560> kills

have<00:05:28.470> been<00:05:28.500> in<00:05:28.800> Wrath<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.160> Lich<00:05:29.250> King<00:05:29.669> well

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
have been in Wrath of the Lich King well

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.909 
have been in Wrath of the Lich King well
with<00:05:30.030> defending<00:05:30.510> one<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.289> towns<00:05:31.590> and

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
with defending one of the the towns and

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.490 
with defending one of the the towns and
we<00:05:32.460> had<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:33.000> climb<00:05:33.210> up<00:05:33.419> those<00:05:33.630> guns<00:05:34.020> on<00:05:34.320> the

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
we had to climb up those guns on the

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.100 
we had to climb up those guns on the
towers<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.160> then<00:05:35.789> wipe<00:05:36.030> out<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.600> invaders

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
towers and then wipe out the invaders

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.900 
towers and then wipe out the invaders
down<00:05:37.350> below<00:05:37.680> with<00:05:37.890> a<00:05:37.950> cannon<00:05:38.370> while<00:05:38.640> also

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
down below with a cannon while also

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.140 
down below with a cannon while also
being<00:05:39.300> attacked<00:05:39.690> by<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.950> undead<00:05:41.520> ice<00:05:41.640> dragon

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
being attacked by the undead ice dragon

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.210 
being attacked by the undead ice dragon
two<00:05:42.300> who<00:05:42.630> were<00:05:42.750> blasting<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.860> guns<00:05:44.070> down

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
two who were blasting the the guns down

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.340 
two who were blasting the the guns down
so<00:05:44.610> we<00:05:44.700> had<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.450> get<00:05:45.600> off<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:45.990> then<00:05:46.110> move<00:05:46.320> to

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
so we had to to get off and then move to

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.290 
so we had to to get off and then move to
another<00:05:46.650> cannon<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.789> know<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.120> that

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
another cannon and you know that that

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.029 
another cannon and you know that that
was<00:05:48.330> probably<00:05:48.630> my<00:05:48.870> favorite<00:05:49.380> multi-kill

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
was probably my favorite multi-kill

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.969 
was probably my favorite multi-kill
quest<00:05:50.640> which<00:05:50.910> i'd<00:05:51.090> call<00:05:51.660> it<00:05:51.690> but<00:05:52.380> this<00:05:52.530> one<00:05:52.800> was

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
quest which i'd call it but this one was

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.430 
quest which i'd call it but this one was
relatively<00:05:53.700> satisfying<00:05:54.450> it<00:05:54.630> wasn't<00:05:54.930> terrible

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
relatively satisfying it wasn't terrible

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.620 
relatively satisfying it wasn't terrible
by<00:05:55.800> any<00:05:55.830> stretch<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:57.030> was<00:05:57.150> relatively

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
by any stretch it was relatively

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.090 
by any stretch it was relatively
satisfying<00:05:58.200> especially<00:05:58.590> when<00:05:58.710> he<00:05:58.770> got<00:05:58.889> to<00:05:58.950> a

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
satisfying especially when he got to a

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.940 
satisfying especially when he got to a
group<00:05:59.400> you<00:05:59.639> did<00:05:59.789> feel<00:06:00.000> pretty<00:06:00.270> powerful<00:06:00.950> and

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
group you did feel pretty powerful and

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.469 
group you did feel pretty powerful and
the<00:06:02.039> ones<00:06:02.250> we<00:06:02.430> killed<00:06:02.639> there<00:06:02.880> it's<00:06:03.030> sending<00:06:03.330> us

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
the ones we killed there it's sending us

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.320 
the ones we killed there it's sending us
