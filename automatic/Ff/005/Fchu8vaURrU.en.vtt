with<00:00:03.190> backlight<00:00:03.820> scenes<00:00:04.210> what's<00:00:04.779> happening

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.260 
with backlight scenes what's happening

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.140 
with backlight scenes what's happening
is<00:00:05.380> you<00:00:05.500> have<00:00:05.710> a<00:00:05.980> tremendous<00:00:06.550> amount<00:00:06.670> of<00:00:06.910> light

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.150 
is you have a tremendous amount of light

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.720 
is you have a tremendous amount of light
coming<00:00:07.540> from<00:00:07.660> behind<00:00:07.960> your<00:00:08.320> subject<00:00:08.559> and<00:00:09.070> that

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
coming from behind your subject and that

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.910 
coming from behind your subject and that
causes<00:00:10.059> the<00:00:10.450> camera<00:00:10.869> to<00:00:11.080> darken<00:00:11.619> down<00:00:11.770> the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
causes the camera to darken down the

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.070 
causes the camera to darken down the
image<00:00:12.219> so<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:12.850> subject<00:00:13.389> actually<00:00:13.690> comes<00:00:13.930> out

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
image so the subject actually comes out

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.189 
image so the subject actually comes out
black<00:00:14.530> while<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.459> background<00:00:16.059> light<00:00:16.299> is<00:00:16.510> more

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
black while the background light is more

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.010 
black while the background light is more
properly<00:00:17.529> exposed<00:00:18.480> basically<00:00:19.480> what<00:00:19.720> you<00:00:19.840> can

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
properly exposed basically what you can

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.230 
properly exposed basically what you can
do<00:00:20.170> is<00:00:20.440> a<00:00:20.770> couple<00:00:20.980> things<00:00:21.340> one<00:00:21.640> you<00:00:21.910> can<00:00:22.060> just

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
do is a couple things one you can just

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.750 
do is a couple things one you can just
use<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.690> flash<00:00:22.930> turn<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:23.980> flash<00:00:24.190> on<00:00:24.430> by

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
use the flash turn the flash on by

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.620 
use the flash turn the flash on by
moving<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.330> open<00:00:25.900> flash<00:00:26.140> switch<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
moving the open flash switch and you

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.630 
moving the open flash switch and you
can't<00:00:28.960> use<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.440> auto<00:00:29.650> mode<00:00:30.010> because<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.490> auto

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
can't use the auto mode because the auto

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.970 
can't use the auto mode because the auto
mode<00:00:30.880> forces<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.630> auto<00:00:31.840> flash<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.680> auto

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
mode forces the auto flash and auto

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.470 
mode forces the auto flash and auto
flash<00:00:33.340> is<00:00:33.550> not<00:00:33.700> going<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:33.940> work<00:00:34.149> in<00:00:34.360> this

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
flash is not going to work in this

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.720 
flash is not going to work in this
situation<00:00:34.949> because<00:00:35.949> as<00:00:36.100> I<00:00:36.129> mentioned<00:00:36.249> you

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
situation because as I mentioned you

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.970 
situation because as I mentioned you
have<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:36.969> lot<00:00:37.239> of<00:00:37.269> light<00:00:37.570> coming<00:00:37.600> in<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:38.859> the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
have a lot of light coming in so the

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.529 
have a lot of light coming in so the
camera<00:00:39.280> doesn't<00:00:39.489> realize<00:00:39.909> the<00:00:40.120> flash<00:00:40.359> is

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
camera doesn't realize the flash is

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.380 
camera doesn't realize the flash is
necessary<00:00:41.050> so<00:00:41.800> what<00:00:41.949> you<00:00:42.069> need<00:00:42.219> to<00:00:42.339> do<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.699> turn

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
necessary so what you need to do is turn

program mode will give you the

more than 10 feet away this flash really
won't<00:01:16.210> have<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.570> effect<00:01:16.870> you're<00:01:17.050> looking<00:01:17.350> for

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
won't have the effect you're looking for

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.580 
won't have the effect you're looking for

and then go down to choose one of these
three<00:02:28.569> settings<00:02:29.049> I<00:02:29.349> would<00:02:29.859> go<00:02:29.980> with<00:02:30.010> high<00:02:30.370> in

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
three settings I would go with high in

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.099 
three settings I would go with high in
this<00:02:30.730> situation<00:02:31.060> because<00:02:31.510> you're<00:02:31.810> dealing

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
this situation because you're dealing

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.429 
this situation because you're dealing
with<00:02:32.139> a<00:02:32.319> very<00:02:32.439> very<00:02:33.219> contrasting<00:02:33.819> image<00:02:34.439> what

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
with a very very contrasting image what

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.099 
with a very very contrasting image what
this<00:02:35.590> does<00:02:35.859> is<00:02:36.159> help<00:02:36.670> reduce<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.780> amount<00:02:37.959> of

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
this does is help reduce the amount of

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.770 
this does is help reduce the amount of
contrast<00:02:38.590> by<00:02:39.189> brightening<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.269> Dark

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
contrast by brightening up the Dark

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.649 
contrast by brightening up the Dark
Shadows<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.159> can<00:02:42.310> try<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:42.549> as<00:02:42.849> well<00:02:43.030> this

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
Shadows so you can try this as well this

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.629 
Shadows so you can try this as well this
is<00:02:43.810> something<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.530> add<00:02:45.040> later<00:02:45.370> on

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
is something that you can add later on

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.659 
is something that you can add later on
in<00:02:45.969> a<00:02:46.060> program<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.480> Photoshop<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:48.129> photo
