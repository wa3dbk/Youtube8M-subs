00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.660
 we just came out of a presentation 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.760
 behind closed doors, not the one you see 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.129
 behind me the new bourne blog 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.080
 title from exclusive software for 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.380
 playstation 4 that will come next 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 year on the sony flagship console 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.740
 within this presentation 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.930
 there was miyazaki the chief creative director 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.430
 from from software that showed us a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.140
 little features of the game and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.570
 obviously the first answer was on 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000
 demon's souls blog board is not the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.079
 followed by demon's souls although since 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.950
 our point of view is that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.379
 spiritual 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.449
 change the setting changes everything too 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.210
 the setting is darker than the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.230
 past and the combat system 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.249
 an evolution compared to that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.809
 previous one 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.579
 obviously who played demon's soul 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.420
 only 2 dark soul will be found immediately 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.980
 home 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 but as we have seen, then let's go 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.149
 played more than half an hour from the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.280
 developers there are several things 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.920
 interesting fact porthole board looks like 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.229
 be a kind of evolution over all 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.639
 the plans from all points of view of 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.530
 what was demon's souls instead 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:07.049
 because first of all what is immediately 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.150
 the playstation 4 technical division changes 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.740
 and financing by sony 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.050
 because the game is developed by from 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 software but it is produced by sony have 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.750
 permission to give the game a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.980
 respectable technical department 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.840
 really next gen 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.910
 as they say and this is noted 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.340
 immediately from the visual depth from the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.410
 detail from reflections from all that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 which concerns the game setting 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.400
 the aspiration taken for this title 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.610
 it should be that of the countries 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.690
 of Eastern Europe in the late nineteenth 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.310
 century you see enormous cathedrals 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.820
 ferocious beasts that were a bit like that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.160
 mythology there is all that denotes a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.350
 very very interesting impact that 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.030
 however it immediately catches the eye 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 we see that there has been a work of up 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 improved compared to the past 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 obviously to a net of a framerate 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.160
 which still today is under 30 frames 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 on the second but there is the game exits on 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.310
 next year 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.300
 as for the gameplay the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.980
 titolo sees this protagonist 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.780
 it seems to be much stronger 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.830
 self- confident with respect to those of demon 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.240
 souls 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.090
 at this point it happens that the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.490
 protagonist with two weapons available 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.410
 a sort of extensible ax that yes 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.170
 then evolves based on the combat 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.460
 can extend to change shape according to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.630
 type of attack 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.030
 and while on the left hand we have 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.070
 caught sight of this sort of gun that shoots 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.710
 even flaming balls so that 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.150
 adds in degree of diversity than 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.950
 to the past 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.390
 and in fact during the fights that 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.580
 some are similar to those of the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.260
 previous work from software yes 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.870
 want you see how you can set up 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.900
 a sort of combo and therefore maybe a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.490
 skewering the opponent with the ax and then 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.500
 shoot him a direct shot to make him 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.550
 a combo to kill him in a manner 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.300
 ultimately 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.590
 what they told us 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.960
 developers during this 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.730
 presentation that the gameplay the 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.780
 fighting will be more dynamic 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.920
 compared to the past 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.660
 the protagonist is fearful and passive 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.230
 always using maybe the shield and the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.690
 sword 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.880
 to avoid or contract attacks 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.010
 enemies and then unleash the blow in 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.720
 this case the main protagonist is 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.750
 aware of its strength it can 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.120
 attack the enemy to destroy it 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.800
 anticipate it but having said that it will always be 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.410
 very difficult to deal with even every 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.390
 single opponent who is a human 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.700
 from the dubious origins it is however very 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.860
 aggressive maybe even with a rifle or 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.610
 let an animal be a beast 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.930
 anything that will be discussed in front 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.000
 blood bourne remains a very title 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.310
 difficult where the developers want 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.370
 inculcate in the player a sense of 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.080
 fear anger difficulty every enemy can 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.239
 being the one that brings you sends you to 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.430
 creator and therefore of me it remains a game 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.470
 very difficult where maybe turning 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.050
 on the corner there are five enemies like 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.850
 was shown in the demo or a 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.940
 particularly difficult boss that you do to 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.350
 slices with two shots the demo has us 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.020
 allowed to see some level design 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.840
 of the title this setting I repeat 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.120
 much darker than the dark 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.860
 past where it is also in this case 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.019
 you can maybe open some 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.239
 shortcuts as you go on and 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.970
 so avoid turning your opponents but 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.830
 however, tackle them more often 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.050
 we repeat that from the point of view 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.760
 aesthetic but also artistic was 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.870
 did a super job or why anyway 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.890
 we have seen birds for example 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.660
 very well designed 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.600
 the final boss who looked like some kind of 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.720
 werewolf even bigger than one 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.180
 one would expect really aggressive 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.890
 bad that probably will be 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.900
 very difficult to deal with during 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.510
 game and then with all these effects 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.039
 particulates and reflections and so on 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.870
 the aesthetic impact seems to be really 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.180
 exceptional obviously we cannot 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.220
 express yourself on how different it will be 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.430
 respect demon's soul to us if but 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.960
 let us repeat a spiritual following why 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.520
 the feeling is that but the developers 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.440
 have kept us underlined several times 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.630
 that all we will see in the game 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.430
 will be of a higher level because 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.410
 the hardware is better because the budget 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.840
 superior because the experience gained 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.280
 with the other chapters it will allow you to 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.289
 get a title that will have a map 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.360
 larger larger than 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.760
 previous work is a game that will do 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.710
 pleasure that all fans of the 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.479
 series but also to new players who 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.979
 they will be afraid they will find difficulties 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.560
 they will repeat different sections over and over 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.930
 times but they will not find frustration 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.479
 simply great sense of challenge 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.520
 fun fear is satisfaction 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.520
 in having killed the next enemy
