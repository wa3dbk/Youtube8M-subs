making a ski portal cool despite my best
attempts<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.899> making<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.770> interesting<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
attempts at making this interesting to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.010 
attempts at making this interesting to
watch<00:00:38.940> there's<00:00:39.329> still<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:39.780> heavy

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
watch there's still some heavy

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.740 
watch there's still some heavy
mathematics<00:00:40.800> ahead<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:42.210> aware<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
mathematics ahead so be aware of it

there's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.710> through<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> tried

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
there's a lot to go through and I tried

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
there's a lot to go through and I tried
compressing<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.149> down<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.539> best<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.960> could<00:00:46.020> so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
compressing it down at best I could so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.420 
compressing it down at best I could so
let's<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.579> started<00:00:48.590> of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> few<00:00:50.039> comments

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
let's get started of the few comments

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
let's get started of the few comments
that<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> got<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:51.090> how<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.020> view<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.410> Basking

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that I got about how the view in Basking

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.020 
that I got about how the view in Basking
corner<00:00:52.920> might<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.160> been<00:00:53.250> accomplished<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
corner might have been accomplished the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
corner might have been accomplished the
most<00:00:54.510> common<00:00:54.899> idea<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.920> some

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
most common idea was that it was some

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.400 
most common idea was that it was some
form<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.520> ray<00:00:56.820> casting<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.079> works

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
form of ray casting it's not that works

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.799 
form of ray casting it's not that works

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360 
signs of 25 degrees is 0.42 three we'll
round<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.110> off<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> need<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.099> three

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
round that off so you need to take three

23<00:02:18.390> remember<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.080> multiplication

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
23 remember to do the multiplication

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.320 
23 remember to do the multiplication
before<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.129> addition<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:20.849> new<00:02:21.000> x<00:02:21.180> is

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
before the addition and your new x is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.479 
before the addition and your new x is
4.4<00:02:22.049> one<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> same<00:02:22.860> way<00:02:23.010> your<00:02:23.159> new<00:02:23.280> why

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
4.4 one in the same way your new why

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.270 
4.4 one in the same way your new why
would<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.810> 2.36<00:02:24.810> plot<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.709> XY<00:02:25.920> path

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
would be 2.36 plot these on the XY path

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.740 
would be 2.36 plot these on the XY path
and<00:02:26.459> you'll<00:02:26.489> see<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.909> around<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.569> origin

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and you'll see that around the origin

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.990 
and you'll see that around the origin
the<00:02:28.260> point<00:02:28.500> 0<00:02:28.709> 0<00:02:28.799> there's<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.459> 25<00:02:29.970> degree

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the point 0 0 there's a 25 degree

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.390 
the point 0 0 there's a 25 degree
rotation<00:02:30.930> now<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.500> next<00:02:31.680> concept<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
rotation now the next concept is

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.460 
rotation now the next concept is
actually<00:02:32.670> much<00:02:32.790> easier<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.540> linear<00:02:33.989> algebra

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
actually much easier it's linear algebra

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.020 
actually much easier it's linear algebra
and<00:02:34.650> hopefully<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.250> happening<00:02:35.519> zobelle<00:02:35.790> for

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
and hopefully it happening zobelle for

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.119 
and hopefully it happening zobelle for
you<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.299> not<00:02:36.480> maybe<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:36.959> will<00:02:37.140> y<00:02:37.530> equals<00:02:37.980> MX

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
you if not maybe this will y equals MX

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.160 
you if not maybe this will y equals MX
plus<00:02:38.370> B<00:02:38.790> actually<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> needed<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.989> use<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
plus B actually I needed to use a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.569 
plus B actually I needed to use a
different<00:02:40.260> form<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.920> took<00:02:41.040> two<00:02:41.159> points

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
different form that took two points

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.030 
different form that took two points
created<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.269> M<00:02:42.480> between<00:02:42.900> them<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:43.739> used

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
created the M between them and then used

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.770 
created the M between them and then used
again<00:02:44.519> two<00:02:44.760> points<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.180> calculate<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.659> it

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
again two points to calculate it it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.559 
again two points to calculate it it
looks<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.170> y1<00:02:46.470> minus<00:02:47.010> y2<00:02:47.400> equals<00:02:48.000> M

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
looks like this y1 minus y2 equals M

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.410 
looks like this y1 minus y2 equals M
times<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:49.470> quantity<00:02:49.560> X<00:02:49.829> 1<00:02:50.370> minus<00:02:50.549> X<00:02:50.730> 2<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.329> in

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
times the quantity X 1 minus X 2 and in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.520 
times the quantity X 1 minus X 2 and in
order<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.629> make<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.840> work<00:02:52.019> is't<00:02:52.349> have<00:02:52.470> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
order to make this work is't have to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.470 
order to make this work is't have to
book<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.739> y<00:02:52.920> 1<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.220> x<00:02:53.579> 1<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:53.910> one<00:02:54.090> side<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.420> the

y 2 and X to the other side just

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.860 
y 2 and X to the other side just
multiply<00:02:56.819> through<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.269> do<00:02:57.510> some<00:02:57.690> subtraction

multiply through and do some subtraction
addition<00:02:58.500> there<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.129> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.489> side

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
addition there you go so on the one side

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.170 
addition there you go so on the one side
i've<00:02:59.819> got<00:02:59.970> y<00:03:00.180> 1<00:03:00.420> minus<00:03:00.750> MX<00:03:01.440> 1<00:03:01.859> equals<00:03:02.430> y2<00:03:02.640> minus

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.559 
alright i'm not going to mention any
more<00:03:10.950> about<00:03:11.159> that<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:12.000> know<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.359> you'll

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
more about that if you know this you'll

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.180 
more about that if you know this you'll
be<00:03:12.720> able<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:13.049> reproduce<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.739> if<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:13.980> don't

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
be able to reproduce it and if you don't

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.800 
be able to reproduce it and if you don't
you<00:03:14.370> won't<00:03:14.519> but<00:03:14.790> let<00:03:15.180> me<00:03:15.209> show<00:03:15.329> you<00:03:15.359> how<00:03:15.450> i<00:03:15.540> used

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you won't but let me show you how i used

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.289 
you won't but let me show you how i used
it<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.739> i'm<00:03:16.980> making<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.609> map<00:03:17.819> with<00:03:18.150> some

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
it so here i'm making a map with some

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.610 
it so here i'm making a map with some
internal<00:03:18.630> walls<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.079> let's<00:03:19.200> say<00:03:19.319> I've<00:03:19.410> fire<00:03:19.590> a

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
internal walls and let's say I've fire a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.770 
internal walls and let's say I've fire a
portal<00:03:20.010> here<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.459> here<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.359> first<00:03:21.630> step

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
portal here and here so the first step

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.409 
portal here and here so the first step
is<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.169> take<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.530> copy<00:03:22.919> of<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.370> map<00:03:23.669> just<00:03:24.090> as<00:03:24.239> it

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
is to take a copy of this map just as it

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.569 
is to take a copy of this map just as it
is<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:24.870> line<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.380> up<00:03:25.620> with<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.040> blue<00:03:26.250> portal

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
is and line it up with the blue portal

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.150 
is and line it up with the blue portal
where<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.150> yellow<00:03:27.660> portal<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.139> but<00:03:28.709> since<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
where the yellow portal is but since the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.550 
where the yellow portal is but since the
view<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.609> rotated<00:03:30.209> 90<00:03:30.510> degrees<00:03:30.540> or<00:03:31.200> will<00:03:31.440> be

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
view is rotated 90 degrees or will be

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.780 
view is rotated 90 degrees or will be
rotated<00:03:31.919> by<00:03:32.010> degree<00:03:32.220> first<00:03:32.489> thing<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.669> do<00:03:32.760> is

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
rotated by degree first thing to do is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.479 
rotated by degree first thing to do is
rotate<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.419> view<00:03:33.480> 90<00:03:33.989> degrees<00:03:34.290> now<00:03:34.980> okay<00:03:35.430> you

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
rotate the view 90 degrees now okay you

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.490 
rotate the view 90 degrees now okay you
can't<00:03:35.760> see<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> view<00:03:36.299> below<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.720> because<00:03:37.049> well

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
can't see the view below it because well

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.319 
can't see the view below it because well
it's<00:03:37.709> it's<00:03:37.980> over<00:03:38.400> top<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.150> first

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
it's it's over top of it so the first

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.460 
it's it's over top of it so the first
thing<00:03:39.389> you<00:03:39.540> need<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.690> do<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.930> take<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.109> straight

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
thing you need to do is take a straight

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.839 
thing you need to do is take a straight
line<00:03:40.709> that's<00:03:41.069> where<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> linear<00:03:41.549> algebra

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
line that's where the linear algebra

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.390 
line that's where the linear algebra
comes<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.389> cut<00:03:42.959> off<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.319> area<00:03:43.530> below<00:03:44.069> it

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
comes in and cut off the area below it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.580 
comes in and cut off the area below it
in<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.699> case<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.389> that<00:03:45.540> we<00:03:45.629> can<00:03:45.810> see

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
in this case so that we can see

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.050 
in this case so that we can see
everything<00:03:46.980> there<00:03:47.190> well<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.549> works<00:03:47.760> okay

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
everything there well that works okay

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.550 
everything there well that works okay
except<00:03:48.690> now<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:48.900> need<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.139> draw<00:03:49.349> two<00:03:49.410> more

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
except now we need to draw two more

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.930 
except now we need to draw two more
straight<00:03:50.040> lines<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.489> cut<00:03:50.609> off<00:03:50.699> anything

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
straight lines and cut off anything

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.580 
straight lines and cut off anything
that's<00:03:51.180> right<00:03:51.299> over<00:03:51.569> here<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.900> figure<00:03:52.319> out<00:03:52.379> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
that's right over here I figure out the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.809 
that's right over here I figure out the
greater<00:03:52.769> than<00:03:52.949> or<00:03:53.040> less<00:03:53.069> than<00:03:53.220> by<00:03:53.489> looking<00:03:53.760> at

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
greater than or less than by looking at

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.949 
greater than or less than by looking at
where<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.060> portal<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.690> then<00:03:54.840> i<00:03:54.900> create

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
where the portal is and then i create

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.300 
where the portal is and then i create
another<00:03:55.290> straight<00:03:55.590> line<00:03:55.620> through<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.160> player

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
another straight line through the player

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.009 
another straight line through the player
to<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.639> left<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.239> portal<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.629> little<00:03:57.870> bit

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
to the left of the portal a little bit

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.629 
to the left of the portal a little bit
and<00:03:58.199> cut<00:03:58.410> off<00:03:58.500> anything<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.190> left<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.549> it

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
and cut off anything to the left of it

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.670 
and cut off anything to the left of it
easy<00:03:59.940> there's<00:04:00.359> your<00:04:00.569> first<00:04:00.750> view<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.500> same

easy there's your first view it is same

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.990 
easy there's your first view it is same
thing<00:04:01.829> for<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:01.980> other<00:04:02.040> view<00:04:02.370> make<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.609> copy<00:04:02.879> of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
thing for the other view make a copy of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.119 
thing for the other view make a copy of
the<00:04:03.180> entire<00:04:03.449> map<00:04:03.780> rotate<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.560> make<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.799> straight

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
the entire map rotate it make a straight

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.409 
the entire map rotate it make a straight
line<00:04:05.310> through<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.790> portal<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.180> cut<00:04:06.329> off

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
line through the portal and cut off

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.729 
line through the portal and cut off
anything<00:04:06.720> that's<00:04:07.049> on<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.199> players<00:04:07.560> fight

make<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.129> straight<00:04:08.430> line<00:04:08.549> through<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.000> player

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
make a straight line through the player

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.460 
make a straight line through the player
a<00:04:09.239> little<00:04:09.540> bit<00:04:09.660> above<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.840> portal<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.349> cut

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
a little bit above the portal and cut

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.809 
a little bit above the portal and cut
off<00:04:10.590> anything<00:04:10.829> that's<00:04:11.129> of<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.400> because<00:04:11.669> the

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
off anything that's of it because the

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.430 
off anything that's of it because the
portal<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.269> below<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.629> make<00:04:12.900> another<00:04:13.139> straight

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
portal is below it make another straight

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.930 
portal is below it make another straight
line<00:04:13.470> cut<00:04:13.980> off<00:04:14.069> anything<00:04:14.430> that's<00:04:14.579> below<00:04:14.790> it

line cut off anything that's below it

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.089 
line cut off anything that's below it
tada<00:04:15.299> we've<00:04:15.720> got<00:04:15.930> wedges<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.709> method

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
tada we've got wedges and this method
