00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 very built and under how there learned that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.660
 I can buy a house with my mod I can not 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.710
 exactly called mod and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.969
 to buy a house you need to go withers 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.969
 kayla now 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 a lot of these jarl and take from him 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.350
 first mission in general in one video I 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.940
 Sees us well, there were no two missions at once. 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.180
 then it becomes become the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.110
 to us and here in another way somehow very first 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.930
 the mission was to kill this leader of the bandits 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.110
 I Bam or rogue does not remember exactly what 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:11.460
 saying and after that you are allowed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:13.740
 buying a house and to keep the house still 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 can extra things be worth it 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.770
 to put 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 besides after it about building turned out 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 in addition to his equip you can still 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.580
 extra buns don't leave these 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.350
 horse carts further this is all possible 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.710
 will be done only if you are there 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.509
 pushing and you have houscar 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.470
 only with narrow llamas can you buy a cow 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.379
 you can only have a striped horse here 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 you don't have a piece of it you can just house 

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:56.840
 build equip it and everything and bought 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.830
 there was nothing to do with a house 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.009
 performed missions in parallel 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.940
 light massager extra mission 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.009
 than where did the house decide to equip it and 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.260
 learned something like you can put in there 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.080
 here's a horse strip only thanks 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.410
 to this 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.280
 due to the fact that you're on something you have 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.470
 Juzcar but it so happened that I came to 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.140
 the city and here came the vampires so I 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.440
 completed the mission to start they often 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.310
 appear in cities and they killed 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.920
 some people first blacksmith this 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.610
 you hit critical do was not needed 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.170
 but not the year a million man was ruined to carry 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.830
 you were killed when 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.160
 and who are you houses 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.640
 this sofa there are two more people or 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.920
 there is one item and to become us 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:03.010
 need to do need something they help people 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.569
 this is the second mission of these 3 just do not have this 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.540
 Adam could not kill you very much 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.850
 this this 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.519
 the priest needs this help you 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.040
 the book was attributed 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.319
 there is one more in and there was mission 1 this already 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:24.000
 an hour he was also killed there and in general not 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.730
 I turned out to be a tan where I got angry 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.080
 sucks it turned out very much like 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.080
 restart due to the fact that he killed and 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.140
 was still becoming a dance 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.080
 I didn't even have to restart you 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.200
 tell generally remove the save for 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.150
 start and so did obliged began began 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.829
 and yet became what we kept in 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.320
 general advice for those who want to buy a house 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.890
 and to become a tang here all to yourself 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.959
 I advise you to put a sign on the guard 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.459
 dawn and complete the quest 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:07.320
 then loop and porting 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.320
 wither it 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.640
 or just fulfill this mission only 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.120
 then build a house though not everyone has 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.600
 money on the principle of this time only 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.890
 if at the end only complete this mission 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.390
 it's already started let's do a bunch 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.759
 additional missions are already a lot of money 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:31.750
 it was not bought a house 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:35.770
 Bleach is what they really wanted 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.610
 say end if you have any 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.620
 problems with you can not find the answer or 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.030
 find something you need and can find one 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.800
 answer then write me in the comments I 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:55.750
 I will answer I will remove the video how to do it 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.699
 surely have a lot know and and of course 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.889
 there are those who start talking 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:05.740

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:09.630
