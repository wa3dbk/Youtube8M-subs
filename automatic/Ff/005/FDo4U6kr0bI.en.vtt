 the story tells that the kingdom of 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.950
 Asgard is protected by the father of everything 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.080
 or bing but during the winter you should 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.960
 rest a week to replenish their 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.820
 energies on those dates your son thor was 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.220
 responsible for defending the kingdom together 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.860
 other valiant warriors while the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.900
 trolls gods giant enemies and 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.870
 demons seek to take control 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.970
 of asgard because in all his battles 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 demonstrates its immense destructive power 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.790
 fighting against the defenders of asgard 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 ovum 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.250
 volstad sandra and later by 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.890
 who tries to contact his friend but 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.620
 without getting it, let's start with the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.560
 incredible ur hulk that is easily the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.270
 be physical most powerful land your 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.850
 Strength varies depending on what 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.100
 incarnation is treated being the ultra the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.159
 incarnation with the lowest base strength 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.590
 and the wild bruce banner the weakest 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.689
 according to the scales of marvel belongs to 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.689
 the class 100 more in strength is to say 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.909
 can exceed 100 tonnes 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.460
 class 100 plus is the maximum scale in 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.310
 marvel in such a way that to this class 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.100
 belong beings how galactus and thor not 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.899
 there is class 200 or 500 or 1000 or more 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.299
 because this scale means that 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.590
 anyone who exceeds this weight is already 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.990
 incalculable or of unknown limits 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.969
 its strength is directly related to 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.549
 your adrenaline discharge in such a way 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.490
 that the more furious or depressed 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.920
 find stronger is the strength based 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.079
 of is not known either because although 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 belongs to class 100 plus some 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.060
 incarnations are considered between 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.829
 class 100 before the creation of the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.859
 class 100 more for better 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.780
 classification and even less but just 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.729
 almost all of them are of character 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.549
 unlimited does not mean that this 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.470
 signal base weight over the years 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.829
 ulc has performed in its various 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.519
 battles feats of supreme strength do not 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:14.290
 they know the limits of the force of erc 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.480
 apparently its strength is unlimited such 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.030
 as the comic has established for years 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.010
 his different feats and feats of 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.019
 power have given us the samples of 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.780
 highest level of strength and power in 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.209
 everyone of the graphic cartoon 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.510
 now let's know something about the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.540
 mighty thor the mighty thor is one of 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.530
 the most powerful beings in the universe 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.580
 physically it is on par with the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.470
 Hercules 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.470
 the gladiator or any other character 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.569
 class 100 over marvel maybe it's the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 strongest marvel character with the only 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.730
 possible exception of hulk at least up 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.950
 certain point to be son of odín and of 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.780
 Jorge to the mother earth 'actor is much 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.080
 stronger and more powerful than others 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.090
 Asgard already gives us the range of physical strength 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.340
 of thor is in class 100 plus is 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.920
 say to exceed 100 tons of 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.290
 weight but this is not a limit force 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.330
 nor base in marvel this class 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.970
 means that the character here is from 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.120
 unknown or incalculable limits by 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.850
 that reason does not exist class 200 or 500 or 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.830
 1,000 or more throughout its existence 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.110
 Tora has shown in his fighting 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.319
 fighting feats and feats of strength and 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.420
 incredible power thor has raised in 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.220
 weight to hornung and my snake 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.380
 home whose weight is according to marvel 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.410
 incalculable and according to mythology its 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.450
 weight is equal to the weight of the planet earth 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.730
 the incredible strength of this mystic 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.250
 snake was crushing the world 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.080
 whole and causing natural disasters 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.600
 all over the world had it not been 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.690
 stopped by thor would have destroyed everything 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.880
 the planet the incalculable force of 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.680
 thor and his iron will achieved 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.140
 reverse the rotation of the world engine 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.660
 thus preventing the machine from causing 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.030
 ragnarok and destroy the world the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.830
 unimaginable power of the world engine 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.830
 I was fed by and brásil
