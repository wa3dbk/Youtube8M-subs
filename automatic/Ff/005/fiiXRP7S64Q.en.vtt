batteries and it does come with two

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.910 
batteries and it does come with two
triple<00:00:56.860> A<00:00:56.920> batteries<00:00:58.320> drop<00:00:59.320> those<00:00:59.530> in<00:00:59.740> real

triple A batteries drop those in real

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.700 
triple A batteries drop those in real
quick<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:01.000> was<00:01:01.120> pretty<00:01:01.390> simple<00:01:01.630> package<00:01:02.560> you

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710

video<00:01:06.010> cable<00:01:06.220> with<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:09.729> sorry<00:01:10.000> this<00:01:10.150> is<00:01:10.300> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
video cable with the I'm sorry this is a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860 
video cable with the I'm sorry this is a
composite<00:01:11.350> video<00:01:11.470> cable<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.729> it's<00:01:13.630> kind<00:01:13.810> of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
composite video cable so it's kind of

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.930 
composite video cable so it's kind of
the<00:01:13.960> bottom<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.410> line<00:01:14.620> so<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.430> have<00:01:15.729> your

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
the bottom of the line so you have your

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.420 
the bottom of the line so you have your
left<00:01:16.660> and<00:01:16.870> right<00:01:17.020> audio<00:01:17.290> right<00:01:18.010> there<00:01:18.310> and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
left and right audio right there and

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.340 
left and right audio right there and
then<00:01:18.610> your<00:01:18.760> video<00:01:19.060> so<00:01:19.150> that's<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.780> composite

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
then your video so that's the composite

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.830 
then your video so that's the composite
signal<00:01:20.590> which<00:01:21.520> plugs<00:01:21.820> into<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.119> lot<00:01:22.330> of<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.509> TV

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
signal which plugs into a lot of the TV

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.230 
signal which plugs into a lot of the TV
sets<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.530> know<00:01:23.619> general<00:01:24.009> TV<00:01:24.280> sets<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.729> then

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
sets you know general TV sets and then

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.580 
sets you know general TV sets and then
you<00:01:25.300> just<00:01:25.450> plug<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.750> cable<00:01:26.080> into<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.350> back

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
you just plug the cable into the back

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.290 
you just plug the cable into the back
right<00:01:26.890> there<00:01:27.160> now

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
right there now

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.540 
right there now
optionally<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.050> can<00:01:29.320> purchase<00:01:29.530> an<00:01:29.860> HDMI

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
optionally you can purchase an HDMI

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.310 
optionally you can purchase an HDMI
cable<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.509> I<00:01:31.570> think<00:01:31.810> there<00:01:31.930> are<00:01:31.960> like<00:01:32.050> nine

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
cable and I think there are like nine

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.620 
cable and I think there are like nine
dollars<00:01:32.560> through<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.250> roku<00:01:34.150> website<00:01:34.600> I

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
dollars through the roku website I

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.030 
dollars through the roku website I
actually<00:01:34.810> had<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.200> ton<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.500> these<00:01:35.740> laying

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
actually had a ton of these laying

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040 
actually had a ton of these laying
around<00:01:36.190> so<00:01:37.060> that's<00:01:37.240> what<00:01:37.420> I'm<00:01:37.509> gonna<00:01:37.630> hook<00:01:37.869> up

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
around so that's what I'm gonna hook up

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.050 
around so that's what I'm gonna hook up
mine<00:01:38.320> with<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.740> going<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.950> be<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.310> HDMI<00:01:40.030> cable

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
mine with is going to be the HDMI cable

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.930 
mine with is going to be the HDMI cable
so<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:42.430> Roku<00:01:43.420> 2<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.350> lot<00:01:44.680> smaller<00:01:45.070> than<00:01:45.759> the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
so the Roku 2 is a lot smaller than the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.490 
so the Roku 2 is a lot smaller than the
original<00:01:46.030> Roku<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.780> original<00:01:47.200> rope<00:01:47.320> is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
original Roku the original rope is

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.260 
original Roku the original rope is
probably<00:01:47.800> about<00:01:47.920> like<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.430> much<00:01:48.670> bigger<00:01:48.970> as

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
probably about like that much bigger as

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.270 
probably about like that much bigger as
you<00:01:49.570> can<00:01:49.720> see<00:01:49.930> right<00:01:50.080> there<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.649> know<00:01:51.100> like

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
you can see right there you know like

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.580 
you can see right there you know like
probably<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.210> size<00:01:52.509> so<00:01:53.259> this<00:01:53.410> is<00:01:53.560> a

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
probably about that size so this is a

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.800 
probably about that size so this is a
much<00:01:53.800> smaller<00:01:54.039> unit<00:01:54.580> on<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:55.179> secondary

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
much smaller unit on the secondary

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.460 
much smaller unit on the secondary
version<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.679> it's<00:01:56.950> pretty<00:01:57.160> simple<00:01:57.550> power

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
version and it's pretty simple power

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.130 
version and it's pretty simple power

cable<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:03.009> then<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.250> HDMI<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.149> think<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.780> can

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
cable and then the HDMI I think you can

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.960 
cable and then the HDMI I think you can
buy<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> component<00:02:05.800> cable<00:02:06.190> for<00:02:06.459> this<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.850> has

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
buy a component cable for this that has

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.620 
buy a component cable for this that has
the<00:02:07.270> RGB<00:02:07.750> color<00:02:08.140> separation<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.509> be

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
first time I hook it up it usually tends

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.659 
first time I hook it up it usually tends
to<00:06:45.630> take<00:06:45.840> a<00:06:45.900> few<00:06:46.470> you<00:06:46.710> know<00:06:46.800> I<00:06:46.830> can<00:06:47.039> edit<00:06:47.250> or<00:06:47.490> two

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
to take a few you know I can edit or two

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.909 
to take a few you know I can edit or two
for<00:06:48.000> it<00:06:48.060> to<00:06:48.150> queue<00:06:48.360> up<00:06:48.479> but<00:06:48.720> once<00:06:49.380> it's<00:06:49.620> warmed

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
for it to queue up but once it's warmed

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.650 
for it to queue up but once it's warmed
up<00:06:50.070> and<00:06:50.220> ready<00:06:50.280> to<00:06:50.490> go<00:06:50.700> it<00:06:50.880> kicks<00:06:51.150> in<00:06:51.360> pretty

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
up and ready to go it kicks in pretty

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.719 
up and ready to go it kicks in pretty
quickly<00:06:51.930> so<00:06:52.320> of<00:06:52.919> course<00:06:53.070> my<00:06:53.280> wireless<00:06:53.520> network

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
quickly so of course my wireless network

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.330 
quickly so of course my wireless network
the<00:06:54.300> router<00:06:54.570> is<00:06:54.960> still<00:06:55.200> in<00:06:55.350> the<00:06:55.440> same<00:06:55.650> room<00:06:55.919> so

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
the router is still in the same room so

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.370 
the router is still in the same room so
and<00:06:56.910> you'll<00:06:57.030> notice<00:06:57.300> it's<00:06:57.510> a<00:06:57.600> little<00:06:57.840> fuzzy<00:06:58.110> at

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
and you'll notice it's a little fuzzy at

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.400 
and you'll notice it's a little fuzzy at
first<00:06:58.760> but<00:06:59.760> then<00:06:59.940> after<00:07:00.240> a<00:07:00.270> few<00:07:00.330> seconds<00:07:01.080> it

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
first but then after a few seconds it

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.279 
first but then after a few seconds it
kicks<00:07:02.310> in<00:07:02.550> and<00:07:02.700> it<00:07:02.820> clears<00:07:03.150> up<00:07:03.270> really<00:07:04.050> nicely

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
kicks in and it clears up really nicely

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.310 
kicks in and it clears up really nicely
so<00:07:05.000> like<00:07:06.000> the<00:07:06.150> first<00:07:06.360> few<00:07:06.570> seconds<00:07:07.050> of<00:07:07.169> the

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
so like the first few seconds of the

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.409 
so like the first few seconds of the
video<00:07:07.440> it's<00:07:07.919> gonna<00:07:08.100> be<00:07:08.310> kind<00:07:08.640> of<00:07:08.729> fuzzy<00:07:08.970> there

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419
