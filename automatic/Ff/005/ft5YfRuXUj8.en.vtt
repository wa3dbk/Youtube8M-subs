now it's only a quick video I'm not sure
with<00:01:20.460> channel<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.000> awful<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.549> be

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
with channel this is awful it should be

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.999 
with channel this is awful it should be
online<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.600> mod<00:01:24.720> spotlight<00:01:24.930> book<00:01:25.380> I'm

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
online all the mod spotlight book I'm

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.200 
online all the mod spotlight book I'm
going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> quickly<00:01:26.369> show<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> how<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> make

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
going to quickly show you how to make

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.980 
going to quickly show you how to make
these<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:28.430> these<00:01:29.450> materials<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> make<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
these are these materials to make it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
these are these materials to make it
with<00:01:31.220> now<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.790> quickly<00:01:33.240> check<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:35.130> eat<00:01:35.670> an

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
with now we quickly check so you eat an

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.840 
with now we quickly check so you eat an
egg<00:01:36.210> knots<00:01:38.030> redstone<00:01:39.200> torches<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.860> diagonal

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
egg knots redstone torches up diagonal

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
egg knots redstone torches up diagonal
so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> first<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.229> will<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.439> like

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so I think the first one will be like

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.340 
so I think the first one will be like
ladders<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.450> put<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> together<00:01:45.930> like

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
ladders so you know put it together like

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
ladders so you know put it together like
that<00:01:46.430> may<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> you've<00:01:47.729> got<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.119> teleporter

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that may I you've got the teleporter

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.950 
that may I you've got the teleporter
base<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.960> quickly

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
base and then this I think it's quickly

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
base and then this I think it's quickly
check<00:01:55.170> want<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.070> guys<00:01:56.250> but

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
check want to get up so so you guys but

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
check want to get up so so you guys but
I've<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:56.850> got<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.719> good<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.140> memory<00:01:58.350> so

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I've not got that good of a memory so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.270 
I've not got that good of a memory so
you<00:01:59.100> pick<00:01:59.460> place<00:01:59.790> there

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
you pick place there

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.480 
you pick place there
that<00:02:02.240> sounds<00:02:02.720> like<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.770> redstone

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
that sounds like so them redstone

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.080 
that sounds like so them redstone
torches<00:02:05.320> well<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.350> thought<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:06.860> are<00:02:07.030> okay<00:02:08.030> so

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
torches well I thought we are okay so

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.820 
torches well I thought we are okay so
you'll<00:02:08.450> need<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.660> make<00:02:08.780> two<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.140> these<00:02:09.289> two<00:02:09.740> of

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
you'll need to make two of these two of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.059 
you'll need to make two of these two of
each<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:11.360> when<00:02:11.870> you've<00:02:11.990> got<00:02:12.140> these<00:02:12.319> two<00:02:12.530> parts

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
each now when you've got these two parts

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.699 
each now when you've got these two parts
I<00:02:13.250> believe<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.300> place<00:02:14.870> them<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.500> top<00:02:15.530> of

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
I believe you just place them on top of

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.680 
I believe you just place them on top of
each<00:02:15.920> other<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.400> don't<00:02:16.970> know<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.240> depends<00:02:17.569> on

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
each other I don't know if it depends on

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.620 
each other I don't know if it depends on
certain<00:02:18.410> order<00:02:18.830> haydel<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.670> you'll<00:02:20.239> want<00:02:20.270> a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
certain order haydel so you'll want a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.620 
certain order haydel so you'll want a
propeller<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.920> top<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.819> you'll<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
propeller on top then you'll get the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.340 
propeller on top then you'll get the
little<00:02:25.300> teleporter<00:02:27.700> toolkit<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.750> again

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
little teleporter toolkit then again

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.190 
little teleporter toolkit then again
you'll<00:02:30.620> need<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.860> make<00:02:31.010> your<00:02:31.130> over<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.150> we<00:02:33.050> have

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
you'll need to make your over so we have

you'll need to make your over so we have
that<00:02:33.350> like<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.070> then<00:02:34.100> with<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.209> you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
that like so and then with this you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.280 
that like so and then with this you
can't<00:02:36.530> place<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:37.220> then<00:02:38.209> right<00:02:38.900> click<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
can't place it on then right click on it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.890 
can't place it on then right click on it
so<00:02:39.800> we'll<00:02:40.010> put<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:40.400> frequency<00:02:41.000> 8<00:02:41.269> here

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
so we'll put it on like frequency 8 here

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.120 
so we'll put it on like frequency 8 here
put<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:42.200> eight<00:02:42.610> then<00:02:44.980> place<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:48.130> so

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
put up eight then place this one so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.920 
put up eight then place this one so
place<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.060> when<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.750> right<00:02:50.900> click
