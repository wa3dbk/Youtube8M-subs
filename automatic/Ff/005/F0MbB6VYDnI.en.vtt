00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.420
 Hi everyone, welcome to the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.689
 by architecting in this video lesson let's 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.689
 speak graphic symbols floor level graphics 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.269
 Just let's talk a little about 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.660
 graphic symbols in the drawing 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.420
 architectural 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 still talking about graphic symbols in the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.519
 architectural drawing 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.970
 we will observe that everything that 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.269
 is above the cut line 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.239
 there the representation of the tip more goes 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.000
 appear in a dashed way as is the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 case of a water reservoir such as the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 case of a zenith opening for 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 elimination of mutilation, as in the case of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.180
 the top of the staircase where you are 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:23.600
 above the pot line and finally 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:28.700
 eaves projections of lages platibandas 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.760
 another graphic symbol is is the lighting 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.730
 of environments all the environment 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.620
 internally they should receive a man and the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:44.270
 indication and square footage of the 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.830
 environment where details may appear 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.680
 Floor finish indication of 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.909
 lining relatives or else I'm here 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 appearing has with a legend as 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.890
 in this case a finishing legend in 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.430
 that we have types of floor used in the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.519
 design types of wall type ceiling and 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.819
 necessary observations and here each 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:15.870
 environment of architectural design 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.300
 we are now observing the representation 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.520
 the graphic symbol 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.570
 the level, ie the height of the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.140
 the external environment then observed 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:35.070
 in this example that this environment is in the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.330
 level 10 30 positive 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:46.220
 Of course he's 30 taller in 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:50.480
 relation to the zero point to the zero point 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.580
 we call it level 1 reference 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.660
 this is the correct way to 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.120
 represented in plan and this is the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.780
 the correct way of representing the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.080
 cut level 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:12.390
 floors must be represented by 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:16.050
 clear way and only the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:22.530
 taken as wet or the bathroom 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:26.580
 laundry kitchen garage balconies is 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.209
 which will then represent a tone with a 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.800
 texture, differentiating 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:39.840
 of the other floors that should appear 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:45.180
 without any texture on the floor plan 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.600
 we represent some more equipment 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.420
 only the fixed equipment of the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.330
 equipment that is not 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.930
 example in the bathroom 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.780
 the laboratory plant should appear 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.310
 this way by this way both 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:12.080
 a workbench showing the toilet 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:19.680
 here in plan the vittorio lavatory and 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:21.810
 shower box and bath in kitchen and 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.580
 service area we'll see 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:31.490
 the sink is inserted into the field 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:36.030
 the reliability and economy of the tank 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:40.200
 only these equipments should be 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:44.960
 appear on a ground floor is technical 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.480
 here we have representation north 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.780
 according to the norms of abnt 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.550
 we have the north is presented 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:00.360
 way but we can customize our 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:06.750
 representation of the magnetic north also 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:10.530
 we have the representation of the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.650
 dimensions can be represented 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:19.250
 externally by calling lines and 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:24.210
 coca cola lines its aa dimension 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.580
 expressed along the quota line or 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.520
 in the vertical direction or in the 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.370
 horizontal 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:39.330
 here we have the radius of the curve 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.100
 origin of this wall is also 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:47.669
 represented in this way 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:53.250
 here we have the quota this window and here 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:57.510
 at the hour quota the door can be raised 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:01.110
 this way in which it comes to the 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:04.480
 width and height or we can 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:11.110
 use a name with the name 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:15.280
 and drill down into a caption at the 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:19.390
 side of the drawing also the windows can 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.800
 This is the way we put it here. 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:28.810
 the width of the window its height and height 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:32.440
 from floor to feitor in and we can also 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:37.180
 use a caption we put a name 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:41.500
 in the window and refer to a legend where 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:45.690
 will be explained its characteristics of 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.690
 dimensions and materials
