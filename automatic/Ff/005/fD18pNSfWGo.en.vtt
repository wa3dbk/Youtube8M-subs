swivel Clips towards the top here as you
just<00:00:45.640> slide<00:00:45.910> them<00:00:46.120> apart<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:48.250> table

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
just slide them apart and the table

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.729 
just slide them apart and the table
section<00:00:48.970> itself<00:00:49.239> that<00:00:49.750> should<00:00:49.930> just<00:00:50.050> pulls

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
section itself that should just pulls

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.010 
section itself that should just pulls
apart<00:00:50.920> into<00:00:51.190> two<00:00:51.280> pieces<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.750> is<00:00:52.870> where<00:00:52.960> you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
apart into two pieces this is where you

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.780 
apart into two pieces this is where you
get<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.200> to<00:00:53.380> separate<00:00:53.770> tables<00:00:54.190> from<00:00:54.370> you'll

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
get you to separate tables from you'll

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.190 
get you to separate tables from you'll
see<00:00:55.000> one<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.149> this<00:00:55.270> side<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:55.750> got<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.079> other

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
see one on this side and got the other

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.319 
see one on this side and got the other
all<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.280> components<00:00:57.700> that<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:57.820> need<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.120> set

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
all the components that you need to set

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.000 
all the components that you need to set
up<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.480> table<00:00:58.840> are<00:00:59.170> stored<00:00:59.500> with<00:00:59.649> inside

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
up the table are stored with inside

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.010 
up the table are stored with inside
we've<00:01:00.520> got<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.730> legs<00:01:00.940> inside<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.540> here<00:01:01.750> which

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
we've got the legs inside of here which

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.540 
we've got the legs inside of here which
are<00:01:02.170> clipped<00:01:02.379> in<00:01:02.590> obviously<00:01:03.190> stop<00:01:03.370> them<00:01:03.489> from

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
are clipped in obviously stop them from

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.189 
are clipped in obviously stop them from
rattling<00:01:03.940> around<00:01:04.000> once<00:01:04.509> you<00:01:04.629> put<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.899> table

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
rattling around once you put the table

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.410 
rattling around once you put the table
together<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.640> let's<00:01:06.759> put<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:06.969> a<00:01:07.030> few<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.329> the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
together so let's put it a few of the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.849 
together so let's put it a few of the
configurations<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.079> we<00:01:08.170> have<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.679> take<00:01:08.799> a

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
configurations that we have and take a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.660 
configurations that we have and take a
closer<00:01:09.039> look<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.959> tables<00:01:11.289> themselves

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
closer look so the tables themselves

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.440 
closer look so the tables themselves
exceptional<00:01:12.670> easy<00:01:12.939> to<00:01:13.119> put<00:01:13.299> together

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
exceptional easy to put together

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.270 
exceptional easy to put together
obviously<00:01:13.899> once<00:01:14.380> we've<00:01:14.619> split<00:01:14.920> them<00:01:15.069> into

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
obviously once we've split them into

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.699 
obviously once we've split them into
their<00:01:15.399> two<00:01:15.579> main<00:01:15.789> compartments<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:17.530> you

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
their two main compartments as you

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.010 
their two main compartments as you
mentioned<00:01:18.039> before<00:01:18.399> all<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.149> legs<00:01:19.359> are<00:01:19.659> stored

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
mentioned before all the legs are stored

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.809 
mentioned before all the legs are stored
underneath<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.889> table<00:01:21.219> all<00:01:21.369> clipped<00:01:21.639> into

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
underneath the table all clipped into

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.260 
underneath the table all clipped into
place<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.240> prevent<00:01:22.359> me<00:01:22.600> from<00:01:22.630> moving<00:01:22.899> around

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
place to prevent me from moving around

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.029 
place to prevent me from moving around
so<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.389> main<00:01:25.539> leg<00:01:25.779> sections<00:01:26.289> are<00:01:26.439> folded<00:01:26.889> down

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
so the main leg sections are folded down

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.029 
so the main leg sections are folded down
here<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:29.020> easy<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.350> put<00:01:29.499> up<00:01:31.590> all<00:01:32.590> made<00:01:32.770> from

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
here really easy to put up all made from

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.679 
here really easy to put up all made from
aluminium<00:01:33.279> as<00:01:33.759> well<00:01:33.939> so<00:01:34.209> nice<00:01:34.389> and

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
aluminium as well so nice and

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.769 
aluminium as well so nice and
lightweight<00:01:34.929> but<00:01:35.170> still<00:01:35.740> very<00:01:36.130> strong<00:01:36.779> all

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779 
lightweight but still very strong all

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.660 
lightweight but still very strong all
the<00:01:38.079> struts<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:38.709> have<00:01:38.859> in<00:01:38.979> here<00:01:39.219> have<00:01:39.520> this

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
the struts we have in here have this

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.089 
the struts we have in here have this
triangle<00:01:40.029> design<00:01:40.539> to<00:01:40.810> them<00:01:40.959> many<00:01:41.499> benefits<00:01:41.920> of

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
triangle design to them many benefits of

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:43.499 
triangle design to them many benefits of
that<00:01:42.279> obviously<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.759> triangulation<00:01:43.299> here

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
that obviously the triangulation here

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.779 
that obviously the triangulation here
gives<00:01:43.990> great<00:01:44.380> stability<00:01:44.920> makes<00:01:45.490> them<00:01:45.639> nice

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
gives great stability makes them nice

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.599 
gives great stability makes them nice
