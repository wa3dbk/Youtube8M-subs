00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 how will my natural being be good 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.670
 next to the announcement of the knot of seven and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.250
 as expected at the beginning in 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 new version of 43 gerin that so much 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 had rumored during the past 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
 months and that in the last weeks 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.539
 where migrations appear to group 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.289
 4.3 although it is a decision 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.730
 less 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.329
 comes with important news and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 improvements in this video I will be giving 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 the most important news of the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.680
 third version of the living so 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.680
 I started murcia 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.539
 good android 4.3 faster smoother and 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.489
 more sensitive now used rather 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.379
 so that andry is something faster for 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.539
 they have optimized the compass flow 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.550
 of drawing organizing and joining 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.680
 drawing operations and the teacher 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.149
 Now you can use multi threads to 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.090
 through its multiple cpu cores 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.950
 to perform certain tasks in addition to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.540
 improve the way representation of 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.310
 text so that for example in the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.140
 circles and rounded rectangles are 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.880
 show with higher quality and shape 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.680
 more efficient buffer improvement 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.539
 images to make it faster and 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.310
 reduce the time in which a 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.409
 application shows a picture they call 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.850
 finally official opinion support is 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.799
 3.0 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.250
 Let's talk about what you just mentioned is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.680
 cent or pencil is 3.0 as we have already 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.990
 seen between 4.3 offers official support 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.580
 of open is 3.0 for those 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.060
 compatible devices for example the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.820
 98 74 and net its 10 the api of opel and the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 3.0 allow developers to create 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.390
 complex and very efficient graphics with 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.009
 state- of-the-art visual effects and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.659
 high quality textures compression 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.509
 etc 2 already 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.979
 the bluetooh is mark and andrew 4 minute 3 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.569
 de vivienne also supports the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.850
 smart bluetooth technology so that 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.859
 applications can easily easily 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.200
 detect nearby sites query from 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.490
 at &amp; t services and communicate with 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.470
 children intelligently the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.580
 devices and accessories and with u2 smart 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.230
 may for example in the great 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.610
 notifications from another device 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.200
 in addition also give a bluetooth support 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.849
 11.3 rcp bird to support interactions 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.730
 richest definitive transmission of 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.489
 remote media as players of 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.310
 music the unlimited profiles in the 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.900
 antiquated multi-user support 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.790
 eliminates worlds added support to the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.099
 multiple users on tablets and now 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.720
 public 2003 inhibit improvements that support 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.700
 adding to the possibility of limiting 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.590
 profiles in the parental control style 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.849
 the administrator can say if a 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.670
 profile can download because it is given 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.590
 wyplay if you can make purchases and play 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.220
 to video games or access certain 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.560
 optimization applications of the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.840
 location as we saw a week ago 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.849
 of 4.3 and the good will allow the user 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.810
 leave active wifi to read the 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.660
 geolocation 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.640
 although we disable the wifi connection 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.590
 of progression wifi is optional and the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.360
 user can deactivate it from the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.520
 adjustments but it is very practical that 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.440
 we want to get one more location 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.150
 accurate 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.520
 than that of telephone networks but not 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.710
 we want that if we connect to any of 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.810
 wifi have also added support for the 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.400
 hardware and offensive for the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.500
 devices with let's 4 materials and 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.150
 917 for example optimizes the efficiency 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.280
 of location energy by 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.080
 performing calculations in our 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.380
 location by hardware and not by 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.020
 software 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.730
 notifications from android 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.170
 4.3 and well applications can 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.850
 access and manage without problems all 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.850
 our notifications without having to 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.620
 recur accessibility options but 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.180
 besides that we have a small 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.010
 history of latest notifications that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.810
 you access it by creating in our 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.880
 desktop an access to settings the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.530
 section widgets and select the 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.090
 notifications in this history 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.640
 we can see what applications some 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.560
 publications and allows us to access the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.970
 information of the application that generated 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.440
 every notification to be able to deactivate 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.790
 your notifications dialing with 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.110
 autocomplete have added in the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.670
 call application the option of 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.620
 autocomplete when we are checking 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.120
 a phone number this system 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.560
 besides showing the numbers that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.400
 match our agenda too 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.739
 they look for the names with their keyboard t9 the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.150
 camera application of the camera and 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.860
 gallery also after improvements that already 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.930
 we saw in filtered versions the camera 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.940
 has an interface where it shows the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.910
 Circle-shaped arc-shaped options 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.010
 so they do not get stuck with your finger and add 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.320
 the timer option has also 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.090
 improved the quality of the photos first 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.590
 in the gallery they have added the new ones and 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.970
 best filters frames 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.100
 options to edit our photos 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.470
 we can adjust the position the contrast 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.450
 saturation density and sharpness curves 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.000
 color in a simple way also like 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.240
 that in the stand speed we can adjust 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.490
 the local shape the contrast brightness and 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.530
 saturation applications and enabled 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.700
 from android 4.0 ice cream sanwich 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.050
 we can disable some of the 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.210
 applications that are installed in 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.820
 series on our devices now with 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.350
 andy 4.3 we can easily see thanks 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.330
 to the new tabs of the settings of 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.960
 applications in the list of 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.750
 applications and enabled options 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.640
 of development forgiveness in this new 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.130
 version have added new options 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.950
 development development now we can 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.390
 revoke access to usb debugging 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.100
 all the computers that we have 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.290
 authorized and have added new options 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.650
 profile rendering of gpu in 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.740
 screen with barriers or lines and in the 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.780
 hidden permission manager chat 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.100
 a few days ago it was discovered that andy 4.3 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.870
 and the living hides a mixed 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.920
 services when we can activate some 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.300
 of the permissions of the applications 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.070
 although to use it we have to install 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.690
 This time of application permission 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.800
 manager surely this manager 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.220
 permits 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.050
 in the next version of android 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.000
 let's talk now about your 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.770
 internationalization and localization 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.800
 add support for languages 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.870
 Africans Amharic Idu and his look and 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.270
 improved the support of the systems rtl 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.400
 from right to left as Hebrew 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.349
 Arabic to support the screen of 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.409
 start the configuration applications of the 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.699
 phone contacts and google that your 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.699
 security system 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.169
 android 4.3 faster more fluid and more 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.610
 sensitive accusation of thanks to the 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.229
 optimization of the combat flow of 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.909
 drawing to the buffer improvement of 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.289
 allocation of views and the use of 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.759
 multiple through the various 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.740
 the system processor cores 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.539
 operative is more secure more protected 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.099
 against the vulnerability I discovered 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.710
 potential because it has reinforced 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.270
 the android sandbox with 6 minutes a 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.099
 system that incorporates a variety of 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.750
 security policies and controls 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.879
 access that they try to prevent a 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.530
 application anxiety part of the system 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.530
 you have that you do not have permission
