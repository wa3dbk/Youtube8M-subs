00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
what everybody says so um there's just

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.629 
what everybody says so um there's just
nothing's<00:05:45.380> really<00:05:45.590> wrong<00:05:45.710> with<00:05:46.039> this<00:05:46.130> more<00:05:46.400> at

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
nothing's really wrong with this more at

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.320 
nothing's really wrong with this more at
all<00:05:46.729> um<00:05:47.680> I'm<00:05:48.680> like<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.400> second<00:05:49.820> owner<00:05:50.090> but<00:05:50.300> I

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
all um I'm like the second owner but I

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.110 
all um I'm like the second owner but I
think<00:05:50.660> and<00:05:51.130> it's<00:05:52.130> just<00:05:52.220> somebody<00:05:52.669> cut<00:05:52.970> that

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
think and it's just somebody cut that

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.620 
think and it's just somebody cut that
piece<00:05:53.360> off<00:05:53.600> right<00:05:53.840> there<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.350> I<00:05:55.449> put<00:05:56.449> the

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
piece off right there and I put the

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.180 
piece off right there and I put the
different<00:05:56.990> tires<00:05:57.199> on<00:05:57.500> there<00:05:57.680> than<00:05:57.800> not<00:05:57.979> as

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
different tires on there than not as

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.040 
different tires on there than not as
aggressive<00:05:58.940> as<00:05:59.060> other<00:05:59.360> ones<00:05:59.539> but<00:05:59.780> they<00:05:59.900> are<00:05:59.930> a

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
aggressive as other ones but they are a

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.050 
aggressive as other ones but they are a
little<00:06:00.289> bit<00:06:00.560> wider<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:01.220> that's<00:06:01.669> the<00:06:01.820> main

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
little bit wider and that's the main

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.250 
little bit wider and that's the main
