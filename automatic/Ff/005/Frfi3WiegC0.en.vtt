00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
pencil drawing initially then we will be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.040 
pencil drawing initially then we will be
actually<00:00:21.050> using<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:21.950> color<00:00:22.160> pencil<00:00:22.640> to<00:00:23.510> give

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050

throw it the coloring part is actually

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.149 
throw it the coloring part is actually
making<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:02.320> more<00:01:03.320> beautiful<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.070> is

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
making it more beautiful so this is

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.529 
making it more beautiful so this is
initially<00:01:04.579> a<00:01:04.610> pencil<00:01:04.969> drawing<00:01:05.149> as<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.390> can

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
initially a pencil drawing as you can

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.300 
initially a pencil drawing as you can
see<00:01:05.719> we<00:01:05.869> have<00:01:06.020> made<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:06.319> in<00:01:06.439> a<00:01:06.530> time-lapse<00:01:07.039> so

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
see we have made it in a time-lapse so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.099 
see we have made it in a time-lapse so
you<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:07.999> download<00:01:08.209> the<00:01:08.479> video<00:01:08.630> or<00:01:08.899> you<00:01:08.959> can

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
you can download the video or you can

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:10.889 
you can download the video or you can
pause<00:01:09.409> it<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.740> learn<00:01:09.979> how<00:01:10.009> it<00:01:10.219> is<00:01:10.429> been<00:01:10.639> done

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
pause it and learn how it is been done

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.230 
pause it and learn how it is been done
so<00:01:11.899> now<00:01:12.319> I<00:01:12.380> can<00:01:12.859> see<00:01:13.039> a<00:01:13.069> boy<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:13.819> girl<00:01:13.850> is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
cloud over there which I am doing and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.109 
cloud over there which I am doing and
now<00:01:28.939> we'll<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:30.459> start<00:01:31.459> coloring<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:31.969> up

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
now we'll just start coloring it up

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.510 
now we'll just start coloring it up
using<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.689> pencil<00:01:33.229> color<00:01:33.590> pencil<00:01:34.219> colors

using the pencil color pencil colors

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.399 
using the pencil color pencil colors
already<00:01:35.529> cute<00:01:36.529> when<00:01:37.219> we<00:01:37.609> applied<00:01:37.939> because

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
already cute when we applied because

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.089 
already cute when we applied because
comparatively<00:01:39.409> it<00:01:39.499> will<00:01:39.619> be<00:01:39.770> having<00:01:39.979> a

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
comparatively it will be having a

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.339 
comparatively it will be having a
lighter<00:01:40.340> shade<00:01:40.459> but<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.270> very<00:01:41.450> much<00:01:41.749> enjoy

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
lighter shade but I very much enjoy

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.679 
lighter shade but I very much enjoy
using<00:01:42.770> pencil<00:01:43.099> colors<00:01:43.340> while<00:01:43.689> drawing

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
using pencil colors while drawing

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.690 
using pencil colors while drawing
because<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:45.349> gives<00:01:45.709> a<00:01:45.829> particular<00:01:45.979> texture

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
because it gives a particular texture

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.029 
because it gives a particular texture
which<00:01:46.909> I<00:01:47.179> love<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.169> most<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.529> can<00:01:48.649> also<00:01:48.799> try

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
which I love the most you can also try

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.339 
which I love the most you can also try
it<00:01:49.099> out<00:01:49.310> maybe<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.729> can<00:01:49.909> also<00:01:50.240> give<00:01:50.869> another

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
it out maybe you can also give another

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.800 
it out maybe you can also give another
color<00:01:51.649> different<00:01:52.579> like<00:01:52.819> crayons<00:01:53.479> or<00:01:53.630> water

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
color different like crayons or water

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.260 
color different like crayons or water
color<00:01:54.079> whatever<00:01:54.799> color<00:01:54.979> types<00:01:55.639> you<00:01:56.090> can

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
color whatever color types you can

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.080 
color whatever color types you can
actually<00:01:56.590> experiment<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.919> see<00:01:58.069> how<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:58.909> troy

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
actually experiment and see how the troy

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.319 
actually experiment and see how the troy
looks<00:01:59.419> like<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.469> you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.369> see<00:02:01.639> we<00:02:01.969> are<00:02:02.029> giving

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
looks like so you can see we are giving

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.019 
looks like so you can see we are giving
different<00:02:02.689> colors<00:02:02.959> for<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.979> Impala<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.639> there

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:05.029 
different colors for the Impala or there

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:10.480 
different colors for the Impala or there
like<00:02:05.450> blue<00:02:06.429> orange<00:02:07.429> green<00:02:08.440> yellow<00:02:09.440> etc<00:02:10.160> so

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
like blue orange green yellow etc so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.580 
like blue orange green yellow etc so
that<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:11.090> will<00:02:11.270> be<00:02:11.450> looking<00:02:11.810> more<00:02:12.050> attractive

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
that it will be looking more attractive

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.860 
that it will be looking more attractive
so<00:02:12.740> it's<00:02:13.010> very<00:02:13.280> simple<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.820> cute

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
so it's very simple and cute
