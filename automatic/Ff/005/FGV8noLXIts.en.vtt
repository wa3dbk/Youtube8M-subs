today's<00:00:13.140> project<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.890> take<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.340> air<00:00:14.580> cleaner

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
today's project is take this air cleaner

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.130 
today's project is take this air cleaner
and<00:00:16.080> make<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.380> a<00:00:16.470> 360<00:00:17.040> clamshell<00:00:17.900> so<00:00:18.900> this

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and make it a 360 clamshell so this

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.430 
and make it a 360 clamshell so this
intake<00:00:20.570> foreign<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> hell<00:00:21.990> ever<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
intake foreign what the hell ever it is

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.650 
intake foreign what the hell ever it is
it's<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.860> to<00:00:22.920> go<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:24.090> we're<00:00:24.360> going<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.510> take

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it's going to go and we're going to take

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.250 
it's going to go and we're going to take
this<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.930> cut<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.689> I<00:00:27.689> hope<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> works

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
this and cut it up and I hope it works

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.820 
this and cut it up and I hope it works
okay<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.210> attentive<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.690> the<00:00:31.590> fact

that all the pressure going to be riding
on<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.780> filter<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.110> don't<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> crush

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
on the filter so we don't want to crush

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.640 
on the filter so we don't want to crush
anything<00:00:41.300> but<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.449> want<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.720> good<00:00:42.960> enough<00:00:43.230> seal

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
anything but we want a good enough seal

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.009 
anything but we want a good enough seal

the<00:00:46.350> filter<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:48.510> project<00:00:48.989> shouldn't<00:00:49.260> take

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
the filter this project shouldn't take

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.000 
the filter this project shouldn't take
long<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:50.030> still<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> hurry<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.769> try<00:00:52.769> to<00:00:52.830> get

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
long I still want to hurry up try to get

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
long I still want to hurry up try to get
it<00:00:53.129> done<00:00:53.250> before<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.699> shows<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.780> may<00:00:54.900> be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it done before that shows up you may be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.630 
it done before that shows up you may be
wondering<00:00:55.290> why<00:00:55.589> we're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.830> to<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> 360

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
wondering why we're going to make a 360

wondering why we're going to make a 360
clam<00:00:56.850> shell<00:00:57.150> out<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.589> well<00:00:58.589> there's<00:00:58.800> two

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
clam shell out of it well there's two

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.310 
clam shell out of it well there's two
tricks<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.460> horsepower<00:00:59.909> one<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.750> cold<00:01:01.080> air

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
tricks to horsepower one is cold air

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.969 
tricks to horsepower one is cold air
makes<00:01:01.979> horsepower<00:01:02.550> oh<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:04.290> gotta<00:01:04.500> drop<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
makes horsepower oh you gotta drop you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
makes horsepower oh you gotta drop you
temperature<00:01:05.370> like<00:01:05.519> 20<00:01:05.820> degrees<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.540> on

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
temperature like 20 degrees to get on

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
temperature like 20 degrees to get on
one<00:01:07.200> percent<00:01:07.620> increase<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.190> some<00:01:08.340> crap<00:01:08.460> like

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
one percent increase or some crap like

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
one percent increase or some crap like
that<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.360> we're<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.500> able

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that so it's we're not going to be able

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.060 
that so it's we're not going to be able
to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> cold<00:01:11.100> air<00:01:11.250> induction<00:01:12.799> but<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
to do a cold air induction but what we

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.260 
to do a cold air induction but what we
can<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.020> give<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> an<00:01:16.229> unrestricted<00:01:17.270> other

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
can do is give it an unrestricted other

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.020 
can do is give it an unrestricted other
than<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> air<00:01:19.020> filter<00:01:19.880> unrestricted<00:01:20.880> air

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
than the air filter unrestricted air

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.990 
than the air filter unrestricted air
flow<00:01:21.270> let's<00:01:22.110> did<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.770> portal<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> size

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
flow let's did have one portal the size

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
flow let's did have one portal the size
of<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.240> fist<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> air<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.469> to<00:01:25.530> be

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
of your fist that the air is going to be

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.349 
of your fist that the air is going to be
able<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.969> to<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.119> able<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
able to go in it's going to be able to

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.380 
able to go in it's going to be able to
suck<00:01:27.539> air<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.200> around<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.859> element

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
suck air all the way around the element

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.410 
suck air all the way around the element
so<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.719> air<00:01:30.930> makes<00:01:31.530> horsepower<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:33.210> going

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so more air makes horsepower it's going

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.789 
so more air makes horsepower it's going
to<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.570> hot<00:01:33.780> air<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.469> coming<00:01:34.710> out

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to be hot air because it's coming out

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.109 
to be hot air because it's coming out
from<00:01:34.950> underneath<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> hood<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.969> still

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
from underneath the hood but it's still

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:54.990 
from underneath the hood but it's still
going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.719> air

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.660 

here's<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.120> bottom<00:01:56.450> half<00:01:56.660> hacked<00:01:57.110> up<00:01:57.670> there's

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
here's the bottom half hacked up there's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.540 
here's the bottom half hacked up there's
the<00:01:58.880> rim<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.500> I'm<00:02:00.500> pretty<00:02:00.740> happy<00:02:00.890> with<00:02:01.010> that<00:02:01.190> I

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
the rim and I'm pretty happy with that I

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.770 
the rim and I'm pretty happy with that I
cut<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.510> larger<00:02:02.960> than<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:03.860> needs<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.160> be<00:02:04.420> on<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
cut it larger than it needs to be on the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.440 
cut it larger than it needs to be on the
positive<00:02:06.260> side<00:02:06.290> of<00:02:06.470> air<00:02:07.090> don't<00:02:08.090> still<00:02:08.300> work

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
positive side of air don't still work

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.480 
positive side of air don't still work
the<00:02:08.600> same<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.880> really<00:02:11.180> don't<00:02:11.300> care<00:02:12.430> now<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the same and I really don't care now to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.070 
the same and I really don't care now to
knock<00:02:13.760> down<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.150> sharp<00:02:14.390> edge<00:02:14.600> isn't<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:15.020> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
knock down the sharp edge isn't going to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.250 
knock down the sharp edge isn't going to
come<00:02:15.200> back<00:02:15.320> with<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.620> grinding<00:02:15.980> wheel<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
come back with the grinding wheel and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:35.040 
come back with the grinding wheel and
grind<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:31.360> there's<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.480> parts<00:02:32.870> removed<00:02:33.580> and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
grind it there's a parts removed and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.590 
grind it there's a parts removed and
there's<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.170> resulting<00:02:37.390> clamshell<00:02:38.390> air

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
there's a resulting clamshell air

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.870 
there's a resulting clamshell air
cleaner<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.880> couldn't<00:02:41.180> buy<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:43.250> won't<00:02:43.790> hit

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
cleaner but you couldn't buy I won't hit

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.430 
cleaner but you couldn't buy I won't hit
it<00:02:44.030> with<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.180> grinder<00:02:45.430> smooth<00:02:46.430> up<00:02:46.610> there<00:02:46.790> just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
it with the grinder smooth up there just

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.520 
it with the grinder smooth up there just
I'll<00:02:48.440> hang<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:49.100> pieces<00:02:49.400> because<00:02:50.530> if
