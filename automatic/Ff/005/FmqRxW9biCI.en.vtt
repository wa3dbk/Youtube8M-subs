00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.019
 two 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.019
 Hello 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.699
 yes 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.079
 according to your screens and new things 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.239
 and nothing less that I have the pleasure of 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.460
 share as a 2 something awesome and 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.809
 epic that you will see below and that you 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.239
 I will teach to do it 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.220
 I want good and I want to start saying 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.900
 is that I use it to troll everything 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.510
 fishing time not so much my friends or 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.489
 online is a bus that is very very 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.379
 very funny and that surely when I 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.269
 You see, do not believe it, because if 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.860
 we compare with other bugs is atypical and 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.080
 it's really not going to affect when 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.000
 win neither coins nor anything those files 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.350
 so do not try to pigeonhole in the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.940
 I'm going to give you an idea and 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.619
 now you are seeing now 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.539
 is here on your screens that 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.460
 You see the cassette with with 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.550
 the equipment of the portage that means 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.990
 that's good, I'm seeing that really 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.429
 we can do it in different ways what 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.500
 you can put the house between the goal and 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.030
 You can go out with him until you get close to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.950
 area but it would be quite dangerous already 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.690
 that is surely leaving the goal 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.250
 free would pull us from either side 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.070
 if he retrieves the ball and marks us I'll 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.020
 children I will teach you a way better 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.000
 they teach me a way how to do that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.739
 our favorite forward has the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.700
 equipment of the goalkeeper during all 

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:41.740
 party and not 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.960
 ultimate in but in any way 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.610
 fifa game what if kids before 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.049
 to speak to you about how to do the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.000
 trick I have to tell you that I have not 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.619
 invented I have not discovered this bug 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.670
 but they have discovered a friend of mine 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.590
 that you are already watching our screens 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.820
 a link that will take your channel and if not 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.960
 you will also get the description and the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.670
 end of the video if you want to give it a 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.590
 little bit to go through his channel I 've 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.299
 done and really has squat wheeler 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.159
 has compilation and also has 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.960
 variety of other types of games what 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.460
 totally recommended so go through 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.200
 there give him affection because thanks to him 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.220
 we can do this kind of thing and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.929
 after having said all this 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.610
 come to the moment to show you how 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.530
 put the equipment to your player 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.580
 preferred the goalie kit in 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.470
 last and it has very easy since 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.290
 changing the position to sending by that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.780
 player is the one that is valuable used 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.819
 medium water and then always and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.099
 super necessary requirements and you'll see 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.200
 so then have a goalkeeper 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.459
 on the bench it's super necessary so 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.590
 what court on the player bench 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.420
 favorite of goalkeeper and goalkeeper 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.890
 position of our player I will 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.819
 teach the team this continuation already 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.950
 which is the rival that I'm going to face 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.280
 since for you to see that it is the ultimate 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.930
 team and essential and know if we have 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.980
 luck we get from the middle of the field 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.480
 Do not enter 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.580
 and nothing else start 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.200
 try to steal the ball as fast 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.209
 possible since I do call me goal 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.950
 it should not be very good or just at 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.930
 steal give it to be so once 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.610
 let's get that we just go to the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.739
 template where you will see already bojan has the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.330
 goalkeeper kit like changing it 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.739
 by sending it is not going to be impossible anymore 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.900
 what numbers does not allow us that so 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.090
 there we are going to need since it enters 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.260
 game the substitute goalkeeper has changed 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.480
 by the substitute goalkeeper as it is a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.829
 original goalkeeper do not hear in this case 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.360
 Well yes it will let us change it for 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.040
 Humility must rise to the bench 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.420
 we are going to change it by mandrin and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.519
 sending her who was our goalkeeper 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.930
 owner we will change it by roger what 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.060
 will do that in the field that changes the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.739
 exhibition both to bojan by sending 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.269
 be that guam she will not go to 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.650
 center forward with the kit of 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.150
 goalkeeper and sending to measure with the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.959
 player kit is going to go to the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.430
 goal 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.040
 next you will see the change since 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.660
 that is immediately the only thing that yes that 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.910
 I have to say you see water go 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.489
 recovering the position with gestures of 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.290
 goalkeeper and with his equipment of Spain in 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.060
 this case and what I have to say is that 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.769
 yes you will see that it is already costing 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.750
 errand and stand back yes it is 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.819
 true I what to say from now that a 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.770
 once sending to the achievement and there was 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.390
 goalkeeper in particular I managed 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.610
 the goal you will see that has as a 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.960
 kind of delay in it you'll see no 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.850
 does no function of goalkeepers but 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.920
 that you put the ico line you will see is super 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 static there they pull us from any 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.220
 side and we could score the goal that 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.960
 you need for him to send his 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.000
 goalkeeper functions nothing very simple and 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.470
 all matter from outside and that goalkeeper will 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.970
 will restart good that player will 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.890
 will restart and the gestures will have 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.390
 etcetera etcetera stops of a goalkeeper 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.280
 normal and current as you will see 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.200
 then there he threw it out and now 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.060
 your goalkeeper will already put good by sending 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.770
 see the position of goalkeeper and so on 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.270
 etcetera it is very important that you do it 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.220
 always or ever change the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.560
 positions do that always mandatory 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.030
 so that sending to wall so nothing and 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.680
 you are already seeing a mile from 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.450
 center forward with the kit of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.130
 doorman and has already been of his own seems 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.900
 that even goes more bumpy and you'll see 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.490
 the first play touches her 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.560
 another euro running like him xavi 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.900
 giving us the happiness that always gives us 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.580
 and already the first one who hits a goal with 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.740
 uncle's goalie will be freaking out and what 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.450
 Pussy is this is hacker or I do not know what the fuck 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.340
 will be thinking about the time and be 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.140
 watching medium water celebrating the how 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.640
 always talk but this time with the 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.100
 goalkeeper kit and it will last you 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.300
 during the whole game you do not know 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.090
 now that they are sticking to 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.940
 my friends these days with this one 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.100
 and the truth is that I laugh a lot 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.770
 since many times they thought I had 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.830
 player touched the entire event 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.930
 since it is impossible to play with a goalkeeper 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.190
 of forwards already with the equipment as well 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.110
 that nothing next I'll put some 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.479
 how many clips with a few players 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.040
 between them the cassette and water mediated 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.600
 which are the ones I was using last 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.820
 team and nothing only remains for me 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.740
 say goodbye to enjoy this boom 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.970
 since you will laugh, it is even 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.260
 fuck and without internet if you are not going to 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.360
 do it as friends or if francisco 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.729
