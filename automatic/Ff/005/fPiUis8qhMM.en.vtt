00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
you don't want the heat to be too much

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.399 
you don't want the heat to be too much
cuz<00:01:24.100> they<00:01:24.189> also<00:01:24.369> burn<00:01:24.729> your<00:01:24.909> butter<00:01:25.119> so<00:01:26.020> you

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
cuz they also burn your butter so you

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.859 
cuz they also burn your butter so you
start<00:01:26.680> just<00:01:26.830> putting<00:01:27.009> your<00:01:27.450> toast<00:01:28.450> on<00:01:28.659> in

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
start just putting your toast on in

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.180 
start just putting your toast on in
there<00:01:29.399> one<00:01:30.399> side<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.179> other<00:01:35.130> now<00:01:36.130> I'm

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
there one side do the other now I'm

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.070 
there one side do the other now I'm
going<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.369> let<00:01:36.429> this<00:01:36.580> just<00:01:37.149> go<00:01:37.569> low<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:37.869> slow

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
going to let this just go low and slow

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.109 
going to let this just go low and slow
for<00:01:38.619> probably<00:01:39.009> about<00:01:39.190> three<00:01:39.520> or<00:01:39.549> four<00:01:39.789> minutes

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
for probably about three or four minutes

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.969 
for probably about three or four minutes
on<00:01:40.210> each<00:01:40.270> side<00:01:40.390> until<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.409> gets<00:01:41.679> a<00:01:41.770> nice<00:01:41.920> golden

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
on each side until it gets a nice golden

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.130 
on each side until it gets a nice golden
brown<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:43.270> while<00:01:44.080> that's<00:01:44.200> going<00:01:44.440> on<00:01:44.679> I<00:01:46.140> like

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
brown and while that's going on I like

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.639 
brown and while that's going on I like
to<00:01:48.119> monitor<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.479> pretty<00:01:49.720> much<00:01:49.869> maybe<00:01:50.380> put<00:01:50.619> a

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
to monitor it pretty much maybe put a

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.230 
to monitor it pretty much maybe put a
little<00:01:50.709> bit<00:01:50.920> more<00:01:51.159> oil<00:01:51.459> in<00:01:51.759> there<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.030> kind<00:01:52.149> of

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
little bit more oil in there to kind of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.090 
little bit more oil in there to kind of
regulate<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.940> heat<00:01:55.149> of<00:01:55.360> things<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.920> oil

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
regulate the the heat of things the oil

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.730 
regulate the the heat of things the oil
will<00:01:57.340> kind<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.580> bring<00:01:57.819> up<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:59.080> Browning

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
will kind of bring up the Browning

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.169 
will kind of bring up the Browning
temperature<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.340> butter<00:02:00.549> so<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.880> doesn't

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
temperature of the butter so it doesn't

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.069 
temperature of the butter so it doesn't
burn<00:02:01.330> on<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.600> too<00:02:01.780> much<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.810> what<00:02:04.930> you're
