sense of the use of the public that uses

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.540

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
space on and it was after spending

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
space on and it was after spending
really<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> couple<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.289> days<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> atrium<00:00:59.010> of

the<00:00:59.370> european<00:00:59.820> union<00:01:00.030> council<00:01:00.449> i<00:01:00.510> realized

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the european union council i realized

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
the european union council i realized
that<00:01:01.050> people<00:01:01.199> had<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> very<00:01:01.890> linear<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that people had a very linear a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.830 
that people had a very linear a
trajectory<00:01:03.920> from<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.189> street<00:01:05.610> entrance<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
trajectory from the street entrance to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590 
trajectory from the street entrance to
the<00:01:06.930> actual<00:01:07.350> main<00:01:08.100> entrance<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.030> council

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the actual main entrance of the council

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.080 
the actual main entrance of the council
there<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:10.110> kind<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.760> linear<00:01:11.760> vector

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
there was a very kind of linear vector

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.320 
there was a very kind of linear vector
that<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:13.229> traffic<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.520> i<00:01:14.580> wanted<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.060> play

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that of traffic that i wanted to play

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
that of traffic that i wanted to play
with<00:01:15.360> i<00:01:15.570> wanted<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> somehow<00:01:16.290> intervene<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
with i wanted to somehow intervene and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.730 
with i wanted to somehow intervene and
that<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> i<00:01:17.759> use<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.229> i<00:01:19.259> decided<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that and i use and so i decided to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.820 
that and i use and so i decided to
create<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.280> 33<00:01:21.119> meter<00:01:21.330> LED<00:01:22.080> screened<00:01:22.530> it's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
create this a 33 meter LED screened it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.780 
create this a 33 meter LED screened it's
almost<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.520> there's<00:01:24.150> long<00:01:25.790> almost

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
almost like this there's long almost

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.660 
almost like this there's long almost
like<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> flying<00:01:27.810> carpet<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.189> sense<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
like a flying carpet in a sense that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.660 
like a flying carpet in a sense that
that<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.990> floating<00:01:31.619> about<00:01:31.890> people's<00:01:32.340> heads

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that is floating about people's heads

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.109 
that is floating about people's heads
and<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.680> an<00:01:34.950> alternative<00:01:35.670> an

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and it was really an alternative an

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
and it was really an alternative an
alternative<00:01:36.390> view<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.200> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> linear

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
alternative view that kind of linear

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
alternative view that kind of linear
road<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> wanted<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> create<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> sense<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
road I wanted to create a sense that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.590 
road I wanted to create a sense that
nothing<00:01:40.320> through<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> road<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.060> all<00:01:42.270> are

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
nothing through the road we are all are

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
nothing through the road we are all are
in<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.920> European<00:01:44.340> Union<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> linear

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
in in the European Union is not a linear

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.630 
in in the European Union is not a linear
road<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.960> linear<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> rota<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
road it's a linear it's a rota as the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.630 
road it's a linear it's a rota as the
ups<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> downs<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.869> has<00:01:49.170> curves<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.280> even<00:01:50.520> has

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
ups and downs it has curves it even has

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
ups and downs it has curves it even has
a<00:01:50.670> loop<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.930> wanted<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> create<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.280> other

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
a loop so I wanted to create this other

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.600 
a loop so I wanted to create this other
perspective<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:55.170> play<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> very

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
perspective and really play in a very

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.420 
perspective and really play in a very
direct<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.320> usage<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
direct way with the usage of a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.300 
direct way with the usage of a
pedestrian<00:02:00.060> walking<00:02:00.299> through<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> space

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
pedestrian walking through the space

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
pedestrian walking through the space

perhaps when we think of the european
union<00:02:22.050> council<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:23.520> tend<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> think<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.390> very

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
union council we tend to think of a very

space<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.280> fact<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.880> actual<00:02:33.270> atrium<00:02:33.720> is

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
space and in fact the actual atrium is

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.540 
space and in fact the actual atrium is
not<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.380> most<00:02:34.560> beautiful<00:02:35.040> space<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
not the most beautiful space in the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.450 
not the most beautiful space in the

work<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> space<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.760> usually

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.990 
stimulated by their work environment so
I<00:02:48.030> was<00:02:48.300> very<00:02:48.360> interested<00:02:48.870> in<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.860> making<00:02:50.340> that

some really interesting reactions from
the<00:03:10.530> people<00:03:10.650> actually<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.550> work<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.180> space

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
the people actually a work in this space

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.820 
the people actually a work in this space
how<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.810> long<00:03:16.080> it's<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.620> very

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
how and it's it's a long it's a very

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.100 
how and it's it's a long it's a very
long<00:03:17.130> video<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.000> seen<00:03:18.270> on<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.540> screen<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
long video that is seen on the screen it

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.550 
long video that is seen on the screen it
it<00:03:19.890> lasts<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:20.489> 25<00:03:21.000> minutes<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.510> as<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.320> walk

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
it lasts like 25 minutes so as you walk

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.750 
it lasts like 25 minutes so as you walk
in<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:22.890> out<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.250> building<00:03:23.459> on<00:03:23.730> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
in and out of that building on a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.580 
in and out of that building on a
day-to-day<00:03:23.970> basis<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:25.020> different

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
day-to-day basis you see different

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.430 
day-to-day basis you see different
moments<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.430> video<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> LED<00:03:27.780> screen

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
moments of that video on the LED screen

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.130 
moments of that video on the LED screen
and<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:29.580> think<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.209> kind<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.690> sense<00:03:31.020> of

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
and I think it's kind of like a sense of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.110 
and I think it's kind of like a sense of
wanting<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.470> keep<00:03:31.739> on<00:03:31.980> engaging<00:03:32.370> them<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:32.880> it

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
wanting to keep on engaging them as it

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.620 
wanting to keep on engaging them as it
as<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.720> as<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.860> as<00:03:35.130> they<00:03:35.340> enter<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.209> out<00:03:36.390> and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
as a as the as they enter in and out and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.350 
as a as the as they enter in and out and
they<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.870> their<00:03:37.050> quotidian<00:03:37.680> tasks<00:03:38.360> engage

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
they do their quotidian tasks engage

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.449 
they do their quotidian tasks engage
them<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:39.690> c<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.050> seeing<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.860> different

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
them in c and seeing that different

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.400
