and stuff like that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.570 
and stuff like that
would<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.560> pick<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> core<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.340> want

that you're gonna have over the summer
and<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.700> varies<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.360> every<00:01:25.049> core<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.659> again

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and that varies for every core but again

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.730 
and that varies for every core but again
you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.900> probably<00:01:28.080> find<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.619> by

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you can probably find that out by

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
you can probably find that out by
researching<00:01:29.280> them<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
researching them a little bit and that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.030 
researching them a little bit and that
brings<00:01:30.780> me<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> another<00:01:31.079> topic<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> guess

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
brings me to another topic and I guess

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.440 
brings me to another topic and I guess
this<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:32.670> directed<00:01:33.090> towards

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this is kind of more directed towards

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.770 
this is kind of more directed towards
