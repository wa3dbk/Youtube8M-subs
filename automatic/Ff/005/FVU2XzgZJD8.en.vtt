00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.320
 a study conducted by experts from the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.980
 glasgow university that included more 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.039
 of 3000 children between 0 and 6 years old 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.560
 proven to watch the TV more than 2 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.470
 hours a day to be in front of a 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.000
 screen more than 2 hours a day 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.150
 doubles the probability of having 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.279
 asthmatic problems is the first time 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.010
 that is investigated about this because 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.190
 we are now entering a 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.440
 society in which it is very common to be 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.649
 sitting in front of a screen be it a 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.800
 TV either a computer or even 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.070
 the screen of the mobile what consequences 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.170
 has this aside from the scarce 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.079
 physical activity that is done when one 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.910
 is sitting you have to take for granted from 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.269
 that those children to those who 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.429
 want to have children and want their 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.320
 children develop well is not a 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.170
 good option to wear for a long time 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.880
 time to watch TV because it's very 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.900
 possible that they develop problems 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.310
 asthmatics concretely double the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.829
 double that a person who 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.009
 watch television that is not in front 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.530
 in front of the screen so it has already 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.810
 concluded through this study that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.520
 those children those good this is worth 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.570
 also for adults not only for 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.470
 children those people who see the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.810
 screen for more than two hours a day 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.229
 they run the risk of duplicating problems 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.270
 asthmatics so you know it's clear 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.210
 that being in front of a screen is not 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.799
 something healthy me for example I shot 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.560
 enough time here in front of the 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.289
 screen recording videos and others but what 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.049
 compensated by doing physical activity in a 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.869
 gym and running if on the contrary 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.580
 a person is long in front of 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.880
 a screen and it does absolutely 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.170
 nothing else is locked in a 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.720
 room , most likely, 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.950
 develop asthmatic problems because 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 you have to keep in mind that the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.140
 room accumulates large amounts 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.140
 of dust that can trigger in 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.030
 future problems so you already know 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.180
 all the people that you are 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.859
 watching this channel you are warned 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.510
 because being in front of a lot of time 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.510
 screen is not healthy
