you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:55.640> maybe<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> other<00:00:57.360> thing<00:00:57.480> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you know maybe that's the other thing I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.770 
you know maybe that's the other thing I
want<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> test<00:00:58.050> out

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780 

I<00:01:02.870> was<00:01:03.860> really<00:01:04.010> surprised<00:01:04.400> because<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
I was really surprised because the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.399 
I was really surprised because the
reason<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:05.210> wasn't<00:01:05.540> going<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.720> switch<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.260> is

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
reason I wasn't going to switch to it is

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.109 
reason I wasn't going to switch to it is
because<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:06.740> have<00:01:07.010> all<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:07.340> setup<00:01:07.640> if<00:01:07.909> that

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
because I have all this setup if that

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.320 
because I have all this setup if that
the<00:01:08.240> camera<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:09.440> all<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.130> your<00:01:11.030> LED

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
scenes and things like that and I can do

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.840 
scenes and things like that and I can do

in data and the other thing good with
shadow<00:01:26.869> play<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.320> if<00:01:27.890> you're<00:01:28.040> like<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.490> a

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
shadow play is if you're like in a

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.969 
shadow play is if you're like in a
heated<00:01:29.000> battle<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.960> well<00:01:30.170> better<00:01:30.470> quality

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
heated battle it well better quality

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.609 
heated battle it well better quality
lower<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.610> uses<00:01:32.210> less<00:01:32.240> resources<00:01:33.020> only<00:01:33.409> five

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
lower it uses less resources only five

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.380 
lower it uses less resources only five
percent<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:35.420> also<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.110> could<00:01:36.970> record<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.119> or

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
percent and also you could record the or

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.930 
percent and also you could record the or
capture<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.350> last<00:01:39.530> five<00:01:39.920> up<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.399> 20<00:01:40.729> minutes

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
capture the last five up to 20 minutes

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.310 
capture the last five up to 20 minutes
of<00:01:41.149> gameplay<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:41.630> if<00:01:41.840> you're<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.110> heated

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
of gameplay so if you're in a heated

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.109 
of gameplay so if you're in a heated
battle<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:43.340> just<00:01:43.490> hit<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.610> button<00:01:43.789> and<00:01:44.000> it

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
battle you just hit a button and it

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.020 
battle you just hit a button and it
automatically<00:01:44.690> saves<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.259> last<00:01:45.560> scene

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
automatically saves that last scene
