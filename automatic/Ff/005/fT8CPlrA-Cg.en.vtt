00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.260
 we need eggs that the eggs 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.400
 let's separate the egg whites from the yolks 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.270
 we need sugar 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.260
 flour 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.830
 oil 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.990
 and here I have yogurt with grated 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 lemon and vanilla we have beaten the whites 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 We added the little sugar to the snow 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 a little alternating with the yolks is worth 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.210
 then let's go now let's add the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.790
 yogurt is worth having here with lemon 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.420
 with the lemon zest in this case and 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.890
 vanilla with color 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.500
 OK 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 We already do this process by hand and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 we have turned off the blender it is no longer beating 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.540
 better and now carefully trying to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.979
 that does not get off the smoothie ok we're going to 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.509
 incorporate the flour always in all 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.430
 the ingredients we incorporate little to 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.860
 little vale 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.910
 let's divide the recipe 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.910
 in two containers 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.920
 the next step is to take it to the oven 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.700
 the oven must be at 180 degrees 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.030
 at a temperature at a medium height without 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.560
 air is worth and we are going to put our 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.140
 biscuits 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.189
 and will be for an approximate time of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.810
 about 35-40 minutes let's remove the 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.810
 oven our biscuits 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.520
 let's cover the cake with fondant vale 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.440
 then the fondant comes to us in white 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.170
 or it also comes in colors and then 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.720
 we can dye it and give it the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.960
 color you want so it would be 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.530
 texture is is very malleable similar to a 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.530
 clay 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.090
 and it's the way to work this
