00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.020
 I was surprised when braking the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.680
 Turn down the last corner of the engine 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 went out 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.860
 I could not restart myself 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 do not know what it was 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.610
 to lead gasoline but always if 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.990
 analyze something 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.990
 again the weekend 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.400
 Definitely what my fault is always im 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.320
 street sale there was worth it then 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.930
 The wheels were in the front and fault 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.840
 After all , I slipped on what 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.890
 of course for him, especially because he is 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 did not do anything wrong and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.880
 his race was over and that's why 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.620
 Just be shocked in that 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.390
 moment that happened so me 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.830
 believe me how to describe it 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.940
 It should be difficult if I believe it 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.560
 not so experienced but in principle 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.820
 Do you think at the moment that is now 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.650
 not happening you do not want it 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.190
 realize what has just happened there 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.190
 the film 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 ddp
