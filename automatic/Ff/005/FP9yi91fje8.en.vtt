and<00:00:12.870> I've<00:00:13.710> been<00:00:13.860> slowly<00:00:14.130> modding<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.700> up<00:00:14.820> since

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and I've been slowly modding it up since

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.939 
and I've been slowly modding it up since
then<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.780> first<00:00:16.020> time<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.199> heard<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.650> OEM

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
then the first time I heard the OEM

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.400 
then the first time I heard the OEM
audio<00:00:17.250> +<00:00:17.460> system<00:00:17.789> was<00:00:18.000> when<00:00:18.600> sign<00:00:18.869> evolution

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
audio + system was when sign evolution

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.279

held<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.949> meet<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.820> five<00:00:21.090> axis<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.050> whole

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
held a meet at five axis and the whole

held a meet at five axis and the whole
om<00:00:23.100> crew<00:00:23.340> was<00:00:23.490> there<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.820> then<00:00:23.910> start<00:00:24.330> talking

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
om crew was there and then start talking

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240 
om crew was there and then start talking
some<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> people<00:00:25.439> there<00:00:25.590> showing<00:00:25.859> me<00:00:26.099> like

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.009 
some of the people there showing me like
the<00:00:26.400> system<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.880> then<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.060> test<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.480> it

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the system and then I test it out it

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.560 
the system and then I test it out it
sounded<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.890> clear<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:30.449> was

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
sounded like so clear and then it was

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.319 
sounded like so clear and then it was
like<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.840> best<00:00:30.990> system<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.309> don't<00:00:33.270> know

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
like the best system that I don't know

like the best system that I don't know
how<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> say<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.140> fits<00:00:34.440> exactly<00:00:34.649> for

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100

and as far as installing it's like a lot
of<00:01:01.079> unplug<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.800> plug<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.789> makes<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
of unplug you can plug in so it makes it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.690

I've heard it after it's been all

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.750 
I've heard it after it's been all
installed<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.170> hear<00:01:26.800> everything<00:01:27.550> so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
installed you can hear everything so

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.000 
installed you can hear everything so
much<00:01:27.880> clearer<00:01:28.180> as<00:01:28.990> far<00:01:29.200> as<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.410> base<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:29.860> can

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
much clearer as far as the base you can

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.320 
much clearer as far as the base you can
hear<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.250> distributed<00:01:30.790> more<00:01:31.000> throughout

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
hear it's distributed more throughout

hear it's distributed more throughout
the<00:01:31.420> car<00:01:31.750> versus<00:01:32.229> just<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.620> doors<00:01:32.860> but

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310

I<00:01:59.220> really<00:02:00.220> like<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.490> addition<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.939> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
I really like the addition of the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.880 
I really like the addition of the
tweeter<00:02:01.390> in<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.630> back<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:02.439> makes<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.740> sound

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
tweeter in the back it makes it sound

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.399 
tweeter in the back it makes it sound
better<00:02:03.070> if<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.000> design<00:02:04.299> of<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.540> amp<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.229> how

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
better if the design of the amp and how

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.490
