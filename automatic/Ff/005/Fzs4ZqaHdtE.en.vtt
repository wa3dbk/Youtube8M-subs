00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.270
 in the moors 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.570
 renault offers a youthful look to his 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.330
 megan cabriolet and it's under a sky 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.250
 covered that we discovered it so 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.660
 without rolling over that this does not 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.369
 hold this model does not change 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.390
 basically but harmonizes with 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.100
 the rest of the range 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.590
 by adopting a new grille 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.320
 style symbol created by laurens van 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.260
 den acker the whole shield lighthouse 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.940
 grid is so modified do not ignore 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.920
 cry out to genius but that gives more 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.320
 personality to the car without making it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.970
 aggressive so far the rest of the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.339
 line will be to everyone's taste 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.800
 the megan keeping for asset its roof 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.269
 glazed hard the followers of the canvas 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.720
 will inevitably find their pleasure 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.720
 elsewhere 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.890
 cabriolets are pleasure cars 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.900
 we can therefore wonder in the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.760
 current context how is this 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.910
 sector and what are the expectations of 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.910
 customers 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.730
 so on a French market that has known 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.490
 from 2013 a bit complicated we have a 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.800
 coupe-cabriolet market on the segment 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.960
 c which suffered more than the market 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.470
 since it is down 26% 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.320
 when the French market was almost 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.610
 on a new megan coupe-cabriolet 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.830
 10% of our customers choose 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.400
 petrol engines the rest is carried 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.130
 on one of the wings 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.690
 we will also note the arrival of the system 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.700
 airlink offering a touch screen of 7 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.200
 inches and allowing to communicate the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 classic navigation functions 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.979
 audio management and other equipment 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 worthy of any car word to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.500
 the interior of the car does not evolve anymore 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.420
 the sedan had already been entitled to his 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.270
 facelift but welcomes a change 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.760
 under the hood the engine dci 130 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.160
 with the double clutch gearbox edc is 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.250
 now available on the model on 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.060
 new megan sedan we were learning the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.480
 tc had 130 deaths so in terms of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.520
 new 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.770
 it's soon, of course, the introduction of 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.250
 the double clutch gearbox to six 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.890
 reports is also in box version 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.840
 manual we introduce the overboost so 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.020
 with 20 newton meter extra 1 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.030
 available on request always a 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.620
 reduction in consumption that one of the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.270
 first expectations our customers 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.770
 today but also a search 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.140
 from comfort to laws in evolutions 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.810
 of the market on the car boxes 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.350
 today in europe from 20% to 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.350
 34% 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.390
 the promise of the builder and that of 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.550
 short reports of good times and 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.770
 from 0 to 100 had five seconds 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.200
 so equipped we have a couple of 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.540
 205 newton meters at 2000 rpm 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.760
 in practice this configuration fits 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.920
 well to use the megan in 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.620
 high road we adopt a driving 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.420
 casting and if not looking here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.070
 a kick to the buttocks the occasions 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.030
 are perfectly correct to double 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.070
 safely 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.630
 However, we feel a little hollow when 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.760
 changes of reports that we 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.760
 might wish less noticeable 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.070
 with his chassis still holding largely 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.660
 head to more modern platforms 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.760
 these changes will ensure the megane 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.770
 still beautiful days and can be 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.230
 will we not finish reviewing the set tc 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.720
 e130 and edc box on the megane 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.990
 cabriolet to get the best of 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.990
 two worlds
