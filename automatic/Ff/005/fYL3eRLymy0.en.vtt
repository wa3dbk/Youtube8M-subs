this<00:01:22.229> Lego<00:01:22.740> Atlantis<00:01:23.869> golden<00:01:24.869> king<00:01:25.140> head<00:01:25.700> this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
this Lego Atlantis golden king head this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
this Lego Atlantis golden king head this
is<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.939> cool<00:01:27.180> head<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.049> reversible

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is a cool head because it's reversible

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
is a cool head because it's reversible
so<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.579> side<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.450> default

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so on one side you can have a default

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.120 
so on one side you can have a default
paladin<00:01:31.740> head<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.470> well<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.979> can

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
paladin head just like that well you can

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
paladin head just like that well you can
have<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.240> more<00:01:36.420> suited<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
have it so it's more suited to the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.830 
have it so it's more suited to the
actual<00:01:37.530> artwork<00:01:37.939> rather<00:01:38.939> than<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> paladin

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
actual artwork rather than the paladin

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.249 
actual artwork rather than the paladin
himself<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.400> utha<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
himself which is utha so you can have it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.929 
himself which is utha so you can have it
so<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> gold<00:01:44.009> version<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> head

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so it's a gold version of the head

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.230 
so it's a gold version of the head
instead<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.159> think<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.430> looks<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.909> cool

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
instead I think that looks pretty cool

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.950 
instead I think that looks pretty cool
and<00:01:48.990> also<00:01:49.430> fitting<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> artwork<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and also fitting to the artwork of the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.819 
and also fitting to the artwork of the
Paladin<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.159> game<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.320> then<00:01:55.320> finally<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
Paladin in the game and then finally you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.450 
Paladin in the game and then finally you
can<00:01:55.890> top<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.219> off<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:57.060> some<00:01:57.600> nice<00:01:58.040> yeah<00:01:59.070> which

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
can top it off with some nice yeah which

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.070 
can top it off with some nice yeah which
looks<00:01:59.850> also<00:02:00.299> similar<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.079> that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
looks also similar to that

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.330 
looks also similar to that
from<00:02:02.260> paladin<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.850> hafsteinn<00:02:04.240> artwork
