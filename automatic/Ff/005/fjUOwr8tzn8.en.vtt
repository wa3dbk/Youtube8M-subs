00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.170
 hello how about here I bring you a news 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.900
 about rambo the gay video that goes 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.110
 letting go 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.840
 little by little information was in the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.580
 information that you released in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.090
 shaped image that you are watching 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.090
 which is the police station that started all 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.540
 the police station of 'cornered' also 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.190
 He put some previous photos of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.470
 the town on the outside and two 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.220
 more photos that you can also see that are 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.559
 of the jungle the game for what not 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.470
 you only know is cataloged with triple-a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.739
 so it is a game that is worth a paste 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.619
 and is cataloged when cataloging the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.140
 games are games similar to ark 2 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.330
 duty black ops' are similar to look 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.580
 the warfala since it is not a game 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.159
 anyone or a game of these wanted 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.430
 go up I'm going to buy spend a while and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.790
 we laugh not the game 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.070
 so little filtered out happens 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.200
 will have to do with the movie I do not know 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.150
 he still knows if they go to all 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.140
 movies have me the game or is it going to be 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.980
 for the same part that happened in the movie 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.010
 actually 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.900
 is based on that if you know you're 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.430
 based on the movies of john rambo 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.850
 it is good that they have taken this game to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.979
 out of time because 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.740
 if they do it very close we all know what 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.619
 what happens with video games that are 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.440
 movies that I do not know why but it falls in 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.119
 oblivion but this game that in addition to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.720
 those as I said has triple 'a' that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.770
 will be doing well done they would have 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.640
 many fans of this john rambo and that the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.680
 first action at least action 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.380
 of vietnam in this style 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.020
 because nothing else I can not give more 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.410
 information because the only thing you know 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.980
 is that a screen of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.820
 beginning of menu in the helmet of 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.770
 germany but the only images that have 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.550
 been able to leave after the time has been 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.140
 this one that I taught from the police station 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.820
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.970
