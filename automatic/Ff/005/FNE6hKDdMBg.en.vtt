00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:11.759
 the moon low ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 cooking and today I 'm here to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.630
 you a gameplay of farkas there and 3 if it is 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.730
 babies for me the best game of 2013 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.460
 The vehicle in that game was released in 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.390
 2012 as can not be advice already had 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.640
 three because it's I know, I know, I just 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.099
 I was playing it recently recently. 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.010
 He sent me to greaves. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.160
 along with the clutter of design is disgrace 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.649
 radio newspaper and stuff like that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.410
 it is a game too and the kingdom 4 is also a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.750
 I already played gameplay game you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 including but that is not the case where 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.719
 come to the case is that frei cal far cry 3 is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.300
 fucking fucking 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.120
 What I liked the most about the game was the island. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.550
 then he was neither, nor was the story 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.920
 was neither dense nor well written nor 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.110
 psychological and physical character 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 main I do not know the name of the guy 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.650
 because I will not be decorating the name 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.200
 of main character that we do not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.759
 sees neither face then in the other neither does 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.549
 I'm not saying that the game is fucking 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.700
 cause of their epic characters I believe 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.479
 Vampire fucking man, you know what it is. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.310
 the difference 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.119
 I already told you about the definition of end 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.740
 to define are of is is what is the definition 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.790
 of insanity, the vase is fucking 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.229
 fuck 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.299
 Another thing I enjoyed fairly by 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.790
 these parallel child appointments 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.399
 You see here they are missions now. 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.560
 dominance of specific points in 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.960
 that you can not trigger the alarm that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.930
 catch the guys at the stel fiame game 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.750
 provide an endless 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.170
 Possibilities of gambling can play 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.180
 can help a 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.299
 tips as you can see I'm with 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.070
 a dose on hand is I can see 12 game 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.049
 which I love to put in my hand and here 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.170
 takes behind for certain and black cap 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.710
 took the knife in the head 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.800
 damn it 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.960
 aa evolution that you get the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.820
 character through xp and buying 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.740
 buying non- unlocked skills 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.360
 new through ringtones 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.200
 this brings with it a range of 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.040
 I've played a few times in 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 games and in addition to the island the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.520
 island to me is a is a character to 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.720
 part of the game there is completely alive 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.540
 has animals all over the island 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.310
 including animals are not there acts 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.720
 their goal in the game is that you 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.520
 choose the logical match and choose the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.640
 remove your skin to increase your 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.310
 saddlebags ie your backpack your covers 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.060
 of arms is expensive 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.780
 The game is incredibly it te as is that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.240
 I will say 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.760
 It makes you want to do the missions. 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.510
 parallel he makes want to waste time 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.120
 in the game I took about 20 more hours 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.220
 or less did not come close to completing 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.250
 all the missions to do everything that commands 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.030
 in the game but it's still so I can not 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.880
 stop playing 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.520
 I already determined he even I have 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.400
 one a the almost spoiler a pleasure to 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.730
 You're not the story but the game. 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.770
 he has two exact endings has two 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.020
 endings for you 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.340
 they choose, although they do not have a 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.870
 system of karma where your actions will 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.100
 result in the ultimate goal of the game he 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.690
 does not support the charging system but 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.030
 There's a fucking decision for you guys. 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.630
 talk at the end so think carefully 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.060
 by condemnation do not go with much thirst 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.220
 to the pot you guys might bother 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.480
 this is one of the parallel missions that 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.950
 I was talking to you 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.800
 of these hunting missions to which all 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.049
 gain a specific advantage and if this 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.340
 black panther you see there 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.560
 The goal is to kill her with a bow and 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.420
 arrow and clinging to her skin I 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.180
 I managed to do 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.100
 if I'm not mistaken it was a way of 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.260
 higher for my syringes 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.270
 this parade to the islands is also fucking expensive 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.800
 brought in 11 in the new game ended up leaving the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.130
 very end shark to casadinha 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.930
 you enjoy it because it's the year of 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.000
 animals that have to make the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.650
 hunting is complicated it is difficult to have 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.410
 to stop attacking first can catch 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.040
 And man I 'm really fascinated with 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.720
 It's the game, I recommend you 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.060
 do not have the opportunity to play 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.020
 It's still good the way I play. I'm playing. 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.690
 on ps3 and I feel a lot of 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.030
 frame rate I feel is very serrated 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.410
 subtle graphic bit strange then I 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.690
 I'm very happy with the announcement of ps4 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.910
 who left two days ago to everyone 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.250
 speaks of the year 4 Feet Knowing About 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.630
 principality that is a guy who was 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.620
 lost inside a low touching a 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.060
 stone and uganda where the monkey denies 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.990
 I'm going to make a video about the ps4 in 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.640
 brief 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.860
 I just wanted to bring this neighbor here to 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.840
 come back because I missed you 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.520
 record for you 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.140
 so I brought videos in quick to 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.240
 talk a little about this game one thing 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.800
 so to recommend to 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.560
 You're recommended because said 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.420
 so do not forget that if you 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.190
 I have an opportunity when I left promotion 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.140
 in steam when it gets cheaper with 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.300
 this game he is a pleasant surprise 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.150
 I tried recording the multiplayer for 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.290
 you but unfortunately I get 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.690
 play the multiplayer i played well 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.000
 multiplayer but I could only play 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.500
 at dawn game is at two o'clock 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.320
 nights ago managed to play multiplayer 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.690
 I did not record and in the last days I did not 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.430
 I have been able to get through on ps3 is 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.100
 very difficult this room has very little 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.740
 people playing very little very little 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.230
 there is no staff 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.850
 living and learning with a good game 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.670
 poetry is coming to an end 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.570
 I bid you farewell I call that 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.490
 neighborhood that sexiest you like 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.130
 remembering that if you liked the video and 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.920
 has already went according to IRNA said the 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.930
 more beautiful you help to spread 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.110
 this channel 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.759
 so see the comment I'm going 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.729
 find it very cool that he does not have 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:39.800
 any great champion and I will if and it is 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:42.440
 remembered that today we will still have more 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.360
 videos probably a maybe two 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.650
 because I 'm in the mood to record people 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.960
 I came back and I went back to stay because 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.960
 here is my place 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.520
 kisser colonist all good and another neighborhood 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.930
 that the sexiest one there was not good for 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.930
 You then go to another one. 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.050
 ae
