00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
only can you do that but it can also be

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700 
only can you do that but it can also be
the<00:00:59.100> starting<00:00:59.579> point<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.570> many<00:01:00.989> breeding

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the starting point for many breeding

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.299 
the starting point for many breeding
chains<00:01:02.160> some<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.120> could<00:01:03.870> potentially

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
chains some of which could potentially

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.929 
chains some of which could potentially
be<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.820> ways<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.130> certain

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
be the only ways to get a certain

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
be the only ways to get a certain
combination<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.810> moves<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> certain

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.070 
same thing as ditto but nonetheless it's
very<00:01:20.009> convenient<00:01:20.520> when<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> comes<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.509> giggles

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080

of<00:07:22.070> polish<00:07:22.490> their<00:07:23.030> the<00:07:23.570> solution<00:07:24.050> is<00:07:24.140> fairly

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
of polish their the solution is fairly

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.110 
of polish their the solution is fairly
easy<00:07:24.890> to<00:07:25.070> memorize

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
easy to memorize

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.290 
easy to memorize
that<00:07:27.020> place<00:07:27.770> where<00:07:28.100> there's<00:07:28.430> well<00:07:29.030> I<00:07:29.060> wouldn't

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300 
that place where there's well I wouldn't

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.010 
that place where there's well I wouldn't
call<00:07:29.419> it<00:07:29.660> ice<00:07:29.840> but<00:07:30.410> whatever<00:07:31.160> so<00:07:32.030> gotta<00:07:32.780> do

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.260 
this I'm just concentrating to make any

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.100 
this I'm just concentrating to make any
to<00:07:36.620> make<00:07:36.800> sure<00:07:36.979> the<00:07:37.400> ldr<00:07:37.940> curse<00:07:38.300> doesn't

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
to make sure the ldr curse doesn't

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.409 
to make sure the ldr curse doesn't
happen<00:07:39.530> and<00:07:39.889> I<00:07:39.949> screw<00:07:40.460> up<00:07:40.490> after<00:07:41.000> saying<00:07:41.300> it

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:41.419 
happen and I screw up after saying it

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:45.730 
happen and I screw up after saying it
was<00:07:41.600> easy<00:07:41.900> and<00:07:42.940> now<00:07:43.940> to<00:07:44.000> do<00:07:44.510> these<00:07:44.840> go<00:07:45.139> yeah

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
was easy and now to do these go yeah

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.790 
was easy and now to do these go yeah
yeah<00:07:46.460> sometimes<00:07:47.240> I<00:07:47.389> go<00:07:47.570> right<00:07:47.960> and<00:07:48.260> then<00:07:48.470> I<00:07:48.590> end

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 
yeah sometimes I go right and then I end

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.100 
yeah sometimes I go right and then I end
up<00:07:48.979> messing<00:07:49.430> up<00:07:49.820> because<00:07:50.330> there's<00:07:51.020> really

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.110 
up messing up because there's really

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.400 
up messing up because there's really
only<00:07:51.410> one<00:07:51.680> solution<00:07:52.250> to<00:07:53.210> that<00:07:53.479> and<00:07:53.870> it's<00:07:54.199> by

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.410 
only one solution to that and it's by

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.580 
only one solution to that and it's by
going

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.590 
going

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.870 
going
no<00:07:56.770> additional<00:07:57.580> Sam<00:07:58.120> boney<00:07:58.420> like<00:07:58.750> pattern<00:07:59.320> and

00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 
no additional Sam boney like pattern and

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.970 
no additional Sam boney like pattern and
yep<00:08:00.880> that's<00:08:01.630> it<00:08:02.050> so<00:08:02.350> we're<00:08:02.560> going<00:08:02.740> to<00:08:02.890> be

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:02.980 
yep that's it so we're going to be

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.850 
yep that's it so we're going to be
fighting<00:08:03.250> one<00:08:03.700> for<00:08:04.390> a<00:08:04.420> second<00:08:05.170> time<00:08:05.350> I'm<00:08:05.650> glad

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:05.860 
fighting one for a second time I'm glad

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.310 
fighting one for a second time I'm glad
it's<00:08:06.070> this<00:08:06.310> one<00:08:06.580> because<00:08:06.790> the<00:08:07.120> other

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:07.320 
it's this one because the other

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.230 
it's this one because the other
rematches<00:08:08.320> will<00:08:08.890> have<00:08:09.130> their<00:08:09.490> Pokemon<00:08:10.000> and

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 
rematches will have their Pokemon and

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.080 
rematches will have their Pokemon and
like<00:08:10.690> the<00:08:10.900> 30s<00:08:11.470> and<00:08:11.740> low<00:08:11.920> 40s<00:08:11.950> but<00:08:12.640> this<00:08:12.850> guy<00:08:13.060> is

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.090 
like the 30s and low 40s but this guy is

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.470 
like the 30s and low 40s but this guy is
in<00:08:13.330> the<00:08:13.450> high<00:08:13.630> 40s<00:08:14.200> and<00:08:14.500> low<00:08:15.250> 50s<00:08:15.550> so<00:08:16.270> that's

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:16.480 
in the high 40s and low 50s so that's

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.930 
in the high 40s and low 50s so that's
not<00:08:16.690> bad
