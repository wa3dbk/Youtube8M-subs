 American word for autumn and full 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.250

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.480
 with school hairstyles and there I am 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 be inspired by peter leyers the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 series if she does not know yet 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.800
 Be sure 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.910
 and they 're pretty cool 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.290
 hairstyles and I have four now 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.850
 piece of the four characters 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.200
 picked out the easy to copy 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.739
 are and are also taken to school 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.070
 and I'll show you today 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.239
 let's start with hennes hairstyle and 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.610
 for that you need a first 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.480
 page crest 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.449
 I have a little more here now 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 as I usually have and then 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.010
 you catch the side where he then the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.050
 Most hairs on a window too 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.219
 flee 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.570
 So I from normal to lichen 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.170
 and then always takes from the pages 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.170
 couple of years with 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.900
 and if you did it 45 times 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.600
 flashdance whether or not it's all the way 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.130
 normal without which gentleman to take 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.670
 and then he puts on a short head behind 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.440
 couple of hairs on the other side and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.760
 then stopped down there with bobby pins 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.760
 fix your soft 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 then you can go back all the years 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.100
 drauflegen and so you see the end of 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.930
 one at a time and that is 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.930
 actually already pulled out 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.210
 Let's continue with Spencers here as well 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.700
 needed a wide again 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.220
 side vertex and after all hair on 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.890
 a page then you catch in the back of the head 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.500
 to plait the spray on top so one 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.170
 you take a big stake yours 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.360
 Hair and found him to each other 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.300
 That's why the new ones are always weaving 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.340
 to put streaks under the others and 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.330
 then you take from the front it's something that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.650
 stranded hair lies underneath and then from 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.050
 But there you have to stand on the back 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.459
 pay attention to a strand from the very back 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.260
 So do not just take that a bit 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.910
 front but really of all the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.890
 hair from the other side one 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.970
 to take a sting and then in all 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.920
 maybe to lay 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.709
 Here you can see that again from the bottom 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.770
 take a strand and put it in the back 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.270
 bind your club and then completely normal 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.650
 continue the contest so too 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.650
 again take hair from one side 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.120
 and if you then down the head 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.500
 then you should be too 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.720
 already have intertwined all hair 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.799
 and then you can do the job normally 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.790
 still further and braid and then and 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.790
 with a hello love for her 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.190
 you're welcome to do that a bit 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.030
 relax if you want and that is 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.230
 then even spencers hairstyle how 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.760
 The hairstyles they have always said 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.840
 worn at school sometime and 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.670
 are actually pretty easy 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.170
 and now we do with Elvis hairdresser 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.750
 and she always has 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.070
 pretty naturally just lure open 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.570
 but I 'm here now for one 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.590
 Ponytail decided and I wanted 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.600
 but show a little bit how to do that 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.280
 can beautify and copy for it 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.330
 I now my hair first with it 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.330
 I have a bit of volume 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.450
 and then you make yourselves a very high 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.730
 go black and pull you up then 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.830
 The hair out again that you again 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.170
 Lied a lot and then you need that 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.410
 a little brace and do it 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.910
 your hair stuck under your ponytail 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.140
 so the whole of fair opportunity has 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.570
 a bit more volume and hectic 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.530
 just down and then if you are 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.030
 Of course you want one more 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.230
 take strand and those around your hair tie 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.710
 then you can see that tell me 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.060
 no more 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.900
 and he just does that too 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.900
 a bracket fixed 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.109
 and then come to Arias river 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.609
 Prosor and there I have one 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.959
 you will be visited by a cloth and for that 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.160
 you need a middle parting so 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.090
 You must necessarily but I have 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.550
 me now for middle part 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.980
 decided 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.420
 and as I said a cloth you need then 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.100
 I have the hair first in two 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.280
 Parts split the top and the 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.930
 lower part and the upper one 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.080
 That's just pretty formidable 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.260
 indiscriminately put up with bobby 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.260
 pins 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.650
 then I have the lower hair too 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.600
 again divided into two parts and 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.740
 she pinned up so again only 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:02.060
 rather randomly shot a bit 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.060
 and thus bobby pins moored 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.909
 then you can draw a little bit 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.589
 and then make it a bit firmer 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.129
 so that the whole thing at the end of a nice 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.129
 picture results 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.360
 and then you need yours already 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.740
 cloth and then just put it around 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.740
 gets stuck on top 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.660
 you can do that too 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.960
 arrange as you want and that is 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.960
 everything already 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.360
 so here next to me on the symbol on the 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.950
 full on symbol you will find the 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.810
 playlist to the whole videos so far 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.400
 of course only a video in there but it 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.470
 Many others are following now 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.360
 in september and the under takes place 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.010
 you can find another video of it 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.180
 Unfortunately I have the look of emmely 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.100
 Imitation you can like to 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.600
 crutches and that's it 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.710
 Thank you for seeing I have you 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.610
