kind of play with the placement of the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.850 
kind of play with the placement of the
prosthetic<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:58.320> not<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.680> dry

right away so if you don't get it right
the<00:03:00.510> first<00:03:00.540> time<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.260> can<00:03:01.500> mess<00:03:02.160> with<00:03:02.190> it

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the first time then you can mess with it

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.920 
the first time then you can mess with it
