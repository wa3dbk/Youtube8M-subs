00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
in the evening so I'm not too sure if

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.800 
in the evening so I'm not too sure if
his<00:00:20.369> price<00:00:20.640> has<00:00:20.820> dropped<00:00:21.000> or<00:00:21.300> increased<00:00:21.689> I

his price has dropped or increased I

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.120 
his price has dropped or increased I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
probably should've checked out before I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.099 
probably should've checked out before I
start<00:00:23.430> recording<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:23.939> anyway<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.750> happy

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
we do have some special pack so yeah we

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.830 
we do have some special pack so yeah we
aren't<00:00:29.910> actually<00:00:29.970> had<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> happy<00:00:30.539> hour<00:00:30.570> in

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
quite a while and that's probably due to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
quite a while and that's probably due to
the<00:00:32.730> fact<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.540> don't<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.930> many<00:00:34.140> good<00:00:34.469> at
