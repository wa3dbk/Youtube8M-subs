00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.819
 but one vlog boring for you 5 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.099
 Today the king is here to ask for a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.860
 very serious and very important thing. 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.960
 was the focus of this week on 17 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.389
 You may and know that was the day against 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 transphobia zombie homophobia in the last 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.460
 Sunday was the international fight day 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.130
 against homophobia by the way one 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
 date recognized by the student and why 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.539
 People in Brazil, for example, people. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 is the first place in cases of 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.520
 murders related to homophobia 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.559
 which accounts for 50% of these cases in the world 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.399
 all this is absurd we have 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:47.250
 alternating every 28 hours 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:49.170
 someone homophobic dies so it's because 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 there comes a time when we think of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 all that we 're through and everything 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 more and we are faced with a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 reality that no one who has not 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:14.580
 solution even the immediate then side goes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.270
 inform a little because this happens to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.560
 every 28 hours when we said 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.259
 we have examples that the famous ones 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.619
 watched in the media and on the internet 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:36.079
 the game 30 years in cabo de santo 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.079
 Augustine 60 stab wounds that kill someone 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.119
 so you see that it is a hatred and that it is a 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.500
 The situation beyond a simple crime is 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.479
 What I'm saying is more than obvious. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.350
 thing that has no explanation there is no name 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.520
 right that characterizes as a brutality 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.040
 10 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.710
 a transvestite renato 18 years of field 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.079
 large thick bush raped dead by 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.140
 beat and thrown into a river 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.540
 the gays jones lime 19 years and jumps 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.429
 several 24 stab at old village 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.670
 the 14 year old peterson ribeiro 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.200
 oliveira editor 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.880
 Setúbal that famous here in são 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.270
 Paulo beaten at school for being 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.840
 adopted by gay parents means he does not 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.080
 It's the direct target, not even the parents. 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.350
 are homosexuals and what does it mean 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.370
 other people who are not homosexual 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.080
 is being a victim 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.680
 the president says that this is indeed a 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.470
 Everyone's struggle, we have is the year. 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.750
 I think it was first crime. 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.640
 homophobic just judged on beautiful 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.709
 horizon mg Garzón seems to have 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.830
 now also to be tried there in 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.799
 reef that I think the dilma looks like 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.290
 so now you are beginning to see some 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.049
 thing a little more is clear with regard to 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.150
 how to face this situation then 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.360
 so we love making video 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.549
 funny funny joke to people 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.340
 likes to bring it but it's subject like 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.620
 this is delicate because I think 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.690
 takes everyone is right but what I liked 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.819
 Sunday the instagram and percent from 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.420
 of tea too and speaking that this fight 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.799
 is also her is because everyone is 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.609
 starting to take very large proportions 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.340
 big right the violence never reached 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.010
 It's just games that are just homosexuals. 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.380
 gay trans achieved edra 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.820
 other people who are not at fault 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.650
 of what has nothing to do with 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.230
 that is then taking a proportion 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.910
 very large right so we can not 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.680
 that I wrote in the post we can not 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.959
 be silenced why did I say this 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.900
 because there is a majority that says 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.420
 we are minority that this is irrelevant 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.329
 type of violence must be treated with 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.760
 seriousness and should be investigated where 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.170
 he err minority is that you will 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.299
 together all the improvements that are 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.609
 affected by millions of issues 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.799
 it seems we recently had the case 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.959
 of the gymnastics athlete who suffered 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.329
 own friends co-workers 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.430
 it's a matter of racism 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.709
 so it 's again we see that 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.660
 the minority improvement minority what we people 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.090
 either minority actually wants to know who 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.819
 the majority nowadays there is a minority 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.310
 majority is a society only society is 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.799
 equal for all and has to have law and has 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.419
 to have 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.669
 This is for everyone even because he has 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.530
 How does the video that is the year bring us? 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.930
 that is produced in our site 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.169
 including a video, beautiful people I stayed 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.169
 Thought this is supposed to be 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.909
 change who we are yes then yes 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.970
 absurd people still can 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:38.669
 to see and what to aim is the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.560
 Talk the talk when I get tired of 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.060
 lectures on the issue of 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.550
 experience that I speak every 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.520
 characteristics rafael to all that nothing 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.740
 none of them alone define yes 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.289
 ability to define as a person is the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.840
 of the characteristics that make the 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.000
 So that's the way it is, no more can look 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.770
 to someone and point and say that that 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.960
 person like that because he is 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.180
 gay because he is black because he 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.180
 Asian because finally people do not give more 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.419
 I think it already arrived in the layout already I have 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:17.479
 already gave to the government and the police trying 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:23.430
 justify that it was not homophobia for a 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:24.659
 people know that it was and no one 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.300
 person with a minimum of discernment 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.340
 believes that it was homophobia that was 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:36.509
 prejudice and we know very well that 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:39.150
 so prejudice yes we know 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.219
 that sometimes to get past 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.099
 a stage of one of a 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.440
 sometimes only verbal or even physical 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:50.520
 that does not arrive in an environment like this 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:54.539
 then everything is a risk that we have and 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.250
 I'm very happy because we have 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.469
 some data also said that they are paulo 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.750
 in quantity it is the city that most 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.909
 there is also one of the cities that 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.550
 the more we fight against people we see people 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.190
 really assumed who they are and this is 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.990
 important, people will not be silent 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.020
 and you will not be afraid because of this 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.659
 I think this is the message is for a 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.250
 day like today in a theme like that already 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.250
