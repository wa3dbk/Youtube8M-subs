00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
this will float the water level will be

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.880 
this will float the water level will be
about<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:17.040> there<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.710> be

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
about right there and this will just be

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
about right there and this will just be
under<00:01:20.040> water<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.729> monster<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:22.040> it'll

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
