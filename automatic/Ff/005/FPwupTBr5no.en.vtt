00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.600
 Then do something at equal intervals 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:17.490
 It can not be avoided when making clay 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.820
 At equal intervals I will talk about training that sense 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.980
 a First 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:27.160
 Cream Sand Biscuit This is the one who failed 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:36.630
 If you say where is failing 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 To I side only after the side that is a place to hit the two points you have deviated become sparse 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:49.790
 After doing this, isn't it equally spaced? 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.579
 Have collapsed even biscuits in the form of the top and bottom of the child 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.560
 It is such a failure example 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:01.660
 Here is the cream sand biscuit I made 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:06.239
 Why is it this way? 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.239
 Sometimes make the cream sand biscuits 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.270
 Maako rim is also right towards the center 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.869
 It is also the case to go with Pyeong Pyeong Pyeong Pyeong Pyeong 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.869
 Surface 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.290
 It's so from going to stamp 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.340
 Those who are not good at it 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.970
 First of all the force I added 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.330
 I do not remember it 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.000
 Reset again and then 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.290
 When hitting 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.730
 We are all different and distinguished service 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:51.930
 This is when the first one was in any degree of force acceleration to it even able to remember also to the next Te 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:53.340
 Because the same kind of force acceleration a and equal interval and pop pom-pom is not Yara ride to the rhythm 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.420
 It is not good 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.690
 I'm thinking this way and being jealous 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:06.750
 So it becomes rather difficult 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.700
 Get in the rhythm with the first effort and one more important thing 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.789
 It's breathing 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.200
 of 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.859
 Hold your breath or one 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.549
 Or suck the breath of two first hit the point 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.549
 To breathe 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.230
 It's about adjusting to the gism when you are making this way 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.150
 I will introduce the practice method of those who are easy to make such mistakes next.
