 document management nowadays is based on 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 some solid principles that are 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.030
 based on the experience of centuries in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.539
 the management of paper documents 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.830

 indisputable as is the increase in 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.470
 efficiency and effectiveness as well as 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.340
 possibility of making profitable the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.110
 investments in technology also be able 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.030
 have an important tool for the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:01.530
 disaster but also be able to have some 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:05.159
 tools and defenses and tests 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 in litigation cases and is and also a 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.110
 very important thing that is the encouragement 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.340
 of the knowledge of organizations 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.330
 that is achieved when you get 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.430
 and share information 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.400
 for documentary management aenor has 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.360
 published a series of standards 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.580
 that are the result of a 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.310
 consensus and they are great 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.690
 tools to be able to implement this

 30,300 management systems for 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.590

 and continuous improvement making them 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.220
 fully compatible with other standards 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.280
 well-known management systems 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.040
 like the iso 9000 of quality the iso 14000 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.450
 of environment or the iso 27000 of 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.030
 security of the information 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.030
 In addition to these systems standards 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.090
 management there are other standards and reports 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.040
 technicians that are intended for 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.709
 responsible for the implementation of that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.230
 document management and that whose header 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.930
 is the norm 15 489 that is called management 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.530
 of documents but that has as 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.410
 derived another set of rules 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.030
 based on digitization in the 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.730
 conversion and migration processes 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.950
 electronic documents in the metadata 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.750
 for document management and others 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.010
 many topics related to good
