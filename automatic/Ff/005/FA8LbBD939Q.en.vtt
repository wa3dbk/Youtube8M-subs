00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
doing them as soon as possible so start

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.200 
doing them as soon as possible so start
off<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> handling<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.880> panther

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
off with the handling with the panther

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.460 
off with the handling with the panther
as<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.689> already<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.199> pretty<00:00:31.349> small

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
as we know already it's a pretty small

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.470 
as we know already it's a pretty small
car<00:00:31.800> understeers<00:00:32.640> quite<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> bit<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> high

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
car understeers quite a bit of high

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.200 
car understeers quite a bit of high
speed<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.890> you'd<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.160> brake<00:00:35.730> quite<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> bit

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
speed so you'd have to brake quite a bit

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.630 
speed so you'd have to brake quite a bit
when<00:00:36.510> taking<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> corner<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:38.250> course<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
when taking a corner and of course the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
when taking a corner and of course the
little<00:00:38.760> bit<00:00:38.910> bombs<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.329> marches<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.750> taking

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
little bit bombs and marches when taking

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.750 
little bit bombs and marches when taking
air<00:00:40.230> time<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.219> make<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.550> car

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
air time it's gonna make your car

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.069 
air time it's gonna make your car
oversteers<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.629> pretty<00:00:42.840> difficult

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
oversteers so it's pretty difficult

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.740 
oversteers so it's pretty difficult
those<00:00:43.730> sort<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> corners<00:00:45.210> where<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.570> really

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
those sort of corners where you really

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.869 
those sort of corners where you really
need<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.960> turn<00:00:46.110> consecutively<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.980> point<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
need to turn consecutively so point is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.729 
need to turn consecutively so point is
the<00:00:48.180> police<00:00:48.329> star<00:00:48.660> obviously<00:00:49.230> when<00:00:49.320> compared

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the police star obviously when compared

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.990 
the police star obviously when compared
to<00:00:49.770> panzer<00:00:50.129> ii<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> blister<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> blister<00:00:50.940> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to panzer ii the blister the blister is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
to panzer ii the blister the blister is
gonna<00:00:51.149> dominate<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.690> corners<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.260> mean<00:00:52.620> it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
gonna dominate the corners I mean it's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.900 
gonna dominate the corners I mean it's
got<00:00:52.890> better<00:00:52.980> handling<00:00:53.370> him<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.579> those<00:00:53.670> front

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
got better handling him at those front

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.580 
got better handling him at those front
wheel<00:00:54.030> drive<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> perfect<00:00:55.050> element

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
wheel drive it's got the perfect element

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
wheel drive it's got the perfect element
and<00:00:55.680> balance<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.670> understand<00:00:57.510> over

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and balance would the understand over

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.959 
and balance would the understand over
steering<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.559> quite<00:00:58.800> smooth<00:00:59.670> around

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
steering it's quite smooth around

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
steering it's quite smooth around
corners<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> efficiency<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:01.680> up

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
corners so the efficiency is really up

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.299 
corners so the efficiency is really up
there<00:01:02.039> taking<00:01:02.309> corners<00:01:02.870> perfectly<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.979> it's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
there taking corners perfectly and it's

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.859 
there taking corners perfectly and it's
got<00:01:05.400> amazing<00:01:05.519> balance<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.540> definitely

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
got amazing balance to it so definitely

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.149 
got amazing balance to it so definitely
a<00:01:06.930> point<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> us<00:01:07.320> bliss<00:01:07.619> there<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:07.979> handling

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
a point to us bliss there for handling

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
a point to us bliss there for handling
but<00:01:08.369> top<00:01:08.520> speeds<00:01:08.760> interesting<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.360> always<00:01:09.510> one

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
but top speeds interesting as always one

comparisons<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:11.790> expect<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
comparisons you don't really expect to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.630 
comparisons you don't really expect to
what<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.810> expect<00:01:13.200> especially<00:01:14.070> when<00:01:14.250> comparing

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
what to expect especially when comparing

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
what to expect especially when comparing
cars<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:15.810> similar<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.229> each<00:01:16.259> other

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
cars are very similar to each other

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.590 
cars are very similar to each other
especially<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.100> top<00:01:17.220> speed<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:18.090> new<00:01:18.299> cars

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
especially for top speed with new cars

especially for top speed with new cars
with<00:01:18.780> DLCs<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> pants<00:01:20.490> are

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
with DLCs you see here the pants are

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.910 
with DLCs you see here the pants are
pretty<00:01:20.640> much<00:01:20.820> accelerate<00:01:21.330> them<00:01:21.479> goes<00:01:21.810> off<00:01:22.049> but

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
pretty much accelerate them goes off but

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
pretty much accelerate them goes off but
you'll<00:01:23.070> notice<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> blisters<00:01:23.939> slowly

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you'll notice that the blisters slowly

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.410 
you'll notice that the blisters slowly
creeping<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.259> towards<00:01:25.700> Lepanto<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.210> one

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
creeping up towards Lepanto but one

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.819 
creeping up towards Lepanto but one
thing<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.659> noticed<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.080> took<00:01:28.470> quite<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
thing I noticed is that took quite a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.940 
thing I noticed is that took quite a
while<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.759> fact<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.390> pop<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.680> don't<00:01:31.890> know

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
while in fact if we pop and I don't know

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.469 
while in fact if we pop and I don't know
I<00:01:31.979> suppose<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> expecting<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I suppose I was kind of expecting it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.670 
I suppose I was kind of expecting it
because<00:01:33.540> blister<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.079> quite<00:01:34.320> dominant

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
because blister was quite dominant

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.950 
because blister was quite dominant
within<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.130> class<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.329> you'll<00:01:36.509> notice<00:01:36.750> how

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
within this class but you'll notice how

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
within this class but you'll notice how
long<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> takes<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> creep<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.390> go

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
long it takes to creep up here we go

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
long it takes to creep up here we go
past<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> finish<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.340> long

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
past the finish here on this long

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.090 
past the finish here on this long
straight<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.390> eventually<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
straight you know eventually you see you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
straight you know eventually you see you
know<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> Bliss<00:01:44.670> starts<00:01:45.030> creeping<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
know the Bliss starts creeping up and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
know the Bliss starts creeping up and
eventually<00:01:47.509> overtaking<00:01:48.509> here<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
eventually overtaking here so there you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
eventually overtaking here so there you
have<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.750> wouldn't<00:01:52.439> say<00:01:52.590> well

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
have it you know I wouldn't say well

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.609 
have it you know I wouldn't say well
we've<00:01:52.829> been<00:01:52.920> official<00:01:53.399> win<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> race<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
we've been official win a race do you

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.260 
we've been official win a race do you
have<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> blister<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.820> covered<00:01:57.119> this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
have the blister it's covered this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.389 
have the blister it's covered this
distance<00:01:57.719> unless<00:01:57.990> you're<00:01:58.170> doing<00:01:58.469> long<00:01:59.130> haul

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
distance unless you're doing long haul

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.100 
distance unless you're doing long haul
obviously<00:01:59.820> you'll<00:01:59.909> benefit<00:02:00.299> from<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.810> but

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
obviously you'll benefit from that but

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.719 
obviously you'll benefit from that but
other<00:02:01.290> than<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> panto<00:02:02.009> pretty<00:02:02.250> much<00:02:02.399> with

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
other than that panto pretty much with

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.219 
other than that panto pretty much with
them<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.090> seems<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.719> at<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.020> moment

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
them and it seems like at this moment

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.840 
them and it seems like at this moment
and<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> normal<00:02:04.710> track<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.340> we'll<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.610> how<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and a normal track but we'll see how it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.089 
and a normal track but we'll see how it
goes<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.899> yet<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.890> you're

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
goes we don't know yet but you're

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.400 
goes we don't know yet but you're
definitely<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.489> top<00:02:08.700> speed<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.270> towards<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
definitely a top speed going towards the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.260 
definitely a top speed going towards the

blister given at the second

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.160 
blister given at the second
point<00:02:12.480> they're<00:02:13.040> sort<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.190> braking<00:02:14.580> test

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
here fourth gear for the blister now you

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.450 
here fourth gear for the blister now you
see<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> best<00:02:25.560> acceleration<00:02:26.100> as<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.310> know

the<00:02:26.940> pantone<00:02:27.300> much<00:02:27.630> dominates<00:02:28.050> here<00:02:28.290> making

the pantone much dominates here making

the pantone much dominates here making
that<00:02:29.010> three<00:02:29.310> one<00:02:29.550> total<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.540> obviously<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
that three one total and obviously the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.650 
that three one total and obviously the
best<00:02:31.290> customizable<00:02:32.040> options<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
best customizable options we know it the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.720 
best customizable options we know it the
panto<00:02:34.140> dominates<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> scene<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.190> course<00:02:35.370> even

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
panto dominates the scene of course even

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.100 
panto dominates the scene of course even
though<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.940> blister<00:02:36.270> does<00:02:36.420> have<00:02:36.600> somewhat

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
though the blister does have somewhat

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.050 
though the blister does have somewhat
decent<00:02:37.380> customizable<00:02:38.220> options<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:38.910> to

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
decent customizable options but not to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.240 
decent customizable options but not to
the<00:02:39.180> extent<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:39.630> there's<00:02:39.780> variety<00:02:39.960> as<00:02:40.650> we

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the extent but there's variety as we

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.730 
the extent but there's variety as we
have<00:02:41.520> here<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> panto<00:02:42.960> so<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.590> will

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
have here for the panto so that will

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.270 
have here for the panto so that will
make<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.160> 3-2<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.940> believe<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.410> here<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.830> go<00:02:47.010> got

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
make it 3-2 I believe so here you go got

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.080 
make it 3-2 I believe so here you go got
a<00:02:47.310> bunch<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.700> sticky<00:02:47.940> bombs<00:02:48.150> isn't<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.570> blob

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
a bunch of sticky bombs isn't that blob

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.240 
a bunch of sticky bombs isn't that blob
I<00:02:51.090> thought<00:02:51.510> obviously<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.260> particular

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
I thought obviously for this particular

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.370 
I thought obviously for this particular
section<00:02:53.520> here<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> blister<00:02:54.960> so<00:02:55.170> nice

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
section here but the blister so nice

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.960 
section here but the blister so nice
heard<00:02:55.590> custom<00:02:56.040> skirts<00:02:56.310> what<00:02:56.550> no<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.820> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
heard custom skirts what no this and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.240 
heard custom skirts what no this and
that<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.270> oh<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.960> day<00:02:58.140> banter<00:02:59.130> would

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
that but oh the day banter would

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.000 
that but oh the day banter would
dominate<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.640> scene<00:02:59.910> brothers<00:03:00.240> now<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
dominate the scene brothers now for a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.730 
dominate the scene brothers now for a
lap<00:03:02.010> time<00:03:02.280> test<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:04.140> was<00:03:04.350> interesting

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
lap time test this was interesting

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.890 
lap time test this was interesting
obviously<00:03:05.370> you'd<00:03:05.520> expect<00:03:05.970> well<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
obviously you'd expect well the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.020 
obviously you'd expect well the
acceleration<00:03:07.110> around<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.800> corner<00:03:08.040> pants

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
acceleration around that corner pants

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.490 
acceleration around that corner pants
had<00:03:09.120> taken<00:03:09.360> off<00:03:09.630> but<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.080> obviously<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
had taken off but then obviously the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.560 
had taken off but then obviously the
blister<00:03:10.800> was<00:03:10.920> slowly<00:03:11.130> creep<00:03:11.520> up<00:03:11.760> as<00:03:11.970> we've

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
blister was slowly creep up as we've

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.920 
blister was slowly creep up as we've
seen<00:03:12.780> from<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:14.610> test<00:03:14.910> on<00:03:15.210> top<00:03:15.390> speed<00:03:15.660> test

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
seen from the the test on top speed test

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.560 
seen from the the test on top speed test
but<00:03:16.770> we<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.790> handling<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.330> better

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
but we know that the handling is better

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.260 
but we know that the handling is better
for<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.990> blister<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.340> technically<00:03:20.820> taking

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
for the blister so technically taking

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.270 
for the blister so technically taking
these<00:03:21.390> corners<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.560> blisters<00:03:22.980> should<00:03:23.160> be

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
these corners the blisters should be

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.190 
these corners the blisters should be
doing<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.670> comfortably<00:03:23.850> were<00:03:24.660> these<00:03:24.870> which

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
doing it comfortably were these which

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.430 
doing it comfortably were these which
was<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> case<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.150> notice<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.690> it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
was the case now you notice that it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.280 
was the case now you notice that it
seems<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.750> Panzer<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.780> dominating

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
seems like the the Panzer is dominating

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.810 
seems like the the Panzer is dominating
here<00:03:31.350> they<00:03:31.680> are<00:03:31.770> steel<00:03:31.980> pretty<00:03:32.250> square<00:03:32.520> pretty

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
here they are steel pretty square pretty

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.640 
here they are steel pretty square pretty
tight<00:03:33.000> right<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:34.050> see<00:03:34.260> they're<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> little

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
tight right now you see they're a little

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.620 
tight right now you see they're a little
bit<00:03:34.800> over<00:03:35.070> steer<00:03:35.370> with<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:35.970> Panzer<00:03:36.450> just

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
bit over steer with the Panzer just

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.180 
bit over steer with the Panzer just
because<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.170> little<00:03:37.440> bump<00:03:37.740> there<00:03:37.950> little

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
because of the little bump there little

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.030 
because of the little bump there little
notch<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.880> little<00:03:39.450> bit<00:03:39.540> airtime<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.110> that's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
notch a little bit airtime so that's

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.760 
notch a little bit airtime so that's
expected<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.200> course<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.530> little<00:03:43.680> bit

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
expected and of course a little bit

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.500 
expected and of course a little bit
understeer<00:03:44.220> there<00:03:44.430> which<00:03:44.580> caused<00:03:44.820> me<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.150> an

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
understeer there which caused me to an

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.150 
understeer there which caused me to an
oversteer<00:03:46.200> wish<00:03:46.350> because<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.709> went<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
oversteer wish because I went on the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.280 
oversteer wish because I went on the
dirt<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:48.180> noticed<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.600> one<00:03:48.840> thing<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:49.080> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
dirt you noticed that one thing that the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.380 
dirt you noticed that one thing that the
panther<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.680> not<00:03:49.800> beneficial<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.120> dirt

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
panther is not beneficial on the dirt

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.170 
panther is not beneficial on the dirt
when<00:03:51.990> you<00:03:52.110> take<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.530> corner<00:03:52.890> because<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
when you take in a corner because of the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.440 
when you take in a corner because of the
poor<00:03:54.390> traction<00:03:54.920> under<00:03:55.920> okay<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.209> road

poor traction under okay to the road

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.330 
poor traction under okay to the road
there's<00:03:57.780> quite<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.990> weight<00:03:58.260> because<00:03:58.650> under

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
there's quite a weight because under

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.570 
there's quite a weight because under
stairs<00:03:59.580> hell<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.910> lot<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.510> road<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.620> then<00:04:02.459> as

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
stairs hell of a lot on road and then as

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.699 
stairs hell of a lot on road and then as
soon<00:04:02.730> as<00:04:02.850> he<00:04:02.970> hit<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.209> dirt<00:04:03.660> bang<00:04:04.350> he<00:04:04.500> gone

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
soon as he hit the dirt bang he gone

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.699 
soon as he hit the dirt bang he gone
dust<00:04:04.920> because<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.910> car<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.330> small<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.200> you'd

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
dust because the car it's small so you'd

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.760 
dust because the car it's small so you'd
expect<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:09.110> you<00:04:10.110> really<00:04:10.320> see<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.590> really

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
expect that you really see is really

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.500 
expect that you really see is really
struggling<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.370> take<00:04:11.520> consecutive<00:04:12.180> corners

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
struggling to take consecutive corners

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.610 
struggling to take consecutive corners
that's<00:04:12.600> one<00:04:12.780> thing<00:04:12.959> you'll<00:04:13.110> notice<00:04:13.230> as<00:04:13.470> well

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that's one thing you'll notice as well

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.449 
that's one thing you'll notice as well
with<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:13.890> panto

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
with the panto

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.640 
with the panto
and<00:04:14.910> how<00:04:15.060> smooth<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.660> blisters<00:04:16.080> just<00:04:16.350> taking

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
and how smooth the blisters just taking

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.320 
and how smooth the blisters just taking
these<00:04:16.739> corners<00:04:17.130> with<00:04:17.250> ease<00:04:17.459> around<00:04:18.030> this

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
these corners with ease around this

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.420 
these corners with ease around this
track<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:19.380> that's<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.620> huge<00:04:19.770> difference<00:04:19.890> you'll

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
track so that's a huge difference you'll

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.490 
track so that's a huge difference you'll
notice<00:04:20.700> here<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.000> already<00:04:21.299> see<00:04:21.510> that<00:04:21.720> good

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
notice here you already see that good

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.260 
notice here you already see that good
seconds<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.890> corners<00:04:23.160> are<00:04:23.280> beautifully

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
seconds of corners are beautifully

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.460 
seconds of corners are beautifully
executed<00:04:24.450> especially<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.140> second<00:04:25.440> half

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
executed especially in the second half

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.860 
executed especially in the second half
of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.170 
of
this<00:04:25.960> track<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.590> see<00:04:27.400> how<00:04:27.699> well<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.150> can

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
this track you see how well you can

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.379 
this track you see how well you can
solve<00:04:28.800> see<00:04:29.800> how<00:04:30.220> well<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.610> blisters<00:04:31.030> doing

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
solve see how well the blisters doing

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.840 
solve see how well the blisters doing
the<00:04:31.780> taking<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.530> X<00:04:32.710> consecutive<00:04:33.370> corners<00:04:33.699> one

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
the taking is X consecutive corners one

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.060 
the taking is X consecutive corners one
after<00:04:34.150> each<00:04:34.180> other<00:04:34.449> pretty<00:04:35.410> much<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.949> know

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
after each other pretty much you know

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.120 
after each other pretty much you know
this<00:04:36.639> is<00:04:36.729> what<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:36.970> expect<00:04:37.470> but<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.530> panto<00:04:38.889> can

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
this is what you expect but a panto can

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.890 
this is what you expect but a panto can
easily<00:04:39.400> squeeze<00:04:39.669> for<00:04:39.910> tight<00:04:40.120> gaps<00:04:40.360> which<00:04:40.720> is

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
easily squeeze for tight gaps which is

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.510 
easily squeeze for tight gaps which is
the<00:04:40.990> only<00:04:41.139> advantage<00:04:41.500> boy<00:04:41.889> it's<00:04:42.190> not<00:04:42.280> that

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
the only advantage boy it's not that

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.030 
the only advantage boy it's not that
beneficial<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.180> proper<00:04:43.510> track<00:04:43.750> really<00:04:44.110> so

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
beneficial in a proper track really so

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
you'd expect the blister to pretty much

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.680 
you'd expect the blister to pretty much
winter<00:04:57.580> which<00:04:57.699> seems<00:04:58.030> like<00:04:58.210> it's<00:04:58.419> gonna<00:04:58.510> be
