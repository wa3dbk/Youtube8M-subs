00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.740
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.350
 mister maym in this issue i will show you 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.240
 New Seeds I Dug Up From 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.430
 the internet 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:19.810
 let's start see form here look 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.630
 this sit here goes everywhere almost ice almost 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.710
 here there is such a piece of land 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.440
 how would the trees here mine no I 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.880
 looked or is there still such here 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 so goran and there at the very top there 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:44.010
 the trees and here too ride and well in general 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.950
 here are still a bill and pretty 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:55.719
 in principle, sit quite good to me 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:01:01.690
 like now everything is overflying 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:07.329
 looked here too 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:10.079
 the sea is yes and so here's the line 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.079
 he loves 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.180
 let's move on to the next one under 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.080
 called sky this led is the best 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.910
 I think he is very strong to me 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.850
 liked it because here u over there 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.850
 such beautiful biomes in general to me he is so 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.520
 ticked hard 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:44.050
 also soaring mountains all sorts of different here 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.050
 still have such viola 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.130
 Well, here as if the decor separates 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:02:01.160
 probably winter winter and summer here too vodka 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:05.600
 is there winter here years and also here 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.380
 all ice is present too snow sand 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.820
 grass 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:15.700
 Christmas trees are all you need to survive 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:20.209
 In general, the next sip is called count 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.480
 This seed is basically not beautiful 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.260
 It is considered according to the resources 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.920
 to dig deep into the sea you are there 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.150
 You can find a lot of coal and I already 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.720
 played in survival mode in it and there 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.750
 however much coal was also here 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.640
 good is not very smooth Musashi 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.739
 the area is so pretty 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.320
 also there are trees here too 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.010
 biomes are looking for such a mountain like this 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.470
 clear and beautiful at all 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:06.100
 also, in principle, a good network for 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.100
 survival fits right now 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.410
 by the way when I fell asleep I fell asleep 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:20.340
 Here in this place and I built by the way here 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:25.799
 this place is your house here as well 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.799
 some three or how many trees there 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.500
 the basement 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:40.209
 two trees on the sand are also present 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:43.989
 such that not small in general 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:52.750
 move on to the next force and this type 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:58.629
 called pakman take a look here too 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.540
 biomes mostly also sit if you play 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.030
 in creative mode you can judge everything 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 trees and here you can, in principle, not bad 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.920
 build a city but next sit me 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.250
 seems better than this one there more 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.289
 flat surface or this one here 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.169
 Here, too, see here from there yet 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:26.380
 cool you can build a house or rather the house 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.450
 in principle, it is suitable for survival 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.300
 it's not easy for friends to talk about 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.250
 whirl 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:40.060
 sitting beautifully there are three trees growing 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.400
 there are also angle coal diamonds too 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.430
 climb if you by the way this mountain 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.340
 Yeah from the dig, I also played in the mode 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.120
 survival and there is this mountain 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.340
 dug and here gum set here 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.120
 dug there in principle not bad there 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.169
 gold is there and iron is coal there too 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.180
 but its not very much let's come to 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.169
 the next sine this sits last 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.169
 call it porsche 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.470
 See this one here. 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.310
 completely for the construction of the city daredevil 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.850
 he is quite good in principle also 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.730
 are present 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.400
 such a thing I donâ€™t know the island 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.880
 I do not know this so they write even 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.260
 surface large biomes principle 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.790
 not bad 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:42.880
 probably in second place after sky a 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:48.280
 and here, too, there is snow snow 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:50.530
 the mountain is so big and here it is no longer 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.790
 very flat terrain in principle 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:58.630
 good by the way this is perhaps something 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.860
 was but here also here here if you 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:06.090
 play a lot of survival mode 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.090
 will mages spawn 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:18.250
 but right now let's flyby I'll show you all 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:21.610
 I think that's the highest point of this sedan 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:24.400
 it doesn't seem like this is that almost on 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:32.620
 cloud level there do not know blocks 10 to 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:36.070
 clouds or all somewhere in the area in 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.130
 Basically cool sit me enough 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.100
 I liked this place of wings 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.380
 also funny here it is possible 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.230
 build such a house if you want 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.690
 build away from everyone if you 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:57.670
 create this trick then purity is strange 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:59.950
 why he keeps here fell if you 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.370
 want to build a house for someone 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.950
 server in this sit then advise you here 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.080
 this place to build a house because but i 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:12.460
 ask admin to build there somewhere 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:17.110
 the very day there will build your city 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:20.470
 if you want to make a bargain 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.900
 house there hack a secret to break 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.820
 there undermine immediately build here 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.860
 because in principle, safe is 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.310
 place so here 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:37.450
 resource he is 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:40.000
 there is also something in general our bronchitis 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.620
 came to the end with you was mr coins
