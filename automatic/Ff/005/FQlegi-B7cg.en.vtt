00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
here now the back of these numbers they

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.890 
here now the back of these numbers they
did<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> little<00:00:09.090> bit<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.210> sticky<00:00:09.540> stuff<00:00:09.750> on

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.140 
did have a little bit of sticky stuff on
them<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.050> help<00:00:10.200> keep<00:00:10.320> them<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.559> place<00:00:10.969> but<00:00:11.969> when

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
them to help keep them in place but when

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.610 
them to help keep them in place but when
you<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> piece<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:12.990> that's<00:00:13.410> not

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
you have a piece like this that's not

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.189 
you have a piece like this that's not
perfectly<00:00:14.099> round<00:00:14.389> what<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> used<00:00:15.719> was<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
perfectly round what I used was as a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.170 
perfectly round what I used was as a
guide<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.980> these<00:00:17.070> rings<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:18.060> are

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
guide with some of these rings that are

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.779 
guide with some of these rings that are
on<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.990> wood<00:00:19.140> itself<00:00:19.640> because<00:00:20.640> they're

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
on the the wood itself because they're

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.609 
on the the wood itself because they're
genuinely<00:00:21.119> pretty<00:00:21.779> close<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.080> being<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.289> circle

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
genuinely pretty close to being a circle

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.890 
genuinely pretty close to being a circle
so<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> tried<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.580> same<00:00:23.789> ring<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.539> put

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
so I tried to use the same ring to put

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.250 
so I tried to use the same ring to put
my<00:00:25.019> numbers<00:00:25.289> around<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.750> now<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.140> my

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
my numbers around and now that I have my

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.339 
my numbers around and now that I have my
numbers<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:29.090> I'm<00:00:30.090> gonna<00:00:30.240> take<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> my<00:00:31.109> little

going to dab some polyurethane on each
one<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> those<00:00:43.920> numbers<00:00:47.329> trying<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
one of those numbers trying to get a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.970 
one of those numbers trying to get a
better<00:00:48.809> camera<00:00:49.079> shot<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:51.590> dab<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.890> this

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
polyurethane on each one of those

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.340 
polyurethane on each one of those
numbers<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.020> set<00:00:55.260> them

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.710 

and<00:01:04.129> I<00:01:04.190> want<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.370> do<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.580> real<00:01:04.820> easy<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.690> I

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
and I want to do it real easy so that I

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:25.469 
and I want to do it real easy so that I
don't<00:01:05.870> move<00:01:06.110> any<00:01:06.409> of<00:01:06.560> them

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.370 

and<00:01:26.110> once<00:01:26.289> this<00:01:26.409> polyurethane<00:01:27.130> sets<00:01:27.549> up<00:01:28.380> then

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
and once this polyurethane sets up then

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.649 
and once this polyurethane sets up then
those<00:01:29.530> numbers<00:01:29.740> should<00:01:30.100> be<00:01:30.130> set<00:01:30.579> on<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
those numbers should be set on there and

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.569 
those numbers should be set on there and
then<00:01:35.350> what<00:01:35.500> I'll<00:01:35.590> do<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.740> I'll<00:01:35.979> go<00:01:36.100> ahead<00:01:36.130> and

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
then what I'll do is I'll go ahead and

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:44.249 
then what I'll do is I'll go ahead and
polyurethane<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.759> entire<00:01:40.060> piece<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:44.110> it

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
polyurethane the entire piece but as it

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
polyurethane the entire piece but as it
stands<00:01:44.470> right<00:01:44.619> now<00:01:44.679> I<00:01:45.069> just<00:01:45.280> want<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:47.649> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
stands right now I just want to get that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.200 
stands right now I just want to get that
get<00:01:49.149> those<00:01:49.329> numbers<00:01:49.750> set<00:01:50.530> onto<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.399> wood<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
get those numbers set onto the wood so

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.109 
get those numbers set onto the wood so
that<00:01:55.240> they're<00:01:55.450> not<00:01:55.509> moving<00:01:55.689> around<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:58.030> we

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
that they're not moving around do we

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:06.460 
that they're not moving around do we
know<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.509> just<00:01:58.689> moved<00:01:58.899> around

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.639 

so<00:02:07.470> there<00:02:07.620> we<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.770> we'll<00:02:08.280> let<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:08.610> set<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.649> let

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so there we go we'll let this set up let

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.860 
so there we go we'll let this set up let
it<00:02:10.679> dry

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
it dry

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.640 
it dry
it's<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:15.830> fast-drying<00:02:16.830> polyurethane<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:19.350> that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
it's a fast-drying polyurethane so that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's a fast-drying polyurethane so that
should<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.170> couple<00:02:22.440> hours

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
should be here in a in a couple hours

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.320 
should be here in a in a couple hours
this<00:02:22.920> should<00:02:23.070> be<00:02:23.190> good<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:23.970> setup<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.980> can

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
this should be good and setup and we can

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.750 
this should be good and setup and we can
polyurethane<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.709> rest<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> top<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
polyurethane the rest of the top and the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.090 
polyurethane the rest of the top and the
face<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.330> outsides<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.500> then

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
face and the outsides and so on and then

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.370 
face and the outsides and so on and then
we'll<00:02:32.250> put<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.670> actual<00:02:33.209> clock<00:02:33.630> piece<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
we'll put the actual clock piece in and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.360 
we'll put the actual clock piece in and
get<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.830> going<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.170> finish<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
of polyurethane on it so I can get into

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.590 
of polyurethane on it so I can get into
the<00:02:54.840> camera<00:02:55.110> here<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:57.030> make<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.300> good<00:02:57.450> and
