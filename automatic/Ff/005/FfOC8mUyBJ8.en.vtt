 Hi, I'm Marina Garcia, we say 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.660
 mediterrani and swimmer of the federation 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.660
 Spanish 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
 after london I saw a great 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.190
 change already faced different things 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.460
 ways and workouts the way 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 think about facing and also in the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.010
 competitions is clear I'm more confident 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.320
 and that is a point in favor 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.280
 well I knew I was training well 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.570
 and well we are in a moment of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.370
 load training pretty high but 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.170
 good still and I think I could compete 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.210
 well and I think he has taken advantage of it 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.020
 maximum and so it has been good at the beginning 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 I felt a little nervous 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.450
 the nerves of rookie and now it is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 different I think the story better these 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.969
 nerves are also good and now I know 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.369
 control them and that's also a 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.659
 another point in favor that helps me 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.460
 time to compete man because very 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.119
 gratifying very 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.920
 look back and I think I'm 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.290
 progressing and that I still have much more 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.860
 So a lot of way ahead I'm still 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.220
 young so for now all perfect 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.650
 that if you really like swimming and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.540
 and you want to sacrifice yourself for it you enjoy 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.160
 swimming because all the challenges are 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.990
 possible that everything you propose 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.000
 you can get it man now 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.620
 same we have achieved those four 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.820
 medals in European of the moment begins 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.590
 well the season with young people 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.780
 that has made good brands very good 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.560
 marks in arriving in the mornings and 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.880
 trying to qualify for the semis and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.310
 end of a European that you are very much 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.100
 nothing I see with a lot of future the truth 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.680
 well I think that just started now 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.900
 we are in principle and of 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.840
 moment very well is a very exploration 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.330
 long and I really want to train 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.060
 I have that motivation to make it at home 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.060
 and that always helps a very valuation 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.800
 positive after all the work I 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.830
 done so far that as I said 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.710
 before we are in 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.020
 in a period of very high load for the 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.780
 worldwide and for the following objectives 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.790
 well then I find that it has been a 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 very rewarding competition and I'm very 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.100
 happy for having achieved these 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.840
 medals and that also helps me to continue 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.050
 and give me an extra motivation 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.140
 my life 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.760
 a sacrifice 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.760
 without the medal in river
