00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.959
 the major breakthrough among the three parts 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.420
 and games on the iphone has one 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.519
 successor received per m2 than exactly 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.590
 what you expect more and more 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 jump more guided and more coins 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.240
 pick it up but you don't always do that anymore 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
 on foot like dozens of clones 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 Cameroon copied and there wink 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.760
 temple from two o'clock to the competition 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.830
 just like i'm falling you have 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.350
 now own segments in my bowl trolleys 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 you regularly show up 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.710
 controls of brave and two you know 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 already before you start 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.430
 Cancer the iPhone to the right or left 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 to run and jump with a v up 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.899
 accompanied with it down and wipes 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.370
 horizontal to their coming next to him just 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 as in its predecessor does the game and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 again everything to those movements 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.870
 as quickly as possible after each other 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.850
 feed 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.610
 tree stumps tunnel just splits and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.290
 rules alternate at a rapid pace 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.510
 yet feels forward and 2 was a new one 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.950
 game is mainly because the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.170
 randomly devised areas because 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.160
 have become more elegant 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 always with a hill to go to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
 work and horses almost always bend 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.890
 the consequence is not only that you 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.859
 can automatically go up to the iPhone 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 but also that the game on you much better 

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:07.469
 can surprise 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.299
 you have to see that one just in time 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.899
 long bend after sliding under one 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.240
 fire 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.740
 also more followed by t-junction 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.209
 we are very high on that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.069
 get lost 

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:18.869
 of course you can re- collected 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.450
 spend coins in the game in the store 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.310
 with game where you have three extra characters 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.469
 can buy and for that again power-ups 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.319
 collected as debts or walls 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.060
 magnets most forces come however 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.039
 had sex as you dished 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.299
 mission in the game or one 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.890
 purchased the character 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.770
 new are the green diamonds that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.690
 were and cooper yes but I drive a while 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.030
 further and after you to death 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.520
 disturbed or tipped my TV 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.020
 carnage andreas older but the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.070
 initially something we dull colors 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.320
 found and brother 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.970
 two quickly get used to it 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.430
 sound not quite at the level of 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.080
 the competition is there one session starts 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.000
 with an absent drum on the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.860
 background the coins click where 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.420
 can pack less in the original and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.420
 put you or the fallen heads like that 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.970
 also comes out a bit from the is prima ties 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.880
 are also not ambar with variant acb 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.100
 servers epic sb or bit a test 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.310
 another flat overwhelmed m pro 2 luck 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.080
 great intensity of play 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.330
 one after another challenges pull level 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 known and orange beyond and even if you 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.350
 in the middle of a victory greeting by and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.190
 a highscore attempt can simply be over 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.769
 to be 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.130
 it's just running one thing up 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.130
 you drop
