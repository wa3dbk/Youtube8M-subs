00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
Arsenal be the team that their plan I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.710 
Arsenal be the team that their plan I
think<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> Scandinavian<00:01:50.729> him<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.570> we

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
think it's the Scandinavian him so we

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.130 
think it's the Scandinavian him so we
win<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.079> game<00:01:56.479> DeMaria<00:01:57.479> did<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> good

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140

win this game DeMaria did have a good
performance<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:58.890> he's<00:01:59.219> getting<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.520> bit

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
performance I think he's getting a bit

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.749 
performance I think he's getting a bit
over<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.119> later<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:01.350> against<00:02:01.860> Norwich<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> nor

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
over it later but against Norwich it nor

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
over it later but against Norwich it nor
does<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> arsenal<00:02:04.079> win<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> means<00:02:05.189> we

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
does and arsenal win so that means we

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.219 
does and arsenal win so that means we
got<00:02:05.549> drawn<00:02:05.820> second<00:02:06.240> place<00:02:06.420> which<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.020> was

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
delayed work because of the platform we

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.309 
delayed work because of the platform we
had<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.170> star<00:02:10.470> and
