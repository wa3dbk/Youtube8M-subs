00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 
so i just have a black North Face and

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.269 
so i just have a black North Face and
then<00:07:40.899> I<00:07:40.930> think<00:07:41.229> for<00:07:41.409> the<00:07:41.499> whole<00:07:41.680> tablet<00:07:42.099> that

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:42.279 
then I think for the whole tablet that

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:43.589 
then I think for the whole tablet that
should<00:07:42.430> be<00:07:42.520> black<00:07:42.729> so<00:07:42.999> I<00:07:43.029> just<00:07:43.240> paired<00:07:43.509> them
