of the modified 6x kernel that I'm using
to<00:00:10.559> get<00:00:11.030> pae<00:00:12.030> support<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.780> windows<00:00:13.110> 7<00:00:13.500> 32<00:00:14.070> bit

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
to get pae support with windows 7 32 bit

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.460 
to get pae support with windows 7 32 bit
i'll<00:00:15.690> load<00:00:16.080> windows<00:00:16.320> here<00:00:20.779> all<00:00:21.779> right<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.230> as
