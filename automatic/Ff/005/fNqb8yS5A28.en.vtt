things up we have a couple of minor
tweaks<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.650> windows<00:02:44.040> store<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.640> this

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
tweaks to do windows store in this

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.330 
tweaks to do windows store in this
particular<00:02:45.090> build<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.840> windows<00:02:45.870> 10<00:02:46.590> now

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
particular build of windows 10 now

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.310 
particular build of windows 10 now
unlike<00:02:47.700> how<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.970> current<00:02:48.240> store<00:02:48.570> works<00:02:48.810> music

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
unlike how the current store works music

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.770 
unlike how the current store works music
and<00:02:49.560> film<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.160> TV<00:02:50.490> shows<00:02:50.850> were<00:02:51.060> also<00:02:51.300> included

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
and film and TV shows were also included

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.590

alongside<00:02:52.110> apps<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.040> games<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.480> could

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
alongside apps and games now this could

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.030 
alongside apps and games now this could
also<00:02:54.780> mean<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.140> Microsoft<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.770> kind<00:02:55.980> of

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
also mean that Microsoft is kind of

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.740 
also mean that Microsoft is kind of
working<00:02:56.190> towards<00:02:56.670> integrating<00:02:57.090> Xbox<00:02:57.600> music

of the u.s. of course as I said there is
a<00:03:40.590> rumor<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.760> wouldn't<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.150> surprised<00:03:42.660> if

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
a rumor but I wouldn't be surprised if

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.560 
a rumor but I wouldn't be surprised if
it<00:03:43.110> was<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.890> course<00:03:43.920> there's<00:03:44.820> also<00:03:45.030> rumors

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
it was and of course there's also rumors

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.780 
it was and of course there's also rumors
that<00:03:45.600> windows<00:03:46.230> 7<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.709> 8<00:03:47.010> adopters<00:03:47.519> might<00:03:47.670> even

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
that windows 7 and 8 adopters might even

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.280 
that windows 7 and 8 adopters might even
getting<00:03:48.120> themselves<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.630> nice<00:03:48.810> little<00:03:48.959> deal
