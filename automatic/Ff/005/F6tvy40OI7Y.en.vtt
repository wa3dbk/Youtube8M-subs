00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
really strong one maybe if you double it

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.840 
really strong one maybe if you double it
up<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.800> put<00:01:59.800> some<00:01:59.830> water<00:02:00.130> setting<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.729> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
up and put some water setting to the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
already inside of a fish tank you just

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.260 
already inside of a fish tank you just
take<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.369> out<00:02:06.580> like<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:06.759> all<00:02:06.970> right<00:02:07.090> there

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.330 
take it out like that all right there
you<00:02:07.300> just<00:02:07.509> take<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.810> out<00:02:07.929> put<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.739> inside<00:02:09.100> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
you just take it out put it inside the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.919 
you just take it out put it inside the
water<00:02:09.519> after<00:02:09.789> it's<00:02:10.060> set<00:02:10.209> for<00:02:10.420> at<00:02:10.479> least<00:02:10.720> you

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
water after it's set for at least you

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.140 
water after it's set for at least you
know<00:02:11.050> two<00:02:11.230> days<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.769> aerated<00:02:12.370> be<00:02:12.550> chlorinated

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
know two days and aerated be chlorinated

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.600 
know two days and aerated be chlorinated
you<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:13.900> also<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.470> could<00:02:14.620> do<00:02:14.769> that<00:02:14.950> by<00:02:15.190> making

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
you can also you could do that by making

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.330 
you can also you could do that by making
the<00:02:15.940> bacteria<00:02:16.540> regrow<00:02:17.319> again<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.100> water

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the bacteria regrow again in the water

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.070 
the bacteria regrow again in the water
which<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> good<00:02:19.030> bacteria<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.720> fish<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
which is a good bacteria for the fish to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.590 
which is a good bacteria for the fish to
live<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.830> free<00:02:21.430> ox<00:02:21.610> alot<00:02:21.910> OHS<00:02:22.030> they<00:02:22.209> liked<00:02:22.480> it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
live and free ox alot OHS they liked it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.660 
live and free ox alot OHS they liked it
too<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.080> these<00:02:23.410> are<00:02:23.620> all<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.130> ox<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.430> lot<00:02:24.580> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
too so these are all of the ox a lot of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.910 
too so these are all of the ox a lot of
