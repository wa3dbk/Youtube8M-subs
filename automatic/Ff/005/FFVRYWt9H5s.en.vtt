00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.090
 how about record friends how are a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.680
 pleasure to greet you here we walk to 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.030
 talk a little about a subject a 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.250
 slightly sinister football 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.279
 Mexican and already very trite is even 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.529
 boring that is what polished alan 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.290
 very talented young footballer with 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.470
 a possibly promising future not 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.940
 we know in our country or elsewhere 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.620
 that has a quarrel with tiger if you 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.840
 well you know there is a contract by 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.370
 medium according to the feline institution the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 player and his family say that it is not 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 true that the contract is over 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.309
 player who wants to go to europe a 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.440
 player who wants to try other honey is 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.519
 a footballer that I insist has talent 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.680
 that was in the world that 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.650
 practically had no chance to play 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.409
 but that we know anyway with 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.370
 great conditions has not triumphed 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.710
 categorically in Mexican football ni 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.019
 much less is complicated got more 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.879
 or less at some point in his career 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.589
 that the tuca ferretti a man who does not 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.960
 trust so much in young people could 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.370
 put it to play with the team that 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.979
 he plays in the university of new lion 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.579
 good the subject is someone is lying 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.860
 when there is an almost judgment when there is a 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.770
 litigation either of the two 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.140
 he must be lying and they took out the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.610
 tigers a contract as of wills 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.620
 that strictly does not mean that it is 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.450
 the contract that this boy signed on 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.480
 which says that he had not signed it that 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.010
 the signature is not yours in the contract of 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.680
 wills are not shown all 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.410
 paragraphs of the clauses so 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.630
 complete ie tigers I've already been this 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.370
 case to a completely public issue and 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.930
 then the media and 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.640
 everybody already got in and we got ourselves 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.400
 to see who is right or who is not 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.080
 according to our hypothesis, good here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.570
 It's just that there is a soccer player 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.770
 wants to leave but you have to say one thing 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.420
 which is tremendously clear and all the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.580
 the world must know when one is 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.560
 employee and you have a contract you have to 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.290
 fulfill it and if you do not have to negotiate to 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.899
 stop fulfilling it did not become a nor 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.100
 another outburst everything was a player 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.050
 He stopped training when they were 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.209
 waiting tigrett raised his hand and said 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.310
 there is validity in your contract 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.050
 the boy says no in the federation 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.390
 are trying to fix the issue and now 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.760
 they do not know what to do on one side tiger 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.530
 has a very important background of 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.470
 an apocryphal signature you remember 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.640
 the secretary condom and ct that even 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.230
 Any occasion 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.590
 and all important matches that 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.540
 they had to again on resume it 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.430
 they had to redo the games and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.990
 they had to fight again and in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.200
 where tigers and the agreements themselves 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.819
 results included a historical classic 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.830
 it is difficult for tigers in this situation 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.770
 you want to get so strong when 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.810
 He had an antecedent but we have to 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.150
 believe tigers we have to believe 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.590
 polished someone has to open his coat 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.420
 and say things like they are 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.880
 painfully here we always go 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.310
 cloaking always we put trash down 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.380
 of the carpet the mat that is filled and 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.810
 all over the world down quietly no 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.550
 say nothing is a pity that this guy is 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.400
 is cutting the race because 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.070
 let me say one thing surely if 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.410
 has got them harmed polished on the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.400
 Mexican soccer spent many years 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.709
 is that one day he wants to play again 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.180
 here for this from the covenants that 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.700
 they have between clubs 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.890
 the other is if tigers are being 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.560
 handicapped is in all its right of 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.630
 require the player to come and train 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.550
 what is it that is being asked of you? 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.710
 No- end novel 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.720
 it's a shame this guy is between 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.290
 I imagine that for its part it is a 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.300
 interesting player up there with a lot 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.880
 future because of how young he is and because of 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.990
 talent that I hope will be resolved 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.140
 but many will say polished raised his hand 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.330
 and it goes against the system is not bad hopefully 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.030
 that is right because if you do not 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.950
 consequences will be tremendously 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.040
 raised for your young career a strong 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.040
 hug 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.760
 to
