00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
is that in bamboo painting or in a lot

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.569 
is that in bamboo painting or in a lot
of<00:01:27.600> different<00:01:27.810> paintings<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.130> different

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
of different paintings we have different

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.270 
of different paintings we have different
elements<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> ornament<00:01:31.350> one

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
elements that we can use to ornament one

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.359 
elements that we can use to ornament one
of<00:01:32.460> them<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> plum<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:34.229> plum<00:01:34.560> technique

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
of them is the plum the plum technique

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.179 
of them is the plum the plum technique
and<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:36.390> create<00:01:36.689> pools<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.259> shadows<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:38.040> at

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and to create pools or shadows down at

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
and to create pools or shadows down at
the<00:01:38.280> base<00:01:39.020> one<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> things<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the base one of the things we can do is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.060 
the base one of the things we can do is
just<00:01:41.220> simply<00:01:41.549> lay<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.659> wet<00:01:42.840> brush<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.710> on

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
just simply lay the wet brush down on

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.179 
just simply lay the wet brush down on
the<00:01:45.000> base<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.049> painting<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the base of the painting and this

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
the base of the painting and this
creates<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.670> little<00:01:47.820> bit<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.270> feeling<00:01:48.659> that

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
creates a little bit of a feeling that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.639 
creates a little bit of a feeling that
we've<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.390> little<00:01:51.390> bit<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> shadow<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.560> at

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
we've got a little bit of shadow here at

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.130 
we've got a little bit of shadow here at
the<00:01:52.770> base<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.430> tree<00:01:53.840> another<00:01:54.840> thing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the base of the tree another thing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.810 
the base of the tree another thing
