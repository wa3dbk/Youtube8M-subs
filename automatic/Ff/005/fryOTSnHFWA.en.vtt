thing but it's just one of the
statistics<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.170> I'm<00:01:01.379> concerned<00:01:01.920> about<00:01:02.190> for

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
statistics that I'm concerned about for

no<00:01:02.550> reason<00:01:03.110> see<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.260> guy<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.619> bring<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
no reason see this guy here bring the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.560 
no reason see this guy here bring the
car<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:05.610> motion<00:01:05.939> sensor<00:01:06.240> I'd<00:01:06.360> highly

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
car with my motion sensor I'd highly

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
car with my motion sensor I'd highly
recommend<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.990> motion<00:01:07.260> sensor<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> equipment

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
recommend a motion sensor as a equipment

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
recommend a motion sensor as a equipment
because<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> mini<00:01:10.049> UAV<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.680> them<00:01:10.799> up

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because it's like a mini UAV on them up

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
because it's like a mini UAV on them up
and<00:01:11.220> everyone<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> similar<00:01:12.630> area<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.110> patrol
