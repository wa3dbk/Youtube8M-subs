00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
anticipation of this it seems like such

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.330 
anticipation of this it seems like such
a<00:04:42.060> good<00:04:42.330> idea<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.350> how<00:04:43.560> well<00:04:43.740> does<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:43.950> deliver

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
a good idea but how well does it deliver

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260 
okay oh my god so yeah the Tapatio
flavor<00:04:55.620> definitely<00:04:56.160> does<00:04:56.310> get<00:04:56.610> lost<00:04:56.820> in<00:04:57.120> there

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
flavor definitely does get lost in there

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.930 
flavor definitely does get lost in there
a<00:04:57.300> little<00:04:57.479> bit<00:04:57.830> um<00:05:00.380> debris<00:05:01.380> is<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:01.860> creamy<00:05:02.520> and

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
a little bit um debris is so creamy and

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.040 
a little bit um debris is so creamy and
rich<00:05:03.600> I<00:05:03.960> would<00:05:04.410> imagine<00:05:04.740> that's<00:05:05.160> part<00:05:05.550> of<00:05:05.669> it

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
rich I would imagine that's part of it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.810 
rich I would imagine that's part of it
but<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.710> still<00:05:07.830> does<00:05:08.190> come<00:05:08.430> through<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.669> little

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
but it still does come through a little

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.940 
but it still does come through a little
bit<00:05:09.060> but<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.330> corn<00:05:09.630> crunch<00:05:10.050> of<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.410> outside

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
bit but the corn crunch of the outside

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.780 
bit but the corn crunch of the outside
along<00:05:11.940> with<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:13.370> debris<00:05:14.370> which<00:05:14.580> has<00:05:14.760> a
