overall<00:05:31.529> articulation<00:05:32.529> it's<00:05:33.279> definitely<00:05:33.669> a

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
overall articulation it's definitely a

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.649 
overall articulation it's definitely a
10<00:05:34.469> availability<00:05:35.469> at<00:05:36.099> least<00:05:36.339> for<00:05:36.520> me<00:05:36.699> is<00:05:36.939> it<00:05:37.270> 10

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
10 availability at least for me is it 10

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.360 
10 availability at least for me is it 10
but<00:05:38.110> I<00:05:38.319> know<00:05:38.379> that<00:05:38.529> a<00:05:38.680> lot<00:05:38.740> of<00:05:38.889> people<00:05:39.009> out

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
but I know that a lot of people out

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.820 
but I know that a lot of people out
there<00:05:39.430> had<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.389> hard<00:05:40.689> time<00:05:40.749> finding<00:05:41.439> the<00:05:41.529> super

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
there had a hard time finding the super

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.879 
there had a hard time finding the super
scroll<00:05:42.129> so<00:05:42.960> probably<00:05:43.960> have<00:05:44.139> to<00:05:44.289> balance<00:05:44.650> it

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
scroll so probably have to balance it

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:54.420 
scroll so probably have to balance it
out<00:05:45.009> to<00:05:45.219> maybe<00:05:45.430> like<00:05:45.639> a<00:05:46.409> 7<00:05:47.409> and<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.979> detail<00:05:54.399> on

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
out to maybe like a 7 and the detail on

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.939 
out to maybe like a 7 and the detail on
him<00:05:54.759> is<00:05:54.879> pretty<00:05:55.059> nice<00:05:55.439> that's<00:05:56.439> definitely<00:05:56.710> a

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949
