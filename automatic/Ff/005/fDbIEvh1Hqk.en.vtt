just called Dodson's nude I think it's

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.350

really<00:02:39.010> pretty<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.459> like<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.610> frosty<00:02:40.120> pink

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360

color and I am super in love with it I
actually<00:02:43.120> use<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> recent<00:02:43.989> tutorial<00:02:44.410> which

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
actually use in a recent tutorial which

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.350 
actually use in a recent tutorial which
I<00:02:44.680> will<00:02:44.860> link<00:02:44.980> below<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:45.820> let's<00:02:46.090> take<00:02:46.239> this

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
I will link below but let's take this

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
I will link below but let's take this
one<00:02:46.510> off<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.690> try<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.140> Julianne<00:02:47.770> it's

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
one off and try this Julianne it's

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.949 
one off and try this Julianne it's
probably<00:02:48.640> my<00:02:48.790> favorite<00:02:49.030> because<00:02:49.360> it's<00:02:49.690> so

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
probably my favorite because it's so

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.310 
probably my favorite because it's so
pretty<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.950> one<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.220> number<00:02:51.430> six<00:02:51.820> twenty

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.229 

so<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.350> think<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:56.950> Julianne<00:02:57.520> one<00:02:57.850> is

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
so I think that this Julianne one is

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.870 
so I think that this Julianne one is
like<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.500> pretty<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.190> I'm<00:03:00.280> pretty<00:03:00.520> sure<00:03:00.700> this

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
like so pretty and I'm pretty sure this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.550 
like so pretty and I'm pretty sure this
is<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:01.480> will<00:03:01.630> matches<00:03:02.110> like<00:03:02.380> my

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
is the one that will matches like my

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.020 
is the one that will matches like my
skin<00:03:02.860> tone<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.130> best<00:03:03.310> because<00:03:03.489> Julianne

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
skin tone the best because Julianne

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.560 
skin tone the best because Julianne
Moore<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.480> crazy<00:03:05.320> pale<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.850> am<00:03:07.000> i<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.480> know

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
Moore is crazy pale and so am i I know

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.090 
Moore is crazy pale and so am i I know
sometimes<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.200> look<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.440> little<00:03:08.560> bit<00:03:08.770> darker<00:03:09.070> on

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
sometimes I look a little bit darker on

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.580 
sometimes I look a little bit darker on
screen<00:03:09.520> but<00:03:10.000> I'm<00:03:10.150> actually<00:03:10.390> incredibly<00:03:11.320> pale

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
screen but I'm actually incredibly pale

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.560 
screen but I'm actually incredibly pale
and<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.830> think<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.130> one<00:03:12.310> complements<00:03:12.880> my<00:03:13.000> look

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
and I think this one complements my look

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.550 
and I think this one complements my look
the<00:03:13.870> most<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:14.739> for<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.220> sake<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.600> my<00:03:16.600> darker

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
the most but for the sake of my darker

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.979 
the most but for the sake of my darker
skin<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:18.040> ladies<00:03:18.459> or<00:03:18.820> less<00:03:19.150> fair-skinned<00:03:19.840> I

it's so pretty and you can see that

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.010 
it's so pretty and you can see that
these<00:04:36.490> have<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.789> lot<00:04:37.090> of<00:04:37.120> color<00:04:37.419> payoff

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
these have a lot of color payoff

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.540 
these have a lot of color payoff
I<00:04:38.050> saw<00:04:38.440> people<00:04:38.770> complaining<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.280> they<00:04:39.490> were

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
I saw people complaining that they were

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.400 
I saw people complaining that they were
too<00:04:39.820> sheer<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.570> nude<00:04:40.780> or<00:04:40.960> whatever<00:04:41.199> but

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
too sheer to nude or whatever but

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.320 
too sheer to nude or whatever but
they're<00:04:41.919> not<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.520> think<00:04:42.580> they<00:04:42.880> have<00:04:43.030> plenty<00:04:43.210> of

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
they're not I think they have plenty of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.800 
they're not I think they have plenty of
color<00:04:43.570> payoff<00:04:43.780> down<00:04:44.440> says<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.460> most<00:04:45.820> sheer

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
color payoff down says is the most sheer

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.980 
color payoff down says is the most sheer
but<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.800> think<00:04:48.190> that's<00:04:48.340> kind<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.880> point<00:04:49.300> so

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
but I think that's kind of the point so

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.779 
but I think that's kind of the point so
if<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.740> don't<00:04:50.919> want<00:04:51.070> something<00:04:51.130> super<00:04:51.460> sheer

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
if you don't want something super sheer

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.610 
if you don't want something super sheer
baby<00:04:52.090> pink<00:04:52.360> frosty<00:04:52.840> looking<00:04:53.110> don't<00:04:53.350> get<00:04:53.470> that

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
baby pink frosty looking don't get that

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.170 
baby pink frosty looking don't get that
one<00:04:53.800> but<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.010> other<00:04:54.190> ones<00:04:54.430> definitely<00:04:54.699> come

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
one but the other ones definitely come

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.580 
one but the other ones definitely come
on<00:04:55.300> that's<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.720> lot<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:55.900> color<00:04:56.110> payoff<00:04:56.350> right

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
on that's a lot of color payoff right

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.650 
on that's a lot of color payoff right
there<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:56.949> then<00:04:57.340> we<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.910> Eva's<00:04:58.360> nude

which is number six ten so even nude I
didn't<00:05:05.169> think<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.680> was<00:05:05.830> going<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.039> like<00:05:06.280> it<00:05:06.490> but

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
didn't think I was going to like it but

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.850 
didn't think I was going to like it but
it's<00:05:06.850> actually<00:05:07.060> just<00:05:07.840> it's<00:05:08.139> gorgeous

it's actually just it's gorgeous

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.150 
it's actually just it's gorgeous
it's<00:05:08.979> perfect<00:05:09.460> for<00:05:09.580> like<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.470> darker<00:05:11.470> sort<00:05:11.949> of

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
it's perfect for like a darker sort of

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.550 
it's perfect for like a darker sort of
look<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.760> my<00:05:13.060> opinion<00:05:13.539> because<00:05:13.750> I'm<00:05:14.139> so<00:05:14.349> fair

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
look in my opinion because I'm so fair

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.650 
look in my opinion because I'm so fair
skinned<00:05:14.860> but<00:05:15.070> if<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.759> have<00:05:15.880> darker<00:05:16.240> skin<00:05:16.270> or

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
skinned but if you have darker skin or

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.930 
skinned but if you have darker skin or
more<00:05:16.810> olive<00:05:17.349> toned<00:05:17.800> skin<00:05:18.130> I<00:05:18.310> think<00:05:18.430> this<00:05:18.759> would

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
more olive toned skin I think this would
