00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
and so she's going to have to use all of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.240 
and so she's going to have to use all of
her<00:00:44.150> shoulders<00:00:44.690> instead<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.620> her<00:00:45.770> back<00:00:45.980> in

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
her shoulders instead of her back in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.340 
her shoulders instead of her back in
order<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.579> communicate<00:00:46.940> with<00:00:47.149> her<00:00:47.360> horse<00:00:47.570> if

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
order to communicate with her horse if

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.470 
order to communicate with her horse if
she<00:00:48.559> has<00:00:48.800> her<00:00:48.829> wrists<00:00:49.520> rolled<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:50.329> that

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
she has her wrists rolled so that

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.729 
she has her wrists rolled so that
they're<00:00:50.690> too<00:00:50.870> much<00:00:51.020> toward<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.469> ceiling

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
they're too much toward the ceiling

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.410 
they're too much toward the ceiling
toward<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.309> sky<00:00:52.520> with<00:00:52.760> their<00:00:52.850> fingernails

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
toward the sky with their fingernails

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.110 
toward the sky with their fingernails
then<00:00:54.079> that's<00:00:54.379> going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.680> also<00:00:54.920> influence<00:00:55.850> the

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
then that's going to also influence the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.299 
then that's going to also influence the
effectiveness<00:00:56.780> of<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.110> receipt<00:00:57.469> as<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.129> can

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
effectiveness of the receipt as you can

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.340 
effectiveness of the receipt as you can
see<00:00:58.579> it's<00:00:59.090> like<00:00:59.329> she<00:00:59.510> gets<00:00:59.660> stuck<00:01:00.020> in<00:01:00.260> her

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
see it's like she gets stuck in her

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.979 
see it's like she gets stuck in her
shoulders<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.579> what<00:01:01.789> we're<00:01:01.910> looking<00:01:01.940> for<00:01:02.270> is<00:01:02.690> a

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
shoulders so what we're looking for is a

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.139 
shoulders so what we're looking for is a
hand<00:01:03.410> position<00:01:03.920> where<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.610> thumbs<00:01:04.940> are

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
hand position where the thumbs are

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.779 
hand position where the thumbs are
pointed<00:01:05.630> toward<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.170> sky<00:01:06.410> but<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.009> nice<00:01:07.280> level

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
pointed toward the sky but a nice level

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.850 
pointed toward the sky but a nice level
very<00:01:08.210> nice<00:01:08.479> straight<00:01:08.869> line<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.440> you'll

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
about it you want to think about keeping

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.889 
about it you want to think about keeping
the<00:01:19.459> hand<00:01:19.729> alignment<00:01:20.209> and<00:01:20.330> pressing<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.810> little

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
the hand alignment and pressing a little

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.020 
the hand alignment and pressing a little
bit<00:01:21.050> forward<00:01:21.470> rather<00:01:22.099> than<00:01:22.280> cocking<00:01:22.910> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
bit forward rather than cocking the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.940 
bit forward rather than cocking the
wrist<00:01:23.240> that's<00:01:23.899> going<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.200> cause<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.410> problem<00:01:24.679> in

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
wrist that's going to cause a problem in

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.010 
wrist that's going to cause a problem in
another<00:01:25.250> way<00:01:25.429> all<00:01:26.300> right<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:26.720> we're<00:01:26.840> going<00:01:26.959> to

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
another way all right so we're going to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.809 
another way all right so we're going to
look<00:01:27.200> at<00:01:27.349> the<00:01:27.500> influence<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:28.250> having<00:01:28.640> her

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
look at the influence of having her

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.199 
look at the influence of having her
thumbs<00:01:29.149> either<00:01:29.420> flat<00:01:30.200> piano<00:01:30.679> hands<00:01:31.209> rolled

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
thumbs either flat piano hands rolled

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.740 
thumbs either flat piano hands rolled
out<00:01:32.450> or<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.920> alignment<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:35.390> I'm<00:01:35.539> going<00:01:35.690> to

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
out or in alignment now I'm going to

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.999 
out or in alignment now I'm going to
pull<00:01:35.959> on<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.110> reins<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.590> we'll<00:01:36.709> see<00:01:36.890> what

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
pull on a reins and we'll see what

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.490 
pull on a reins and we'll see what
happens<00:01:37.190> so<00:01:37.940> let's<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.599> alignment<00:01:38.990> first

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
happens so let's do the alignment first

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.010 
happens so let's do the alignment first
that's<00:01:40.009> right<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.819> when<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.119> pull<00:01:41.450> that's<00:01:41.899> a

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
that's right and when I pull that's a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.440 
that's right and when I pull that's a
nice<00:01:42.200> solid<00:01:42.679> feeling<00:01:43.069> through<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.369> reins<00:01:43.580> and

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
nice solid feeling through the reins and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.749 
nice solid feeling through the reins and
now<00:01:44.599> piano<00:01:45.020> hands<00:01:45.410> and<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.190> can<00:01:46.220> see<00:01:46.520> that
